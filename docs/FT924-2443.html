			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Carmakers face game of chicken: Ford's price increases highlight the tough choice between profits and sales volume in the UK car market Since the pound crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism in September, carmakers have agonised over how much and how quickly they could raise prices in the UK to claw back their devaluation losses on imported cars and parts. In a sector laid low by recession the UK car market has been a desperate poker game among manufacturers facing mounting currency losses but fearful that any price rise would further depress sales and reduce market share. This week Ford blinked. The company announced price rises averaging 4.5 to 7.5 per cent on its mainstream models and as much as 10 per cent on the high-powered but low-volume Escort Cosworth. The first signs are emerging that the decline in the UK new car market during the past three years may finally be halting - registrations have been higher than a year ago in three of the past four months. But the competition to capitalise on any growth next year will be intense. Ford now faces an anxious wait to see whether other hard-pressed car producers follow its lead on prices or whether they choose instead to push for higher sales at the expense of the UK market leader. Yesterday, it received some encouragement from Rover's announcement that it would increase the prices of its cars by an average of 2.9 per cent. Like Ford, the UK carmaker is trying to reduce losses. Despite the barrage of criticism its move triggered from consumer groups and politicians, Ford's was not the first car price increase to follow devaluation. It is the biggest since Black Wednesday, but the US carmaker has not been alone in feeling the pressure to limit the damage wrought by devaluation on its bottom line. At the beginning of November, Mr Bill Ebbert, chairman and managing director of Vauxhall, was preparing to make a speech in Cheshire to celebrate the opening of General Motors' Pounds 190m engine plant at Ellesmere Port. The draft of the speech, readied by the morning, declared that Vauxhall was 'under severe cost pressure' in the wake of the devaluation, but it had 'no plans at the moment to increase the prices of our cars built in Germany'. By the evening this confident paragraph had been dropped. Over dinner, the Vauxhall chairman was already steeling himself to make the first move on prices. The next day Vauxhall announced it was raising the prices of all of its cars by an average of 3.25 per cent. Deliberations have been no easier at Volkswagen. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, head of the VW make and from next month group deputy chairman, thought he had an agreement at the Paris motor show in early October to increase VW's prices in the UK by 4.9 per cent. VW's UK importer, VAG United Kingdom, was not so sanguine. The VW group may be the undisputed market leader in western Europe, but in the UK it is only a medium-sized player overshadowed by Ford, Vauxhall, Rover and the Peugeot group of France which includes Citroen. VW decided it did not have the market muscle to make the first move and chose to sweat it out until the bigger players acted. Only two days after the Vauxhall announcement, VW jumped to increase its own prices by 2.9 per cent. Pricing decisions have seldom been more difficult in a UK market that has fallen by nearly a third during the recession - about 730,000 fewer new cars will be sold this year than in the peak year of 1989. But of all the car manufacturers, it is Ford that is on the rack in the UK. Its decision this week to raise the prices of its UK-built Fiesta and Escort/Orion ranges by 4.5 per cent and its Belgian and German-built Sierra and Granada ranges by 7.5 per cent is a clear admission that all the price-cutting and discounting initiatives of the past two years have simply failed to 'move the metal'. As recently as the British motorshow in Birmingham in October Ford still appeared to believe that the depressed UK car market could be revived by traditional price cutting methods. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman and managing director, declared that the company had decided 'to take determined action to stimulate the market' and announced price cuts of up to Pounds 520 on some Escort/Orion models and up to Pounds 955 on some of its Fiesta models. Its actions appear to have aroused more confusion than confidence among would-be car buyers, however. The motor show price cuts followed a 1.8 per cent price rise in August. Those cuts have now been followed by this week's rise. Carmakers' opaque pricing policies have prompted angry reactions from consumer groups and some opposition politicians. They claim that the industry's price rises are an attempt to reap the benefit of the recent abolition of special car tax. This measure, announced in the chancellor's Autumn Statement in mid-November, reduced the price of a Pounds 10,000 car by about Pounds 400. According to Mr Stephen Locke, the Consumers' Association's director of policy, Ford's latest move 'confirms all our worst fears about the manufacturers' desire to see the UK as a high-price, high-profit market'. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, claims that the chancellor 'is being walked over by the manufacturers'. Mr McAllister responds that it is absurd to claim that Britain is a 'high price, high profit' market given the decline in the profitability of UK manufacturers and the severity of the recession. In the past, the evidence certainly suggests that consumers have been justified in believing that they have been overcharged for cars in Britain. But if it once was the case, recession and devaluation now appear to have brought UK prices on to a par with continental Europe - at least for the moment. Ford prices in the UK (pre-tax) would be 'very much in line with those in Belgium and below those in the major markets like Germany and France', even after the latest price increase comes into effect in January, insists Mr McAllister. According to Ford, the price of a 1.6 litre Ford Escort LX (excluding tax, adjusted for equipment levels, and not taking into account dealer discounts) in the UK would be Ecu12,001 after the latest price increase, compared with Ecu12,913 in Germany, Ecu12,842 in France, Ecu12,630 in Belgium and Ecu11,015 in Italy. After moving temporarily into the black in the first half of the year following a record loss in 1991, Ford is again suffering mounting losses. In recent months three and four-day weeks have been introduced on its UK assembly lines, as production has had to be cut to reduce excess stocks. As a result, it needs to raise prices as far as the market can bear. Britain has traditionally been one of Ford's most reliable profit sources around the world, but no longer. As market leader it is under attack from all sides, but it no longer has the same financial muscle to fight off its rivals or cope with the fundamental shifts that are taking place in the balance of power in the UK car market. Both General Motors (Vauxhall in the UK and Opel in continental Europe) and PSA Peugeot Citroen of France have made big inroads in the UK, partly at Ford's expense. Helped by the increasing strength of its product range, Vauxhall has more than doubled its share of the UK market to 17 per cent from 8.6 per cent in 1981, allowing it to oust Rover from second place. The combined marques of Peugeot and Citroen are now claiming 12 per cent of the UK market compared with 6.4 per cent a decade ago. The Japanese have arrived in strength, with the addition of cars built in the UK, led by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. The Japanese share, currently at 12.1 per cent for the first 11 months this year, is expected by most automotive analysts to rise to at least 20 per cent by the end of the decade. At the bottom of the market new competitors have appeared, such as Proton from Malaysia, that are selling aggressively with low prices. Proton, which was only launched in Britain in 1989, has already won a 1 per cent share of the UK market. Shifts in consumer taste have also hit Ford. Sales of diesel-powered cars have begun to rise quickly - capturing 15.9 per cent of the UK market in November compared with 6.4 per cent in the whole of 1990. But the benefits have fallen in particular to the Peugeot group, not to Ford. The combination of these factors has steadily eroded Ford's share of UK new car sales. From a level of more than 30 per cent in 1981 and 1982 it has fallen to 22.5 per cent in the first 11 months this year. In November Ford accounted for only 19 per cent of UK new car sales compared with 25 per cent in the same month a year ago. According to Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, the latest Ford price rises do indicate a change of strategy. 'It may well mean that, having accepted that its once-traditional 30 per cent share is history, it has decided that even a 25 per cent share is not worth buying and that it is better to settle for 20 per cent with sales that are profitable.' Mr McAllister admits that 'market share is a difficult issue - pride gets in the way', but he insists that Ford has pulled back from the unprofitable business of selling to the daily rental fleets, where it has foregone sales of around 18,000 cars this year. 'Pushing money to buy market share does not get you anything. It disguises fundamental issues you are facing,' he says. Mr McAllister insists optimistically that new products to be launched next year will help Ford to rebuild its UK share. Hopes are riding most importantly on the Mondeo, which will replace the Sierra in the spring, and the Maverick four-wheel drive leisure vehicle to be launched in the autumn. But the Mondeo is set to meet head-on competition from the first products of Honda's and Toyota's new UK plants as well as the Rover 600 (sister car to Honda's new UK-built Accord) and the new Citroen Xantia, the replacement for the old BX. To add to the daunting challenges facing Ford, Volkswagen this week agreed to pay Pounds 124m to take direct control of its VW/Audi importer and distributor from Lonrho, the international trading group. Volkswagen is clearly not willing to live any longer with its relative weakness in the UK. 'I am not going to accept only 4 per cent of one of the largest markets in Europe,' says Mr Goeudevert. After three years of being locked in recession, the first signs may be emerging that UK new car sales have started a slow recovery. But the battle for a share of that growth can only intensify.</p>

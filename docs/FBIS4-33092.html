			<p>BFN     [Text] The government of provisional president attorney  Emile Jonassaint has officially banned the members of the  resigning government of Mr. Robert Malval from leaving the  country. In a communique issued on the night of 30 May, the  Ministry of the Interior asked the state employees and  government members not to leave the country before providing  explanations about their management of the public coffers. A  formal order has already been applied in that regard at the  border posts in order to block the travel of the people affected  by those measures. No reactions to the measures have been  recorded from the standpoint of the resigning government of  Robert Malval. The resigning prime minister was supposed to  leave the country at the beginning of this month in order to  participate at the OAS General Assembly on 6 June in Belem,  Brazil.    We have learned today from the cabinet of Mr. Malval that he  had decided not to go to Brazil after all, feeling that after 11  May 1994 his place is in Haiti along with the Haitian people and  standing before the usurpers of the legal power -- unquote [no  opening quote as heard].</p>

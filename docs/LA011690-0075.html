			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THESE 49ERS WIN IN A ROUT, TOO;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL STATE LONG BEACH USES PINPOINT SHOOTING TO SURPRISE NEW  MEXICO STATE.  </P> <P> The prospects of breaking a shooting slump did not appear good for Cal State  Long Beach, which had to face a hot New Mexico State team and its tough matchup  zone defense Monday night.  </P> <P> But the 49ers shot 50.9% from the field and got a triple-double from guard  Tyrone Mitchell in winning the Big West Conference game, 72-56, before a crowd  of 1,998 in the university gym.  </P> <P> They shot that well by following their game plan: Move the ball around, get it  inside and make the easy baskets.  </P> <P> Lately, Long Beach had not even been making the easy ones. Last week the 49ers  shot 31% in barely defeating UC Irvine and improved to only 39% in a loss at UC  Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> But that changed dramatically against the first-place Aggies, who had won 12  consecutive games. Not only did the 49ers, 11-3 overall and 4-2 in the  conference, shoot better, but for the first time in four games they weren't  outrebounded.  </P> <P> Mitchell had 11 rebounds, 11 points and 11 assists.  </P> <P> "A triple-double for a college player, I can't believe it," Long Beach Coach  Joe Harrington said.  </P> <P> It was the first triple-double accomplished against New Mexico State.  </P> <P> "We have athletes and we have scorers," said Mitchell, who also had four  steals. "I'm just trying to plug in the holes."  </P> <P> Forward Kevin Cutler led the 49ers with 17 points. He made seven of 11 shots to  break a five-of-21 slump.  </P> <P> Long Beach, 7-0 at home, also got a big lift from Frankie Edwards, who got a  rare start at center and responded with 11 rebounds, 10 points and two blocked  shots.  </P> <P> "We didn't play well," New Mexico State Coach Neil McCarthy said. "They  outplayed us and played harder than we did."  </P> <P> The 49ers took charge of the game early when, trailing, 4-2, they scored 10  points in a row. The Aggies got to within 25-21, but in the last two minutes of  the half the 49ers went on a 7-0 run that was started by Lucious Harris'  three-point basket  </P> <P> New Mexico State (14-2, 5-1) didn't offer a serious challenge in the second  half.  </P> <P> "We have been poor at attacking zones," Harrington said. "Yesterday and today  we worked on that."  </P> <P> Long Beach was also good defensively, holding the Aggies to 35% shooting and  forcing 22 turnovers.  </P></p>

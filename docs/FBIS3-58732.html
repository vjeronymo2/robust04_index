			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- Helmut Szimkus, the German who has  been sentenced to death in Iran, can hope for a pardon. The  influential Iranian politician Mohamad Javad [Larijani] today  referred to the right of the religious leader 'Ali Khamene'i to  grant a pardon. [passage omitted]    Speaking to journalists this evening, Larijani said a pardon  is part of Iranian law. The procedure prescribes a detailed  examination of the case. Should Khamene'i use his right to  grant a pardon in the Szimkus case, this would happen in three  to four months at the earliest.    The Iranian politician stressed that he did not bring up the  so-called "Mykonos trial" in Berlin. [passage omitted]    Larijani expressed his hope that, despite the difficulties,  German-Iranian relations will continue to develop in a positive  way and that a solution can be found for Iran's current problems  in meeting its financial obligations. The German refusal to  resume the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power station on  the Persian Gulf, which was suspended 14 years ago, is a "very  negative point," he said.    The politician also warned against further "politicizing"  the  death sentence (`Fatwa') Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni, the  deceased leader of the revolution, issued against the writer  Salman Rushdie. Rushdie has offended millions of Muslims with  his book The Satanic Verses. "The more the case of  Rushdie is politicized, the more it will stir the emotions of  the Muslims," he said.    The politician also criticized the Israeli-Palestinian peace  process, saying it is neither fair nor feasible. He said a  large majority of Palestinians reject the Gaza-Jericho agreement.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Grants urged for forest scheme PROPOSALS TO develop a 200 sq mile National Forest in central England were greeted with scepticism yesterday by landowners, farmers and industrialists, who said substantial government finance would be needed for such a scheme. The government, which yesterday launched a three-month consultation process on the forest in conjunction with the Countryside Commission, said it could not guarantee any public funds would be available. It will examine the viability of planting 30m trees to create a wooded landscape across parts of Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said: 'The government will not decide what, if any, its contribution will be until completion of the consultation period.' His comments were criticised by the Country Landowners Association and National Farmers Union. Both said that farmers could not comply with the draft strategy for the National Forest, also published yesterday, if it meant they were expected to convert arable land to forestry without any promise of grant aid. Expectations that industry will pay for the forestation of disused workings were also criticised. Mr Stephen Hardy, group property manager of Ibstock Johnson, a brick manufacturer in the area, told Mr Yeo: 'There has to be a firm financial commitment from the government.' The Countryside Commission said it was confident that the proposals would go ahead.</p>

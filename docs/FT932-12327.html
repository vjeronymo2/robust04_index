			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Israel to allow backlong-term deportees Israel agreed yesterday to permit the return of 30 Palestinians expelled before 1987 in a gesture aimed at improving the political atmosphere at the Middle East peace talks which resumed in Washington this week, writes Roger Matthews in Washington. The 30, many of whom are members of Fatah, the mainstream Palestinian organisation headed by Mr Yassir Arafat, are expected to return to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip within the next few days. At least three of them are former members of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said she hoped this was just the first instalment in allowing back many more people and unravelling the whole policy of deportation. Arab diplomats in Washington said the Israeli move would help bolster the standing of the Palestinian negotiators in the occupied territories. The Palestinian negotiating team returned to Washington this week on the instructions of Mr Arafat following a bitter internal dispute. Resumption of talks was delayed by nearly five months after Israel expelled 415 Palestinians, members of the radical Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups, who are opposed to talks. The impact of the Israeli gesture was offset yesterday by the worst day of violence this month in the occupied territories. Israeli troops shot dead three Palestinians, including a 12 year-old boy, and another 50 were reported wounded. A government reorganisation programme for Israel's banking system was yesterday sharply criticised by the banks and their staff, writes Judy Maltz in Jerusalem. The programme, formulated jointly by the finance ministry and central bank, calls for limiting bank holdings in non-banking enterprises and forcing the large banks to sell off their banking subsidiaries. Bank Leumi said the plan would cause serious damage to the Israeli banking system. 'We hope the cabinet will weigh this damage against the benefits before taking its decision,' it said. The heads of the works committees of Israel's largest banks yesterday joined their management in protesting over the programme and threatened to declare a labour dispute if it was implemented. Bank managers said that while the trend in the rest of the world is toward mergers and acquisitions, the government will force them to sell off assets, making them less competitive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gadzhi Shamov] </F>   [Text] Makhachkala May 10 TASS -- The Kizlyar board of the  Terek Cossack community, affiliated to the Russian Union of  Cossacks, has objected to the draft of the new constitution of  the Republic of Dagestan (southern Russia), which was put to  nation-wide discussion by the republic's Supreme Soviet. A  regular meeting of the board has ruled its adoption  impermissible. This is due to the fact that the draft does not  reckon with the interests of smaller nationalities and envisages  the possibility of Dagestan's future secession from Russia,  which contradicts the Constitution of the Russian Federation and  is fraught with tragic consequences.    If the new constitution of the Republic of Dagestan is  adopted in its present form, the Cossack board will rule it  invalid on the left-hand bank of the Terek river and will demand  the annulment of the decree of the RSFSR [Russian Soviet  Federated Socialist Reoublic] Supreme Soviet of January 9, 1957,  placing the Kizlyar, Tarum, and Nogaysk districts under  Dagestan's jurisdiction.    The Cossacks have informed the president, the parliament,  and  the government of Russia about their decision, as well as the  leadership of the Dagestan republic and the local organs of  power.</p>

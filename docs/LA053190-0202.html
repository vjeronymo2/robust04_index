			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> AIRPORT PANEL ASKED TO OVERRIDE REPORT  </P> <P> The City Council passed a resolution this week asking the Orange County Airport  Land Use Commission to reject a study that establishes "accident zones" in  cities near the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center airfield.  </P> <P> The council also asked the commission to delay action on the item until the  federal Department of Defense has an opportunity to make revisions to the plan.  City Manager Darrell Essex said it was unclear whether the federal government  had adopted a final version of the plan, as had been previously reported.  </P> <P> If the commission decides to adopt the plan, "accident zones" would be created  in several cities surrounding the airfield. The plan concludes that development  should be severly restricted in these areas because of the potential for  crashes.  </P> <P> City officials are angry that the study comes after development has gone  unchecked around the airfield. Several hundred homes, businesses and a school  have been built in the accident zones.  </P> <P> Further, officials argue that the study is flawed because it doesn't take into  account the types of aircraft that use the base. According to Army estimates,  helicopters account for more than 90% of airfield traffic.  </P> <P> A consultant hired by the city to study the report said at least 5,000 large  aircraft flights must be made each year before an airfield qualifies for the  type of "accident zones" called for in the study. The Los Alamitos installation  has fewer than 500 large aircraft flights each year, officials say.  </P> <P> If the Airport Land Use Commission decides to adopt the report, the City  Council will still be able to override recommendations of the study vote with a  four-fifths majority vote. However, if the city decides to allow development in  the zones and an accident occurs, the city assumes the liability.  </P> <P> The adopted resolution will be sent to other cities that are affected by the  study to solicit their support, Essex said.  </P> <P> The Airport Land Use Commission is expected to review the plan July 19.

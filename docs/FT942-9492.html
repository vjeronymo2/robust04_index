			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Hint of flexibility in Syria peace talks: Christopher starts shuttle in Damascus Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, arrived last night in Damascus on a mini-shuttle that US officials hope can produce discernible progress in talks between Israel and Syria, amid a rare official hint of possible flexibility from Syria. Mr Christopher went straight into talks with Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president, and Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, his foreign minister, and is expected to travel on within the next 24 hours to Jerusalem. US officials said they then expect Mr Christopher to return for further talks in Damascus. The intensity of the shuttle, coming just two weeks after Mr Christopher's last visit to Damascus, indicates US determination to achieve progress on the Israeli-Syrian front following the Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organisation agreement earlier this month to implement the first stages of limited Palestinian self-rule. Mr Christopher's prompt return also suggests Syria believes there is something to be discussed, despite the fact that Israeli and Syrian negotiators have not met face-to-face since the last round of Washington-hosted peace talks in September last year. Negotiations have since proceeded primarily through US mediation, both in Mr Christopher's two previous shuttles and in the Geneva summit earlier this year between President Bill Clinton and Mr Assad. Mr Christopher will certainly seek Syrian commitment to accept the longstanding US invitation to resume bilateral talks with Israel in Washington. But there are signs his mediation is itself making progress. After his last trip on the eve of the May 4 US-PLO deal, Mr Christopher spoke of the Israeli-Syrian track having entered a new 'substantive' phase. Mr Christopher will also visit Jericho, the West Bank town newly handed over by Israel to limited Palestinian authority, during the shuttle, US officials said yesterday. The visit will be the first by any international statesman to the new areas of limited Palestinian self-rule. After his last shuttle, Syria rejected an Israeli proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights staged over a number of years. Syrian officials instead repeated Mr Assad's firm demand that a peace deal could come only after an Israeli commitment to full and immediate withdrawal from the heights, which it has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, Tishreen, the state newspaper, yesterday signalled a possible softening on the question, saying that Syria was ready to reach a deal with Israel if it concluded 'a clear commitment for withdrawal from the whole of the Golan within a reasonable and acceptable period of time'. Diplomats in Damascus said that while the question of a phased Israeli withdrawal has long been privately aired, it has seldom been officially referred to so directly or positively. 'It is certainly a sign of more flexibility,' said one. Most observers believe Syria would insist on a phased withdrawal over months, rather than the several years suggested by Israel. However, few observers in Damascus expect Mr Christopher's visit to achieve a public breakthrough. For this, Israel is still requiring Mr Assad to spell out in detail what he means by a 'full peace' with Syria, while Mr Assad in turn wants Israel to make an unequivocal statement of willingness to return the Golan to Syrian sovereignty and withdraw from it entirely. Moreover, Syria is also determined to wrest bilateral concessions from the US in return for delivering a deal with Israel - a matter which will certainly feature in Mr Christopher's talks.</p>

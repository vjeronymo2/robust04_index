			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Observer: Returns Still on the subject of contra cyclical stock-market indicators, Observer has noticed another worrying sign. City stockbrokers who retired to run small breweries in the country are starting to re-emerge in the City Graham Axford, one-time corporate finance chief at James Capel, last month gave up the chairmanship of the tiny Wiltshire brewery - makers of Old Grumble - to return as head of corporate finance at Credit Lyonnais Laing. Now Observer hears that John Dunsmore, once the City's number one brewing analyst, is giving up his directorship of Midland's brewer Marstons, so that he can rejoin NatWest Securities as head of equities. Hard to believe that overcapacity in brewing is worse than in stockbroking. But whatever the reason, Dunsmore's return is another sign of the rehabilitation of NatWest's once troubled broking business.</p>

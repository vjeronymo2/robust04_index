			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / RPI housing factor review THE GOVERNMENT has ordered a review of the way housing costs are treated in the retail prices index, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced yesterday. In a parliamentary written answer, he disclosed that the government was referring the treatment of owner occupiers' housing costs to the retail prices index advisory committee, the body that advises the chancellor on the method of construction and compilation of the RPI, the UK's main index of inflation. The move follows widespread criticism inside and outside parliament of the method of measuring the cost of housing, which is based on mortgage interest payments. A particular complaint has been the way the method makes the RPI rise in response to higher interest rates when those are introduced to control inflation. That has knock-on consequences for wage negotiations and other costs. The inclusion of mortgage interest payments in the RPI has also been criticised because they involve a large element of investment and because they can be seen as measuring the cost of credit, while no other type of credit charge is included in the index. Only Britain and the Republic of Ireland among European Community member states include mortgage interest payments in their main inflation measures. Six EC countries make no allowance for owner occupier costs. The chancellor's advisory committee is already investigating how the council tax, holiday spending and new cars should be treated in the RPI.</p>

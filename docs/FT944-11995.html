			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Realigned Lonrho board meets - First get-together since the shift in the balance of power Lonrho, the international trading group whose joint chief executives, Mr Tiny Rowland and Mr Dieter Bock, have been at war with each other, will today hold its first board meeting since the retirement of two of Mr Rowland's closest allies. The retirements have shifted the balance on the board in favour of Mr Bock in his struggle against Mr Rowland. An associate of Mr Rowland said yesterday that today's meeting would be significant in showing how Mr Bock intended to exploit this power. Mr Bock launched an abortive coup two months ago to oust Mr Rowland from his executive duties. However, hours before September's board meeting Mr Bock backed off from proposing that Mr Rowland should step down when he became concerned that he could not count on the support of a majority. A number of Lonrho's directors belatedly took fright from challenging Mr Rowland because they were concerned that he would challenge any attempt to oust him through the courts. Today's meeting is the first to be chaired by the new temporary chairman, the former diplomat Sir John Leahy. He replaces Mr Rene Leclezio, one of Mr Rowland's staunchest allies, who retired last month. Another of Mr Rowland's most loyal supporters, Mr Robert Dunlop, also retired recently. It is widely believed within Lonrho that Mr Rowland would sever his 30-year relationship with the company if Mr Bock, owner of 18.8 per cent of Lonrho's shares, offered him a Pounds 50m premium over the market price for his 48.6m shares. However Mr Bock is thought not to be prepared to pay that price. Today's meeting is also the first since the disclosure last week in the Financial Times that Mr Rowland had embroiled the company in a new court case brought by its erstwhile corporate opponent, Mr Mohamed Fayed, by providing an indemnity to a former employee of Mr Fayed, Mr Graham Jones, who allegedly defected to Lonrho. Mr Fayed is suing Mr Jones for breach of confidence and is therefore also in effect suing Lonrho. It is particularly embarrassing for Lonrho that it should find itself on the opposite side of a case brought by Mr Fayed, because it is only a year since they settled their bitter and costly legal battle over the manner in which Mr Fayed purchased House of Fraser in 1985. According to an associate of Mr Rowland, the indemnity is likely to be discussed by the board meeting. Mr Rowland will insist that he has not damaged Lonrho because he will say that Mr Fayed is once again his friend and would not pursue the action if it was seen to be hurting him.</p>

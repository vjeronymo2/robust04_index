			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (5): Issuance slows to a trickle - The uncertain political outlook will affect emerging markets After surging to record levels last year, the issuance of international bonds by emerging market borrowers has become a trickle in recent months. This follows the sell-off in global bond markets, triggered by the US Federal Reserve's decision in early February to tighten US interest rates. Since then, most bond markets have shed a large portion of last year's gains, with the emerging markets falling most steeply. As long as US interest rate uncertainty persists, emerging bond markets will be caught in the thrall of the US Treasury market, where yields have risen sharply in recent months in volatile trading. Moreover, the uncertain political outlook ahead of Mexico's and Brazil's elections later this year will also make investors reluctant to increase their emerging-market holdings. However, once US rates are perceived to have peaked and the political picture clears, investors are expected to venture back along the yield curve into longer-dated, fixed-rate assets. Until then, they are likely to stick to less volatile short-term or floating-rate instruments which offer a sizeable yield pick-up over most OECD markets at relatively low risk. Moreover, some sectors of the secondary eurobond market are now so cheap that they have begun to attract cautious buying, traders say. 'No one regards this market as fundamentally overvalued,' says Mr Paul Luke, economist at Morgan Grenfell, adding that the market offers significant capital-gains potential. Latin American borrowers - sovereign and corporate - had a spectacular run in the international bond markets in the past two years. After issuing 99 deals totalling some Dollars 9.7bn in 1992, they raised a total of Dollars 24bn in 206 new issues last year, data compiled by IFR Securities Data show. Total emerging market issuance, including Asia and eastern Europe, nearly tripled from Dollars 17.4bn in 1992 to 50.1bn in 1993. In the first four months of this year, issuance fell to 44 deals worth Dollars 6.6bn in Latin America and to Dollars 16.6bn overall, according to IFR. During the boom, the yield premiums issuers paid over underlying government bonds were rapidly eroded by strong investor demand. This allowed borrowers to raise money at increasingly advantageous levels - and well below the interest rates they would have had to pay in their domestic markets, where inflation pressures were keeping rates high. However, the market correction has sent emerging market eurobonds' yield spreads ballooning back out. For example, Mexico's Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext) in January issued Dollars 1bn of 7 1/4 per cent 10-year global bonds yielding 163 basis points above the US Treasury note; the spread widened to about 385 basis points, but narrowed to around 280 by mid-May. During the bull run, many private sector borrowers joined sovereign and public-sector names; some issuers, including the Republic of Argentina and Mexico's Cemex, launched large global bond deals providing investors with more liquid paper; and borrowers lengthened the maturities and broadened the currency range of their bonds to appeal to a wider investor base. Many of these trends have been reversed in recent months: the bulk of issuance has been in US dollars; private sector borrowers have largely ceded the stage to the handful of public-sector entities still brave enough to tap the market; some of the liquid, global issues have taken a particularly heavy pounding; and maturities have shortened significantly, with most business now taking place at the very short end of the yield curve. 'A lot of the action has been in the money market,' says Miles Protter, in charge of emerging markets origination at Swiss Bank Corporation in London. Institutional investors seeking a lucrative home for their cash have been piling into corporate commercial paper and certificates of deposit which Mexican, Brazilian and Argentine banks have been issuing heavily in recent months, he says. They offer returns well above investors' own domestic money markets while minimising the volatility of longer-dated paper. Some of the Mexican government agencies, such as Bancomext and Nafinsa, have been particularly active issuers of Euro commercial paper and medium-term notes ranging between six months and three years, traders say. One dealer estimates they have issued well over Dollars 1bn of such paper since the beginning of the year, including public floating-rate note issues and privately placed deals. It is no surprise that in an environment of rising interest rates, a growing proportion of new issues consists of floating rate notes. Of this year's Latin eurobond issues, 23.4 per cent have been FRNs, far greater than the 6.6 per cent of issues represented by floaters in 1993 and 3.5 per cent in 1992, notes Peter West, economic adviser at West Merchant Bank. 'The trend towards FRNs is likely to intensify, in the light of their attractiveness to investors in a rising interest-rate environment,' he predicts, while adding that issuers reluctant to face the risk of a floating rate structure may instead prefer to pay the premium to swap then into a fixed rate. Meanwhile, some say investors' cautious return to the secondary market may herald a pick-up in new issuance. 'Some bottom fishers are coming back to the market and are buying away the cheap, good-quality assets. This is a positive sign, as it creates an environment where new issues could be welcomed,' says Vincent Keith, head of emerging market syndicate at Bankers Trust in London. His is one of several underwriting houses poised to lead an issue from an emerging market borrower; traders say Bankers Trust has the mandate to issue Dollars 250m of 10-year fixed bonds yielding around 350 bps over for the Philippine Long-Distance Telephone Company. Also in the pipeline are two shorter deals for two Indian borrowers: the Industrial Development Bank of India, with Citibank tipped as lead manager, and the Indian Oil Corporation, said to come via Chase Investment Bank. Elsewhere, the Province of Buenos Aires is planning a bond issue of its Dollars 450m Euro medium-term note programme via Salomon Brothers. The deal was originally supposed to come in the wake of Argentina's global bond offering last December but was then postponed due to a deterioration of market conditions. Eastern European borrowers are also limbering up for new issuance. Poland plans to raise more than Dollars 1bn on the international capital markets once its London Club negotiations for a reduction of up to 45 per cent in its Dollars 13bn commercial bank debt have been concluded. More supply is also expected from borrowers in the the Czech Republic and Slovakia. As long as US interest rate uncertainty continues, most issuers will have to pay larger yield premiums than they did last year, to compensate investors for increased volatility. 'Most issuers understand they have to pay up - they realise the market environment has changed,' says Mr Keith at Bankers Trust. 'Initially, we will have to have generous spreads,' agrees Graham Marshall, head of corporate finance at ING Bank in London. 'But once US rates aren't seen rising any further, spreads could contract,' he predicts. Once interest rate and election jitters are out of the way, he expects issuance to pick up. 'I think we could have a good fourth quarter.'</p>

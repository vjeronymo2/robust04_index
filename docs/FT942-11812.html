			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Arts: Unsullied by wit, taste or quality - Television / Michael Thompson-Noel erases purveyors of small screen tosh Soon, we are told, our homes will be bombarded by hundreds of television channels, including, possibly, some from other planets. I look forward to tuning into Planet Janet. But long before then, to help us chart a course through the videogrunge of hundreds of earthly channels, we will enter the era of MTN-TV. We will buy a black box that will channel-surf for us, selecting, recording, and, I hope, editing a nightly menu of programmes, or bits of programmes, that will cater to our specific tastes and needs. I wish I had MTN-TV now. By the longest of chalks, British television is the best in the world - so good, indeed, that I cannot keep up with it. If I had MTN-TV now, it would do the job for me by analysing my viewing habits and noting my instructions. Despite the quality of British television, much would be zapped, censored and expunged. Here are 10 things that would be obliterated from MTN-TV: 1. Naffness, rubbish and condescension. This would erase, at a stroke, the whole of ITV, which is now realising its destiny as a petfood-and-tampon channel unsullied by wit, taste or quality. It is a channel for proles, to imprison them in naffdom. What a load of tosh it is, personified, for me, by such nightmarish visions as Matthew Kelly, Michael Barrymore, Bruce Forsyth and Cilla Black - especially Black, whose squalidness and commonness, calculated so precisely, is as malign as anti-matter. She should be shot into space, to expire in near-vacuum. Funnily enough, I like commercials. Federico Fellini once praised British commercials as mini-wonders, so once a week MTN-TV will screen a 30-minute carousel of the latest ads. 2. Violence. There will be plenty of (consensual) sex on MTN-TV, but no violence whatsoever. I hate it desperately, especially in news shows, where producers' fondness for hospital footage of war-wounded children and other carnage is a form of pornography. 3. Channel 4 News. It is apparently well-regarded, yet it makes dreariness an art form; preciousness, too. It is not so much a news show as a 'phone-in-cum-seminar with snippets of news. I watched it last Friday. Presenter Jon Snow was still in South Africa, though there was no news to speak of. His first item, on the South African election, lasted 15 minutes and contained no news whatsoever. To learn what is going on, MTN-TV will rely on the BBC. 4. Medical programmes. I am decaying away nicely. The last thing I would want to watch is half an hour on the prostate. As genetics research makes more and more progress, it will be possible for us to learn about the likely nature of our deaths. Not me. In the brave new world of MTN-TV, ignorance will foster happiness. 5. Party political broadcasts. These will not be censored out completely. There was one recently for the Green Party that was rather good - intelligent, modest in its claims and free of the gallimaufry of lies that constitutes the party-political offerings of the three big grey parties. 6. Steve Rider, presenter of Grandstand (BBC1). I watch quite a lot of sport, but the presenters have been lobotomised. These days, given the cost of buying the rights, sports presenters have jettisoned almost all objectivity. Ratings are everything. Everyone is gung-ho, especially Steve Rider. His eyes are horribly close together. That apart, I was staggered at the stupor of sulkiness into which he slumped at the Winter Olympics when it became apparent that Britain's Torvill and Dean  - that pair of frozen pilchards - were not going to win the ice-dancing gold medal. T&amp;A were lucky to win the bronze. What Rider was doing there I could not imagine. 7. Soaps and situation comedies. I used to like Coronation Street (ITV), but can no longer find the time for it. On the other hand, MTN-TV will screen plenty of drama, films and current affairs. There is not much drama about at present, unless you count The Lifeboat (BBC1), in which Lynda La Plante, of Prime Suspect fame, is said to have had a hand. It is set, says the Beeb, 'off the rugged Welsh coast.' At first I wondered if they had shot it in Welsh, as another filmic sop to all those Welsh whingers with nothing better to do than blow up holiday cottages. They hadn't, though even in English I found its hairy-chestedness silly. If there is not much drama about at present, there is a surfeit of first-rate documentaries. QED: Plastic Fantastic (BBC1) was a marvellous account of the alleged discovery, by Maurice Ward, an eccentric ex-hairdresser, of a miracle plastic, a so-called 'smart' material called Starlight which can withstand amazing heat levels and may save mankind from invasion by Planet Janet. Starlight HQ is a bungalow in Hartlepool. Some scientists, including Nasa's, seem impressed with Ward's claims. By some calculations, the invention is worth billions. But Ward is proving reluctant to share or sell his formula. Another excellent current affairs programme was The Disorderly House of Windsor (Channel 4), which put the boot in so effectively that I wondered if Queen Elizabeth II and her hapless family were not about to book one-way tickets through the Channel Tunnel to start life afresh in a small town in Germany. 8. David Bellamy. There will be a lot of wildlife programmes on MTN-TV. In time, our children's grandchildren will view the late 20th-century wildlife video library in horrified amazement that we presided over the extinction of so many species. But I can no longer watch David Bellamy's self-indulgent antics. His heart is in the right place but his mannerisms - especially the leaping about on all fours - made Kingdoms in Conflict: The Owl and the Timberman (Channel 4), about the endangered northern spotted owl in Washington state, unwatchable. 9. Weather forecasts. 10. Angela Rippon. She is the antithesis of Cilla Black in every respect, and thus just as harmful. Media experts and bankers to whom I spoke yesterday were delirious with excitement at the range of viewing likes and dislikes likely to be encountered on MTN-TV, and urged me to make it commercially available. I said that I might.</p>

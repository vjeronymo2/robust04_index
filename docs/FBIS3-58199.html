			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "Dr. Clinton and the Russians"] </F>   [Text] That Bill Clinton will be visiting four European  capitals but that he will leave out the FRG has produced some  grumbling among officials in Bonn. However, the trip does  symbolize a certain progress. After all, in its first year in  office, one had the impression that the Clinton administration  had put the word "Europe" on the index. Whenever foreign policy  would play more than merely a secondary role, the catchwords  were "Somalia," "North Korea," "NAFTA" [North America Free Trade  Agreement], and "GATT."    Secretary of State Christopher has articulated with  impatience and unwillingness that "West Europe is no longer the  dominating region of the world." Moreover, one was hearing "a  lot of criticism" from Europe but not "from Asia."  Unforgettable remains Christopher's blunder in connection with  Bosnia, which sounded as if he had copied it from Neville  Chamberlain, the British prime minister of the 1930's. For the  architect of the Munich agreement, Czechoslovakia was "a faraway  country of which we know nothing." For Christopher, Bosnia was a  "humanitarian crisis, far away from home, on another continent."  <H5>  "Russia First" </H5>   Official rhetoric has meanwhile changed, and so has  politics.  Clinton will visit Europe three times this year, and Christopher  has given assurance that "Europe is in the center of our  interest." This is the good part of the news. The less  flattering part remains unsaid: Not "Europe first" but "Russia  first" is the hidden motto, even when at the opening of the  Brussels NATO summit, Vice President Gore once more emphasized  the classic orthodoxy: "When there is fighting in Europe, we  are also suffering; when Europe is safe and free, we also  prosper."    However, America's eye remains primarily directed toward  Russia, and the policy in this connection is called "Partnership  for Peace," which NATO should give its place this week. The  intricate draft Made in USA [preceding three words in English]  reads just like the Bible; everyone can pick out what fits best  into their concepts. Yet, at the end of the day, two things  remain indisputable: The Russians must not be upset and, hence,  the East Europeans not be accepted into NATO.    What remains are consolation prizes for the former  compulsory  members of the Soviet empire, who now have to hold out in that  drafty waiting room that used to be called "In-Between-Europe":  between NATO Germany in the West and Russia in the East. True,  the alliance intends to offer "interested countries" -- such as  Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and others -- treaties on  military cooperation, ranging from joint training to exercises  for peaceful missions. This produces a pleasant modernization  push for the backward Eastern armies. However, what should the  "In-Between-Europeans" do with the passage in bold print, that  says: no security guarantees, no date for membership in the  alliance? At best, they may "consult" NATO in case they feel  threatened. Who will blame Polish Foreign Minister Olechowski  for deriding such "partnership" as a signal to "get lost."    Behind that, if one wants, one can see a psychiatric view of  Western foreign and security policy. The "patient" is Moscow  and the therapy is called "appeasement and mollification."  Those who want to shift NATO toward the East had better think  of the terrible irrational reactions in Russia: paranoia and  chauvinism, finally the victory of the neofascist and  neoimperialist forces under the banner of someone like  Zhirinovskiy.    Even if such therapeutical definition of politics -- an old  Western reflex --is not a compliment for the Russians, Boris  Yeltsin has now gratefully accepted the signals. While Clinton  was packing up, Yeltsin once more dramatized what has long since  been part of the standard repertoire of Russian rhetoric: a  NATO extension would trigger "a negative reaction from Russian  society" and a "military-political destabilization" in  In-Between Europe.    One thing is true about this theory, which is also supported  by Chancellor Kohl: Provocation is no foreign policy --  particularly if it might benefit Yeltsin's enemies at home.  Yet, maybe even this building of premises is becoming shaky.  First, if we are worried about the Russian reformers, we should  display the same solicitude toward the East Europeans as well.  The former Polish defense chief said, "Our main reason to get  into NATO is to secure democracy. We must force back the same  nationalists who are also bothering Yeltsin."    Second, the therapeutical approach forces the doctor into  the  straight jacket. Those who commit themselves to the motto "To  do anything but provoke them" give the patient a permanent veto  right against their own policy. Moreover, the partners are thus  stripped of the incentive of examining reality. Those who  understand and excuse everything will easily be maneuvered into  the situation where they blackmail themselves -- which might  culminate in the point where vital interests are suddenly at  stake.    American -- and also German -- diplomacy toward Russia is,  thus, running the risk of issuing a blank check and making  itself a hostage of Yeltsin. A wiser policy would, of course,  pursue a strategy on three different tracks. On the one track,  the train would roll toward help and consideration, although one  must never forget that democracy and the market economy are not  export hits and that Russia's fate lies in Russia's hands. (It  only worked in Germany and Japan after 1945 -- albeit under the  loaded cannons of the occupiers.)    The second track is called conditionality: Money only for  reforms, consideration only for legitimate interests.  Neoimperialism under the old-new Czarist flag, particularly if  such imperialism puts its paw on the Baltics and East Europe,  must no longer count on understanding. In this case, the  Russian-friendly "Partnership for Peace" would have to transform  itself into a protective alliance with East Europe, including  the extension of NATO. Moreover, such a strategy does not  necessarily have to weaken Yeltsin -- after all, he could then  refer to the loss of Western confidence and be able to  exquisitely sober those who pester him at home.  <H5>  Comfort for "In-Between-Europe" </H5>   On the third track, the West can make a security-political  virtue of diplomatic necessity -- that is, not to enlarge NATO.  After all, the more an alliance is watered down, the more badly  it will produce security. Although NATO has lost its classic  function -- defense against a Soviet attack -- it remains an  indispensable insurance firm. One has to keep the machinery  well oiled; despite disarmament, the alliance needs the  capability to quickly restore its potential. Ironically, it is  particularly this concentrating on the essential thing that  offers "In-Between-Europe" the best comfort. Even someone like  Zhirinovskiy will think twice before he plays with fire when he  knows that the there are well-trained firemen on the other side.    We must help the Russians, even in our own interest. Only,  confidence is good, but insurance is better.</p>

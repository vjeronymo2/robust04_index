			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fondiaria's profits rise to L68.7bn FONDIARIA, the holding company of one of Italy's biggest insurance groups, had net profits of L68.7bn (Dollars 55.2m) in 1991, the first full year in the group's current form. Over the past year, Fondiaria has confirmed its position as one of Italy's most dynamic insurance companies, with the acquisition of the Latina group of companies controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti and the purchase last month of a 20 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's second largest insurer. Consolidated group profit figures will not be available until next month. But Fondiaria's group premiums rose 13 per cent to L5,021bn last year, making it Italy's third biggest private sector insurance group.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- A report about the alleged  arrival of a Russian group of specialists from the "Sukhoi"  aircraft design bureau in the Yemeni capital Sanaa at the  beginning of June, which appeared in the Saudi Arabian newspaper  "AL-SHARQ AL-ASWAT", does not conform to reality, Grigoriy  Karasin, director of the Information and Press Department in the  Russian Foreign Ministry, said here at a briefing today.    Really three officials of the aforesaid design bureau had  arrived in Sanaa on May 3, that is before armed actions began in  Yemen, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman noted. Their  visit was aimed at holding talks about the repair of Russian  made aircraft the Yemeni Army is equipped with. However, not  getting any opportunity to complete that programme due to  well-known events, they left for home on May 9, Karasin noted.    Regarding the tense situation prevailing in Yemen as a  result  of continued armed confrontation, Karasin emphasised, that  Russia favours an earliest possible end to the fratricide,  Karasin emphasised. He drew attention towards the necessity of  unconditionally implementing the U.N. Security Assembly [as  received] Resolution No. 924, which calls on all sides to  immediately cease fire and return to the negotiating table to  resolve differences for the sake of restoring peace and  stability. According to Karasin, any mediation efforts  undertaken for the search of a way out of the fratricidal  conflict in Yemen are supported in Moscow.</p>

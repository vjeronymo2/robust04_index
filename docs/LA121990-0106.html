			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: MURDOCH QUITS AS DIRECTOR ON REUTERS BOARD  </P> <P> Reuters Holdings PLC announced that Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate who is  chief executive of News Corp., has resigned his seat on the board of the  British news and information agency.  </P> <P> In a letter to the London Stock Exchange, Reuters said Murdoch, an Australian  native who became a U.S. citizen several years ago, cited "the pressure of  other business commitments" as the reason behind his decision to resign.  </P> <P> Murdoch, whose business interests range from magazines and newspapers on  several continents to 20th Century Fox Film Corp. and the Fox television  network, became a director of Reuters Ltd. in 1979 and a director of Reuters  Holdings PLC in 1984.  </P> <P> News Corp. has been widely reported to be in deepening financial debt,  primarily brought on by a number of acquisitions that Murdoch has engineered.  In 1988, News Corp.'s U.S. subsidiary acquired TV Guide, the Daily Racing Form  and Seventeen magazine from Walter Annenberg's Triangle Publications in a deal  valued at $3 billion.  </P></p>

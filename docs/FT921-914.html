			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Letter: Kenya will proceed to elections Sir, According to Michael Holman ('An angry church confronts a troubled state in Kenya', March 24) 'most western diplomats' believe that President Moi should 'bite the bullet' and call an election. He writes that last year's expectations of an early election have proved wishful thinking. Mr Holman cannot have it both ways. As he knows, the opposition parties complained loudly when they thought that President Moi would call an election in the first half of this year. They would not, they claimed, be prepared for an election campaign in such a short time. In fact, there are important constitutional and administrative procedures to be undertaken before an election is held. Nearly 2m new voters, out of a total of 11m voters, have to be listed on a new, computerised voters' register. Six thousand registration units/centres are being established as part of this exercise - which will then be open to prospective voters to inspect, to ensure accuracy. This is a time-consuming and costly exercise without which a free and fair election could not be held. Constitutionally, the election does not need to take place until early next year, at the end of the present parliamentary term. Mr. Holman's assertion of a self-fulfilling prophesy, 'designed to delay - perhaps indefinitely - an election', also requires refutation. President Moi is committed to a multi-party democratic process. He has taken urgent measures to quell the disturbances in western Kenya - and his recent visit to the affected areas was greeted with enthusiasm by the local people. President Moi has always worked for a united peaceful Kenya. We are confident that he will guide Kenya successfully through this period of fundamental political change.

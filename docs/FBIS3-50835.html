Cuban official sources have reported that Robaina has stopped  over in Berne on his way to Africa and will take advantage of  this stopover to meet with Swiss authorities and visit the  capital city, particularly the Parliament. Robaina will leave  Berne on Sunday. This is the second time Robaina has visited  Switzerland; his first visit was in 1993 when he addressed the  Social and Economic Council to explain the Cuban situation. At  that time Robaina also met with Swiss authorities, UN officials  in Geneva, Latin American ambassadors, and other ambassadors to  the United Nations.</p>

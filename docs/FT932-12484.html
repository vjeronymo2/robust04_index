			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Boarding school enrolment falls by 6% as fees rise THE NUMBER of boarders in the UK's independent schools fell by 6 per cent last year, the steepest decline since records began in 1982, according to the Independent School Information Service. This comes on top of a 10 per cent fall in the number of boarders over the previous three years, and accelerates the decline in this sector of independent education, according to the ISIS census, which accounts for about 80 per cent of independent school pupils. Term fees averaged Pounds 3,125 for boarders, a rise of 8 per cent. Overall, independent school fees rose on average by 8.3 per cent - over three times the rate of inflation and almost double the rate of increase in average earnings. The sharpest falls in numbers came at the preparatory level, with the number of eight-year-olds falling by 16.9 per cent, and the number of nine-year-old boarders falling by 15.1 per cent. Mr David Woodhead, director of ISIS, said: 'We've had a long-term gradual decline in the number of boarders in our schools and this shows the extent to which the recession has hastened that decline.' However, numbers at day schools, where term fees average Pounds 1,368, were resilient, with day boys dropping by 0.5 per cent, and the number of day girls increasing marginally, by 0.1 per cent. This resulted in a total drop in the independent school population of 1.5 per cent - the second annual fall in succession, following nine years of steady growth. New spending on buildings and equipment per pupil fell by 10 per cent to Pounds 513 as schools tried to minimise fee rises. More than a quarter of pupils are receiving financial help, the highest figure recorded. Schools provided scholarships or bursaries to 16.9 per cent of pupils - more than double the rate in 1982. Take-up of the government assisted-places scheme for pupils from low-income families rose by 3.4 per cent. ISIS defended the increase in fees, pointing to the cut in spending on building and equipment, and the rise in teachers' pay in the public sector, which it put at 9.5 per cent for 1992. Mr Woodhead said: 'Local authority spending on education in 1992-93 is allowed by central government to rise by 7.1 per cent - more than three times the current inflation rate.' Mr Michael Oakley, secretary of the Girls' Public Day School Trust, also defended the fee increases. He said: 'Our forecast is that fee increases next September will be in the range of 4 to 5 per cent which is roughly in line with the predicted underlying rate of inflation. Education is very labour-intensive and anything up to 80 per cent of our costs are related to staff salaries. We've got to keep our salary scales at least at that which is on offer in the maintained sector.'</p>

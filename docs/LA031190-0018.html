			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUMAN BESTIARY  </P> <P> Here in Southern California there is another fairly common and thoroughly  delightful wild creature, the dove. Each year about this time, a pair of doves  arrives on the balcony of our condo.  </P> <P> They do their billing, cooing and mating on the wrought-iron railing and then  take up residence in one of our hanging plants.  </P> <P> They bring grass and twigs to make the nest, lay two little eggs and take turns  sitting. The two tiny hatchlings grow to almost a third of their parents' size  in about three weeks, thanks to a constant commute by the doves to regurgitate  food into the babies' open mouths. Then they begin their perilous attempts to  fly -- from the nest down to the balcony table and chairs or guard rail, and  then flutter and struggle back to the nest. I ache with sympathetic effort.  </P> <P> And then, some early morning, they will simply be gone, not to return until  early the next spring. The plant is dead and a mess, what with droppings and  lice, and we simply chuck it down the chute.  </P> <P> LARRY KNOPF  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

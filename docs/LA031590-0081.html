			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> 'Elvis' Takes a Break: "Elvis," the low-rated ABC series about the early life  of the great pop star, will be yanked from the schedule following Sunday's  broadcast, the network said Wednesday. ABC said that "Elvis" will continue in  production and will return in a new time slot later this year. It will be  replaced at 8:30 p.m. Sundays by a variety of programs, including episodes of  "Doogie Howser, M.D." on March 25, "Roseanne" on April 1 and "Home Videos" on  April 8. Last Sunday, "Home Videos" was the top-rated program in the country,  attracting viewers in 22.2 million homes at 8 p.m., but more than half of them  tuned out when "Elvis" began at 8:30 p.m. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

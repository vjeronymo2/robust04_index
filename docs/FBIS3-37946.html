First report by Igor Mosin: "Shivering by  Nuclear Stove." Second report by Vladimir Gubarev: "Fission as  Social Disease"]    [Text] Desnogorsk, Smolensk Oblast -- The first step has  been taken toward shutting down Russia's nuclear complex. The  Smolensk AES [nuclear power station] has reduced electricty  production by 30 percent. The Kursk, Leningrad, and  Novovoronezh AES's will be forced to follow its example in the  coming days.    I walk down the AES' long deserted passageways together with  its director. Now only duty personnel and security are working  here.    "Where does the paradox of the current situation lie?" A.  Zemskov, chief of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy public  relations board, asks. "In the fact that AES's provide  consumers with electricity which is half as expensive as that  produced by thermal power stations. But the `YeES Rossii'  Russian joint-stock stock company -- the organization involved  in the distribution of electric power and collecting money for  this -- `treats' its consumers as if all power is produced at  thermal stations. And continually raise their prices. Typical  monopolist mentality. If we had the opportunity to supply power  directly to consumers, it would cost them exactly half as much."    There is a normal working atmosphere at the power station's  control desk. The director requests personnel to prepare to  reduce capacity. They show no concern.    Five, 10, 20 minutes pass. The operator pulls some levers  and presses some buttons. Figures flash up on a monitor.  Capacity has begun to be reduced. Somewhere behind the nuclear  reactors' very thick walls the nuclear processes have begun to  slow down. You see it is all very simple and commonplace.    How might events develop in the future? Today AES's are  shutting down because they do not have the money to buy fresh  nuclear fuel. The "YeES Rossii" Russian joint-stock company is  50 billion rubles [R] in debt to the Smolensk AES alone. In all  this respected monopoly is more than 350 billion in debt to the  nuclear complex. To be fair I must say that consumers are  considerably in debt to the "YeES Rossii" Russian joint-stock  company as well. This is another of the age's economic  paradoxes. Gasoline is selling like hot cakes but the oil  refineries are shutting down. Electricity is in a similar  situation.    If the AES's do not get the money owed them in the near  future, they will reduce their capacities to 40, then 50 [figure  as published], then 20 percent. Then a full shutdown will  occur. [end of Mosin report]    The crisis in Russia's nuclear power industry is increasing  -- you can count the days the fuel will last at the AES's.    Enterprise directors have been meeting for several days now  at the "TVEL" concern, which produces nuclear fuel, in order to  find a way out of the crisis.    What has the nuclear power industry thought up?    Uranium pellets are produced at a combine in  Ust-Kamenogorsk,  Kazakhstan. From there the pellets have to get to  "Mashinostroitelnyy Zavod" in Elektrostal, where rods are  produced, and only then do the rod assemblies go to the  Leningrad AES. This well-known AES worked "for nothing" last  year -- it produced electricity but received no payment.  Consequently, it is unable to pay for the fuel from  Elektrostal, which in turn is not paying for the uranium tablets  to be produced. What is more, Ust-Kamenogorsk is now in a  foreign country, so that there are in addition all sorts of  interstate complications here....    The "new economic plan" devised at the "TVEL" concern is as  follows. The Ust-Kamenogorsk combine is in debt to Kazakhstan's  power system for electricity, the latter is in turn in debt to  YeES Rossii, and it has already built up a debt of many tens of  billions of rubles to Leningrad AES. Mutual clearing  settlements are made along this chain. Plants in Izhora are  also not settling their electricity bills. Now Izhora is going  to give away its excavators which Kazakhstan needs and which it  cannot pay for, and in their place uranium pellets will go to  Elektrostal. The only thing is that you cannot pay the  enterprises' workers either in uranium pellets or excavators.    Superficially, the "new system" of payment looks attractive:  The plants work and the AES's are not shut down. But it was  barter which was preeminent in the feudal period, and which  finally made that state system collapse.    The Russian nuclear power industry produces the cheapest  electricity. According to the conclusions of international  experts, it worked in as reliable and efficient manner last year  as the Japanese, and according to the majority of indicators  surpassed the French and in particular the Americans. I must  repeat that these figures come from international organizations!  The only thing is that we and the government are making  incredible difficulties for it (seemingly deliberately!).  Unfortunately, we simply have not heeded the lessons of  Chernobyl and are unable to learn from our own misfortunes.</p>

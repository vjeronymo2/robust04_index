			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>   [Excerpt] On 6 May, PT [Workers Party] presidential  candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva said that if he is elected,  his foreign policy would promote a debate on a "new  international political and economic order" and would seek to  establish "sound" ties with countries that have large consumer  markets and that are not aligned with economic blocs. In  addition to Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries, he  mentioned South Africa, India, China, and Russia.    Lula made it clear that he does not intend to attach  priority  to traditional Brazilian partners: "Over the past five  centuries Brazil has had trade relations with practically Europe  and the United States alone, which have now closed themselves  off into large blocs." He said his foreign policy would be  "active, with as much traveling as possible, to make Brazil  approach those countries and show the governments of rich  countries the problems and the development model that Brazil  wants to implement."    Lula spoke shortly before dedicating the headquarters of his  campaign's central committee on Angelica Avenue, in downtown Sao  Paulo, on the eve of his departure for the United States. He  will leave today on a five-day visit during which he will meet  with U.S. officials, businessmen, and official organizations.    Lula also referred to the type of "strong state" that he  wants to build in Brazil: "It will not be a state that will  meddle with the economy, but a strong state that will promote a  good taxation policy and increase revenues and investment to  resolve the problems of starvation and misery in the country,"  he explained. He added that in his government, "the sectors  that are not strategic" for national sovereignty might be  transferred to the private sector, yet he said that instead of  thinking about the privatization of existing hydroelectric  plants or highways, entrepreneurs should try to build what  Brazil still needs to promote its development.

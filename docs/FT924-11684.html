			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Gardening: Medal winners take trials in their stride - New verbenas and begonias have caught Arthur Hellyer's eye AMONG THE many new plants to be raised from seed this coming winter and spring are two verbenas that I like very much. Both have won gold medals in the Fleuroselect trials, which are held all over Europe. Both have been unfailingly beautiful in the trials in which I have seen them this past summer. One, named Peaches and Cream, has flowers of quite large size its colour also includes shades of apricot, salmon and yellow. Verbenas are certainly plants that are coming back into fashion after some years of neglect and they can be used in many ways in the garden; as carpeting plants, for edgings, in containers of any kind - including window-boxes in which they will fall naturally over the sides - and, as small standards or dot plants each tied upright to a cane. The second verbena to catch my eye this summer could scarcely be more different. It is called Imagination and it has much smaller flowers. It is said to be a hybrid with another species but the parentage has not been disclosed. The colour is a really deep violet blue, just the thing to contrast with Verbena Peaches and Cream or any of the pink or dark red verbenas. Nierembergia Mont Blanc is another low-growing annual that has won a Fleuroselect gold medal and is available for the first time this winter. It is about 8in high, has narrow leaves and smothers itself in shining, white cup-shaped flowers rather like those of a campanula a very striking plant because of its whiteness and the freedom with which it flowers. It is fast-growing, almost hardy, and suitable for sowing either in a propagator in March or directly out of doors in April where it is to flower. Its compactness makes it an ideal edging plant. Much looser in effect, but still a fine flowering plant, is a new variety of oenothera speciosa called Innocence. This is a fast-growing perennial which I first noted in the Suttons Seeds trial in Devon. Here it was about 18in high and covered in blush pink flowers but the description of the plant is white flushed with pink. Although it is really a perennial that will live for years it is better to treat it as an annual, sowing under cover in March, picking out into boxes in April and planting in May where it is to flower. It is specially recommended as an early flowering plant. Suttons Seeds are offering four new F1 hybrid begonias all of which have had their seeds coated with a special paste which converts the tiny seeds into little pellets. It is claimed that this makes it much easier to sow and that the seeds generally germinate more regularly. The process is known as Superstart. Three of the begonias treated are varieties of the small- flowered Begonia Semperflorens. Their names are Devon Gems, a mixture of colours in both flowers and foliage; Cocktail, also a mixture of flower colours but all with bronze leaves, and Pin Up which has white flowers with a pink picotee edge. The fourth is the one I like best. It is called Non-Stop Mixed and is of the tuberous rooted type with quite large, fully double flowers in a range of colours including shades of pink, red, yellow and orange. Not to be confused with this pelleting of seeds, which is not new, are two pre-sowing treatments which seem to be basically the same, although I cannot be sure as not sufficient information has yet been issued about them. One of them, known as Superstart, is being promoted by Suttons Seeds, the other, called Prime-Start, belongs to Unwins Seeds. In both the seeds are given pre-packeting treatment which brings the embryos of the seeds close to the point of germination without actually starting them into growth. The treatment is then halted and the seeds are hermetically packeted in the ordinary way. When sowing time comes the seeds can be germinated in a simple propagator and will grow with extra speed and certainty because, in Unwins words, they are 'bursting to grow.' Unwins is using Prime-Start for a new begonia, a cineraria, a pansy and a verbena but I do not know the names of the varieties. Suttons is using Superstart for five of its popular geraniums, Floribunda F1 Sensation Mixed, F1 Breakaway Red, F1 Video Mixed, F1 Gala Mixed, which makes a particularly compact plant and so is excellent for window boxes and other small containers and F2 Torbay Colour Mixed obtained from an open-pollinated F1 hybrid which is a cheaper way of producing hybrid seed and one that in this variety has given excellent results. Clarkias are hardy annuals which can be sown in April where they are to flower. They are attractive plants which have never had a great deal of publicity but I think that a newcomer, Clarkia bottiae Pink Joy, may change that. It is an attractive plant, the flowers single and cup-shaped, white in the centre, pink around the edges. They are very freely produced on 20in to 30in high stems. This could be an ideal plant for filing gaps in the borders in April or May, sown where they are to flower. In most of the seed trials I have seen a giant annual sunflower which is new and more compact than any I have seen. Its name is Helianthus Music Box Mixed. It has large flowers with the big dark centres of the familiar annual sunflowers beloved of painters ever since Van Gogh but the stems are only about 3ft high. The ray petals range in colour from light yellow to bronzy red. This is a fully hardy annual which can be sown in spring where it is to flower in summer. The one necessity is plenty of light.</p>

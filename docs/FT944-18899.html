			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Call to retain US defence trade link The UK should look to the US as well as Europe when considering developing new weapons systems, Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, said yesterday on his return from Washington. Mr Freeman said Britain should not move into an exclusively European defence industry but should co-operate with the US on programmes such as anti-ballistic missile systems. 'Whilst we have collaborations with France and Germany we should not be party to any lockout of the Americans.' He pointed out the imbalance in defence equipment trade between the US and the UK. 'Currently we buy about Dollars 2bn of equipment from the US annually, but they only buy about Dollars 1bn of equipment from us,' he said. 'We need to have a more level playing field.' In Washington Mr Freeman met Mr John Deutch, deputy US defence secretary, as well as congressional leaders. Mr Freeman told Mr Deutch that the UK was considering placing several large equipment orders in the US, including replacement Hercules aircraft and attack helicopters for the Army. The orders are worth a total of more than Pounds 3bn. He called on the US to be equally open in its procurement policies. He particularly mentioned the UK-Italian EH101 large helicopter as a possible alternative to Boeing's V-22 Osprey, which is under threat of cancellation. Mr Freeman told congressional leaders that protectionist policies in defence increased the cost of equipment to the US taxpayer. But he acknowledged that in times of heavy cutbacks, the pressure to buy locally was very strong. He highlighted areas where the UK could co-operate with the US in weapons development. He said that British expertise in surveillance, tracking and radar, for example, could have application in ballistic missile defences. Mr Freeman's emphasis on transatlantic links may disturb some European business leaders who see the development of a pan-European industry as the only way to prevent US domination of the international defence market. Mr Louis Gallois, chief executive of the French state-owned Aerospatiale, argued earlier this year that the European aerospace industry had to consolidate quickly to meet the US challenge. Many British defence executives also believe that while there may be collaboration with the US on specific programmes, the bulk of the co-operation and mergers will be within Europe, rather than as Anglo-American deals.

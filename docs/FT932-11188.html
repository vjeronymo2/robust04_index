			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Spain joins French franc borrowers THE KINGDOM of Spain launched its long-awaited Eurobond yesterday, joining the ranks of recent borrowers in the French franc sector with a FFr6bn, 15-year issue. Spain tapped the international capital markets with a DM4bn 10-year Eurobond issue earlier this year, and was keen to return to the Euromarkets with another big - but longer-dated - issue at a low yield. It had considered both the Eurofranc and the Eurosterling markets as suitable for the launch of longer-dated bonds, and eventually chose the Eurofranc sector because it does not expect long-dated yields to fall much further over the next few months. The proceeds of the issue will be used to fund the budget deficit. The issue has a coupon of 7.5 per cent and was priced to yield 44 basis points over the 8 1/2 per cent OAT due 2008. The deal broke syndicate late in the afternoon and held its 44 basis point yield spread, according to CCF, lead manager and book-runner for the deal. Other syndicates pointed out that the deal was launched too late in the day to get a clear idea of how well it had been received, and market participants are likely to keep a close watch on the offering in trading today. One syndicate manager noted that Spain may have missed out on the recent bull run in the French franc sector. Several borrowers have tapped this area of the market in the first quarter. 'Investor interest in this area is less than it was in the first three months, ahead of the (French) election,' said one house involved in the deal. The bonds are likely to be sold predominantly to European investors. The lead manager priced the deal with recent long-dated Eurofranc issues from EDF and SNCF in mind: these borrowers launched bonds at yield spreads of around 33 and 34 basis points respectively. Credit Lyonnais, one of the joint lead managers, said the Kingdom of Sweden's recent French franc deal also provided an indication for pricing the Spanish deal, given that it is a similar credit. Spain has indicated that it would like to tap the Eurobond market with large issues three or four times a year. Mr Federico Ferrer, deputy director-general of foreign financing at the Spanish treasury, said yesterday: 'We may do one more Eurobond issue this year.' The Kingdom of Spain's issue provided the main talking point in the market, although there were a handful of other deals, including two further collared floating-rate notes - a Dollars 150m, 10-year deal from CSFB Finance and a Dollars 100m 10-year deal from Goldman Sachs Group. The market also saw the launch of an unusual Pibs (permanent interest bearing shares) issue from First National Building Society. This is the first building society to raise capital in more than one currency, as the issue consisted of a IPounds 30m tranche and a Pounds 20m portion. Cementos Mexicanos, the world's fourth-largest cement company, is poised to issue some Dollars 500m in debt in international markets, adds Damian Fraser in Mexico City. It will use the proceeds to help repay a Dollars 600m bridging loan it took out last year when buying Sanson and Valenciana, the Spanish cement companies.</p>

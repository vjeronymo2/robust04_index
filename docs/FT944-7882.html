			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / EU's outstretched hand to the east begins to waver Germany is having second thoughts about inviting central and eastern European leaders to next month's European Union summit in Essen, despite pledges to make the meeting a cornerstone of the strategy to build a 'wider Europe'. German doubts appear to stem from sensitivities toward France, which earlier this year expressed reservations about Germany's championing of the cause of enlargement of the Union to the north and east. But Bonn is also concerned about slow progress in talks on a more generous EU market access package for the former Communist countries. Without such a deal - and a clear EU consensus on how to proceed with enlargement to the east - German officials fear that the Essen summit could be branded as a failure. Mr Jan Kulakowski, Poland's ambassador to the EU, said yesterday that his government had been told that Chancellor Helmut Kohl intended to invite the central and east Europeans to Essen. However, some member states remained reluctant, with France holding out to delay the invitation until the next European summit in Cannes next June. 'An invitation is still possible,' he said, 'but it is getting late.' German officials confirmed this account, saying that France was anxious to host an important event at the end of the EU presidency which it takes over from Germany on January 1. French interest had grown after Spain, the successor EU presidency, won support for hosting a conference on the Mediterranean. 'It is very important to balance the regions,' said one German official who pointed out that it might make more sense for France - rather than Germany - to take the credit for a successful summit on strategy toward the east. Behind the diplomatic manoeuvring lies a debate within the Union about how - and whether - to speed up the integration of eastern Europe, starting with the six EU associate members: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as the Baltic states and Slovenia. Germany, worried about instability on its eastern borders, is pressing for early enlargement, possibly around the turn of the century. The UK shares this goal, but is worried that more members may trigger pressure for faster political integration. France, backed by the Mediterranean bloc, wants to ensure that enlargement does not dilute the EU into a free-trade area. All member states are worried about the cost: on present EU farm and regional aid policies, the budget for an enlarged Union would rise from Ecu30bn (Pounds 24bn) to Ecu45bn, and from Ecu25bn to Ecu60bn respectively, according to a European Commission official. Paris and Bonn have co-operated with the Commission in developing a 'pre-accession' strategy, the centrepiece of which is a consultation paper which next spring will set out a list of measures for the central and eastern Europeans to adopt to become fit for EU membership. Chrystia Freeland adds: Hungary has proposed a firm timetable to negotiate its accession to the EU, calling for talks to begin as soon as the member states conclude their 1996 inter-governmental conference, leading to full membership by the year 2000. Mr Laszlo Kovacs, the Hungarian foreign minister, called on the Commission to draw up its own formal opinion on his country's application for membership before the 1996 conference begins, in order to speed up the process. 'We want it to be done country by country,' he said in an interview in London. 'We are very much against the convoy principle.'</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / People: MGN creates pensions post A rare shaft of light in the murkiness that has been the story of Mirror Group pension funds since Robert Maxwell's death came yesterday with the news that MGN has created a new post of pensions chief executive. The first incumbent is Iain Urquhart, 44, formerly benefit administration group manager with Towers Perrin, the management consultants. Urquhart's role will be to help and advise the MGN board and to deal with the pension fund trustees in untangling what he refers to only as 'the outstanding issues' since Maxwell's death. He will administer the group pension schemes and its pension policy. Although not an actuary, he has long experience of pensions, having worked on the corporate side of a variety of occupational pension schemes since 1976. He readily admits that having been in the post only since Monday, he does not yet have the measure of the task and does not feel able to say when MGN might shake off the shadow of Maxwell. And why did he want to take what seems a demanding and in some ways unappealing job? 'It was advertised in one of the pensions magazines, and it sounded like a challenge,' he says.</p>

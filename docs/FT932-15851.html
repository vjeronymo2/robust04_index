			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: GM says sales in first quarter beat forecasts GENERAL Motors, the largest US carmaker, said yesterday its first-quarter sales had been stronger than predicted, and it expected to post improved results for the period. It is due to report its earnings later this month, and analysts expect an operating profit of around Dollars 550m. 'I think it's going to be a good quarter,' Mr Jack Smith, the company's chief executive, told journalists at the New York motor show. In the first quarter of 1992, GM returned to a modest Dollars 179m profit after tax, its first quarterly surplus since the second quarter of 1990. The group's performance during March, Mr Smith added, had been 'really pleasing', and car market shares had been 'well ahead of our most optimistic outlook'. GM shares, which had risen this week on relatively good sales for March, closed up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39 1/4 on Wall Street yesterday. Mr Smith discussed several initiatives on the product development and manufacturing front. He held out the possibility that GM would construct a second production facility for Saturn small cars, and said it was working on plans for a new generation minivan that would probably be sold both in North America and Europe. He said the vehicle was expected to make its debut in the 1997 model year. GM plans later this year to add a third shift at the existing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to lift production to 300,000 cars a year. However, it believes that further additional capacity will be needed. Mr Smith gave no indication, however, of where a second plant might be located. He added that GM was studying ways of expanding production of its European small car, the Corsa, currently built in Spain, to other countries within Europe and possibly North America. Mr Smith said it was 'possible' that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, until recently GM's worldwide purchasing chief, had taken confidential papers concerning GM's European strategy to Volkswagen. 'We don't totally know,' said Mr Smith. Mr Lopez joined VW last month, and six European colleagues subsequently quit to join him. GM has since extended contract arrangements with key executives.</p>

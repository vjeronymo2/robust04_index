			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Big power users to voice fears on possible ICI deal THE UK electricity industry and large power consumers are to relay their concerns to the government over reports that Imperial Chemical Industries may be given special permission to buy electricity at below market rates. The Energy Intensive Users Group, which includes some of the largest companies in the UK, is to see Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, early next week. A spokesman for British Steel, which belongs to the group, said his company wanted to learn more of the government's plans. Members of the electricity pool, the regulated market through which all electricity has to be sold, have decided to write to the Department of Trade and Industry about the reports. Although the DTI stresses that no decisions have been taken, it is believed to be considering a plan to allow ICI to bypass the pool and buy power direct from a generator. This could save it up to 20 per cent on its electricity bills. ICI says that unless it can buy power more cheaply, it may have to shut down its chlorine plant at Runcorn, Merseyside, with the loss of 7,000 jobs. Mrs Margaret Thompson, the pool's chief executive who will be sending the letter, said yesterday that members felt the pool was 'a big and complicated issue', and they wanted to ensure that the DTI understood the implications of making an exemption. The pool's 30 members, representing generators and distributors, are worried that the government could create an unwelcome precedent. They are already under pressure from their customers to match any ICI deal. The pool was established in the late 1980s, before the privatisation of the electricity industry. Prices are set every half-hour throughout the day on the basis of bids placed by power stations. The price paid by the pool includes charges for running the electricity system and ensuring that enough capacity is available to meet peak demands. Power sold through the pool also incurs the nuclear levy, adding about 10 per cent to electricity bills.</p>

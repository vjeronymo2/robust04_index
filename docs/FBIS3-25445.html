			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Togolese President General Gnassingbe Eyadema flew  in to Abuja today for talks with Nigeria's head of state,  General Sani Abacha. As they settled down to bilateral talks,  Gen. Abacha remarked that economic development and security in  the West African subregion and Africa in general are best  guaranteed by the cooperation of the African countries, but in  the framework of groupings like the ECOWAS [Economic Community  of West African States] and the OAU. State House correspondent  Chris Ngu reports:    [Begin recording] [Ngu] Gen. Abacha's opening speech at the  bilateral talks was dominated by two themes: peace and economic  development in the West African subregion. He told the Togolese  delegation led by President Gnassingbe Eyadema that the pursuit  of happiness for the people of both countries should be the  cornerstone of leadership responsibility. He said that in the  face of current economic and security problems in West Africa  and developments in the world, subregional and regional  cooperation of African countries becomes imperative. Gen.  Abacha, however, noted that peace and economic development  cannot be achieved in an atmosphere of strife and discord. He  commended President Eyadema for what he referred to as the  president's peace effort in Liberia, adding that peace efforts  in Liberia should not be given up.    [Abacha] I believe our resolve under ECOWAS which formed the  basis of establishing ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] -- as a vehicle for establishing peace and security of  the Liberian people, as a vehicle to which democratic forces  will emerge in that country -- has to be pursued to its logical  conclusion. The conflict in Liberia should not be allowed to  continue forever.    [Ngu] On relations between the two countries, he hoped that  President Eyadema's visit will strengthen relations between Togo  and Nigeria. President Eyadema, on his part, agreed with Gen.  Abacha on the need for the warring factions in the Liberian  crisis to work for peace. He said that no businessman, local or  international, will like to invest in a country where peace and  security cannot be guaranteed. President Eyadema said Nigeria's  ECOMOG initiative is a fine example of a country that believes  in peace and security of the subregion.    Turning to the West African economy, he called for an  emergency meeting to discuss global issues facing the subregion.  A situation in which raw materials and export commodities from  the West African countries continue to attract low prices and  marked by depreciating national currencies should not be allowed  continue. Delegations of the two countries went into a  closed-door session. President Eyadema and his team, who flew  in today, have left the country. [end recording]</p>

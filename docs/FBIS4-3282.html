			<p>BFN     [Text] Vancouver, Canada, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice  Premier Zou Jiahua today called on Canadian businessmen and  financiers to take a long view into the future, seize the  opportunity and move swiftly to invest in China through fair  competition.    Zou made the call at a luncheon given jointly by Canadian  Asia-Pacific Foundation and Canada-China Business Council here  in his honor.    The vice premier, who arrived here on Monday for a 10-day  official visit, said Sino-Canadian economic and technological  cooperation is presented with a new opportunity.    He said the two countries should open new areas for  cooperation apart from the traditional ones.    Canada is strong in transportation, telecommunications,  energy, electricity, mining, agriculture and forestry, and these  are exactly the priority areas for development in China, he told  about 250 Canadian businessmen and government officials.    Zou said the Chinese government always attaches great  importance to its relations with Canada and believes that  stronger Sino-Canadian ties will work in the fundamental  interests of both peoples and contribute to peace, stability and  economic prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world at  large.    He said China's door is sure to open even wider and an  all-directional pattern of openness linking the coast with the  hinterland across China is taking shape.    The Western countries have advanced technologies and  management know-how, abundant capital and experienced managers,  Zou said, adding that China on the other hand has rich natural  resources, a labor force of low cost, a considerable economic  foundation thanks to several decades of reconstruction and above  all, a huge market.    He said that more economic and technological interflows  aimed  at a long-term cooperation, therefore, could contribute to  mutual complementarity of comparative advantage of the two sides  for common prosperity.    On the form of cooperation, Zou said, it can take many  forms.  "trade with us is certainly welcome. But we also hope to see  more business people with acumen come to China to invest and set  up their own factories, to enter into partnership with Chinese  enterprises, or to transfer technology, and explore China's  market," he added.    The vice premier pledged that China's investment environment  will keep improving and the legitimate rights and interests of  foreign investors will be better protected under Chinese law.    Zou said in 1993 alone, foreign investment actually used in  China reached 36.77 billion U.S. dollars, up by 91.5 percent  over the previous year, in which direct foreign investment  reached 25.76 billion U.S. dollars, up by 130 percent.    The investment environment in China, Zou said, is improving.  There is more order in the financial and circulation fields and  signs of an economic overheating have been brought under control  after the government introduced last June a series of measures  aimed at tightening and improving macro-economic regulation.    "This year, in face of greater inflation pressure and the  quick rise of the aggregate price level, we are stepping up  measures to control the excessive increase in investment in  fixed assets and consumption funds and to reinforce supervision  and examination of prices," the Chinese vice premier said.</p>

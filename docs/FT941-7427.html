			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Spain to clear way for EU entrants The Spanish government, which has taken a strong line on terms for admitting Nordic countries and Austria to the European Union, said yesterday it was confident negotiations would be successfully completed by the March 1 deadline. The optimistic assessment by Mr Carlos Westendorp, Spain's state secretary for the European Communities, coincided with a private meeting in Madrid between Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. Mr Westendorp said there were now 'very few problems left'. Argument over aid for under-populated areas of Finland, Norway and Sweden had been 'satisfactorily resolved' by the EU's proposal on Tuesday to set up a separate regional fund, which would leave intact the current criteria for support given to the EU''s poorest regions. Enlargement was the EU''s most important and urgent task, Mr Westendorp said. He denied that Spain was insisting on budget contributions from the four countries being channelled into 'cohesion funds' for the poorer states. It was prepared to see the estimated Ecu2bn (Dollars 2.2bn) a year in new contributions either spent on the full range of EU policies, including agriculture, or used to reduce the overall budget burden. Spain was still trying to ensure that enlargement would not damage its chances of meeting the 'convergence' criteria for economic and monetary union. But Mr Westendorp said it would be satisfied with a 'political declaration' to this effect. Still to be resolved was the question of Spanish fishing rights in Norwegian waters, closed off by Norway since 1981. Mr Westendorp indicated that Madrid''s request for rights to 14,000 tonnes a year was open to negotiation. Also to be settled were arrangements for qualified majority voting in the enlarged community. Spain wants to ensure that alliances of three or more countries which can now block EU decisions can continue to do so.</p>

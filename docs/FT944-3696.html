			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Aid unlikely for main rail lines: Government subsidies to be aimed at rural and branch services Britain's main line rail services will be expected to pay their own way so that government subsidies can be concentrated on maintaining rural lines and branch services, an announcement on Wednesday is likely to make clear. The details of the passenger service requirements - the minimum timetable that must be run to win government subsidy - are expected to create a political furore because they will be seen as reducing services. The timetable regulations to be unveiled by Mr Roger Salmon, railway franchising director responsible for the sale of British Rail's passenger train service, will show that operators must provide only an hourly service on their main inter-city routes compared with the present half-hour frequency on many main lines. But Mr Salmon will argue that the train operators will have a commercial interest in running services as frequently as possible and that services will be maintained at least at present levels. InterCity services were the most profitable part of BR. If the franchising director were to expect train operators to guarantee a half-hourly service, he would also have to promise to subsidise them if they proved unprofitable. This would drain funds from the rural and branch lines, many of which require considerable subsidies. The timetable requirements are also expected to show that the franchising director is not prepared to subsidise continuation of all sleeper services between Scotland and England. The franchising director has been allocated government subsidy to meet the Pounds 2.2bn of track access charges to be paid by the 24 train operating companies being created from BR. Critics of rail privatisation have predicted the break-up of rail services will lead to a decline in the quality and frequency of services. Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, and train user groups say the bureaucracy involved in the new fragmented railway and the impact of the signalworkers' strike have already led to reduced services. But Mr Salmon is expected to point out that there has been no guarantee of levels of services in the past and that the timetable arrangements included in passenger service requirements represent an improvement on the previous situation. The service requirements lay down frequency of trains and the time of the first and last service. If the timetable is laid down in excessive detail, Mr Salmon believes, train operators will not have sufficient commercial freedom.</p>

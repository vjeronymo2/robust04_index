			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Major to 'badger and bully' for Gatt progress MR John Major, the UK prime minister, last night promised to 'badger and bully' to achieve progress on the stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks at this week's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. Declaring that growth, unemployment and trade were the 'centrepiece' of the summit, Mr Major said it was important to make progress on trade this week. 'I very much hope that by the end of the summit, we shall have a market access agreement opening up markets, lowering tariffs and increasing trade,' he said. Shortly after his arrival in Tokyo, the prime minister said he also hoped the summit could reach agreement to return to the full multilateral trade talks in Geneva. But 'it won't be easy,' he warned. Mr Major was speaking as trade ministers from the so-called Quad group - comprising the US, the EC, Japan and Canada - settled down for talks late into the night on the hoped-for market access pact designed to lower tariffs on a wide range of manufactured goods and services. If successful, the Quad talks could give new impetus to the Uruguay Round. Mr Major said Britain could quickly reach agreement on the Round but other countries had difficulties. British officials pointed out that even if progress was made on the trade talks this week, the outcome would have to be 'multilateralised' and be accepted by the wider Gatt membership. The prime minister said he would advocate supply side economic policies to encourage growth in the industrialised world and would push in the G7 meeting for future economic summits to be more simple. Mr Major said President Bill Clinton had been right to speak of a crisis of slow growth in the G7. With 23m people out of work in the G7 countries 'the only thing that is growing fast is unemployment,' he said.</p>

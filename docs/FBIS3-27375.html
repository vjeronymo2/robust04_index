By the end of January, the gross output value of  industrial enterprises at the township level and above totaled  23.8 billion yuan, an increase of 27 percent over the same  period last year. Their industrial marketing value amounted to  12.5 billion yuan, an increase of 21 percent over the same  period of last year, and their production and marketing rate was  90.34 percent. In January, industrial development was  characterized by five aspects: 1) Heavy industrial development  was good, and light industry saw a turn for the better; 2) all  kinds of ownership developed rapidly; 3) large, medium, and  small industrial enterprises basically materialized [words  indistinct]; 4) most of the major industrial products direct  accounted for by the province continued to increase; and 5) the  production of some industrial products in the province  accelerated, particularly the production of regional industrial  products.    In January, of the 23 prefectures and cities in the  province,  the number of those which registered a decrease in industrial  production reduced by six as compared with the same period of  last year. Today, apart from Guangyuan and Aba, which has  registered a decrease in industrial production, the industrial  production in other areas is optimistic. For example, Chengdu's  industrial production has increased by 37 percent and  Panzhihua's by 29.57 percent.    In addition, the increase in sales of industrial products in  all parts of the province have remained commensurate with the  growth of their industrial production.</p>

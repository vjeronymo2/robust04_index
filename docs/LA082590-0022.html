			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: DAYS OF DRUMS AND BUGLES  </P> <P> It's everywhere now. The war talk, I mean.  </P> <P> I hear it around Farmers Market where two old men, like characters in a Bill  Mauldin cartoon, are saying we ought to go in there and smash hell out of  Saddam.  </P> <P> "Teach him a lesson he'll never forget," was the way one of them put it.  </P> <P> I hear it in Venice where activist Jerry Rubin is trying to get signatures on  an anti-war petition. "Nuke the Arabs!" two kids shout.  </P> <P> I hear it in Glendale from a woman flying the American flag who believes the  longer we wait, the worse it'll get.  </P> <P> "It's a shame," she says, "but we can't let them get away with it."  </P> <P> I hear endless words on radio and television throughout the day, talkin' war  even when there's nothing new to report, like drummers pounding away long after  the parade has ended.  </P> <P> Koppel, Brokaw, Rather, Jennings, Gumbel, Shaw, Donaldson . . . and faces of a  thousand experts in montage, their voices muting to a common riff.  </P> <P> I read it in headlines as black as a night in hell and in ads that hustle a  commodity always in demand when bombs fall and blood flows: music.  </P> <P> "Forty-two Great Love Songs From World War II!" one ad says. "An Unforgettable  Collection For Sweethearts Everywhere!"  </P> <P>  Buy an album, buy a flag, buy a yellow ribbon . . . buy a tombstone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> I sing today of war's cold shadow because, like Roseanne Barr grabbing her  crotch, it's what everyone is talking about.  </P> <P> What I detect in the voices of those I hear around this sprawling megalopolis  is a contradiction of concern, bravado and incredulity.  </P> <P> "It happened so quickly," a woman said, seated across from me at a dinner  party. "One day we're cheering peace with the Russians and the next day we're  sending troops to the desert."  </P> <P> "It's oil," a television writer observed wisely, picking at his lemon chicken.  "We'll kill for oil."  </P> <P> It's an "Arab Hitler," another said in a tone not meant to tempt debate. "We  let Adolf get away with taking Poland and look what happened after that."  </P> <P> I didn't say anything.  </P> <P> That's not like me. Give me a couple martinis before dinner and a little wine  en route and I'll do the dance of the devil's advocate as wildly as a ballerina  spinning across the table top.  </P> <P> But this time I just listened and remembered. The people there were younger  than me and, like three blind men trying to describe an elephant, they were  dealing with something they had never experienced.  </P> <P> War, I mean.  </P> <P> My generation is steeped in the stuff. I grew up in World War II, reached young  adulthood in time to fight in Korea, matured in the Vietnam War and now slide  into my cruel middle years during the . . . what? . . . Arab War?  </P> <P> "Have you ever seen human blood laced across fresh snow?" I finally said to  those at the dinner table. "It's like red ribbons on white tissue." No one  responded.  </P> <P> "Why did you say that?" my wife asked later. I couldn't answer.  </P> <P> "Are you afraid?" I asked a young friend in the Navy. He's stationed aboard the  missile cruiser Long Beach. It could be with the next carrier group to sail for  troubled waters.  </P> <P> "I'm nervous," he said. "You never know what's going to happen. If the Ranger  goes, we go too. We're part of the task force."  </P> <P> "It's all right to be afraid," I said.  </P> <P> "I'm not afraid, I'm edgy," he said. He's 19. There's still swagger in his  tone. "I don't think it will come to the point of shooting."  </P> <P> "Bertolt Brecht said war, like love, will always find a way."  </P> <P> I had meant to cheer him up, not terrify him. The kid didn't even know who  Brecht was. He was just trying to reassure himself. It won't happen to me . . .  will it?  </P> <P> "You have to have vision," the wise writer at the dinner party was saying.  "It's like Korea. No one's going to remember a war in Arabia. But they'll  remember if we don't stand up to aggression."  </P> <P> "That's the trouble with war up close," I said. "Smoke and pain cloud vision."  </P> <P> Later that night I sat in the middle of my den and dug through a box of  souvenirs from Korea. A camouflaged helmet cover, a diary, letters . . . and a  photograph.  </P> <P> It's a young man holding an M-1 rifle. There's bravado in his stance, but  horror in his eyes. I sigh deeply and sit staring at the face in the picture  for a long time.  </P> <P> I remember the smoke, I remember the pain and I hate what's happening. It's  deja vu. The guy in the picture is me.  </P></p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Hungary fails to appoint new bank chief Hungary's Socialist-led government was last night preparing to appoint a temporary central bank governor after failing to find a replacement for Mr Peter Akos Bod, who announced three weeks ago he would step down today. Mr Bod, a political appointee of the former conservative administration, was forced out midway through his six-year term. Government officials said Mr Gyorgy Szapary, one of five deputy governors, would take over in a temporary capacity. The failure to find a new governor was a political embarrassment for the government, analysts and western diplomats said. The appointment of a new governor, who will have responsibility for monetary policy, is a litmus test of the government's commitment to economic reform at a time when Hungary is under pressure to reduce its large current account and budget deficits and prevent its Dollars 26bn foreign debt from rising further. Cuts in spending, however, are being resisted by trade unions. In the summer Mr Gyula Horn, prime minister, said he favoured Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, a highly-respected former central bank governor, as a successor to Mr Bod. But the issue has fallen victim to political infighting between the Socialists, their Free Democrat partners, and factions of the Socialist party. However, it is not clear whether Mr Horn, who represents the left wing of the Socialist party, will accept the pre-conditions set by Mr Suranyi, a tough-minded technocrat who was sacked as governor by the former government. He is believed to have demanded full central bank independence and a say in economic policies and in appointing deputy governors. Mr Suranyi is also a strong advocate of strict monetary policy and of a reduction in the budget deficit, which is expected to exceed 7 per cent of gross domestic product this year.</p>

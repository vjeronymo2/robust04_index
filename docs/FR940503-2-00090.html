			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The standard Call for Information Map delineates the Call area, all of which has been identified by the MMS as having potential for the discovery of accumulations of gas and oil. Respondents are requested to indicate interest in and comment on any or all of the Federal acreage within the boundaries of the Call area that they wish to have considered for inclusion in proposed Sale 157 in the Central Gulf and proposed Sale 161 in the Western Gulf.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although individual indications of interest are considered to be privileged and proprietary information, the names of persons or entities indicating interest or submitting comments will be of public record. Those indicating such interest are requested to do so on the standard Call for Information Map by outlining the areas of interest along block lines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents should rank areas in which they have expressed interest according to priority of their interest (e.g., priority 1 (high), 2 (medium), or 3 (low)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents are encouraged to be specific in indicating blocks by priority, as blanket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nominations on large areas are not useful in the analysis of industry interest. Areas where interest has been indicated but on which respondents have not indicated priorities will be considered priority 3 (low).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents may also submit a detailed list of blocks nominated (by Official Protraction Diagram and Leasing Map designations) to ensure correct interpretation of their nominations. Specific questions may be directed to the Chief, Leasing Activities Section at (504) 736&hyph;2761. Official Protraction Diagrams and Leasing Maps can be purchased from the Public Information Unit referred to above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are sought from all interested parties about particular geological, environmental, biological, archaeological, and socioeconomic conditions or conflicts, or other information that might bear upon the potential leasing and development of particular areas. Comments are also sought on possible conflicts between future OCS gas and oil activities that may result from the proposed sales and State Coastal Management Programs (CMP's). If possible, these comments should identify specific CMP policies of concern, the nature of the conflict foreseen, and steps that the MMS could take to avoid or mitigate the potential conflict. Comments may either be in terms of broad areas or restricted to particular blocks of concern. Those submitting comments are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested to list block numbers or outline the subject area on the standard Call for Information Map.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use of Information from Call. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Information submitted in response to this Call will be used for several purposes. First, responses will be used to help identify the areas of potential for gas and oil development. Second, comments on possible environmental effects and potential use conflicts will be used in the analysis of environmental conditions in and near the Call area. This information will be used to make a preliminary determination of the potential advantages and disadvantages of gas and oil exploration and development to the region and the Nation. A third purpose of this Call is to use the comments collected to initiate the scoping process for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and to develop a proposed action and alternatives. Fourth, comments may be used in developing lease terms and conditions to ensure safe offshore operations. Fifth, comments may be used to assess potential conflicts between offshore gas and oil activities and a State CMP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Existing Information. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Preceding this Call in the sale planning process was an Information Base Review (IBR). The purpose of an IBR is to evaluate the status of pertinent information and the information acquisition efforts. This IBR constituted an assessment of the quality and adequacy of the information available which has been found sufficient for the decision to proceed with the Call.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

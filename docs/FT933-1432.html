			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / IMF chief warns of Gatt danger MR Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, yesterday warned that the world could forget about the prospects of stronger growth if negotiators failed to bring the Uruguay Round of trade talks to a successful conclusion. He said the trade talks were the number one item on the world's economic agenda and leadership was needed on all sides to complete them. A full agenda faced the ministers and central bank governors from the IMF's 178 member countries in the days ahead, he said. The world economy was facing several problems which could have a 'devastating' effect if trends were not reversed. He singled out high and rising unemployment, anaemic growth, the weak fiscal situation in many countries and protectionist pressures as negative factors weighing on the global economy. Mr Camdessus said the world should build on its success in lowering inflation and the 'outstanding' performance of many fast growing developing nations to achieve greater growth. He said countries should press ahead with structural adjustment programmes to modernise their economies, open their domestic markets to imports and press ahead with fiscal consolidation as soon as recovery was established. He called on European nations to make their labour markets more flexible and urged those countries with room to manoeuvre to cut their interest rates. The IMF managing director also urged a strengthening of the international monetary system through greater co-operation in the G7, more economic convergence among members of the Europeam Monetary System and greater acceptance of surveillance of economic policies by the IMF. He said he hoped that the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank would move towards agreeing finance for a successor to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment facility. Mr Camdessus said he would be satisfied if some progress were made towards a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights, the IMF's own reserve asset, to Fund members.</p>

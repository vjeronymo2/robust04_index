			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by F.P. Svinarchuk, Ya.V. Lavrovskiy, D.A. </F> Konevets, V.V. Vlasov, Novosibirsk Bioorganic Chemistry  Institute at the Siberian Department of Russia's Academy of  Sciences; UDC 577.112.855]    [Abstract] The possibility of selective suppression of the  gene expression with the help of short oligonucleotides which  are complementary to target mRNA (antisense oligonucleotides)  and a lack of complete understanding of the mechanism of cell  penetration by oligonucleotides and their interaction with the  cell biopolymers prompted an attempt to identify the proteins  which bind oligonucleotides in the cell nucleus. To this end,  reaction-capable oligonucleotide derivatives with the same cell  penetration parameters as the original oligonucleotides were  used; these oligonucleotides with different compositions  (1.GTGACGTCAG, 2.T(p)T[.sub]15[/], and 3.T(AC)[.sub]6[/])  were synthesized by the phosphotriester method. The experimental  procedure is outlined. The use of oligonucleotides carrying  reaction-capable radicals of aromatic 1-chlorethylamine in  5'-terminal phosphates which covalent-attach the oligonucleotide  derivatives to the cell's biopolymers made it possible to detect  peptides with a molecular mass of 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 kDa  specifically interacting with the nucleic part of the  derivatives in nuclear extracts of mice and human mammalian  cells. Similar proteins with a 1,5 and 3.0 kDa molecular mass  were also detected in insect, plant, yeast, and bacteria cells.  It is speculated that oligonucleotides penetrate the cell by  pinocytosis, possibly through mediation by specific receptors,  yet their subsequent fate, including the appearance in the  nucleus, remains unclear. A study of the effect of  oligonucleotides with varying length, plasmid DNA, and tRNA from  yeast and poly-(A)RNA shows that the proteins modified by  alkylating oligonucleotide derivatives are not specific to the  origin of nucleic acids. The proliferation of the above proteins  with a 1.5 and 3.0 kDa mass (isolated from cell nuclei of  Blatella germanica cockroach, Begonia sp.  plants, Sacharomices cerevisiae yeast, and extract of  Escherichia coli cells) attests to their  participation in important cell activity processes.

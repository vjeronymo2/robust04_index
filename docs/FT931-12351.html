			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / A controversial sense of duty: US penalties on steel imports pose difficult choices for the global industry The penal dumping duties imposed this week on steel imports into the US have brought predictable cries of protest from around the world. But for the hard-pressed steel industry, the consequences are real enough. About 4m tonnes of steel no longer have a home. Steelmakers in 19 countries, from Australia to Argentina, must either find alternative markets or cut production. The choice could scarcely have come at a worse time. Worldwide, the steel industry is struggling. In Japan, consumption fell more than 10 per cent last year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In Europe, prices have fallen by about 30 per cent since 1989, as a result of recession, domestic over-production, and cut-price imports from eastern Europe. Late last year Klockner-Werke, the smallest of Germany's main steel producers, applied for protection from its creditors. Other European steel producers will have to disappear or merge in 1993, Mr Francis Mer, chairman of France's Usinor-Sacilor said yesterday. World steel consumption overall, says the OECD, has fallen from a peak of 649m tonnes in 1989 to about 607m tonnes last year. Not all of this is due to the economic downturn. Plastics and other lighter materials are taking markets away from steel permanently. In mature economies no longer engaged in heavy industrialisation, demand is in long-term decline anyway. And while there is still strong underlying demand in developing countries, there are also low-cost domestic producers increasingly able to supply it. In the shorter term, according to the Sheffield-based steel consultancy, MEPS Europe, the outlook for world demand is also poor. In Europe it is likely to decline further this year, while the Japanese economy is not expected to pick up until later in 1993. In the US market, meanwhile, prospects are improving but the rate of growth is likely to be slow. The Latin American producers may find their domestic markets more difficult, and a further decline in production is expected in eastern Europe. As for western Europe, according to Mr David Morgan of Lehman Brothers, the stockbroker, gross domestic product needs to rise by 1.5 per cent simply to keep steel demand steady. This catalogue of problems puts the row over US imports into perspective. That is not to say that the anti-dumping duties are not damaging. Temporary duties imposed this week on carbon steel products were as high as 109 per cent; and, as Mr Morgan says, 'any duty above 10 per cent is enough to choke people out of a market'. But for British Steel, which faces duties of 109 per cent on its steel plate exports, the duties are described merely as 'an aggravation'. Its annual sales of 35,000 tonnes of steel plate in the US, worth Pounds 7m, are 'equivalent to half a week's output at Scunthorpe', it says. Less than 20 per cent of its exports to the US is affected by the decision. Among other European producers, Hoogovens of the Netherlands is, relative to its total sales, one of the biggest exporters to the US. Usinor-Sacilor of France and Italian and Spanish producers also export to the US. Mr Ekkehard Schultz, management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl, the steel unit of Germany's Thyssen group, says: 'The temporary duties imposed by the US would have little effect on the company but would heighten tension on the European market.' Eurofer, the association of European steel producers, reacted gloomily to the US action which, it said, would place 'a large question mark over the immediate future of the EC steel market, the situation of which is already worrying'. It predicted the duties would cause 'total disorder on the international market'. BHP of Australia, which expressed 'extreme surprise' yesterday at the Commerce Department's ruling, sells about 135,000 tonnes of Australian rust-resistant steel in the US. In truth, the imposition of duties by the US Commerce Department is not all bad news, especially for the European producers. There is frustration, inevitably, at the partial loss of access to the world's second-biggest steel market, just as confidence is returning to the economy. And while the tonnages involved are low, the products tend to carry high profit margins. But the overhanging threat of action by the Commerce Department had already pushed up domestic US steel prices. Importers may be able to raise prices on products not affected by the anti-dumping action, says Mr Jonathan Aylen, senior lecturer in economics at Salford University. Indeed, trade in many of the products affected by the anti-dumping decisions had been cut back sharply in recent weeks. The release in November by the Commerce Department of preliminary findings on countervailing duties - used against alleged subsidies of foreign steelmakers - was a clear sign for importers of how the wind was blowing. It may not be coincidental that the threat of anti-dumping action coincided with almost all leading European steel producers cutting their fourth-quarter output by 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The forthcoming loss of American sales 'concentrated producers' minds, which was probably a good thing', according to Mr Edward Hadas of Morgan Stanley, the investment bank. Total steel imports to the US market had, in any case, fallen from 20.9m short tons (the US measure which is about 10 per cent less than a tonne) in 1988 to 15.8m in 1991. European producers were not expecting to recover the shortfall, says Mr Hadas: the US industry has improved greatly from its dilapidated state in the 1960s and 1970s, and should now be able to supply the domestic market, barring some specialist products. So what will be the fate of the 4m lost tonnes? Yesterday the message from European producers was clear. Finding new markets is not an option. In any case, they are already pursuing a different strategy, which concentrates on keeping prices up rather than chasing volume. Cockerill-Sambre, Belgium's largest steel producer, says it will raise prices by 15 per cent to 20 per cent in the second quarter of the year, following the lead set earlier this month by British Steel, Usinor-Sacilor and Thyssen. Success in raising prices cannot be guaranteed, however. Already, for example, there have been rumblings of dissent from big customers in the European automotive industry. And Europe's steel producers tried to push prices up last year and failed, largely because of overproduction. They appear genuinely determined, though, that it will be a different story in 1993, and the involvement of big companies in the price rises improves the chances of making them stick. At the same time, they are unlikely to raise production simply to recoup lost sales in the US, for two reasons. First, alternative markets would be extremely difficult to find in the present environment. Second and most important, maintaining a disciplined approach to output will be a crucial element in maintaining the price increases. With virtually all European steelmakers losing money, the over-riding priority for the industry is the successful implementation of measures which are now being mooted by the European Commission to protect it. The European Community's special steel envoy, Mr Fernand Braun, has been touring EC steel companies in recent weeks to assess the extent of the crisis, and will be submitting his recommendations next month. About Ecu500m could be available to help steel producers cut capacity permanently, so short-term restraint on output is in their long-term interests. The European industry wants financial help to cover an expected 50,000 job losses over the next three to four years. Observers believe Mr Braun's talks went well, suggesting that companies realise they cannot expect rivals to make capacity cuts without responding themselves. Few, if any, of the other countries targeted by the Commerce Department will find alternative markets easily. For east European producers on the list, such as Poland and Romania, domestic markets have been ravaged by the political and economic turmoil of the past three years, and further cut-price imports to the EC would simply be used as ammunition by western producers who claim that eastern products are unfairly subsidised. Japanese producers will hardly find solace in their domestic market either. Along with most of the world's steel producers, the anti-dumping action traps them between a rock and a hard place.</p>

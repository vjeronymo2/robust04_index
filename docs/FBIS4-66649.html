			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed by "Y.L.": "Islamic Fundamentalists in </F> France: A New Haul; Thousands of Official Algerian Documents  Uncovered"]    [Text] Among the documents seized are blank identification  papers and affidavit forms from the High Commission on National  Service [HCSN], also blank.    These documents (511 national identity cards and 606 HCSN  affidavit forms) were uncovered by French security services  after a search of the homes of two presumed former Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS] sympathizers, El-Hadj Chaib Eddour, an  Algerian citizen, and Ahmed Seba, an Algerian holding French  citizenship. These two individuals had been arrested and  questioned on 21 March for their role in a drug trafficking case.    Yet more seriously, at Ahmed Seba's home the French police  had discovered an Israeli Galil assault rifle, two 9-mm PA  loaders, as well as several boxes of shells. All of which would  earn him another charge, namely criminal association of being in  contact with a terrorist enterprise.    However, according to VSD (a French magazine), which broke  the background to the story on an exclusive basis in its most  recent issue, the discovery of the documents happened  accidentally.    The origin of this haul, according to this magazine, was an  investigation begun in early December into a drug trafficking  network.    Two different agencies, the general intelligence office [RG]  and the Judiciary Police [PJ], had begun an investigation into  the same group of suspects, but for two different reasons: the  RG was interested in the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] support  network aspect, the PJ in a heroin trafficking operation. Until  this precise moment, French security forces still did not  suspect that they were going to make the extraordinary discovery  of the official Algerian documents.    It was only after the arrest, on 21 March, of 18 members  (including Chaib and Seba) and the search of their premises that  the secret was discovered. There was a huge network producing  counterfeit Algerian documents. A fair share of these papers  were already in envelopes bearing the addresses of their  addressees in Algeria.    When questioned, Seba would admit that these documents were  meant for members of GIA, the terrorist group.    He is reported to have stated that he had left them at  Chaib's house at the request of a certain Boudjellal Chemellal,  a presumed GIA member, and that he had done so under the threat  of reprisals against members of his family.    Still, according to Seba's admission, Boudjellal was also  the  owner of the Israeli assault rifle and the load of ammunition.    These facts would, in fact, provide concrete evidence for  the  French security agencies and authorities that the GIA has indeed  managed to set up a support and logistic network in France,  which is closely connected with drug trafficking.    Better yet, French police have even established a connection  between this case and certain individuals arrested as part of an  operation last November code-named "Chrysanthemum" aimed at  circles of sympathizers and activists in France of the former  FIS.    That evidence is the discovery of a photocopy of the  verification order issued on 12 November against Larbi Beddiaf,  a member of the FAF [Algerian Brotherhood in France], who was  questioned for being [part of] a criminal organization in  contact with a terrorist enterprise.    Last, it should be noted that Chaib and Seba as well as  Boudjellal, for whom the examining magistrate issued an  international arrest warrant, are not known and therefore not in  the files of the French and Algerian security agencies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will today  continue the talks they began in Cairo yesterday. The talks aim  to resolve some unsettled issues concerning the implementation  of the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation, said the  current talks focus on the release of detained Palestinians,  crossing points between both Gaza and Jericho and Israel, and  joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols. Sha'th added that any delay  in the implementation of the Declaration of Principles will  increase the suffering of the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories. He expressed hopes of progress in the current  round of talks, which will last until the end of this week.</p>

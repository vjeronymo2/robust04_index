			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURBS EASED ON COMPUTER EXPORTS TO EASTERN BLOC;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE PENTAGON WILL NO LONGER TAKE PART IN SCREENING SALES OF LOW-END  MAINFRAMES. THE MOVE CALMS A TURF BATTLE BETWEEN THE DEFENSE AND COMMERCE  DEPARTMENTS.  </P> <P> The Defense Department said Friday it no longer wants a role in reviewing sales  of U.S. medical equipment and less advanced mainframe computers to the Soviet  Union and Eastern Europe, leaving it to the Commerce Department to grant export  licenses on its own.  </P> <P> The move is a further de-escalation of a decade-long battle between the two  agencies over which should control strategically sensitive exports. For years,  Commerce has argued for allowing more sales, while the Pentagon has warned that  they could endanger U.S. security.  </P> <P> The action also reflects a continued relaxation of export restrictions by the  Bush Administration in recognition of the past year's political and economic  developments in the Soviet Union and Central Europe.  </P> <P> U.S. allies have been pressing the Administration to ease restrictions on the  export of strategically sensitive technology so that Western firms can take  advantage of new sales opportunities in emerging democracies such as Poland and  Hungary.  </P> <P> The White House initially was reluctant to loosen its rules, but it has been  forced to reconsider amid fears that the Europeans might bolt and go their own  way. A high-level committee has been reviewing U.S. policies and is slated to  make recommendations soon.  </P> <P> Although Friday's decision was expected to speed the processing of export  licenses for both categories of equipment, it was not considered likely to have  much impact on overall sales. Officials said the Pentagon had been approving  most such requests in recent months.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, long a holdout among top Administration  policy-makers in advocating any easing, conceded that continued reforms by  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev most likely would bring even more  liberalization.  </P> <P> In a speech before the Assn. of American Publishers, Cheney said that "as long  as Mr. Gorbachev pursues the current policies he is pursuing . . . we will see  it's easier for the Soviets to acquire military technology . . . than it's  been."  </P> <P> At the same time, however, Cheney warned against moving too rapidly to lower  technology-control barriers.  </P> <P> "There's already an erosion of the international agreements that limit the flow  of sophisticated technologies to the Soviet Union," he said.  </P> <P> Frank J. Gaffney, director of the Center for Security Policy, a conservative  group that follows such issues, warned that while "in this case the move may be  genuinely inconsequential," the Administration should take care that it is not  moving too fast.  </P> <P> "We are seeing this happening in such a wholesale fashion that the Defense  Department is now obliged to be much more selective on how it uses its  capital," Gaffney said. He warned that the Administration ought to be cautious  on how quickly it eases its stance.  </P> <P> Friday's decision was the product of an interagency review of export-control  policy. Defense Department officials said the move was cleared with a number of  departments and agencies, including the State Department, that have an interest  in the issue.  </P> <P> However, Pentagon spokesmen insisted that the change was proposed by Defense as  a streamlining move, on grounds that it was taking too much time to review  proposed sales of equipment that did not present any serious security problems.  </P> <P> Officials said the looser regulations for computers would apply only to low-end  mainframes such as the IBM 3031, 4331 and 4341 computers.  </P> <P> High-end products, such as IBM 4381 and 9370 computers and their equivalents,  still will be subject to both Pentagon and Commerce Department review.  </P> <P> The change, approved personally by William Rudman, deputy under secretary of  defense for trade security policy, also applies to licenses for trade shows  involving such equipment.  </P> <P> The regulation of exports of strategically sensitive goods is performed under  the aegis of the Paris-based Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export  Controls, a 17-member compact that includes the United States and most of its  major economic allies.  </P> <P> In the past, the United States essentially has set the standards that Cocom has  followed. In recent years, however, with other countries developing  high-technology equipment of their own, Washington has been somewhat less  dominant in the organization.  </P></p>

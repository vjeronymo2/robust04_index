There are a few nuclear power  information network systems that can be readily accessed using  personal computers and modems, but the majority of these systems  are closed and can only be accessed and used by power companies,  research institutes and other pertinent organizations. And there  is a lot of data on nuclear power that has yet to be converted  to an electronic format, i.e. databases that have been  maintained as-is in hardcopy form, and others which have gone  electronic, but which are simply accumulations of individual  personal records.    The future conversion of stores of valuable data to  electronic formats will make it easier to utilize this  information, and current efforts such as the ``Data Freeway''  project being sponsored by the Science and Technology Agency  (STA) are attempting to stimulate the mutual utilization of this  information by various research organs. The storage and use of  data via various forms of multi-media such as CD-ROMs will  likely become more popular in future as well. We can therefore  look forward to the day when these advances will make nuclear  power-related information available to the general public,  thereby promoting a better understanding of this valuable source  of energy.    We apologize in advance for the fact that time and space  limitations have prevented us from introducing herein more than  just a portion of the database systems currently in existence in  Japan.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcela Doleckova: "Russian Partner Makes </F> Delivery of Nuclear Fuel for Dukovany Conditional on Repayment  of Debt"]    [Text] Skodaexport, which was buying Russian nuclear fuel  for the Dukovany nuclear power station until last year, owes the  Russian supplier $5.7 million for the 1992 deliveries. Albert  Panushkin, chief engineer of the Mashinostroyitelniy zavod  company, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that, following the bad  experience with Skodaexport, the Russian fuel producer intends  only to sign contracts directly with the Czech consumer--that  is, CEZ [Czech Power Generating Works] company. However, no  contract will be signed until the debt is settled. In spite of  the glut on the world uranium market, Mashinostroyitelniy zavod  is the only company in the world that produces nuclear fuel for  reactors of the Russian type that are installed in Dukovany.  Even though CEZ invited tenders for the supply of alternative  fuel for Dukovany, responses to which have come not only from  the present Russian supplier but also from a West European  consortium and the U.S. Westinghouse company, the mere  development of the production technology for fuel for the  Dukovany Russian-type reactors would take two to three years.  Any supplier but the Russian one is thus essentially out of the  question until then. The new contract between CEZ and the  Russian supplier concerns this year and the subsequent two  years. Although it should have been signed in March, it has  only been initialed thus far. According to Jaroslav Mil, CEZ's  specialist for nuclear fuel issues, the Dukovany power station  has enough fuel in stock to last one year. However, it has  already starting tapping those reserves.    Vladimir Lima, Skodaexport's director of finance, admitted  to  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that "there is some truth" to the Russian  accusation. He admits, above all, that CEZ had actually paid  Skodaexport for the purchase in Russia a long time ago.  Vladimir Cima stresses, however, that Skodaexport is "in  complex credit relations with Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka  [Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank, CSOB]" and suffers from a  shortage of funds. Asked directly whether Skodaexport uses CEZ  money to cover its other commitments, the director of finance  replied in the affirmative. He stressed, nonetheless, that ways  of settling the Russian claim are being sought intensively. In  this context, both Cima and Jiri Brudnak, who heads the relevant  trade division of Skodaexport, use the words "gradually, by  means of deliveries of goods as well as bank transfers." Cima  even uses the term "to mutually offset claims and liabilities,"  by which he means not only Skodaexport's claims and liabilities  toward Mashinostroyitelniy zavod (or, respectively,  Tekhsnabeksport, a trading company with a license to export  nuclear fuel), but also toward other Russian companies.  Overall, Skodaexport's claims in Russia exceed its liabilities.    Albert Panushkin told us in this contact that  Mashinostroyitelniy zavod is 51 percent private (these shares  are owned by its employees) and does not care about the  liabilities of other Russian companies toward Skodaexport.  Neither Panushkin nor Brudnak deny the existence of certain  partial interests on the Russian side. It seems that the  management of Mashinostroyitelniy zavod is interested in  obtaining the company's remaining shares and that the management  would be more accommodating if the Czech side tried to influence  Moscow in this direction. The remaining shares of this sole  supplier of fuel for the Dukovany nuclear power station, on  which the Czech Republic depends for about 25 percent of its  electricity production, are still owned by the Russian state.</p>

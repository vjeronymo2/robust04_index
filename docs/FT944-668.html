			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar firmer The dollar was yesterday the beneficiary of Mexico's woes with the US currency profiting from a flight to quality, writes Philip Gawith. The reverberations in Latin American markets, and beyond, of the sharp devaluation of the Mexican peso were still the focus of attention. Activity was, however, very quiet. Trading desks were lightly manned, and activity in Europe effectively died after the lunchtime release of the US durable goods data. The dollar shed some of the gains it made on Thursday, but maintained its firmer tone to close in London at DM1.5783 from DM1.5805. Against the yen, it finished at Y100.205 from Y100.495. Elsewhere, the lira was firm after the excitement earlier in the week, culminating in the resignation on Thursday of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister. The lira finished unchanged at L1,039. Also attracting some attention was the New Zealand dollar, which touched a six year high of Dollars 0.643 in Asian trading. Analysts said that the ramifications of Mexico's devaluation were potentially more serious for the region than the collapse of the ERM had been for Europe. The slide in the peso, from around 3.46 on Monday, to 4.70 yesterday, has spilled over into other countries like Brazil and Argentina, prompting a heavy liquidation of assets held in the region by US funds. 'From a sentiment standpoint, the market has perceived this will be money coming home, and that will be good for the dollar,' said Mr Shandi Modi, chief economist at IDEA, the financial advisory service, in London. Trade remained very thin, with an enormous bid-offer spread of around 4.60/4.80 pesos. Although the peso appears to have achieved a modicum of stability, analysts said it remained vulnerable to further sale of the underlying assets. On the other hand, recovery over the past two days in the stock market has provided a glimmer of hope. Before the devaluation, most observers believed the peso was 10-15 per cent overvalued, suggesting it is now oversold. The only figures released of any note were US durable goods orders. They rose by 3.4 per cent in November, compared to a consensus forecast of 1.7 per cent. The series, however, is very volatile and was ignored by traders. Mr Modi said the bias of the market was 'to walk in next year and buy dollars.' The New Zealand dollar touched a fresh six year high, buoyed by buying from a local bank in thin trade. Dealers said the 'Kiwi' was also benefiting from Standard &amp; Poor's sovereign upgrade of New Zealand on Thursday, with some local institutions caught short by the move. The Kiwi finished in London at Dollars 0.6425/USDollars from Dollars 0.6409. The French franc recovered off a low of FFr3.4592 to close at FFr3.454 against the D-Mark, from FFr3.455. Business, however, was light and dealers said it was difficult to see why the currency had fallen to its lowest level in a year. The franc has been in retreat ever since Mr Jacques Delors announced he would not be standing for the presidency next year. This prompted fears of a swing towards the Eurosceptic right in French politics. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 900m money market shortage at established rates. Sterling was barely changed, with the trade weighted index finishing at 79.7 from 79.8.</p>

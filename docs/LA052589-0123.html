It offers free entertainment, 40 carnival rides and more than 100  food, game and commercial booths and exhibits.  </P> <P> California's largest strawberry shortcake will be carved up and served to  several thousand visitors Friday evening. On Saturday morning, the annual  Strawberry Festival Parade will feature television celebrities and will be  broadcast live on KHJ-TV Channel 9. A strawberry-pie eating contest will be  held Sunday and a "Redhead roundup," in which prizes will be awarded for the  reddest hair and the most freckles, is set for Monday.  </P> <P> The event has raised $1.5 million for charities since 1966, festival president  Dick Miller said. Last year, the festival gave $100,000 to the city for the  restoration of the Mills House, a civic art gallery and community meeting  place. The festival also donated $25,000 each to the Grove Theatre Company of  Garden Grove and Ronald McDonald House in Orange.  </P> <P> Although strawberry cultivation in Garden Grove -- once promoted as the  strawberry capital of the world -- has dwindled to only 44 acres, strawberries  continue to be an important crop in Orange County.  </P> <P> Over the last 20 years, strawberry acreage has increased from 1,372 acres in  1967 to 2,498 acres in 1987, said John Ellis, deputy agricultural commissioner  for Orange County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989 STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL PARADE  </P> <P> When: FRIDAY, MAY 26:1 p.m. to midnight  </P> <P> SATURDAY, MAY 27: 10 a.m. to midnight  </P> <P> SUNDAY, MAY 28: noon to midnight  </P> <P> MONDAY, MAY 29: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Where: Village Green Park, Stanford Avenue and Euclid Street, a half-mile north  of Garden Grove Freeway.  </P> <P> Admission: Free.  </P> <P> Parking: On surrounding streets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989 STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL SCHEDULE  </P> <P> FRIDAY, MAY 26  </P> <P> 2 p.m.: Tiny tots contest with Billy Barty (must pre-register)  </P> <P> 6 p.m.: Opening ceremonies  </P> <P> 7:30 p.m.: Cutting and sharing world's largest strawberry shortcake  </P> <P> </P> <P> SATURDAY, MAY 27  </P> <P> 10:30 a.m.: Parade starts at West and Chapman, goes west to Euclid and south to  festival grounds  </P> <P> Noon: Celebrity autograph session  </P> <P> Battle of the bands  </P> <P> 7:30 p.m.: Talent contest (pre-register)  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUNDAY, MAY 28  </P> <P> 12:30 p.m.: Pie-eating contest  </P> <P> 2 p.m.: Live entertainment  </P> <P> 7:30 p.m.: Las Vegas revue  </P> <P> </P> <P> MONDAY, MAY 29  </P> <P> Noon: Redhead roundup  </P> <P> 2:30 p.m.: Live entertainment  </P> <P> All events will take place at the Strawberry Bowl on the grounds.  </P> <P> Pre-registration: Tiny Tot King and Queen (ages 3, 4, 5 and 6) by today.  </P> <P> To obtain forms: Call Strawberry Festival at (714) 638-0981.

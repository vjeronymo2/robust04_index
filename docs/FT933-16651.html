			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Observer: Smokey's send-off Though the sun was shining and the champagne flowing, the first reception for the Bank of England's new governor was but sparsely attended. Besides Eddie George - otherwise known as Smokey Joe - the octet present included Mrs George, Bernie Kemp, who organised the bash and bestowed the nickname, and top professional toastmaster Ivor Spencer, replete with presentational magnum. Possibly the thin crowd reflected the impromptu nature as well as the site of the occasion: outside North Dulwich railway station. Invitations had been strictly by word of mouth, in whispers. The champagne launching was newsagent Bernie's tribute to the governor not only for rising to the office from humble beginnings, but also for buying the FT from him for years. They are almost neighbours. For the past quarter century Smokey Joe - so called because he always has a gasper on the go when he picks up his paper - has lived in a semi only a few roads away from the station, above which Bernie has lived for his whole life. Like his customer, he is moving up in the world. He has diversified into double-glazing, painting and decorating, plumbing, carpentry and window-cleaning for offices, all without having to advertise. Along the way he has served other distinguished customers, in Lady Thatcher and the ex-premier of Thailand, and he is currently in the running to help to build a Greek airport . . . But there the chat ends. He must rush off to make sure that what could well be the last time Smokey Joe goes to work by train - the 7.32 to London Bridge - isn't the first time he misses it.</p>

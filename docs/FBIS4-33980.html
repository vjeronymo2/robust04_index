			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 11 (CNA) -- The Mexicali industrial  zone, situated at the border of the United States and Mexico,  wants more Taiwan investment, a representative of the zone said  Saturday [11 June].    Investors will be allowed easier access to the North  American  Free Trade Area (NAFTA) [as received] after setting up plants  there, Chuang Chih-lung, an overseas Chinese authorized by the  zone to court Taiwan investment, said Saturday.    Chuang made the call for more Taiwan investment in the wake  of Republic of China Premier Lien Chan's visit to Mexico last  week. The only Taiwan companies currently operating in the  industrial zone are computer makers, Chuang said.    Most of the investors in the zone, which encompasses a  population of a million people, come from the United States,  Japan, and Taiwan, Chuang noted. He said the low cost of rent  in the zone and the cheap and abundant labor force there make it  an ideal place for Taiwan investors wanting to break into the  North American market.</p>

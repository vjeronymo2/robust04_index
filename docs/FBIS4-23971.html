			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer Bruno Masure] The tragedy in Rwanda:  France this evening officially asked the UN Security Council to  adopt a resolution allowing the use of all necessary means--that  is, military ones--in order to protect civilians on the ground.  [passage omitted] Philippe Rochot takes stock of the situation:    [Rochot] [passage omitted] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]  men believe that they themselves can rescue the Tutsis and that  they do not need French troops to return to Rwanda, which may  jeopardize their military victory. Paris means to show good  will toward these RPF troops by saving Tutsis--the majority  ethnic group within their movement--first of all. However, a  few hours away from the Security Council meeting, the RPF was  displaying a very harsh position:    [Begin Claude Dusaidi, RPF envoy to the United Nations,  recording, in English, with superimposed French translation] We  have no contact with the French, and this morning we declared  that the French ambassador in Kigali will be persona non grata.  If he comes, we will arrest him and send him back to France.  We will accept any peacekeeping force, even if it includes  troops from France or its allies, but we do not want a force of  aggression and we will treat it accordingly. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    [Masure] Our special correspondent in Kigali, Laurent  Boussie, is live on the telephone. He arrived in the Rwandan  capital this morning from Uganda. Laurent, can you hear me?    [Boussie] Yes, indeed, Bruno, I can hear you.    [Masure] Can you tell us in a nutshell what the situation is  like in Kigali this evening from a military viewpoint?    [Boussie] In Kigali, after 48 hours of shelling and  fighting,  today was a rather calm day. This precarious truce allowed the  humanitarian organizations and UN soldiers to evacuate hundreds  of wounded people.    [Masure] You had the privilege--the journalistic luck--to  meet the president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front in Kigali this  morning. He confirmed the hostility of the Rwandan rebels toward  any French military presence.    [Boussie] You know, you know, he is called Alexis  Kanyarengwe. He is the president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front,  which has a majority of Tutsis, but he himself is a Hutu. He  expressed extremely harsh words and his determination seems to  be very strong. I am going to read to you a sentence he uttered  this morning: French soldiers are coming here in order to  protect the torturers. As soon as they set foot in Rwanda, we  will consider them as enemies and do our utmost to fight them.  As you can see, he is very determined and his men on the ground  seem to be, too.    [Masure] Thank you, Laurent Boussie, for this report live  from Kigali.</p>

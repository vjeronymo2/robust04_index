			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Monarch makes Argentinian gold investment Monarch Resources, the UK-listed company with gold mining and exploration operations in Venezuela, has signed its first deal outside that country. It will pay Dollars 275,000 (Pounds 177,000) to earn 51 per cent of the Gualilan gold properties in the San Juan province of Argentina. Subject to due diligence, Monarch must complete Dollars 2m of work on the properties over four years to earn its interest. It will also take over a purchase option agreement amounting to Dollars 420,000 which lasts until October 1996, but this may be credited against Monarch's annual work commitment obligations. It is also entering into a Dollars 1m purchase option agreement, over mineral rights at the Tuna 1 concession in the El Dorado district of Bolivar State, Venezuela, near Monarch's La Comorra mine.</p>

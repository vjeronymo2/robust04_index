			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Oxygen levels in newborn babies Scientists are experimenting with infra-red light absorption as a method of measuring the oxygen reaching the brains of newborn babies, which crucially affects their risk of death or disability. The oxygen present in the brain is related to the amount of light absorbed by bone and brain tissue when a pulse of infra-red light is fired from a laser placed at one temple to a photo-detector at the other temple. A computer model to determine the relationship between the distance travelled by the light and the absorption coefficients of the brain has been developed by researchers at the Centre for Research in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Wales Swansea. The model is based on digitised anatomical studies of adult brains, which have been scaled down to the size of infant brains. The researchers say refinements to the model will result in highly accurate measurements of brain oxygenation. University of Wales, Swansea: UK, tel 01792 295598; fax 01792 295676.</p>

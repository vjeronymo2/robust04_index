			<p>BFN     [Text] Concerning the reversion of the Naha Military Port  and the Yomitan Auxiliary Airstrip -- two major sites concerning  the military base issue on Okinawa -- it has been learned by 16  June that the United States has prepared plans of its own  accommodating the prefectural government's requests and has  presented them to the Japanese Government. According to  information supplied by several officials concerned, the U.S.  plans -- which propose to merge Naha Port facilities into the  Makiminato Supply Depot in Urasoe City and to return the Yomitan  Auxiliary Airstrip completely -- were presented to the  Japan-U.S. Joint Committee early this year. Meanwhile, the  Japanese Government is cautious about its course of action  because of the possibility of reaction arising from the local  area to which the facilities may be moved, and has not made a  clear response yet. Apparently, both cases will need to be  resolved through U.S. leadership.    On the issue of the Naha Military Port, the U.S. plans  propose to install berths on which vessels can dock in the area  of Makiminato, where the western coast development project is  now underway, and to use the Supply Depot as a backup area for  supply storage. The merger plan envisages reducing the scale of  the military port by about half of what it is today.    The U.S. Armed Forces used to say "it is essential to have a  backup area of the size of the Naha Military Port in order to  store supplies for contingencies," but they think that problem  can be solved by securing a route linking the berths and the  collection area in the supply depot.    As for the Yomitan Auxiliary Airstrip, the armed forces have  shown their intention to return all of it, and are now studying  how to solve the radiowave problems of the Sobe Communications  Station (Zono-ori), to which the parachuting exercise site will  be moved.    At present, the Chubu training ground in Camp Hansen between  Kin- cho and Ginoza-son is being cited as a possible candidate  for the parachute exercise site. On 16 June, the Japan-U.S.  Joint Committee agreed to establish a working group to discuss  the specifics of the return of the airstrip.    The package of U.S. plans for solving the issues, comprised  of specific removal and integration plans, was presented by U.S.  representatives at the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee session.    As far as the problem of the live-fire exercise over  Prefectural Highway 104 is concerned, the U.S. forces are  studying a plan to move almost all of the exercise to the East  Fuji Training Ground in Shizuoka Prefecture. The live-fire  exercise has been another major issues along with the other two  concerning the return of facilities.    The plan appears to envision removing this exercise, now  conducted from 30 to 40 days a year on Okinawa, to the East Fuji  Training Ground. The U.S. Government is expected to ask the  Japanese Government to bear the costs of transporting troops for  the exercise. The transport costs will amount to about $1  million for each exercise. Since Japan is not allowed to  directly assist combat operations, including exercises under the  existing Status-of-Forces Agreement, the conclusion of a new  treaty will become necessary in order for the Japanese  Government to be able to bear the costs of transporting the  troops.</p>

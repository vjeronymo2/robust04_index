			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENFED'S 3RD-QUARTER PROFITS DOWN SHARPLY  </P> <P> Glenfed Inc., parent of Glendale Federal, announced Thursday that third-quarter  earnings were off sharply due partly to rising interest rates.  </P> <P> For the quarter ended March 31, the firm reported net income of $20.2 million,  down from $45.6 million in 1988. The 1988 quarterly earnings included an  extraordinary item of $9.9 million for utilization of tax loss carry-forwards.  </P> <P> Norman Coulson, president and chief executive of Glenfed, said: "Our earnings  were impacted by a narrowing of our interest rate spread, a phenomenon  affecting the majority of the thrift industry . . . Yields on our  adjustable-rate mortgage portfolio increased and operating expenses declined,  but these improvements were more than offset by rapidly rising short-term  interest rates."  </P> <P> Coulson also said that deposit flows, which had been negative in January and  February, rebounded strongly in March.  </P> <P> Glendale is the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan.  </P></p>

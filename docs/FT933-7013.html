			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minero Peru sets mine price at Dollars 30m STATE-OWNED Minero Peru has fixed the base price for its Cerro Verde copper mine to be sold off on October 13 at Dollars 30m, with a minimum investment requirement of Dollars 60m, the company's president, Mr Raul Otero, said yesterday, reports Reuter from Lima. The Dollars 30m is to be in cash and the investment is to be over five years. Mr Otero said the investment pledged by 19 of the potential bidders who qualified would be a key factor as Minero was unable to develop the second stage of the mine for lack of financing and it would signal the bidders' long-term plans. The figures would be kept low to allow each of the 19 qualifiers to assess the mine's worth. They are at present making analyses of the mine to verify its reserves. Latest studies show that Cerro Verde, located in the southern region of Arequipa, has a potential output of 100,000 tonnes of copper a year.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Minister vetoes Scottish art plan Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has vetoed the plan by the National Galleries of Scotland to establish a gallery of Scottish art in Glasgow. He said the plan, which had aroused intense controversy in Scotland, did not enjoy 'the broad general support appropriate to a major initiative of this kind'. Mr Lang's decision is a rebuff to Mr Angus Grossart, the merchant banker who is chairman of the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland, and to Mr Timothy Clifford, the director of the galleries, who were the plan's proponents. The idea was to create a gallery to depict Scottish art and history.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / People: Calver retires Ron Calver, 48, general manager of Norwich Union's UK life operations, is to leave the company after 10 years in that position. Calver's duties will be covered by Phillip Scott, general manager (finance) and chief actuary, who took on the office vacated by the last NU director who took early retirement, Hugh Scurfield. Norwich Union's directors have their work cut out for them. In 1992, its board recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18m, but took comfort from the fact that the loss was significantly smaller than that recorded in the two prior years. Also, it has made progress in improving its regulatory capital. Meanwhile, NU, renowned for flexing its muscle as an institutional shareholder on matters such as directors' pay, is mum on how much it will pay to Calver for his early retirement. Scurfield received Pounds 146,000 for loss of office last year.</p>

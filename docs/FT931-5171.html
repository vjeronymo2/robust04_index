			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Etonbrook meeting called Mr Andrew Perloff, the rebel shareholder in Etonbrook, has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting of the property development company, in another attempt to join the board and remove all of its existing directors. Mr Perloff and his three companies own 29.9 per cent of Etonbrook. He has failed once before to win a seat on the board but thwarted a proposed capital restructuring at an EGM in September. In January the former BES company blamed a drop in its interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 74,000 on costs incurred in fighting a tender offer from Mr Perloff.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Inflexibility meets naivety: What Schlesinger said For an institution that prides itself as a paragon of conservatism and stability, the German Bundesbank seems suddenly to have become remarkably accident-prone. Twice in a matter of days, the mighty central bank has been forced to issue agonised denials of statements attributed to it, on each occasion too late to prevent a blood-letting on the currency markets. First it was a confidential report by a leading French bank, saying the Bundesbank believed the lira, peseta and sterling were all 'candidates for devaluation'. Now it is Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president, who denies having told two business newspapers that the problems of the currency market have yet to be resolved, more currencies will come under pressure, and a more comprehensive realignment within the European Monetary System would have been better. What is up? Is it all a terrible plot by the beastly Bundesbank to bash the Brits? Or is it a tale of incompetence, a chapter of accidents by a lumbering institution, a public relations nightmare and no more? The latest tale of woe is certainly indicative. Mr Schlesinger decided to give a simultaneous session on Tuesday afternoon to Germany's Handelsblatt and the US Wall Street Journal. His intention was apparently to answer the barrage of criticism, at home and abroad, that the Bundesbank had lost its credibility as an independent institution. The charge is that it was pressured politically into easing its interest rates in exchange for a limited realignment in the EMS on Monday. The interview was only granted on the guarantee that the subsequent publication would be carefully cleared by the bank's press department - a common German practice, but a considerable concession for the Journal. What Mr Schlesinger failed to take into account were the inflexible deadlines of his own national newspapers. An interview at 4pm was clearly a challenge for the US publication, but it managed to clear the article in time. A respectable, but unexciting version, warning against expectations of further interest rate cuts, duly appeared yesterday. Only one slightly dubious quote slipped through: 'One can see that the problems aren't finally solved,' Mr Schlesinger was quoted as saying. 'But it looks much quieter than it did last Friday.' The same cannot be said for Handelsblatt, a paper with a reputation almost as worthy as that of the Bundesbank. It was quite unable to process an entire interview in time for its late afternoon deadline. So it decided to run a brief summary, and publish the interview today. Even then, the summary story only made the last few thousand copies of the print run. But the result caused consternation in the corridors of Europe's central banks - above all in London and Frankfurt itself. As German newspapers often do with a good story, Handelsblatt sent a summary of the story to the news agencies in advance, and it was humming on the wires by 8pm on Tuesday. As soon as the news got to London, the Bank of England rang the Bundesbank, demanding an explanation. It was told the interview was 'unauthorised'. Nothing shocking would appear. By then the uncensored summary was coming off the Handelsblatt presses. It was too late to stop it, even though it was barely 9pm. Did Schlesinger say, or did he not, that he would have preferred a more comprehensive alignment? 'He did not say that, and he did not mean that,' a Bundesbank spokesman replied. Yesterday, Handelsblatt and the bank's press department were locked in what one participant called 'a damage limitation exercise'. Mr Werner Benkhoff, the head of the newspaper's currency and capital markets department who conducted the interview, is unrepentant. 'We stand by the story. The content accurately reflected what he said,' he insisted yesterday. 'But we also admit that it was not the authorised version.' One person closely involved says the Handelsblatt excerpts were simply 'the direct quotes in indirect speech'. The whole truth will probably never be published. But it does say something about inflexible German press practices, and the naivety of the correct and courteous Mr Schlesinger. He was stating, or leaving the impression of, little other than the obvious. The fact that it came from the president of the Bundesbank is what caused the consternation. 'Your boss is too honest for his own good,' was the comment made to a Bundesbank official overheard in the corridor after the interview.</p>

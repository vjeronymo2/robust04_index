			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Hungarian trade setback Hungary's trade deficit jumped to a record Dollars 473.6m in August, bringing the total deficit in the first eight months to Dollars 2.594bn, the Trade and Industry Ministry said. Exports in the same period were Dollars 6.361bn, up 12.2 per cent over the first eight months of last year, while imports rose 16.1 per cent to Dollars 8.954bn. Officials blamed the August deficit on exceptional items such as a Dollars 147m payment for the lease of Boeing airliners by Malev, the national carrier, and energy imports costing Dollars 136m. The central bank has devalued the forint by 1.1 per cent with effect from today, bringing total devaluation to 14.9 per cent this year. Denmark's gross domestic product growth rate is set to level off, with no signs as yet of higher inflation, the central bank governor, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, said yesterday. 'We expect the. . . high 4.4 per cent rate predicted for 1994 to level off to 3 per cent in 1995,' he said.</p>

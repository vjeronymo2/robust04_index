			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: New packages of Peps launched A NEW range of packaged personal equity plans has been launched by River &amp; Mercantile, the fund management group, in the wake of the new Pounds 6,000 limit for investment trust plans. There are three packages: high income, capital growth, and income and growth. Each uses shares in River &amp; Mercantile's various split capital investment trusts. The high-income plan uses a combination of ordinary income, income and stepped preference shares to create a desired income yield of 10.5 per cent per annum (before charges). There is a risk of capital loss, however, with this plan; the assets and dividends of the trust need to grow at 2.5 per cent per annum for investors to receive their money back. The capital growth plan uses a combination of stepped preference and capital shares. Use of the stepped preference shares ensures a nominal (2.1 per cent) yield to cover the charges. But the plan is designed for those who want to back a rising stock market, and who regularly pay capital gains tax. If the assets and dividends of the trusts grow by 5 per cent a year, the gross redemption yield (before charges) will be 12.2 per cent per annum; if they grow at 7.5 per cent per year, the yield will be 15.4 per cent. The downside is that if assets and dividends do not grow at all, the yield will be just 5.9 per cent. The income and growth plan will invest in stepped preference, income and ordinary split capital shares and will aim for an income yield (before charges) of 8.9 per cent. If the assets and dividends of the trusts grow at 5 per cent a year, then the gross redemption yield will be 12.2 per cent per annum. There is a 4 per cent initial charge and a 1.5 per cent annual charge on all of the plans. That means for those investing the full Pounds 6,000, the first year's charge is Pounds 330. The income tax saving on the highest yielding plan will be Pounds 157.50 for a basic rate taxpayer and Pounds 252 for a top rate taxpayer, so it will take a couple of years or so to recoup the charges in tax savings. One further caveat is that the trusts in which the plans invest are set to be wound up in 1999 and 2000. Anyone wanting to invest beyond that date must depend on River &amp; Mercantile's success, either in extending the trusts' lives, or in launching new ones.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / A flight from the slopes: FT Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. This week they moved from Europe to North America on their way to Chile. In her hooded white jacket and white jeans, Lucy looked like something out of Colorado's 10th Mountain Division, the war-time unit of American troops trained to fight on skis, as we set off on a misty dawn to ski a hillside at Hintertux, Austria. Not bothering to change into our ski suits for just one run, we drove to the nearest snow-covered fields, tried to avoid the gentians and hoped the local farmer would not spot us. Once again we were skiing at an unearthly hour in order to leave ourselves enough time to reach a distant airport before an inter-continental flight. Frankfurt was 350 miles away, and our Air New Zealand flight to Los Angeles was due to take off that afternoon. If we had waited for the lifts to open and gone up to the glacier, we might not have made it. The skiing at Hintertux, the best of the Austrian glacier areas, had been so outstanding that we were tempted to lengthen our stay: we made fresh tracks in powder all morning. Earlier, at Saas Fee in Switzerland, we were rescued by the ski school director, Heinrich Kalbermatten, who arranged a ride on a snow cat for us when the summer skiing area was forced to close because of snow and high winds. Our driver, Urs Niederer, drove us like a tank commander in a white-out to a point on the glacier from which we could ski our obligatory mile. Now in California, our traditional landfall between continents, we drove all night across the Mojave Desert to Mammoth Mountain, passing Edwards Airforce Base, where most of the Space Shuttles land. It reminded us that Fran Newitt, our expedition co-ordinator based in Kent in England, has started referring to us as her 'time travellers'. Faced with an itinerary which grows more complex by the day, she has been gamely trying to keep us on course. But even she sometimes has to draw breath. Her last message to us included the memorable sentiment: 'I'm sure there's a way round all these problems - if only I could think what it is.' At Mammoth, Ivan Russell had horses, Jeeps and snowmobiles standing by to help us get to the snow while the gondola was closed for maintenance. Our daily outing on skis has been down Scotty's, named after a skier killed on this trail by an avalanche in 1968. We pass a monument to him every time we ski his run. We hope he would have wished us well.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Restructured AIM shows 36% rise to Pounds 3.11m AIM Group, the maker of aircraft interiors, yesterday reported a 36 per cent increase in profits as the benefit of orders placed some years ago showed through. Pre-tax profits in the year to April 30 rose from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 3.11m on sales up 9.6 per cent to Pounds 58m. Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 13.7p and a recommended final dividend of 5p brings the total to 6.5p, a rise of 18 per cent. With the sale of its air conditioning contracting division in May, the group has now returned to its core business of design and manufacture of aircraft interiors. The restored fortunes of the group follow last year's debt rescheduling relating to property loans. Some Pounds 6m now bears no interest charge and must be repaid only in 1994. The aviation division increased operating profits by 33 per cent to Pounds 4.43m on sales up 17 per cent at Pounds 43.7m. Mr Jeff Smith, chairman and chief executive, said the recent high investment in the Derby and Wallisdown sites had been completed. Mr Smith said that in spite of the strengths of the group and the results which were 'bang on target', AIM was dogged by the poor state of aircraft sales and the mood in the industry. 'Every time they talk of the European Fighter Aircraft, where we have absolutely no involvement, our share price goes down 5p,' he said. Results from contracting were 'disappointing'. Sales fell from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 15m but erosion of margins led to a fall from profits of Pounds 383,000 to break even at the operating level. Eastern Electricity bought the contracting division for Pounds 1.5m more than net book value after the balance sheet date.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The implementation of the Washington Agreement was  one of the topics discussed at the talks in Zagreb this evening  between Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and Iranian  Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, who was accompanied by the  Deputy Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri. After the talks, the two  ministers made statements. Albino Cehic has a report.    [Begin Velayati recording, in English with superimposed  translation into Serbo-Croatian] We have already concluded very  friendly talks with his excellency the prime minister of  Croatia, and we are happy that, less than a week after his visit  to Iran, we had an opportunity to come to Croatia to implement  what we signed in Tehran. This evening we remembered what we  signed and, in addition to bilateral relations, we would like to  include Bosnia as well, in order to establish tripartite  cooperation between Iran, Bosnia, and Croatia. [end recording]    [Cehic] This evening's meeting is also important because we  have just come back from Sarajevo where we had useful talks with  the Bosnian leaders and Alija Izetbegovic. We hope that Croatia  and Bosnia will find a way to implement the agreement they  signed recently. I believe that the future of Croatia and Iran,  Minister Velayati stressed, lies primarily in the strengthening  of bilateral cooperation between our and your country. Prime  Minister Valentic had the following to say to reporters:    [Begun Valentic recording] This is the continuation of the  very concrete talks we began in Tehran, primarily on bilateral  relations, and, even more importantly, on tripartite relations  between Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran, and Croatia. I think that  very soon our three countries will form a joint economic  commission, in order to make joint appearance in the world --  especially, as I have already said, in Islamic countries where  we believe that mixed Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatian companies  can obtain considerable financial projects.    In the same way, Iran's help and support are important in  the  implementation of the agreement on the [Muslim-Croat]  federation. We agreed that the federation is important,  primarily for Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state, but also for Croatia as a  directly interested neighboring state, and a state which is  concerned about its people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it is also  important for Iran as a state. Croatia attaches great  importance to that, and we will continue developing bilateral  and tripartite relations. [end recording]</p>

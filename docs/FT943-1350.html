			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips as Fed meeting is awaited Wall Street US stocks slid lower for the fourth successive day yesterday as investors remained nervous about the outcome of next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm, writes Richard Waters in New York. Yesterday's falls left the Dow Jones Industrials Average 101.60 lower than its level at the end of the previous week. Concern that the Fed will raise interest rates for the sixth time this year have been behind the slide. Friday's losses were more modest than previous days, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 5.38 to 3,831.75, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.60 at 459.67. The American Stock Exchange composite was up 0.32 at 455.23, while the Nasdaq composite receded 2.98 to 757.46. After driving the Dow industrials down rapidly in the previous three sessions, investors were still on edge over the outlook for interest rates, which some market analysts said could be raised by as much as half a percentage point next week. There was no clear consensus on Wall Street as to whether the Fed would come down in favour of an immediate tightening of credit conditions during Tuesday's session. As a result equity investors seemed content to let share prices drift. Bond traders were also taking a wait-and-see approach. Trading was quiet and bond prices across the maturity range moved marginally lower. There was no fresh economic news to disturb the uneasy tranquility. At first the lazy mood put stocks on firmer ground as bargain hunters stepped in after the recent downturn. But as the day wore on, the jitters intensified once again and the blue chip index slipped back into negative territory. Among the components of the Dow industrials, Disney dropped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 39 1/2 amid continuing reports of management turmoil at the company. Boeing shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 7/8 and Procter &amp; Gamble receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 58 7/8 . Offsetting the declines, Kodak rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 7/8 and International Paper was up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 78 1/4 . The action elsewhere was mixed as well. On the NYSE as a whole, delining issues held a modest edge over advances during the day. The Big Three car makers fell out of favour, with General Motors losing Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 46 1/2 and Chrysler dropping Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 43 5/8 . A related issue, Goodyear Tire, shed Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 32 1/8 . Georgia-Pacific was a bright spot, thanks to a favourable re-rating by Kidder Peabody. The stock jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 74 5/8 . In the technology sector, Digital Equipment was marked down Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 25 7/8 on a downgrading by PaineWebber, which said the stock was overvalued. On the Nasdaq, most computer stocks suffered setbacks. Intel was down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 63 1/4 , Sun Microsystems retreated Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 29 1/4 and Oracle gave back Dollars  5/16 to Dollars 43 1/4 . Canada Toronto trading picked up sharply today after yesterday's lacklustre session, with the TSE composite index closing up slightly. The TSE-300 index added 4.89 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,367.54 in volume of 74m shares. Advancing issues beat declines by 389 to 357. The TSE was down 36 points on the week. Ten of the 14 indexes were down, led by transportation and industrial products. Golds, mining, conglomerates and energy all gained on the day. The New York spot price for gold closed up 40 cents (US) to Dollars 395.95 an ounce. In the gold group, Franco-Nevada gained 1 to 87; American Barrick added 7/8 to 36 1/8; Echo Mines was up 5/8 to close at 18 3/8.</p>

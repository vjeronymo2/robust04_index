			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SANSEI': AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A BAND  </P> <P> There's a loud noise coming from the Mark Taper Forum -- louder than any we can  remember.  </P> <P> The source of the noise is the Asian-American band Hiroshima. And the cause of  it all is "Sansei," a musical-theatrical construct based on the lives of  bandleader Dan Kuramoto, his ex-wife and koto player June Kuramoto, drummer  Danny Yamamoto and taiko percussionist Johnny Mori. As the musicians perform,  actors impersonating them step forward and talk to us cloaked in their new  personas.  </P> <P> This is another of the Taper's self- and socially conscious ventures into the  tortuous mine field of commissioned sociodrama. Like its most obvious artistic  predecessor, "Green Card," developed at the Taper in 1986 to explore the lives  of Los Angeles' newest immigrants, "Sansei" is a pseudo-play.  </P> <P> Verbally, it is a collage of monologues consisting of personal reminiscences,  peppered with a few cultural gags and attempts at a sort of poetic social  commentary addressed directly to the audience and redolent most with  self-congratulation. Call it collective kitsch.  </P> <P> Musically, unlike "Green Card," it's a terrific concert.  </P> <P> Visually, "Sansei" also offers satisfactions. Mark Wedland has provided a  handsome structural set of platforms and grids that come alive under Jeff  Ravitz's kaleidoscopic lights (assisted, in the musical portions, by David E.  Freeman). Between the set and the dancing lights (also used to focus our  attention), there is at least one memorable image: that of Johnny Mori in  traditional Japanese dress (Lydia Tanji designed the costumes) going at the  taiko while Lane Nishikawa, portraying Johnny, tells us how he came to play the  instrument and improvise it from wine barrels when he couldn't afford to import  the real thing.  </P> <P> "Sansei," the program tells us, was "created" by the band members and  "developed" by director Robert Egan. Where it departs from the presentational  stasis of "Green Card" is in its integration of words and music and one other  thing: While it is often a clumsy or entirely superficial effort, it does make  a stab at living up to its title (Sansei means third generation  Japanese-American) by illustrating the extraordinary mix of cultural influences  that have shaped and will continue to shape the inhabitants of our new world.  </P> <P> Thus it is not surprising that some of the other, newer Hiroshima band members  bear names reflecting this ethnic mix: Dean Cortez, Kimo Cornwell, Allen Hinds  and a lead singer named Machun.  </P> <P> Dan Kuramoto (played by Marc Hayashi) is Sansei but grew up in East Los Angeles  and extols the virtues of the burritos and taquitos at that end of the city.  </P> <P> June (performed with some depth and great polish by Natsuko Ohama) grew up  rebellious and in her efforts to assimilate tried to give up the koto; only a  persistent teacher who regularly sought her out and dragged her to classes kept  her on track.  </P> <P> Nishikawa as Mori talks about discrimination in Utah, where he and a group of  friends were denied service in a coffee shop because, by the blackest irony,  they were mistaken for American Indians.  </P> <P> Nelson Mashita as Yamamoto tells of his extreme isolation as a student at UCLA.  None of them knows where Tule Lake might be, though all of them know it was the  location of a wartime internment camp. To these third-generationists, their  Japanese ancestry is at once immediate and remote.  </P> <P> That must be why the band, which mixes the koto, shamisen and taiko with  synthesizers, electric keyboards and guitars, is known chiefly for instrumental  jazz with its roots firmly in black music. The result (including fine  renditions of "Living in America" and "Thousand Cranes") is an exciting musical  Big Mix, in a way the parallel theatrical format never touches: spontaneous and  organic.  </P> <P> For all its good intentions and its sporadic flare-ups of interest, "Sansei"  remains a concert trying to "pass" as drama. Its content is super thin, the  personal histories trivial or limited and, when a real issue comes along --  such as race discrimination in the recording industry, Dan and June's divorce  or Dan's addiction to drugs -- they're all but passed over in a fast line or  two, countered by a good deal of chatter about rebirth and self-assertion.  </P> <P> To bring the spoken content of "Sansei" up to the level of the musical one  would have taken far greater courage. There's plenty of intercultural nastiness  festering out there in the real world. This could have been an opportunity to  explore it. It would have taken another kind of gumption to look at things  head-on, squarely and honestly. Instead, "Sansei" pays lip service to the  problems and offers a happy Hollywood ending.  </P> <P> At the Music Center, 135 N.

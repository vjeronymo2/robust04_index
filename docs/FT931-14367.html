			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Observer: Cheesed off It has long been an adman's axiom that if you can't find anything interesting to say about a client's product, mount a teaser campaign. Even so, the latest efforts by Coca-Cola and Lowe Howard Bell, its British advertising agency, to drum up free publicity betray signs of unusual desperation. Summoned yesterday to a 'major mystery announcement' at St Martin's Theatre in London, home of the long-running whodunnit 'The Mousetrap', hacks were treated to a tedious presentation by a top Coke executive which included a man dressed as Kaiser Bill and a small inflatable zeppelin. These, it finally turned out, were the improbable themes of a UK commercial for Tab Clear, a new colourless diet cola. No figures were available for sales targets, the ad budget or even Coca-Cola's UK sales last year. But as it happens, the same product was announced a month ago in the US, where Tab's once-commanding share of the diet cola market has shrunk to less than one per cent, and followed the launch of a similar soft drink by arch-rival Pepsi. Even as self-important a company as Coke should realise that if a secret is really worth revealing, it will be faxed around the world in a matter of hours. If it wants to attract media attention, it had better invent a better mousetrap next time.</p>

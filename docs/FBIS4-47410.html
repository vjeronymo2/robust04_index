Puzankova,  Scientific Research Institute of Foot and Mouth Disease,  Vladimir; UDC 616.98-078.33]    [Abstract] Enzyme immunoassay is the preferred test for  diagnosing viral and bacterial infections among animals for a  number of reasons, among them its simplicity and quickness of  execution, its high level of sensitivity, the accessibility and  stability of the reagents used. The researchers here developed a  field technique that will analyze a serum sample for the  presence of antigens or their antibodies and provide on-site  results. Test results are produced within 30-40 minutes (as  opposed to the best current time of 3-4 hours), without the need  for complex instrumentation. References 11 (Russian).</p>

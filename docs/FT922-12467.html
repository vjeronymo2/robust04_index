			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: Hefty pre-merger loss at SecPac FIRST-quarter earnings from the soon-to-be-merged Bank of America and Security Pacific continue to underscore Bank of America's profitability and the heavy losses at SecPac, the weaker of the two banks. Bank of America and SecPac agreed to merge last summer in a Dollars 4.5bn transaction, the biggest in US banking history. The deteriorating balance sheet at SecPac has persuaded most observers to view the merger as effectively a rescue. In the last set of separate results from the banks before completion of their merger, the San Francisco-based Bank of America reported 7 per cent higher net profits of Dollars 303m in the first quarter of 1992. By contrast, SecPac - hit by nearly trebled loan loss provisions of Dollars 786.8n - unveiled a hefty Dollars 496.3m first-quarter loss, which compares with net earnings of Dollars 96.5m in the first quarter of 1991. Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman of Bank of America, attributed his bank's strong first quarter earnings to 'prudent management of the credit portfolio and success in our expense control efforts'. He noted that despite the sluggish US economy, the bank's net loan losses and non-performing assets actually declined year-on-year. Its net loan losses were Dollars 219m in the first quarter of 1992, less than half the Dollars 447m suffered in the same period of 1991. At March 31, 1992, the bank's non-performing assets totalled Dollars 2.95bn, down from Dollars 3.1bn at last December 31. SecPac, by contrast, said its poor first-quarter results reflected 'the continued impact of prolonged adverse economic conditions' in several key markets. Non-performing loans and leases totalled Dollars 3.5bn at March 31, 1992, compared with Dollars 2.75bn last December 31. Continental Bank of Chicago, helped by lower loan loss provisions, said first-quarter net income jumped to Dollars 57m, from Dollars 28m in the first three months of last year. Mr Tom Theobald, chairman, said the bank was continuing to see positive results from its restructuring.</p>

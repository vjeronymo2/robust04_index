			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (7): Battle against corruption - Many Russians believe the mafia has simply changed its colours 'YES, a clever man cannot but be a cheat,' wrote Alexander Griboyedov, the 19th century Russian writer, in the play, Woe from Wit. Throughout the centuries, Russia has been notoriously corrupt. But racketeering, influence-peddling and embezzlement have come to play such a large role in everyday life that the word mafia is now one of the most frequently-used words in the Russian language, writes Leyla Boulton. Another peculiarity of life in the former Soviet Union is that the word as used in Russian has no precise analogy anywhere else in the world. It describes not a group of 'godfathers' (although there are such figures, too) but an all-embracing system of crooked practice created by seven decades of Communist rule. Its foundations: artificially low fixed prices, shortages, total state-ownership of the economy. Its multiple actors: a haphazard but wide-reaching assortment of state or party functionaries, gangsters, entrepreneurs, and petty employees. 'Countries which are called civilised are far from rid of the mafia, but at least they are based on democratic principles which are opposed to the mafia,' says Mr Arkady Vaksberg, the country's leading expert on the subject. 'A system which is fundamentally rotten cannot fight against itself.' Now that the new Russian government is pursuing bold market reforms to dismantle the old economic system, there is some hope that society can defeat the mafia because its root causes are finally being tackled. Whereas before most forms of business activity could be described as mafia because they were illegal, their unbanning removes the justification for at least some of the dishonesty. However, a weak federal administration, a poorly-developed legal system, and the continued state ownership of most of the economy mean that corruption is thriving as never before. Resistance from old vested interests to the government's privatisation and demonopolisation efforts is also an obstacle to tackling the mafia's root causes. At stake is the credibility of market reforms which are supposed to benefit all, and not just those who know how to use the prevailing system to enrich themselves. Today, and not without reason, the Russian public believes the mafia has simply changed its colours. A perception that the new rulers are not only impoverishing people with price liberalisation but may be as corrupt as their Communist predecessors, could well sink the whole reform process. The main reason many ordinary people voted for new 'democratic' politicians was hope for a more just system. But mafiosnost (literally 'mafia-ness') has simply adjusted to new circumstances - a government official sells off state assets at less then their worth in a private transaction disguised as 'privatisation.' Prices have been freed but it is still profitable for shop assistants to hoard goods on sale in the shops in anticipation of further price rises. Communist officials have either taken new jobs in the administration or have set up companies with laundered party money. Poorly-paid civil servants fearful for their future as a result of the political and economic changes have even more incentive to steal than before. Instead of transferring assets from the state to the people, different sets of government officials are fighting each other for control of what they see as lucrative sources of personal wealth. Foreign businessmen privately complain that they are being asked to pay more bribes even though no company will publicly admit to ever paying any bribes. Foreign companies which do pay bribes are disturbed by the fact that it is no longer clear whom they have to pay to obtain results. Those which do not pay bribes continue to complain they lose out to other companies which do. The final straw is that whatever morality or discipline which existed under the old Communist system has fallen by the wayside in today's chaotic free for all. Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the government's new anti-corruption service, claims that even the attempt by last month's conservative Congress of People's Deputies to remove the government of young economic reformers was a rearguard mafia action to sabotage their reforms. The reason he agreed to join this government, he says, is that it 'owes nothing to nobody' - unlike the previous administration which he claims relied on support from shadowy entrepreneurs to defeat the old Communist nomenklatura. Mr Yuri Boldyrev, head of President Yeltsin's government inspectorate, argues that 'what is happening in our country now is not even a battle between Communists and democrats, it is a struggle between different power groups in a vacuum of any rules.' While Russia searches for new rules, officials from top down are apparently free to do whatever they want. The older generation is particularly used to disposing of state property as its own. One high-level example was provided by Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, who is himself constantly accusing the government of corruption but who last month rang up the chairman of the central bank, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, to demand Rbs7bn credit for the Renaissance Bank. This commercial bank, which has personal links to Rutskoi, is supposed to provide funds for private farmers - a noble enough cause which the vice-president is supposed to promote. The problem is that when Mr Matiukhin refused to grant the funds, the vice-president threatened to have him removed within a week. Mr Leonid Zapalsky, former first deputy economics minister last December signed an order one month after the ministry's dissolution, giving valuable export licences for 10m tonnes of oil and 10m tonnes of oil products to a private 'charity.' He also transferred computers and cars to a joint-venture called 'Russian-Japanese University.' The assets are now being returned after a government crackdown. But, somewhat inexplicably, charges are not being pressed by the state prosecutor. Equally revealing from the readiness of many Russians to admit to crooked dealings is the fact that few see that corruption as a crime. Even fewer understand the notion of conflicts of interest. A senior official at the state oil company of Tatarstan, a republic within Russia which is pressing for independence, admitted in conversation to taking a Dollars 20,000 bribe from a foreign company in helping it work out projects for investing in his republic. 'I've got expenses to cover,' he explained, saying his Rbs4,000 (Dollars 40) monthly salary was not enough to survive on. A Soviet government official who was laid off in December when the country collapsed told me about how he had received Rbs20m from Soviet finance ministry officials who were loath to pass on the money to the Russian government.  The money was to set up a socially-useful project. President Boris Yeltsin last month issued his first decree against corruption, forbidding public servants from getting involved in business, either as intermediaries or employees of private firms. But Mr Gurtovoi says this is only a first step, which must be followed up by higher pay for government officials so that the administration does not lose its best people to the private sector, 'leaving behind the idiots and hardened criminals'. 'A civil servant can't live on 2,500 roubles (Dollars 25) a month. If we ban him from using his government position to make money on the side, we need to give him conditions for a decent life - that is a high pension, a guarantee he won't be fired, and a system of privileges which we as democrats used to fight against,' he explains. Likewise, a policeman must know that if he dies, his pension will be big and somebody else will look after his children.  Otherwise he will run away from thieves, rather than catch them.' In the mean time, Mr Gurtovoi, who used to blow the whistle on government corruption as a top investigative journalist, is intent on catching specific individuals red-handed pour decourager les autres. An opposite view is expressed by Mr Arkady Murashov, head of the Moscow police who says there is no point in conducting an active battle against corruption until the old system is dismantled, demonopolised and privatised. A leading young liberal politician, he was appointed police chief last year to clean up the police force. He agrees that police pay must be increased and says that more effective commercial courts would help reduce violent crime since businessmen would be more inclined to settle their disputes in court rather than employing gangsters to deal with unsettled accounts.  But he sees the fight against the so-called mafia as an evolutionary process. 'By the highest standards, the Soviet system is totally corrupt,' Mr Murashov admits with refreshing candour. 'All decisions are made by Yeltsin and millions of little bureaucrats. If somebody famous comes to the mayor of Moscow and says 'I need a building to set up the Gorbachev Fund,' who will take that decision? The mayor. 'And so a building worth millions of dollars will be transferred to that person.  And after a certain amount of time, he will be able to let office space to commercial insitutions. 'And after yet some more time, it will be transformed into his private property.  Is that corrupt?  Yes, it is.  But that is how decisions are taken.  It is the system.' It is not surprising that from this perspective, Mr Murashov is looking forward to the day when he has just a 'normal' mafia to fight - say, a US-style drugs trade. Mr Gurtovoi retorts that the fight must begin now - otherwise 'there will be no tomorrow'.  He warns of a terrible backlash if market reforms are simply associated with chaos and lawlessness. 'Out people won't let this country turn into another Colombia.  Instead, a new Stalin will appear and simply shoot people.  If we don't catch thieves now, there won't be anything left to steal. 'We'll show up one day and find the Kremlin has been sold.'</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COMMISSION OKS SCALED-BACK PLAN FOR SANTA CLARITA;  </P> <P> GROWTH: THE PANEL'S ACTION UPHOLDS A COUNTY POLICY TO LIMIT THE MAXIMUM  POPULATION IN THE VALLEY TO 270,000 BY THE YEAR 2010.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County planning commissioners, brushing aside objections from  developers, approved a sweeping plan Monday to sharply reduce the expected  growth of the Santa Clarita Valley for the next 20 years.  </P> <P> The new general plan, approved on a 4-1 vote by the Regional Planning  Commission, would allow developers to build less than a third of the 38,000  housing units they have proposed.  </P> <P> The plan would uphold a county policy to limit the Santa Clarita Valley's  population, now about 150,000, to a maximum of 270,000 by 2010.  </P> <P> The plan must still be approved by the Board of Supervisors, and developers  whose projects were not included in the plan Monday said they would push for  their projects during public hearings before the supervisors, possibly in late  summer.  </P> <P> The commissioners said the plan would provide a good foundation for management  of future growth in the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> Commissioner Betty Fisher, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said she approved  of the plan's goals but questioned how strongly it would be implemented. Rather  than develop a firm plan, she said, the county had produced an advisory  document that could be amended later.  </P> <P> "I just have a problem with putting this plan into action," Fisher said.  </P> <P> "It's certainly not perfect," said Commissioner Sadie B. Clark, "but nothing  is."  </P> <P> Almost two years in the making, the new general plan sets broad guidelines for  development in the booming Santa Clarita Valley, one of the fastest-growing  regions in the county during the last decade.  </P> <P> Planning commissioners decided to create a new general plan in 1988 because the  Department of Regional Planning was struggling to process a backlog of 43  proposed amendments to the old general plan.  </P> <P> Those proposals, for more than 38,000 units, would have pushed the Santa  Clarita Valley's population past 270,000 residents in this decade.  </P> <P> County planners said the valley does not have the infrastructure, from roads to  fire stations to libraries, to support such rapid growth. "We just can't add  more and more residential developments in the Santa Clarita Valley for a number  of reasons," Jack Edwards, administrator of regional planning, said Monday.  </P> <P> The new general plan does not reject or approve specific developments, but  instead designates whether land is appropriate for residential growth, parks,  industry or other uses. Developers would still be able to ask the planning  commissioners to hold hearings on each of the 43 development proposals.  </P> <P> But the land-use designations approved Monday indicate where development is  most likely to be allowed. Planning Director James E. Hartl said the guidelines  separate viable projects from others unlikely to be approved.  </P> <P> Even some potentially desirable projects were not included in the general plan  because they would overload the current infrastructure, planner Lee Stark said.  One project not included is a proposed 1,157-space mobile home park needed to  accommodate mobile homes from parks that are expected to close in the next  several years, he said.  </P> <P> At a series of well-attended hearings on the plan that began in December,  developers promised that their projects would pay for roads, schools, parks and  other amenities in the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> Among the potential winners in the aftermath of Monday's action was Newhall  Land &amp; Farming Co., the valley's largest developer, which would be allowed  to build about 6,000 of nearly 9,000 units it had proposed in Valencia.  </P> <P> Among the losers was the Dale Poe Development Corp., which had hoped to build  4,632 units, but would be allowed about 1,200 under the new plan. But Jeff  Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, said the company would stress the  potential benefits of the project to the Board of Supervisors.  </P></p>

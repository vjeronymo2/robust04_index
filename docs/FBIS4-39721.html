			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 9 Jun -- The issue of the Russian base in  Armenia has been settled in principle. It is planned to have  one efficient military base installed in two localities on the  Republic's territory. The main installation is to be in the  Gyumri locality, where a Russian motorized infantry division is  currently quartered, while part of the base's subunits will be  stationed in Yerevan, where a Russian motorized infantry  regiment is based at present. This opinion was shared by the  members of the Russian military delegation at the summing-up  conference held today by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.  He noted that Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan was  sympathetic toward the proposed Russian military base.    According to Grachev, the bases in Armenia should be set up  by 1 August 1994. The minister noted that it will be quite a  powerful body of troops and that there are plans to include  antiaircraft and air force -- with the exception of  long-distance aircraft -- elements alongside ground troops. "It  will be a powerful air mobile force," Pavel Grachev said, "which  can be deployed in any danger area at short notice should the  need arise."    Apart from this, the question of creating a joint  Russian-Armenian antiaircraft defense system within the  framework of the collective security treaty was also discussed.  The extent of the Russian and Armenian contributions in terms  of materiel and personnel was established. In particular,  Russia plans to station additional air defense subunits in  Armenia to cover certain sections and control the Armenian  airspace. These will be missile complexes and a squadron of  interceptor planes. The final decision on the whole complex of  questions concerning the Russian military base in Armenia will  be made at the presidential level.    As one of the participants in the talks said to an ITAR-TASS  correspondent, Russia intends to take legal posession of its  military base for the period of 25 years. At the same time the  Russian side hopes that "conditions do not mean that the base is  being rented." Besides, the Russian side proposed that Moscow  exercise direct control over the base.    According to Pavel Grachev, the Armenian side promised to  assist in funding and provision for the Russian military base.</p>

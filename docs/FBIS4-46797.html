			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Ekhanurov, Ukrainian deputy minister of </F> economy: "The Future Belongs to Multinational Companies"]    [Text] Yuriy Ekhanurov, Ukrainian deputy minister of  economy and president of the Small Enterprise Union in weighing  problems concerning the creation of a CIS unified economic space  and the place of our country in it, believes that the future  belongs to multinational companies.    There have already been many declarations. One of them  concerns creation of an economic union of commonwealth  countries, which as is commonly known, Ukraine joined as an  associate member. A lot here is big politics. Economic reality,  however, stubbornly injects its corrections in such agreements  and treaties. It is necessary to take that into account.    When I hear appeals by industrialists (particularly from the  eastern regions) heard from tribunes at conferences and  congresses for the immediate restoration of old ties with former  cooperative partners, which for some reason are often linked  with various forms of protests against active privatization of  state property, I involuntarily feel surprised by the naivete  and the feigned lack of insight by these mature leaders of large  industries.    The economic river is fast-flowing and variable. How is it  possible to seek links with something that no longer exists with  such recklessness? First of all I have in mind the new economy  of our main economic partner, Russia, which is completely  different from what it was yesterday. Totally different  relations, frequently not controlled by decisions at the state,  and certainly, at the interstate level, predominate there. The  new property owner is already functioning in Russia and becoming  more active, a prototype of whom is barely evident in Ukraine.    Still we must hold on to former markets at whatever cost,  inasmuch as we will hardly be able to get a foothold in the next  several years on the new European market with our products,  which lack high quality and competitive ability. It is necessary  to seek ties with Russians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, and other CIS  members, but on a qualitatively new basis.    Structural interrelations among subjects of management in  Russia, for instance, as I have already said, are undergoing  important changes. For instance, tens of industrial-financial  groups are already operating there (whereas we are only talking  about them). Therefore, the question concerning mutual  penetration and amalgamation of capital and, correspondingly,  efforts for attainment of some common goal, is increasingly  becoming the order of the day. Mutual acquisition of "foreign"  property is necessary and inevitable.    Again, because of the outstripping pace of their economic  reforms, the Russians are today ready to sell shares in their  enterprises and financial structures to foreign partners and  purchase foreign shares. We, however, are not ready for this.  Even though I feel confident that the future belongs to  multinational companies.    Thus, whether we want to recognize it or not, there is  simply  no other way for us to engage in normal work and obtain the  possibility of economic integration with the closest, and in the  long range, with presently distant neighbors, other than to  follow the path of immediate radical reforms and mandatory  fulfillment of privatization programs and measures.    We have to create structures as quickly as possible that  would be capable of conducting a policy aimed at assimilation  and protection of markets (i.e. the amalgamation of efforts of  industry and financial capital). It is necessary to develop the  entire market infrastructure with insurance against risk, along  with leasing, holding, and similar forms and organizations  accepted in a market economy.    Before attempting to change something on the outside,  however, it is necessary to create optimal conditions inside the  country for the normal existence, development, and flourishing  of domestic production. Its export possibilities must not be  stifled with thoughtless laws and decrees, but stimulated in  every way. It must be offered the opportunity to get up on its  feet so as to be able to arouse interest in itself primarily  among countrymen, and then among consumers abroad.    According to first quarter results 24 percent of our  enterprises (read every fourth one) are unprofitable. Can they  promise any dividends at all to potential owners of their  potential shares? An absurd question. But it is already on the  agenda in connection with the massive privatization that has  started.    It might turn out that we will yet again fail the  expectations of our people. That cannot be allowed to happen.  The policy must be rigid, but honest and open. People must be  told the truth. They must know that profits, and that means  dividends, may be generated only by effective production. That  is what it will be when an enterprising owner emerges on the  economic arena.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE FROM LITTLE  </P> <P> Jess Bravin's comedy review ("Rich Little Makes a Weak Impression," Nov. 13)  was "right on target."  </P> <P> With an audience composed of citizens who worked diligently to raise funds for  some 40 charities, he should be ashamed of his performance.  </P> <P> In his rote presentation of "old" material, not once did he seem in contact  with his audience. His eyes were closed most of the time. I sincerely doubt he  could find a valid excuse for such a dismal performance.  </P> <P> Bravin was indeed correct about Julie Budd -- she was absolutely marvelous and,  in addition, donated funds from the sale of her new album to the buyer's  charity choice.  </P> <P> Rich Little should have stayed home.  </P> <P> LYNN QUIGLEY  </P> <P> Monarch Beach  </P></p>

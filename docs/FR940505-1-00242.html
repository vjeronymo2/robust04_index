Nonroad registration is proposed to occur every January beginning in 1999. At that time, owners would bring documents representing their equipment to EPA along with a preliminary calculation of the surcharge due, if any. EPA would issue stickers for the equipment in the fleet as well as a certification that the fleet complies for that year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each piece of equipment that falls under the provisions of this section would be required to have an EPA sticker prominently displayed on it to be used or stored (except under certain conditions) in the FIP areas. EPA's regulations describe the size and color of the sticker and its placement. Individual stickers would be issued for each engine document (as described below) that has been reviewed by EPA. The engine documents would be designed to be marked each year in such a way that a fleet owner would be unable to use the same document to obtain two stickers. Documents would also show the name of the equipment owner, and only EPA could reissue documents when ownership is transferred. This system would be set up to limit the potential market for stolen documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The documentation required must include the serial number of the engine, the equipment type, the horsepower rating, and the certified emission standard. For equipment produced after the effective date of this FIP, EPA proposes to require manufacturers to supply the documentation to purchasers just as do vehicle manufacturers. In the case of existing equipment, documentation would be created by EPA based on sworn statements by the owner. The documentation must also include the useful life renewal certificates as described in the rebuild program (for 1999 and later model year nonroad engines that are beyond their original useful life period) and proof that any necessary repairs have been performed by an authorized party for any nonroad engine subject to a recall action. Owners would be required to have documented all engines in their fleet by or during the first year of registration cycle in January 1999. Only those pre-1999 nonroad engines shown in a California fleet in that first year may be re-registered to be used in the FIP areas at any time after 1999. EPA retains the right to conduct physical inspections of the engines or deputize local government agencies to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with onhighway registration programs, stickers will be applied by owners since the equipment could not be brought into the surcharge office. To prevent cheating through the placement of stickers on improper equipment, stickers would be serially numbered and the sticker number recorded on the engine document and on a separate card with all fleet engine serial numbers which would be given to the owner. Stickers would also describe the engine type and serial number. EPA proposes that it or its deputies be able to inspect any site where affected engines are used or stored in the FIP areas and require surrender of such documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing a system based on paper documents. However, a computerized registration data system, similar to the types of registration systems used for onhighway vehicles is possible. Such a system has the potential to minimize transaction problems, assist in title transfers, and reduce problems associated with sole reliance on physical documents. It would also require more resources. EPA is open to working with the California Department of Motor Vehicles to develop such a system and invites comments on its benefits and feasibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This sticker system will apply only to engines operated in the FIP areas. However, the system is proposed to be accessible statewide to accommodate leasing companies which own a significant portion of the nonroad equipment used in the state. New nonroad equipment not meeting the enhanced in-use compliance program requirements will be allowed to be sold even in the FIP areas to accommodate distributors and such leasing companies. EPA plans to monitor sales and will target audits on any FIP area purchaser of significant numbers of non-FIP area equipment. EPA is proposing to require use of only stickered equipment in FIP areas year round. Such a program eases enforcement and is necessary, at least in Los Angeles, to prevent ozone exceedances. Nonstickered equipment will be allowed only if it is being transported through, or out of, the FIP area (and remains in a loaded condition while in the FIP area) or is being stored on an equipment leasing or distributor's lot for later use outside the FIP area. Such lots should not be on or adjacent to any job site in the FIP area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will have the authority to enter premises to inspect equipment, stickers, and other documentation. The unauthorized presence or operation of equipment without an appropriate sticker, the application of a sticker to any engine except the one for which it was designated, the use of false documents to obtain an EPA sticker, or the falsification of any documentation required under this section is strictly prohibited and will be punishable by fines of up to $25,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

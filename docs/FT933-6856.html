			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Wates declines to Pounds 860,000 WATES CITY of London Properties, all of whose properties but one fall within the core of the City, suffered a sharp decline in profits in the six months to June 30 and passed its interim dividend. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 860,000 compared with Pounds 3.74m, in large part because net rental income was Pounds 1.8m lower at Pounds 6.12m. Mr John Nettleton, finance director, explained this was primarily a result of the sale at the end of 1992 of 1-6 Milk Street for Pounds 9.35m and 20 Cannon Street for Pounds 14.2m. These two investment properties, he said, were 'over-rented and old (about 20 years)'. Some time ago Wates decided to concentrate on new developments in the form of joint ventures, Mr Nettleton said, and to this end, Pounds 23m of the proceeds was channelled into the joint ventures and not to pay off debt, which stood at Pounds 95m at the period-end. This has since been reduced by Pounds 12m, almost all of the sale price for Bolsa House, Cheapside, which Wates sold to Tesco earlier this month for Pounds 12.7m, almost 30 per cent above the 1992 year-end valuation. Mr Nettleton said this had excited analysts seeking the seeds of the next property boom. He said that Wates had been weathering the storm for three years now and that he felt some confidence was seeping back into the property market. Administrative expenses fell to Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 1.37m) and management fees received swelled to Pounds 831,000 (Pounds 175,000). Interest payable rose to Pounds 4.66m, though last time's Pounds 3.25m had Pounds 1.2m of capitalised interest stripped out. Earnings declined to 0.44p (1.95p) per share, and Mr Nettleton said the dividend was omitted (0.77p), because of a deficit of about Pounds 20m in the revenue reserve.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 20 (TANJUG) -- Firms founded with  foreign capital in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will have  to adjust by the end of the year their operations to the new law  on foreign investments which was adopted by the Yugoslav  parliament on Thursday [20 May]. Full effect of the law is  expected after the alleviation or lifting of the economic  sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council on May  30, 1992.    As explained by the federal government, the new law is  expected to ensure greater legal security for foreign investors,  grant additional facilities for those who are ready to invest in  the Yugoslav economy and simplify the investment procedure. The  law rules that foreigners can found firms in Yugoslavia, invest  capital in domestic firms, open company branches and buy shares  and concessions for exploitation of natural resourses.    Foreign investors will also be able to import equipment and  materials for building firms in Yugoslavia tax-free. Foreigners  are only not allowed to hold more than 49 percent of the shares  in strategically important branches of industry, such as the  miltiary industry.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 28--Mrs Margaret Alva, Minister of  State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, today said  in the Rajya Sabha that till a court ruling was available, the  Government would abide by the opinion expressed by the former  Attorney General that the Centre and State Governments, not the  Election Commission, were empowered to take action against  officers indicted by the Election Commission on various grounds.    Mrs Alva said this while informing the House during Question  Hour that the Election Commission had moved the Supreme Court,  seeking a ruling on its authority to take disciplinary action  against the officials.    (UNI adds from Pune: The Chief Election Commissioner, Mr  T.N.  Seshan, today warned that the Election Commission would strictly  abide by the ceiling on election expenditure and any candidate  or political party found exceeding the limit would be dealt with  firmly. However, he conceded that the ceiling of Rs 1.5 lakh  [rupees] was low and needed to be raised or abolished.    He also warned that action under the Indian Penal Code would  be initiated against political parties found spending on behalf  of a candidate without his consent.)    Earlier, a section of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha  accused the Centre of protecting officials indicted by the  Election Commission for tardy functioning while on poll-related  duty.    The Election Commission had indicted 28 officials, Mrs Alva  said, and, as per the procedures specified in the service  conduct rules, the concerned Ministries were making preliminary  inquiries to ascertain if regular departmental action was  required against them.    The House was told that after preliminary inquiries, charges  had been dropped against five officials, two had retired,  departmental inquiries were being conducted against two, and  action had been taken against one.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (1): Jobs needed to halt exodus - The impact of industrial transformation in the south, which is linked to Toyko by high-speed rail, is awaited in the more remote prefectures IN 1990, the population of Tohoku, Japan's north-east region, began to increase again. This may sound like a mean accomplishment, but it symbolises the fact that, after decades of sitting on the sidelines of the Japanese economic miracle, Tohoku has finally joined in. Two of the region's southern prefectures - Miyagi and Fukushima - have in recent years received sufficient industrial investment, particularly in the electronics industry, to offer high-quality jobs that encourage young people to stay at home and attract others to return. Gradually the impact of the industrial transformation of southern Tohoku, which is linked to Toyko by the high-speed Shinkansen railway line, is certain to spread to other prefectures in the region which are more remote and isolated. It will not come too soon, because outside of Miyagi and Fukushima, young people continue to leave by the thousands to seek a better life elsewhere. Tohoku is a vast mountainous region that contains some of Japan's most beautiful and unspoilt scenery, and some of its richest farmland. It accounts for nearly 18 per cent of the land area of Japan, but contains just 8 per cent of the population. In the winter cold, wet winds streak across the sea of Japan from the Asian continent and dump piles of snow on the mountains, which has allowed development of some of Japan's best ski resorts. In the summer, Tohoku is spared the worst of the sultry weather that can make life in the capital almost unbearable. Sendai, the seat of Miyagi prefecture, is the region's administrative and economic centre, and is rapidly developing direct air and telecommunications links with the outside world. Government and academic leaders in Sendai are trying to forge the six prefectures of the region (which for some purposes also includes a seventh, Niigata) into an alliance for the co-ordinated development of a network of high-technology research institutes. From Sendai, also the site of Tohoku University, this looks a practical, if long-term, way forward towards establishing the economic independence of Tohoku from the rest of Japan. Yet, for much of the region, this idea looks merely a distant dream. While 14.5 per cent of the working population of Miyagi is employed in primary industry, mainly agriculture, nearly 25 per cent remain on the farm in Aomori to the far north, where there is almost no manufacturing to speak of. The key difference between the various prefectures is the relative development of their transport infrastructure. The mountains that cover most of the region have increased sharply the cost of building roads and railways. Although the region is well served by a network of local trains, high-speed train service is confined to a corridor linking Tokyo, Fukushima, Sendai, and Morioka in Iwate prefecture, which was completed in 1982. Yamagata was this month finally connected to the high-speed railway line by means of a mini-Shinkansen, a high-speed train which runs on wide-gauge tracks but with a narrower car that can pass through older tunnels. Construction of a similar line to link Akita to the network has just begun and should be finished by 1995. Construction of a full trunk line to Aomori is also under way, although this may not be completed until the end of the decade. In the mean time, Akita and Aomori have been desperate to stem the outward flow of young people. 'We want the young people to stay, but three to four thousand are leaving every year,' says Mr Ken-ichi Sunouchi, deputy director-general of planning at the Akita prefectural government. Akita's population peaked in 1960 at 1.35m, and has fallen to 1.23m today. Just over 16 per cent of the population is now over 65 years old, and this is continuing to rise, causing serious concern about the future viability of parts of the economy, particularly agriculture. Akita recently opened an office in Tokyo, and has compiled a list of many thousands of Akita natives living in the capital region. After contacting them, 1,600 have expressed a desire to return to Akita. The prefecture is trying to help them, but the difficulty is finding a job in Akita appropriate to the skill of an educated, experienced employee. Aomori, similarly, is watching 12,000 of its young people leave each year, fully half of the annual school leavers. Prefectural officials cite the lack of appropriate jobs, poor salaries and a dearth of entertainment facilities. Aomori, however, is likely to have to wait a long time before things improve  -until the fast train can cut travel time to Tokyo from 5 1/2 hours to four. In some ways, it is surprising that companies have managed to find so few opportunities to invest in the area, in spite of its relatively poor transporation links. An outstanding exception to this pattern is TDK, the world's largest manufacturer of magnetic tape and ferrite, which maintains its principal manufacturing base in Nikaho, in the southern part of Akita prefecture along the Japan Sea. TDK was founded in 1935 by Mr Kenzo Saito, a local member of parliament, and the company has based its growth principally on the Japanese discovery of ferrite, a magnetic compound produced by a sintering process that is now used in nearly all electronic appliances. TDK has remained in the area ever since, even as it has gradually expanded to be a global manufacturer. Its decision to stay, however, was not a act of charity. Mr Tokujiro Kudo, general manager for the Akita district, admits that the business is somewhat hampered by the distance from its principal customers in central Japan, the higher cost of transport, and slightly higher electricity charges. He says, however: 'The advantages of Akita far outweigh these higher costs.' Akita offers cheap land and lower wage costs. TDK, as the biggest and most sophisticated company in the area, also has its pick of the graduating class. It has never had to cope with the severe shortage of labour that has begun to afflict the central areas of Japan. 'All of Japan is suffering from a labour shortage,' says Mr Kudo. 'But TDK has so many people who want to work here.' However, he also admits that TDK's position in the region carries a big responsibility. The company, its subsidiaries and suppliers employ about 14,500 people, over 10 per cent of the area's population base, and TDK pays for 70 per cent of the Nikaho town budget. Southern Akita probably has no room for another employer like TDK, though it seems amazing that other sophisticated, international companies have not found opportunities in the region. Perhaps, over time, the relatively late development of the Tohoku region will be seen as a blessing. Although Japan has coped remarkably well with the intense overcrowding and concentrated industrial development in the central Kanto and Kansai regions, these are becoming less and less attractive places to live and work. Severe road congestion is chronic everywhere, and ordinary salaried employees can no longer afford to buy a home. Tohoku, by comparison, faces the certain prospect of industrial growth at a time when it is relatively unspoilt and prosperous. It can afford to think about how to preserve an attractive living environment, rather than relegate this to a secondary question after pushing for economic growth at the highest possible speed. This is not to suggest that achieving a balance between development and environmental preservation will prove easy. Conflict between developers and local residents concerned about damage to the environment will certainly persist. The greatest problem facing the region will be the human cost of the transformation of agriculture, where the current farm system of small, inefficient plots looks less and less viable as farmers age and cannot find any successors to till the soil. This problem, faced everywhere in Japan, will be all the more painful in Tohoku, because of the larger relative size of the farm economy. Nevertheless, the pain promises to be eased considerably if, as expected, industrial investment continues at a fast pace, contributing to the further prosperity of the region. Statistics from the ministry of international trade and industry show that over a third of new high-technology factories in Japan between 1978 and 1990 were built in Tohoku. As Japan's manufacturing economy climbs out of its current recession, and as Tohoku's transport infrastructure continues to improve, there is no reason why this trend should not continue.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Denmark to expand job rotation plan: 'Time-off' programme aims to shrink country's long dole queues The Danish government is giving a boost to its already ambitious job rotation programme, which, according to Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, will contribute to a change in the country's social values. The purpose of the programme is to encourage people in work to take time off in order to allow some of the 12.4 per cent (348,000) unemployed to take over the vacant jobs. The scheme began earlier this year when it was used by about 16,000 people. For 1994 the programme has been modified to make it easier to use and to attract more participants. Among other things, it enables parents of small children to take leave of up to a year to stay at home with their young families. Labour offices report enormous interest in the programme. The government is expecting that 20,000-25,000 people, or about 1 per cent of the employed labour force, will use the scheme next year, but it may have underestimated the popularity of the scheme by a wide margin. The Confederation of Danish Trade Unions claims, on the basis of a sample survey, that as many as 240,000 people - more than 10 per cent of the employed labour force - would like to use the scheme. The job-rotation programme gives employees three possibilities for going on leave. Parent leave. This is the most popular scheme, on offer to parents with children under the age of nine. Parents can take six months leave, with an option of extending the period for another six months, while receiving 80 per cent of the maximum unemployment benefit, or about DKr9,000 (Dollars 1,340) per month. A condition is that children under the age of three do not use municipal day-care facilities and children over this age only use them on a half-day basis. Municipal councils can top up the leave payment by a maximum of DKr2,900 a month, which is roughly what the councils save from reduced use of day-care facilities. Job training leave. Employees aged over 25 who have been in work for three of the past five years can take up to a year's leave for job-related education, receiving the maximum unemployment benefit, about DKr11,300 a month. The employer's consent is required. Sabbaticals. Employees can take up to a year off while receiving 80 per cent of the maximum unemployment benefit, but a condition is that someone from the dole queue steps into the vacant job. Private sector employers, especially owners of small companies, have misgivings as they say finding replacements will be difficult and costly in terms of training replacements and reduced productivity.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Cuban beaches empty as refugee ban imposed Beaches near Havana, Cuba's capital, were deserted yesterday after the Cuban authorities reimposed a ban on illegal departures under an immigration accord agreed with the US on Friday. 'The fury seems to have passed,' an Interior Ministry police officer said at a beach at Brisas del Mar, about 18 miles east of Havana. A few days before, Brisas del Mar and Cojimar, another beach near Havana, had been crowded with makeshift rafts and boats as hundreds of refugees set off north across the Straits of Florida. The Cuban authorities gave a 72-hour grace period ending midday yesterday for would-be rafters to give up their attempts. The authorities said force would be used after the deadline if necessary to halt illegal departures by sea to the US.</p>

The full text of  the message is as follows:    With reference to the recent brilliant victories, especially  the recent capture of the Anlung Veng position -- which has cut  off the key center for the disturbances, harassment, and  insecurity caused by the Khmer Rouge, and which has again made  the Siem Reap-Oddar Meanchey region stable and safe for the  people to earn a living -- achieved by all of you, who are the  KRAF's officers and troops, militiamen, policemen, and civil  servants at all levels, and who are currently actively carrying  out the task of defending the innocent people in the region of  Siem Reap-Oddar Meanchey;    On behalf of the RGC and the KRAF co-command, we wish to  most  sincerely and warmly commend all of you for your heroism, which  constitutes a fine model for the cause of defending the  motherland and national security for the Cambodian children of  future generations. We also wish to pay tribute to the souls of  those who have courageously fallen on the battlefield. In  addition, we wish to express our deepest condolences to the  families of those who have died for this sublime cause. The  great sacrifices made by those officers and the rank and file  will be engraved in the golden pages of the national history.    We would also like to wish all of you who are receiving  treatment in hospitals a speedy recovery so you can return  quickly to your families and units.    May you enjoy the five blessings of Lord Buddha, namely,  longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and  enlightenment.

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Cable &amp; Wireless Judging by yesterday's 5 per cent fall in Cable &amp; Wireless shares, the market thinks the telecoms group has lost the sureness of touch demanded of highly rated companies. The irony is that the restructurings announced yesterday for its business service and personal communications network (PCN) divisions appear to make sound commercial sense, even though the accompanying Pounds 50m exceptional provision suggests this year's earnings per share will be slightly lower than the 31p reached last year. Under its chairman, Lord Young, the group has been steadily moving away from the idea that it is a global provider of premium services, partly because competition has forced it to reduce the scope of its ambitions. Arguably, C&amp;W needs a stronger and narrower base from which to compete in the crowded business sector, while yesterday's joint venture with US West in the nascent PCN market both removes a competitor and creates a more powerful threat to cellular operators like Vodafone. Perhaps understandably, the market was more inclined to the view that this latter arrangement has scotched the chance of a deal between Mercury and AT&amp;T. It may be that C&amp;W is paying the price for refining its strategy in public, a notion raised first by the on-off talks with AT&amp;T and more recently by the abrupt departure of a senior manager. On balance, investors are probably right to show scepticism until C&amp;W proves it has recovered its poise.</p>

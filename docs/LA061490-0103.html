			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER MAY BUY DOLLAR RENT A CAR;  </P> <P> AUTOMOBILES: A DEAL WOULD GIVE THE NO. 3 CAR MAKER A CAPTIVE CUSTOMER FOR ITS  PRODUCTS.  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. and Los Angeles-based Dollar Rent A Car are discussing the sale  of Dollar, the nation's largest privately owned auto rental company, to  Chrysler, a well placed source said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I think that discussions are at a fairly advanced stage," said auto analyst  Charles H. Finnie of Alex. Brown &amp; Co., a Baltimore investment company.  Another source said, "It's just a matter of time."  </P> <P> Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on the reports.  </P> <P> A source who declined to be identified said Dollar would be worth somewhere  between $70 million and $90 million.  </P> <P> If the transaction is consummated, it would follow a trend of transforming the  auto rental industry into a distribution system for the nation's auto makers,  giving them captive customers for their cars.  </P> <P> "The auto rental firms are coveted by the auto makers because they are the  largest buyers of cars," Finnie said. Such deals give the auto makers a place  to sell cars even when individual sales decline, he added. Dollar, which  purchases between 70,000 and 80,000 cars annually, has been using mostly  General Motors cars.  </P> <P> Ford owns a portion of Hertz Corp., the nation's largest car rental company,  and has also invested in Budget Rent A Car. General Motors has invested in  National Car Rental System and Avis. And Chrysler already owns Thrifty  Rent-A-Car Inc., which it bought last July for $263 million. Five days later,  Thrifty bought Snappy Car Rental for $40 million.  </P> <P> Dollar, which has 762 locations in the United States and 550 outside the  country, is largely a franchising company and owns only about 10% of its  locations. It has a fleet of 82,000 vehicles, with 57,000 in the United States  and the rest overseas.  </P> <P> According to Automotive Fleet magazine, Dollar is the sixth-largest U.S. rental  car company in terms of total revenue, including that taken in by franchisees.  </P> <P> Dollar Rent A Car was founded in 1966 by Henry J. Caruso as Dollar A Day with a  fleet of 18 Volkswagens operating from one location in downtown Los Angeles.  Within a year, Caruso had opened another five branches in Los Angeles, and the  company's first airport site was at the Burbank Airport. The company then began  selling franchises nationwide.  </P> <P> It is believed that Caruso, who is in his 60s, "has reached the point in his  life where he wants to quit working," Finnie said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE RENTAL-CAR MARKET  </P> <P> Chart shows how rental-car companies share the industry's estimated 1989  revenue of $6.11 billion (business and leisure rentals only).  </P> <P> Hertz: $1.53 billion  </P> <P> Avis: $1.3 billion  </P> <P> Budget: $ 920 milllion  </P> <P> National: $825 Million  </P> <P> Other: $160 million  </P> <P> American Int'l. $175  </P> <P> General, $235 million  </P> <P> Dollar, $255 million  </P> <P> Alamo, $525 million  </P></p>

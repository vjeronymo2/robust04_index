			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bowater loss blamed on poor prices BOWATER, the US newsprint manufacturer, has incurred a Dollars 20.9m fourth-quarter net loss, which it blamed on poor prices in its main markets. It forecast that 1993 would be better than last year, but still difficult. The loss, which worked through at 59 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 398.9m, compared with income of Dollars 1.6m, or 2 cents, on sales of Dollars 325.9m in the same 1991 period. For 1992 as a whole, the company suffered a net loss of Dollars 82m, or Dollars 2.34 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.49bn, against net income of Dollars 45.6m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.29bn in 1991. The 1992 results are not directly comparable with the previous year, since they include Great Northern Paper, which Bowater bought at the end of 1991. Mr AP Gammie, chairman, said newsprint prices remained at unprofitable levels, while currency problems and the economic slowdown in Europe had resulted in a significant drop in market pulp export prices.</p>

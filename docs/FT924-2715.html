			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Accountancy firms fall short of standards MANY ACCOUNTANCY firms are failing to comply with the audit requirements introduced last year, the first annual report of their self-regulatory body shows. Only 11 of the 158 audit firms so far randomly inspected passed all 13 tests devised by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Joint Monitoring Unit, the regulatory body jointly owned by the three UK chartered accountancy bodies. The findings come in a confidential internal report due to be sent today to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for consideration by officials before publication next week. The report emphasises that most of the 10,200 registered firms have taken steps to comply with the audit regime introduced in October 1991, and that it is too soon to make a definitive statement on the quality of work carried out. The Joint Monitoring Unit unearthed widespread failures in the systems and procedures that the regulations require. Its findings will fuel criticism of the present quality of auditing. The unit visited 291 firms in the 12 months to September - meeting its targets - of which 143 were to prepare for registration, to offer training or in response to requests. Of the remainder, which were randomly selected during April to September, 67 firms were not conducting 'cold' or continuous reviews of their audit work as required by the regulations. The audit procedures of 39 were not subject to quality control procedures and 41 had not planned their audits. The unit emphasised that the findings might indicate inadequate documentation at least as much as unsatisfactory audits. It also judged 10 firms not to be independent from their audit clients, and identified nine that were not competent. The professional accountancy bodies have refused to register at least 12 firms or practitioners as auditors, and have so far withdrawn registration from 10. They received more than 183 complaints during the year. The report concludes: 'The weaknesses thus far identified do not appear to indicate any general shortfall in the quality of audit work but do demonstrate in many cases procedural shortfalls.' It recommends making audit regulation more economical and more rapid in the future, and says that more meaningful ways of analysing data from monitoring visits to firms need to be developed. It says many firms believe that audit regulation was introduced in response to a few prominent company collapses, and are concerned at the high cost of the new regime. Audit registration fees received from firms are expected to be about Pounds 4m this year, against expenditure on regulation and the Auditing Practices Board of Pounds 3.6m this year and Pounds 3.5m in the previous three years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The 1994 work for placing Army officers  transferred to civilian work is about to begin. On 23 May in  Shenyang, the provincial authorities held a meeting on placement  of Army officers transferred to civilian work to relay the  guidelines of the national meeting on placement of Army officers  transferred to civilian work and to arrange for the province's  work in placing such officers. [passage omitted]    Liaoning has always been a province placing relatively more  Army officers transferred to civilian work. Last year, the  province satisfactorily fulfilled the task of placing 5,400  transferred Army officers and 590 spouses of such officers, and  95 percent of such officers were trained to improve their  adaptability and professional skills. By combining the placement  of transferred Army officers with the endeavor of facilitating  the "second pioneering program," the province witnessed a  remarkable increase in the number of the transferred Army  officers who were working for state-owned enterprises,  foreign-invested enterprises, and township-, town-, district-,  and neighborhood-run enterprises; who initiated economic  entities; and who sought employment by themselves. Of them, 177  officers were self-employed, surpassing the total sum over the  past 15 years since the commencement of reform and opening up.  This year, the province has been assigned with the task of  placing 3,700 Army officers transferred to civilian work. Of  them, the officers below the age of 40 account for 77 percent,  officers having received the education of specialized secondary  school, college, and institutions of even higher levels account  for 59 percent, and the officers mastering various kinds of  skills account for 25 percent.    On behalf of the provincial group for placement of Army  officers transferred to civilian work, Xiao Zuofu summarized  last year's situation in placing transferred Army officers and  set demands for this year's work. He pointed out: Party  committees and governments at all levels should, with a high  degree of the sense of political responsibility, conscientiously  accomplish the task of placing Army officers transferred to  civilian work, should make great efforts to maintain the  stability and continuity of the related policies, and should  actively explore the new ways of appropriately placing such  officers under the condition of the socialist market economy.  With emphasis on the first line of economic construction, such  officers should be primarily transferred to judicial and public  security departments, industrial and commercial departments, tax  departments, and financial departments. In particular, such  officers should be guided to work for enterprises and the places  they are needed. This year, the above-mentioned departments  should fill their vacant positions with such officers on a  priority basis, and the proportion of such officers should not  be less than 15 percent of their personnel increase quota.  Other departments should also fill their vacant positions with  the Army officers transferred to civilian work on a priority  basis. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The logic of occupiers is the same whatever pretexts  they might use to express their ideas. Former Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Shamir said he wanted peace, but peace in  return for peace. This means peace, plus the Arab territories  Israel occupies.    For his part, current Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  has announced that he wants peace, but he wants peace without  any commitment to comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan. This  means he wants Syria to give him peace, without committing  himself to abandoning occupied Syrian territory.    Strangely, Rabin accuses Syria of not being ready for peace,  as if peace is something detached from the Israeli occupation  and the UN resolutions, especially Resolution 242, which says  acquisition of land by force is illegal.    The U.S. initiative that launched the peace process in  Madrid, and then in the Washington talks, considered  implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 the  basis for reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the region  in accordance with the principle of exchanging land for peace.  This exchange does not mean part of the land. It means all of  the occupied land. This cannot be subject to bargaining under  any security, political, or interest pretexts.    If Israel really wants peace and does not want to obstruct  the implementation of the U.S. initiative, it would have  approved the principle of comprehensive withdrawal from the  Golan in return for full peace. But Israel does not want peace  unless it is subject to its expansionist logic. This is what  Rabin recently stated openly when he said he is not prepared to  pledge full withdrawal from the Golan to Syria. Who, then, is  responsible for stalemating the peace talks and for the lack of  progress in the peace process? Is it not Israel, whose leaders  sometimes speak about conditional peace, and at other times  about withdrawal from the Golan or about secret talks to abort  the Madrid and Washington talks?    Mixing the cards with Syria will not take place as Rabin  hopes because Syria stands with a peace in which it will never  relinquish a grain of its national soil. This fact was  emphasized by President Hafiz al-Asad during the summit he held  in Geneva with President Clinton, who in turn stressed the U.S.  commitment to realize a just and comprehensive peace.    After the U.S. emphasis of its commitment to the peace  process, and in light of the Israeli positions that obstruct the  implementation of the U.S. initiative, the Israeli leaders stick  to the logic of occupier, thus rendering U.S. credibility  hollow, especially because Rabin knows, more than anyone else,  that the answer he gave to U.S. Secretary of State Christopher  during his latest visit to Israel was the main reason for the  stalemating of the peace talks.</p>

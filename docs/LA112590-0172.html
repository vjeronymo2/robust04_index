			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN ONOFRE;  </P> <P> MOTOR PROBLEM SHUTS DOWN REACTOR  </P> <P> A reactor at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was shut down because of  a problem with the electrical supply for a motor that operates control rods, a  utility spokesman said Saturday. Plant operators noticed the problem at noon  Friday and gradually reduced the power level in the unit until it was shut down  at 9:28 p.m., said Southern California Edison spokesman Dave Barron.  </P> <P> The utility expected to have the 1,100-megawatt unit running again by Monday  morning. "It's not a serious problem. We'll probably get it fixed by the end of  the weekend," Barron said. Even if the problem continues into the week, there  is no risk of a power shortage in Southern California, he said. The plant on  the coast between Los Angeles and San Diego has three reactors. One has been  closed down for some time, and the third is operating at normal levels, he  said.  </P></p>

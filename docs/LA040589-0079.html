			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HAITI REGIME BOWS TO PRESSURE, DEPORTS 3 WHO LED COUP MOVE  </P> <P> The government bowed to pressure from mutinous soldie1 rs and said Tuesday that  it has released from jail and deported three army officers who tried to  overthrow Haiti's leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.  </P> <P> Rebels surrendered control of the international airport, which reopened Tuesday  for the first time since Sunday's coup attempt.  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy here said there no longer appeared to be any active resistance  in the army to the government.  </P> <P> "I think there's no doubt that President Avril is completely in control now,"  said embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde. "There are no signs of a continuation of  the coup attempt against him."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3 Coup Leaders  </P> <P> A government communique identified the three alleged coup conspirators as Lt.  Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the Leopards Battalion; Col. Phillipe Biamby,  commander of the Presidential Guard; and Col. Leonce Qualo, an administrative  officer at army headquarters.  </P> <P> The government accused Rebu, Biamby and Qualo of a "foolhardy" attempt to  overthrow the government but said Avril has "magnanimously" decided to free  them from arrest on humanitarian grounds.  </P> <P> The communique, read on state-run television, said the three were given safe  passage to the United States and were driven Monday night to the Dominican  Republic border for a flight out. Rebu was accompanied by his wife and four  children.  </P> <P> Independent Radio Haiti-Inter said Tuesday that the Leopard Battalion has  accepted its new commander, Col. Lionel Claude -- a strong indication the  insurgency had ended.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crossed Border at Dawn  </P> <P> In Santo Domingo, Foreign Ministry sources said the Haitians crossed the border  at dawn. It was not known how long they would remain in the country before  flying to the United States.  </P> <P> Release of the coup leaders was seen mainly as an attempt to appease soldiers  of the elite, 300-man Leopard Battalion, who were demanding freedom for Rebu,  their commander.  </P> <P> At least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion were killed Monday in  skirmishes with troops loyal to Avril. The rebels briefly seized control of  national television Monday before being evicted by the Presidential Guard, and  they held the airport until late Monday night.  </P> <P> The airport was reopened Tuesday, but all commercial flights into the country  had been canceled earlier.  </P> <P> Schools remained closed, but most stores in Port-au-Prince, the capital, were  opened by midday Tuesday, and traffic was picking up steadily.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo -- The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee held a  meeting at the New Sanno U.S. Forces Center in Minato-ku, Tokyo  on 16 June. In the meeting, committee members agreed to  establish a "task force" under the Special Committee on  Facilities [SCF] to deal with the issue concerning the return of  Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. The task force will be composed of  working-level officials from the U.S. Forces Headquarters in  Japan, the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and the Defense Facilities  Administration Agency [DFAA]. It will discuss technical matters  about the issue of providing U.S. forces with a substitute for  the airfield, and the possibility of removing Sobe  communications site, which is adjacent to the airfield, to  another place. Commenting on the establishment of the task  force, DFAA Director General Ichiro Yoneyama said: "I hope it  will work for the return of the airfield." The task force is  scheduled to hold its first meeting before the end of June.    DFAA Facilities Coordination Officer Akira Sato has been  appointed Japanese chairman of the task force. The Foreign  Ministry is currently looking for suitable officials for members  of the force. Colonel Malepoty [name as published], SCF  chairman, is in charge of selecting U.S. members. It is  expected that about 20 Japanese and U.S. officials will be  picked as task force members before the first meeting is held.    U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner recently visited  Japan to attend a meeting of the Consultative Committee of  Japan- U.S. Security. On that occasion, Wisner and Yoneyama  agreed that "developed communications technology may make the  current vast radio wave buffer zone unnecessary." Thus, the  task force is expected to look for a substitute for Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield, and to discuss in detail technical aspects  of two possible measures to return the airfield to the locality  -- one is removing Sobe communications facilities to other site  and the other is reducing the size of the buffer zone.    With the establishment of the task force, the existing "task  force to study removal of parachute training area at Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield" was dissolved. This task force was  established in 1982 to survey suitable land for a substitute.  It has proposed several sites as a substitute. The results of  the survey will be given to the new task force.    In recent years, problems concerning the return of Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield, the return of Naha Military Port, and the  suspension of live shell firing exercises across highway 104  have drawn attention as three pending issues. The establishment  of the new task force is expected to help make progress in  solving the airfield issue.    Meanwhile, Joint Committee members also agreed on the return  of a 16,000-square-meter lot located east of Camp Kuwae, which  Chatan town has demanded to construct a health center there.</p>

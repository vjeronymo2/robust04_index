			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / European airlines cut fares from US EUROPEAN airlines yesterday cut their ticket prices between Europe and the US in response to a transatlantic price war which broke out among US air carriers earlier this week. Lufthansa, the German state airline, Swissair and British Airways cut prices on flights from the US to match those made earlier this week by Delta, American Airlines, United Airlines and others. KLM, the Dutch airline, said it was were reviewing its pricing policy. This is latest round in the fight for market share on the world's most competitive long-haul route. It was initiated on Monday by the third biggest US carrier, Delta Airlines, whose larger rivals, United Airlines and American Airlines, quickly followed suit. Continental Airlines has also matched most of the lower fares. The reductions are on higher-priced tickets, including first and business class. Lufthansa's New York-Frankfurt business class return ticket is Dollars 772 cheaper at Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,098.9). These are for the summer season only, so travel must start by September 30 and finish by October 14. Transatlantic traffic has been healthy in recent weeks, especially by comparison with slack domestic US demand. But the growth in traffic between the US and Europe has been largely leisure travellers buying cut-price tickets. The Delta move was intended to stimulate business traffic. US carriers have been price-cutting heavily on domestic US routes since April, when American Airlines cut business fares and created a simplified ticket structure on its domestic routes. The price war has come at a time when air travel is beginning to pick up after a slump induced by the recession and the Gulf war. Six of the world's top 10 airlines have lost money over the past two years and with price cuts now have little hope of returning to profit this year. The price war triggered by Delta caught its competitors by surprise. 'We're puzzled and totally perplexed by Delta's move because advance bookings to Europe have been very strong,' said United on Tuesday. Delta cut fares by up to 45 per cent on business, first-class and full-price economy ticket.</p>

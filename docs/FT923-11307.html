			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Brussels stages some summer attractions  -Why investors in Belgian stocks should not go on holiday just yet THE Belgian government is about to thrash out the 1993 budget, a court ruling on minority shareholders' rights is expected shortly, and powerful institutions are vying for control of one of the country's biggest banks. It is probably unwise, therefore, for investors in Belgian equities to pack up for their summer holidays just yet. A drop of 6.7 per cent in the Brussels Bel-20 index to 1,134.06 this week reflected the fall on global markets, the index having come off its 1992 peak of 1,235.40 reached on June 2 on fears of higher interest rates. This was accompanied by an improvement in volume, whereas it was depressed elsewhere in Europe. Although Belgium is suffering from the same interest rate malaise as the rest of Europe, analysts believe that the bourse could outperform its continental counterparts in the coming months. Dillon Read's half-year analysis cites 'Belgium's de facto integration into the economies of the D-mark bloc and the country's rock solid commitment to the EC' as factors underpinning the Belgian franc and, the bond and stock markets. Tugging against this tentative optimism is the prospect of another season of gloomy results from Belgium's cyclical industrial companies. Most interim results are due at the end of August and in early September, but investors will benefit from some pre-season training next Thursday, when Solvay, Belgium's largest chemicals company, releases its figures. Caution ahead of the results season is understandable. The market's bouts of enthusiasm for cyclical stocks over the last 18 months - often fuelled by over-optimistic company statements - have mostly been disappointed. 'We're looking at a very gradual economic recovery,' says Mr Guy Lerminiaux, an analyst with Dewaay. 'Industrial companies have profited from restructuring, and they've all cut back on expenditure. But the feeling is that after some optimism in the first quarter we could now see some underperformance in cyclical stocks.' Analysts are therefore focusing on defensive stocks, such as banks and retailers. The retail sector - namely Gib, Delhaize and Colruyt - was the market's success story in the first quarter. Gib has sustained the rally, taking further steps towards realising the value of its Quick hamburger restaurant chain, and continuing to improve its domestic retailing operation. By contrast, enthusiasm for Delhaize has waned in recent months, as the weak dollar and difficult trading conditions have taken their toll on the group's extensive US operations. Over the next few weeks, however, investors will be more interested in developments in the following three areas which could have a longer-lasting influence on the stock market: The 1993 budget. Last April the new government stitched together a stringent 'emergency' budget for 1992. The austerity package drew criticism at home, but although his government is under some political pressure, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, is expected to take an equally hard line on cutting expenditure for 1993. The Wagons-Lits court ruling. The Brussels court is expected to decide early next month whether Accor, the French hotels group, and Societe Generale de Belgique, the holding company, gained effective control of the Franco-Belgian tourism group when they bought a stake in the summer of 1990. The two companies have since mounted a successful bid for Wagons-Lits at a lower price. If the court rules that control did change hands, then the companies will probably have to buy out disgruntled minority shareholders at the original, higher price. Some of the evidence in the hearing was so convoluted that it seems unlikely the decision will be that simple. Nonetheless, brokers are hoping the ruling will inject much-needed legal certainty into the vaguely-worded Belgian takeover rules. The wooing of Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL). Internationale Nederlanden (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance group, wants a commercial partnership with the Belgian bank and has built a 10 per cent stake in the group. The outcome hinges on the attitude of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), which controls nearly 25 per cent of BBL and also heads a long-standing syndicate of BBL's main shareholders. Mr Albert Frere, the head of GBL, is said to favour a partnership with a domestic bank, but some analysts believe he is holding out for a higher price. He appears to want BFr4,000 a share but analysts reckon the bank is worth BFr3,000 a share. The market is hedging its bets: BBL is trading at around BFr3,500. A solution may not emerge until the end of the year when GBL's right to first refusal of other syndicate members' stakes in BBL is due to expire. However, vacationing shareholders should still keep one eye on the bourse since Mr Frere's holiday plans are unknown.</p>

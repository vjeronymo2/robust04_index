Setup of Various Categories of Markets </H5>   Along with the gradual setup of the socialist market  economic  system, the municipality made bigger strides in building the  markets for various production factors. The data compiled from  the survey on various categories of markets showed that a market  system preliminarily took shape in the municipality.    The municipality made a breakthrough in setting up the  markets for means of production. Sixty-five general markets for  means of production were set up with an annual transaction  volume of 5.86 billion yuan, an increase of 25.8 percent. More  than 90 percent of means of production were distributed. The  setup of the petroleum exchange centers and the commodity  exchange centers, that are operated according to the  international practice, indicated the municipality entered a new  stage of setting up the markets for means of production.  Simultaneously, the municipality also entered the stages of  building or planning to build large-sized markets for means of  production, such as coal, building materials, metals, and  vehicles.    The municipality began to build monetary markets.  Forty-eight financial organs across the municipality got  involved in market activities. The negotiable securities trade  volume reached 15.17 billion yuan, an increase of 61.2 percent  over 1992. Of this, the stock trade volume reached 6.42 billion  yuan, an increase of 1550 percent.

The Opening of the Municipality to the Outside World as </H5> Well as the Setup of Development Zones, Small Industrial Zones,  and Science and Technology Park Zones    The year 1993 was a year when the municipality made a  breakthrough in using foreign capital. A total of 3,752  foreign-funded enterprises of three types were newly approved  during the year, an increase of 70 percent over the previous  year and equal to the total figure in the previous 14 years.  The foreign capital introduced according to agreements totaled  $6.23 million, an increase of 430 percent and much higher than  the accumulated figure in the previous 14 years, totaling $3.96  million. Some 7,500 foreign-funded enterprises of three types  were approved and more than $10 billion were brought in. In  1993, $2.85 billion foreign capital were really used, accounting  for 31 percent of the total planned figure.    Of the "three-typed" projects approved in 1993, the number  of  large-sized projects each involving moreo than $10 million  doubled or redoubled and reached 200. Due to the stimulus by  large projects, the scale of these projects averaged at  $2,770,000 and each project used $167.4 million foreign capital  on average, respectively increasing by 120 percent and 150  percent over the previous year. More than 20 trans-national  companies made investment and ran plants in Beijing, and there  were more than 60 international famous companies in Beijing.    Development zones and small industrial zones developed  healthily and became new economic growth points. As of the end  of 1993, the municipality had 33 development zones, small  industrial zones, and science and technology park zones of  various categories which were established with the approvals of  the State Council and the municipal government. Some 277.35  square kilometers of land were covered in the plan for  clarifying the categories of land which should be used to build  the zones of these three types. So far, 26 development zones  and small industrial zones have entered the stages of building  infrastructural facilities. A total of 1,374 projects entered  these zones (excluding the new-tech industrial development  experimental zone). Investment in these projects totaled 18.15  billion yuan; registered capital totaled 9.94 billion yuan, of  which 5.43 billion yuan was invested by the foreign side; and  contracted amount of foreign funds was $1.25 billion, of which  40 percent, or $500 million, was brought in. Some enterprises  and products of the zones entered the world market and played a  fairly good exemplary and leading role. Enterprises completed  and commissioned in the development zone and small industrial  zones created 950 million yuan in output value in 1993, created  1.52 billion yuan in sales income, earned a profit of 80 million  yuan, and paid 50 million yuan of taxes.    The three development zones subordinate to the  municipality--the Beijing Economic and Technological Development  Zone, the Beijing Xisanqi New Building Material Industrial  Development Zone, and the Wangfujing Commercial Zone--provided  projects for investment. These projects brought in 10.2 billion  yuan of investment, their registered capital totaled 4.85  billion yuan, and the contracted amount of foreign capital was  $670 million. Development in bringing in foreign investment  remained vigorous.    The Beijing Municipal New-Tech Industrial Development  Experimental Zone continued the high-speed development. By the  end of 1993, 3,768 technological enterprises had registered with  the zone, of which 700 were foreign-funded enterprises of the  three types. These enterprises employed 75,000 people, of whom  more than two-thirds had a college education level or higher.  They developed over 4,500 new technology and new products in  the year, and over 1,600 of them were put into mass production.  A number of high- and new-tech achievements leading in the  world were directly transformed into productive forces to  produce good social and economic benefits. In 1993, the  experimental zone's income from technological and industrial  production and foreign trade exceeded 10 billion yuan, and its  profit totaled 800 million yuan, both ranking first in China's  new-tech industrial experimental zones.  <H5>  7. Living Standard, Prices </H5>   Living standard was further improved. The annual total wage  of incumbent staff members and workers was 20.25 billion yuan,  up 27.8 percent from the preceding year. Workers' average wage  increased by 28.3 percent over the preceding year, or 7.8  percent when allowing for price rises. Peasants' per capita net  income showed an increase of 18.2 percent over the preceding  year, or 5.1 percent when allowing for price rises. Urban and  rural people's large durable consumer goods continued to  increase. Every 100 urban families had 107.2 color television  sets, 45.6 video recorders, and 82.4 cameras, up 5.7, 9.4, and  6.7 percent, respectively, from the preceding year; and every  100 rural families had 56 color television sets, 47  refrigerators, and 76 washing machines, up 21.7, 17.5, and 4.1  percent, respectively.    Price reform was accelerated. To meet the needs in  developing the socialist market economy, Beijing further  accelerated the price reform in 1993. It lifted the price  control on grain, edible oil, and their products in the year and  basically decontrolled the prices of all major consumer goods,  except for fuels, thus playing a positive role in balancing the  price relations and enlivening commodity distribution. Thanks  to larger demands and increased production cost, workers's cost  of living price index rose by 19 percent in the year, and the  retail price index rose by 16.9 percent. The price index  registered an increase of 20.7, 9.2, and 16.6 percent,  respectively, in food, clothes, and articles for daily use; a  decline of 0.3 percent in cultural and recreational commodities;  and an increase of 15.1, 10.7, and 57.3 percent, respectively,  in medicine and medical goods, building materials, and fuels.  The price index of services rose by 33.8 percent.    Savings deposits of urban and rural residents continued to  increase substantially. By the end of 1993, saving deposits of  urban and rural residents amounted to 56.07 billion yuan, an  increase of 44.2 percent over the figure at the beginning of  that year. Of this figure, savings deposits of urban residents  amounted to 48.25 billion yuan, up 46.6 percent, and those of  peasants amounted to 7.82 billion yuan, up by 31.2 percent.    New headway was made in residential construction. In 1993,  construction of 18.083 million square meters of residences were  started or restored, an increase of 4.9 percent over the  previous year, and construction of 61.41 million square meters  were completed. In 1993, 135 small residential districts were  under construction in the municipality, with the areas whose  construction was started or restored reaching 12.634 million  square meters. Of them, 10 small residential districts newly  started construction in 1993, with a total floor space of  994,000 square meters. In 1993, construction of three small  residential districts was completed, with a total construction  area of 500,000 square meters. By the end of 1993, 15 small  dangerous residential districts were under rebuilding, with a  total construction area of 3.555 million square meters, of  which, 790,000 square meters were completed, newly settling  9,500 households, and resettling 3,600 households. In line with  the "Beijing programs for well-off-type residences projects,"  the municipality built 100,000 square meters of well-off-type  residences, 8,000 square meters were made available, enabling  some specially difficult households to moved to new residences.  The people's housing conditions improved further. The per  capita share of housing acreage of urban residents was 12.5  square meters, and that of peasants was 23.7 square meters.  <H5>  8. Population </H5>   Population growth continued to be put under control.  According to the statistics by the household registration  departments, by the end of 1993, the municipality's population  with household registration came to 10.512 million, 63,000 more  than the figure at the beginning of 1993. Of them,  non-agricultural population numbered 6.687 million, 124,000 more  than the figure at the beginning of 1993. According to the  sample survey of the changes in population, the birth rate of  permanent population was 9.35 per thousand, up by 0.13  permillage points over the previous year, and the death rate was  6.16 per thousand, 0.05 permillage points higher than the  previous year, resulting in a natural population growth rate of  3.19 per thousand, 0.08 permillage points higher than the  previous year.    Along with the all-around development of the work, the  municipality also met some difficulties and problems in 1993.  Relatively conspicuous ones included: Construction funds  remained insufficient, construction of basic facilities still  lagged behind the demand of accelerating the development of the  capital, economic efficiency of some state-owned enterprises  declined, increase margin of commodity prices was on the high  side, and some low-income households still had difficulties with  daily life.

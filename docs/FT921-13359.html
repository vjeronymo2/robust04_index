			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Borland The computer industry has had more than its share of glamour stocks. So when a group such as Borland International, the California-based software company, pauses for breath, the inevitable question is whether it might be about to fall from grace. Given that its shares have risen more than eight-fold in the last two years, Borland has a long way to fall. Whereas a year ago its third quarter results sent the shares up by more than 10 per cent, yesterday they fell 6 per cent on confirmation that earnings were flat thanks only to a one-off tax credit. The slowdown can be blamed on the Dollars 430m friendly acquisition last summer of Ashton-Tate, a rival which was falling apart in such classic fashion that some observers doubted it was worth rescuing. Ashton-Tate's strength in the market for databases gave Borland a full range of products with which to tackle competitors such as Lotus. But in the short term, the effect has been to load the group with restructuring costs totalling Dollars 116m. Although Borland has set about integrating Ashton-Tate with impressive speed, the real test will come in its next financial year when it expects to start growing again. In the meantime, shareholders face a dilemma. Borland's determination to compete with the biggest in the business has caused its shares to lag the recent rise in software stocks both in the US and the UK. Micro Focus, for example, has risen 40 per cent since early December. But if it pulls it off, the really big returns may yet lie ahead. Perhaps investors should hedge their bets like some of Borland's own directors and sell part of their holdings.</p>

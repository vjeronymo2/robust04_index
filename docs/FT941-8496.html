			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / An opportunity to trade out of trouble: Insurance market reforms which could benefit Names Followers of Lloyd's of London will become increasingly familiar with an ugly word during the next two years as the insurance market presses ahead with its strategy to modernise its capital base. 'Assignability' - the rights of the Names whose assets traditionally support the market to transfer or trade their participation on syndicates - is one of the reforms on the agenda of a new 10-strong committee, the Value Group. The group will also examine ways that Names can be given pre-emption rights  -allowing them the opportunity to increase their share on a syndicate if its management chooses to increase its capacity and underwrite more business. Once answers to these issues have been found, a market in syndicate participations could be set up. On the basis of the supply and demand it should be possible to give value to participations. The possibility of selling their participations in syndicates might allow Names to raise funds, allowing them to raise the extra capital needed to participate as limited-liability investors. Alternatively, Names could use the money to settle outstanding liabilities and withdraw from the market. This latter option could help Lloyd's in its efforts to set up a new reinsurance company, NewCo, into which it aims to transfer all assets and liabilities for business underwritten before 1986. As part of its preparatory work for NewCo, which is to be set up by the end of 1995, Lloyd's is assessing the adequacy of reserves held by all syndicates to meet these so-called 'old-year' liabilities. Some syndicates may be asked to make calls on Names to increase their reserves. It is clearly possible that some hard-pressed Names could generate funds for this purpose by the sale of their participations on other syndicates. Meanwhile, the group, led by Mr Robert Hiscox, the market's deputy chairman, will also examine ways in which Lloyd's can more successfully manage its capacity in the future, in order to avoid the kind of rate competition that plunged it into loss in the late 1980s. One of the ways it could do this is by 'risk weighting': adjusting solvency ratios - the ratio between capital and premium income - in line with the riskiness of particular lines of business. Among other ideas likely to come under consideration are: Rule changes allowing corporate Names to own a majority or possibly all the participations on a syndicate. At present any one corporate Name can account for no more than 25 per cent of a syndicate's capacity, while corporate capital in general must account for no more than 50 per cent of a syndicate's capacity. One-year accounting. Two years ago, Lloyd's rejected the idea of changing its present system of accounting for results three years in arrears. However, there is some pressure from corporate investors for this to change. The introduction of two-year accounting is regarded as a strong possibility in the medium term, while some agencies may decide independently to account on an annual basis. If this were to occur the individual syndicates at Lloyd's could present their results independently - much as companies do - and Lloyd's might dispense with presenting its results on a global basis. Each of these ideas indicates that after the successful introduction this year of corporate capital - trading on a limited liability basis - the market's management is determined to change the character of its capital base. As Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said recently: 'Last year will seem tame to what we are preparing for 1994.'</p>

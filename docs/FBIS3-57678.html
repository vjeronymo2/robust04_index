			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek January 28 TASS -- Kyrgyz President Askar  Akayev issued today an appeal to the Kyrgyz people entitled "I  am guiltless before people and before my own conscience." He  took this step in connection with a referendum, scheduled for  January 30, which should give an answer to the question: Can the  president continue to discharge his duties or not? The reason  for the referendum is that the Kyrgyz Constitution, adopted on  May 5, made illegitimate all branches of power existing in the  republic, which was used as a pretext by the forces opposing  Akayev. As a politician, the president decided to resolve the  problem with the help of a nationwide referendum.    Akayev explained the essence of his policy in the appeal. He  maintains that "now the majority of people in our republic and  all political forces favour a market-based economy, economic  freedom for the strong and social protection for the week."  Despite a rather difficult economic situation in the republic  and the continuing decline of living standards, the president  believes that "solid economic preconditions have been created  for the people to feel the first accomplishments, brought by our  economic reform, in 1994, for us to start living just a little  better."    "If the Kyrgyz people support me at the popular referendum,  I  shall stick to the policy of reform, the policy which will  ensure, in the long run, the well-being of our people and the  prosperity of the republic," Akayev stressed in the appeal.</p>

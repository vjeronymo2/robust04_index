			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by XINHUA reporter Yang Ning (2799 1337): </F> "Administrators of Research Institutes Should Work Not As  `Housekeeper' But `Catalyst'"]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- A major task for  increasing the popularization rate of scientific research  results is to reform the science and technology management  system so administrators can bring research results from the  archives office and market them at trading or auction centers.    Recently a famous Beijing university successively released  and printed in booklets, three batches of fruits from several  hundred scientific research projects. However, the university  only listed research project titles and technology transfer fees  in the booklets, without making any substantive effort to  transfer technology. Such a passive work style plus expensive  technology transfer fees, which was beyond the budget of units  urgently in need of technology, resulted in very few  technologies transferred.    It is understood that China currently has 17.6 million  scientific and technical personnel. They complete over 10,000  province- or department-funded research projects and turn out  some 20,000 patents annually. However, only 15 percent of the  research results are put into application, and even fewer are  used extensively by more than one unit.    The gradual establishment of a socialist market economic  structure poses a new challenge to China's science and  technology management system. In the past, science and  technology management departments made inventory of research  results, evaluated or awarded them, and locked them up in  archives offices. Such a practice is incompatible with the  development of the market economy. Research fruits should be  put into markets, circulated, and exchanged as commodities. As  enterprises shop in markets for suitable technologies,  scientists will direct their research and development to meet  market demands. Therefore, research institute administrators  should look squarely at the reality and change their perception  of management in certain ways.    According to experts, administrators should not only make  good inventory of, but also effectively manage research results.  In managing research results, administrators should work as  agents, conducting market survey and forecast to match buyers  with sellers, and working as a catalyst to transactions by  providing information service. At present there are many  unauthorized agents with all kinds of qualifications. Quite a  few are swindlers, and only a handful are professionals with  real science and technology information and expertise in  technology transfer. Since Chinese research institutes already  have an edge in this regard, they should set up various  management and service organizations to market high-quality  creditable research results.    Experts suggest the use of economic and legal means to guide  enterprises and scientific and technical personnel to the  technology market for voluntary buying and selling of research  fruits. Meanwhile, it is necessary to do everything possible to  set up auction centers and to increase the rate of auctioning  technology. As technology investment involves risks, many  enterprises are hesitant to move ahead. Administrators should  help enterprises set up the mechanism to deal with investment  risks so that enterprises have less worries and more hopes for  successful utilization of new technology.</p>

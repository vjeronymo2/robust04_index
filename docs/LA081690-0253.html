			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TUPPERWARE FLIPS LID OVER NEWS LEAK ON SECRET PRODUCT  </P> <P> The lid has popped off Tupperware's secret new product for 1990, and the  plastic kitchenware giant is steamed.  </P> <P> The Peoria Journal Star reported Wednesday that Tupperware's "revolutionary new  product line" is a group of stackable microwave dishes that can be used  simultaneously in the oven.  </P> <P> "The paper really did a number on us," said Alan Luce, Tupperware vice  president for administration. "This was a major product breakthrough for us. It  was not like a new tumbler or color. This was a major secret."  </P> <P> The new line was to have been unveiled nationally Aug. 27. But the newspaper on  Tuesday got a reporter inside a closed session of a Tupperware convention when  the product was introduced to a jubilant crowd of dealers and sales managers.  </P> <P> Luce said the story "ruined the fun, surprise and excitement" for  conventioneers attending sessions later this week in Peoria, Orlando, Fla., and  Long Beach.  </P> <P> "We've got 110,000 independent Tupperware dealers in the United States. We  prefer that they know about our new products before the general public knows,"  said Lawrie Pitcher Platt, spokeswoman at Tupperware headquarters in Orlando.  </P> <P> Peoria Mayor Jim Maloof said his secretary received several calls from upset  Tupperware officials. He said he called the newspaper to ask if the story could  be pulled from its evening editions. The paper refused.  </P> <P> "I don't understand what's the big deal. They had news, and we went and got  it," said Jack Brimeyer, assistant managing editor. "We didn't treat them any  differently than any other business or news story."  </P> <P> The mayor also said he had heard Tupperware had threatened to cancel its  three-year contract to hold conventions in Peoria.  </P> <P> The new line is called Tupperwave. It's a nine-piece selection of  casserole-type dishes and accessories that can be stacked three-high in a  microwave to allow for the simultaneous cooking of entrees, side dishes and  desserts.  </P> <P> In unveiling the product Tuesday to Tupperware representatives from 17 Midwest  states, Vice President Larry Camberon said: "There's not a company in the world  that has stack cooking in a microwave. Those people at Rubber Maid don't know  anything about it."  </P></p>

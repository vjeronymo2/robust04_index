			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ANIMAL KINGDOM;  </P> <P> KANGAROO GETS A PACEMAKER  </P> <P> Skippy, a once-lethargic red kangaroo at the San Francisco Zoo, finally has a  heart that doctors hope keeps her hopping.  </P> <P> The 7 1/2-year-old marsupial was recovering today after receiving the first  pacemaker ever implanted in a zoo animal.  </P> <P> Veterinarians discovered the middle-aged roo's slow-beating heart a few weeks  ago while treating a small abscess on her right foot. Her condition  deteriorated, and she was near death Sunday.  </P> <P> On Monday night, three heart surgeons from UC San Francisco, helped by four  anesthesiologists from Stanford University, put the two-ounce pacemaker into  Skippy's neck.  </P> <P> Before the surgery, the 80-pound animal's heart registered between 18 and 40  beats a minute, far below the normal rate of 125 to 150, said Mike Sulak, zoo  curator of mammals.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Angelo Panebianco commentary: "The Language of the Left"] </F>   [Text] Although, as [former IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli  has correctly written, the defects of the right are many and  serious, those of the left are equally numerous and serious.  This too is worth considering. What seems to me to have been  the gravest fault committed by [Democratic Party of the Left,  PDS, Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema in  this election campaign is that they -- nobody else -- have  caused a new political boost to be imparted to anticommunism.  Who could have plausibly used anticommunist arguments against  the PDS if it had not allied with the neocommunists of Communist  Renewal and the "Catholic-communists" [Catholic left-wingers] of  Rete? Nor is it any good for Occhetto to reply that the  American Democratic Party and Britain's Labor Party also contain  extreme fringes. This, both because, as [Democratic Alliance  leader] Ferdinando Adornato has said, in those parties the  influence wielded by the extreme fringes absolutely cannot be  compared to that of [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti and  [Rete Secretary] Orlando within the cartel of left-wing forces  and also, and above all, because neither the Democratic Party  nor the Labor Party -- unlike the PDS -- was born out of the  communist tradition, and therefore they do not need to defend  themselves against the suspicion of links with that tradition.    Occhetto should ponder the following: If tomorrow [National  Alliance leader] Fini were to suffer a breakaway on the right on  the part of a group of diehard fascists, what would we say of  him if he were then to ally with those same diehards in the  elections? Having opted to facilitate unity on the left at all  costs (on the basis of the theory that under the  first-past-the-post system, it is only possible to win if  united: no matter with whom) to the detriment of the pursuit of  the average voter (who would have demanded strict limits in the  left), the PDS may have -- though this is not certain -- gained  a better chance of victory, but only by causing itself, and all  Italians, to have to pay the price of perpetuating the  communist-anticommunist split in Italian society and politics.  This, all the more inasmuch as the PDS' alliance with Communist  Renewal -- unlike what would have happened in the event of a  contest between the two groups -- threatens to block the  (inevitably slow) evolution of the political attitudes of PDS  officials and members. Which are reflected in the language used  by the PDS in this campaign.    All the key terms used by the PDS -- both those, such as  "Progress" or "Democracy", which are accorded a positive  connotation, and those, such as "Individualism" (always  qualified as "unbridled") or "Economic Liberalism" (invariably  "unrestrained"), which are accorded a negative connotation --  belong entirely, in this usage, to the traditional communist  lexicon. D'Alema says that it is boorish for unreconstructed  anticommunists to cite the lamentable argument of "communism,"  but in order to help them to correct such a serious fault, this  boorishness, would it not be appropriate for the PDS to ask the  nearest Public Health Office to carry out an urgent lexical  "disinfection" program? This, since, although of course  language says nothing about intentions (intentions can be  concealed, and must in any case submit to changing  circumstances), it does say some unmistakable things about the  principles and political attitudes behind them.    But it is not of course merely a linguistic problem. There  are (at least) three "areas" concerning which it is legitimate  to worry about a possible victory by the left-wing forces. They  concern the issues of state control, foreign policy, and the  relationship between political authority and the judiciary. On  the first point it seems clear to me that the left-wing cartel  is adopting a position of "continuity" with respect to the  course pursued by the First Republic. It is enough to consider  the remarks made about the 1980's, the CAF [Cossiga, Andreotti,  Fanfani] years. The left refers to them as years of  "uncontrolled economic liberalism." What liberalism? The  1980's were in fact years of state control -- unrestrained, too.  Years when there was not a single instance of privatization  (whereas this was taking place in other countries) and when  dominion was exercised by the Single Party of Public  Expenditure, of which, it must be pointed out, the PCI [Italian  Communist Party] was also part, with the CAF. By taking issue  with an economic liberalism that has never existed in this  country, the left-wing cartel is sending an unambiguous message  to the very many ramified vested interests at all levels of the  social pyramid that are vitally dependent on public spending. A  message of "continuity" (with respect to the Christian  Democratic system of state control) instead of a change of  course.    The second crucial "area" concerns foreign policy. Stances  in this regard can only be fully assessed in crisis situations.  Well, the PDS leadership has not said a single word of  self-criticism about the stance adopted during the Gulf crisis.  If a similar situation were to arise again, what would happen  with the PDS in government? Would Italy undermine Western  solidarity, with all the negative repercussions that this would  entail for our country? It is not possible just to say, "let us  forget about the past," as long as well-founded doubts about  future conduct remain.    Last, the problem of the judiciary. I approach the issue, of  course, with the circumspection and caution that are always  obligatory when discussing the real centers of authority. In  Bologna, the heart of the communist "regime" in our country, for  instance, jokes are made (though these are whispered, and only  to trusted friends, more or less as happens in totalitarian  regimes) about the fact that the most incisive action in  connection with illegal funding, kickbacks, and so forth has  hitherto affected, as it so happens, a number of socialists and  also Ciriaco de Mita's brother. We do not yet know what will  happen in the Cusani case, but, to be frank, the worry is that  in the event of a victory by the left-wing forces, the  politico-judicial lobby known as the "magistrates' party" --  which is, of course, not the judiciary as a whole but, rather, a  pressure group operating within it from positions of growing  strength -- will succeed in imposing a "pact" between the ruling  left-wing forces and the judicial authorities, more or less  similar to that which existed between the DC [Christian  Democratic Party] and the same authorities in the 1950's and  1960's. When the advent of a totalitarian regime is feared, it  is principally the possibility of such a pact that people have  in mind.    I read in the newspapers the statement made by Angela  Cavagna, a television starlet, who criticized parties that  "change their coats but do not change their underwear." Alas,  this is likely to remain absolutely the most accurate  observation that has been made about this election campaign.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Delors condemns UK over Hoover 'job-poaching' MR JACQUES Delors, European Commission president, attacked Britain yesterday for 'job-poaching', saying he was determined to get Brussels plans for mandatory European works councils back on the EC agenda. After meeting shop stewards from Hoover's Dijon and Cambuslang plants in an attempt to solve the controversy over the vacuum-cleaner manufacturer's relocation of jobs from France to Scotland, he said the Commission was powerless to act. 'There is no infraction on competition grounds, it is a case of differences in labour costs,' he declared. The row over whether the UK was downgrading workers' rights and benefits so as to secure investment might have been avoided if the works council directive were law. The directive would oblige companies employing over 1,000 people in more than one member state to consult workers' representatives on issues such as job cuts, new work practices and technology. It has been blocked in the Council of Ministers (of the 12) for over two years by UK opposition. But the Danish government, present holder of the EC presidency, says a directive on works councils is one of its main priorities. Mr Delors said he would ask the Council to set a new date for re-examining the plan, which has strong backing in France and Germany, and the formal support of all Britain's partners. A works council 'would not necessarily have affected the outcome', had one been in place at Hoover. Such works councils would not necessarily resolve conflicts of interests between workers over the transfer of jobs, according to union officials in Brussels and London, but would make it more difficult for multinationals to play off workers in one country against those in another, as the unions claim has happened in the Hoover case. Mr Delors was addressing a European socialist conference on ways to create jobs and growth. A 'social Europe. . . means at the very least implementing the social charter,' which all member states except the UK have signed, he declared. Separately last night, Mr Karel van Miert, the Belgian socialist now in charge of EC competition policy, said social policy had to be factored into the barrier-free single market to ensure a 'level playing-field'. Despite the tension between British and French unions over Hoover, co-operation between European unions is growing.</p>

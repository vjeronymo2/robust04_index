			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (1): Future in the balance - Thirteen years of economic reform have brought progress; society is more free and parts of the country are much more prosperous than they were. But Alexander Nicoll writes that more fundamental reforms need to be implemented IT IS tempting to view the overt prosperity of China's deep south as an indication that free markets and investment in private sector manufacturing are sweeping the communist system away. The idea appeals to the westerner because it fits in with events in the former Soviet empire, in which communist parties and the countries they ruled have collapsed like houses of cards. It also appeals to many Chinese who have become, or would like to be, better off. The orchid grower in Guangdong province, in the prosperous south of China, has no doubts about the benefits of economic reform. 'Before the reforms of the system, we couldn't plant orchids,' says the retired agricultural official, still a communist party member. 'It was called capitalism, and if you planted them, they were taken away by the government. Now you can do things as you like.' From his comfortable home - the orchids growing in pots on the roof fetch up to Yn10,000 each - he looks out at a recently-built sports stadium, evidence of the wealth that the factories springing up everywhere have brought to the Pearl River Delta. Such changes cannot yet, however, be taken as indicative of China's overall direction. Thirteen years of economic reform have brought progress. Society is more free, and parts of the country are much more prosperous than they were. The rapid growth of industrial production and exports is also alarming its neighbours, who have relied on attracting foreign investment to a low cost base to fuel their own economic development. The future remains in the balance. Far more fundamental reforms - of prices, state industry and social welfare - need to be implemented if even the progress made so far is to be cemented. It is not clear that the leadership is willing to contemplate them. The collapse of the Soviet Union has left China's communist leaders, who crushed a pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square three years ago, all the more determined to hold on to power, but divided as to the best way to do it. On the one hand, it has strengthened the arguments of the reformers who believe that producing economic growth is the best way to retain authority. On the other, it has stoked fears among more conservative leaders about the loosening of control which is implied by reform. The climate for economic reform has improved this year, with the symbolic visit of Deng Xiaoping, the 87-year-old paramount leader, to Guangdong province. Mr Deng sees economic progress as the most effective way for the communist party to retain its hold on power. Making his first known public appearance for more than a year, he urged a redoubling of efforts to reform. However, his visit did not surface in the official media for nearly two months. This revealed deep divisions within the party leadership. It also demonstrated that even in relatively open Guangzhou and in the Shenzhen special economic zone across the border from Hong Kong, the party's hold is such that a significant event of this nature could occur and yet pass unreported for some time. Nevertheless, his exhortations have given a fillip to reform-minded officials all over China. Each province is pushing ahead with its own plans and projects, and Beijing is being swamped with applications to set up special zones, give tax exemptions, and establish stock markets. Mr Deng set a target for Guangdong to become a new dragon or newly industrialising economy within 20 years. Its economy is becoming increasingly intertwined with those of Hong Kong and Taiwan, providers of capital and, potentially, of technological and management skills. Every other province would like to attract foreign investment just like Guangdong. Economic reform has, indeed, brought considerable benefits, easily visible in the shops and on the streets in many areas of the country. But in most respects, the progress made so far - though significant in a country as large as China - represents the easy part. Guangdong is prosperous because investment from Hong Kong and elsewhere has been pouring in to take advantage of cheap labour. Industrial production rose 27 per cent last year in spite of sluggish export markets. To advance, southern China needs better legal, social and physical infrastructure, and the transfer of technology and management skills. Chinese agriculture is basically a private sector activity, with virtually all farmers having individual responsibility for leased plots. Initially, this brought a big rise in production, which has levelled off since the late 1980s. Agriculture needs big investment to improve its production and yield. Greater efficiency in agriculture has produced a large labour surplus - officials say the figure could reach 200m people in the 1990s. Already 93m of them have been absorbed in rural and township enterprises - light industrial ventures run on commercial lines - which have given a substantial lift to industrial production and exports. They fulfil other aims: narrowing the rural/urban income gap; reducing the flow of redundant farm workers into cities; and spreading a wider net to catch foreign investment. But rural enterprises will need proper management, marketing and technological skills if their role in the economy is to continue to grow. All these more progressive areas - coastal industry, agriculture and rural enterprises - need a healthy economic and political backdrop. In spite of the renewed commitment to reform, this must be in doubt. China's economy during the 1980s saw bursts of growth triggered by reforms, creating inflationary pressures which were met by tough austerity measures. The effects of restraint were felt especially severely by the new, dynamic areas: private and rural enterprise. With every province now again going for growth, there is a substantial risk that the same go/stop cycle will recur. China needs smoother macroeconomic control. In part, this simply reflects the enormous challenges involved in changing the direction of a centrally planned economy. Reform around the edges of the socialist system creates intense pressures within it, particularly for price reform. Liberation of prices (including interest rates) brings inflation and political problems, as well as further disrupting grossly inefficient state-owned industries. Because of the growth of the private and rural sectors, state industries represent a much smaller proportion of the economy than they did before reform. But they are still bleeding the economy dry. There have been moves to free prices and to make managers take more responsibility. But there is no system for them to take responsibility for losses, and in any case they can often do nothing to prevent structural losses caused by fixed prices. It is difficult for them to increase efficiency by reducing their workforces, because they provide housing, medical care and education to their employees and their families - the so-called iron rice bowl - though increasingly, workers are being put on fixed-term contracts rather than receiving lifelong benefits. In addition to full-scale price reform and a new social welfare system - both large tasks - state industries need an infusion of management skills, a slashing of the bureaucracy which governs them, new legal infrastrucuture and proper accounting. For such reforms to be tackled, a high degree of political will is necessary. In spite of the rhetoric of the leaders, and the enthusiasm of the officials charged with planning such changes, proof is awaited that the will exists. China is still ruled by veterans who have spanned at least 50 years of fighting for and maintaining communist control. They are united by two things - their advanced age and their determination to retain control. They have not developed any institutional means for power to be passed on. Mr Deng remains the leader though he holds no official posts, but his authority is far from unchallenged. The future political and economic shape of China depends to a large extent on who dies first and who subsequently wins the battle for power.</p>

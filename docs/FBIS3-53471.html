As far as timing goes, today's meeting takes on great  importance, happening as it does when eyes full of hope and  expectation are focused on the Mideast peace process and on ways  to overcome obstacles to the process.    The meeting is also significant from the political and  historical perspective because Syrian-U.S. relations have always  been sensitive. The relationship has been unique and  fluctuating but it has never been tense to the point of  estrangement and never improved to the point of reconciliation  and harmony. Hence, the importance of the summit meeting,  especially as it takes place at a time when a comprehensive  peace and nations' prosperity are a broad international desire,  not just limited regional demands.    The U.S.-Syrian summit is truly a summit for Mideast peace.  Its timing means the world is reiterating its commitment to  establish a comprehensive and just peace in this strategic part  of the world. It also means a renewal of international  insistence on removing obstacles and solving problems that  obstruct genuine progress toward peace.    Proceeding from this concept, the U.S. and Syrian sides  agreed to hold the summit. The United States under President  Bill Clinton today raises the slogan of a just peace as a course  for a new world order in which Washington plays a primary,  effective role in handling international politics.    When the situation requires advancing the Mideast peace  effort and convincing Israel of the importance of a  comprehensive and just peace based on UN resolutions and the  principle of land for peace, that is, a complete withdrawal in  exchange for a full peace, the U.S. role becomes important and  necessary for our Arab nations to achieve the goals of regaining  their land and rights without compromising their pan-Arab causes  and just demands.    Look at the political and media uproar created a few days  ago--in Israel or the United States--by circles opposed to  improved Syrian- U.S. relations. By casting doubt about the  Syrian stance on peace to spoil the summit's atmosphere and mar  the political climate in which the Clinton-al-Asad talks are  held, these circles showed that they recognize the importance of  the Syrian role in the Mideast peace process. With its  political weight and military might, Syria is one of the key  influential states in the region playing a primary role in the  peace process that cannot be ignored.    If Damascus has explained clearly its firm stance based on a  comprehensive peace and on the need to achieve it based on the  UN resolutions and the principle of land for peace and on the  consideration that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles is a first step that should be followed by similar  steps on other tracks to achieve a comprehensive peace, these  hostile circles' doubts about the Syrian stance become  meaningless and the accusations fail to achieve their aims.    The U.S.-Syrian summit is a positive step in favor of peace.  The agreement to coordinate views and define the principles of  a peaceful settlement between Syria and Israel, which basically  relies on Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan in  exchange for Syria normalizing its ties with Israel within the  framework of a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli  conflict, is indeed a positive push toward achieving a  comprehensive and just peace. It is also a positive effort  accredited to the U.S. President to save the peace process from  the labyrinth of Israeli deception and their playing for time to  avoid the obligations and responsibilities of peace.</p>

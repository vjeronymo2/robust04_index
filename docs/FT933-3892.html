			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Fears grow of fresh conflict in Croatia FIGHTING flared between Serb and Croat forces around Serb controlled regions in Croatia yesterday, threatening to rekindle the war between the Croat government and rebel Serbs in the area. Serb forces in the Krajina enclave shelled Croat government positions, after Croat forces launched an offensive in the Gospic area and captured three villages. Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, UN peace envoy, urged Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to order his troops to withdraw from the villages, but Croatia's army chief insisted the push was a limited operation. General Jean Cot, commander of the UN protection forces in the former Yugoslavia, said: 'The past 24 hours have seen the most dramatic increase in tensions since January 22.' The Croat offensive, which began on Thursday, marked the first attack across the UN ceasefire lines for eight months. It fuels fears that any lull in the fighting in Bosnia could rapidly be replaced by renewed battles in Croatia. The six-month war which Croatia fought with the rebel Serbs around the enclave two years ago officially ended in January 1992, after the Serbs were given de facto control of the Krajina area, monitored by some 15,000 UN peacekeepers. This situation left the Croatian government hoping it would eventually regain the territory. But in recent weeks skirmishes along the border have intensified, as the Croat government has become increasingly concerned that the proposed partition of Bosnia could herald the partition of Croatia as well and the rebel Serbs grow optimistic that the peace plan will allow them to link Krajina with Serbia. A Bosnian Serb army commander has ordered a group of mutinous soldiers to lift immediately their blockade of the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka, AP reports from Belgrade. Bosnian Serb soldiers demanding the punishment of war racketeers were reported to have seized the northern town early yesterday and ringed key buildings with tanks.</p>

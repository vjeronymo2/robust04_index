			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: BNP eyes purchase of Spanish bank BANQUE Nationale de Paris, the largest of France's state-controlled banks, is considering plans to expand its Spanish interests by buying Banco de Fomento, a medium-sized retail bank controlled by Banco Central Hispanoamericano. BNP yesterday confirmed that it had been in contact with BCH and had discussed the possibility of buying Banco de Fomento. However, it stressed that it was only one of a number of companies to have indicated an interest and that it had not yet made a formal offer for the company. The French group already has a modest presence in Spanish retail banking through the network of 73 branches it has opened since the early 1980s. BNP's Spanish activities also include interests in investment banking, property finance and leasing. BCH, Spain's biggest bank in terms of assets, was formed by the merger of Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano in 1991. It wants to dispose of associated national and regional banking networks, which duplicate its own spread of branches. The bank also needs to improve 1993 profits after reporting a 23 per cent fall on pre-tax profits for last year, although that was due in part to new Bank of Spain accounting procedures. Fomento, which once held the former Banco Central's vast industrial portfolio, has attracted considerable interest from other European banks - notably Deutsche Bank, whose Spanish operation is concentrated mainly in Catalonia - because it is one of the few retail banks available with a national, as opposed to a regional, network. It runs 176 offices nationwide and has assets of Pta305bn (Dollars 2.6bn). BCH owns 76 per cent of Fomento, which reported net profits of Pta1.87bn for last year after Pta2.39bn in 1991, a fall also explained by new accounting rules. BNP, a possible candidate for future privatisation, is one of Europe's largest banks. The bank came under pressure last year due to the competitive state of the French banking market and the Paris property crisis, with first-half net profits falling by 13.4 per cent to FFr1.33bn (Dollars 237.5m) on net banking income of FFr19.48bn. So far, BNP has adopted a more cautious attitude to international expansion than other French banks, notably Credit Lyonnais, another large state-controlled bank. But it has recently shown signs of a more expansive strategy, such as last year's partnership agreement with Dresdner Bank of Germany.</p>

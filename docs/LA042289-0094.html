			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: MCGWIRE, WESSELMAN STAR IN SCRIMMAGE  </P> <P> Juniors Dan McGwire and Patrick Rowe and senior John Wesselman continued to  impress San Diego State football coaches in the Aztecs' third intrasquad  scrimmage of the spring Friday at SDSU.  </P> <P> McGwire, who completed 19 of 33 passes for 305 yards, has thrown for 953 yards  on 59-of-95 passing in three scrimmages. Rowe had his third consecutive  seven-catch afternoon, this for 192 yards including a 61-yard touchdown from  McGwire.  </P> <P> Wesselman's interception of a McGwire pass gave him four, at least one each  scrimmage.  </P> <P> Coach Al Luginbill was more pleased with Friday's effort than last week's. "I  felt our intensity on both sides of the ball was better," he said. "We didn't  move the ball as efficiently as we have, but that could be that our defense was  playing well."  </P> <P> While the offense struggled at times -- Brad Platt (10 for 24) threw for just  110 yards -- the defense probably had its best spring showing.  </P> <P> Receiver Monty Gilbreath, who injured his right knee earlier this spring, will  undergo arthroscopic surgery to remove some cartilage Monday at Mercy Hospital.  Defensive end Todd Coomes reinjured the ankle on which he had surgery last year  and will have X-rays taken Monday. JIM LINDGREN  </P></p>

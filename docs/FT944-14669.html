			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: John Fairfax in talks on pay-television deal John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, has foreshadowed a potential move into electronic and digital technology with a possible investment of up to ADollars 1bn (Dollars 740m) later this decade, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. Mr Stephen Mulholland, chief executive, yesterday told a Securities Institute of Australia lunch the company was negotiating a pay television deal which would involve equity of ADollars 10m-ADollars 12m and borrowings of a similar amount. But the company would be prepared to make an investment of up to ADollars 1bn in the information technology area, either in Australia or overseas, after 1997 when its debt-to-equity ratio was expected to be below 20 per cent. Mr Mulholland reiterated that Fairfax was negotiating a plan to link with a leading, but unnamed, US database provider. The company was also planning to launch a Saturday edition of the Australian Financial Review early next year.</p>

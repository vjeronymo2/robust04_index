			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOUTING ROCK'S HOT NIGHTSPOTS  </P> <P> Want to match wits with the record industry's street scouts? Here's a guide to  the nightspots where you are most likely to find the best of the rock hopefuls  around town.  </P> <P> Coconut Teaszer (8117 Sunset Blvd., (213) 654-4773). A runaway winner in an  informal poll of local tastemakers and scenesters, the 235-capacity Teaszer is  praised for its relaxed atmosphere, but mostly for the high level of talent  presented. Booker Len Fagan is so highly regarded as a judge of up-and-coming  bands that he has received offers from several major labels to become an  independent talent scout. Among his innovations: a biweekly showcase called  "L.A.'s Best Kept Secrets," and "residencies," wherein particularly promising  bands get weekly time slots for extended periods. Fagan estimates that nearly  two dozen Teaszer regulars have been signed to label and publishing deals in  the last two years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Best of the Rest  </P> <P> Club Lingerie (6507 Sunset Blvd., (213) 466-8557). Veteran booker Brendan  Mullen, another shrewd judge of raw talent, generally pairs out-of-town  headliners with L.A. bands of commensurate quality.  </P> <P> Bogart's (Marina Pacifica Mall, 6288 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach,  (213) 594-8975). Steve Zepeda frequently presents the same national acts as the  Lingerie, pairing them with young bands from the South Bay and Orange County,  which makes the club a convenient stop for scouts who want to cover a lot of  ground in a single evening.  </P> <P> The Whisky (8901 Sunset Blvd., (213) 652-4202). Voted the best hard-rock club  of the moment in the poll, primarily for Monday's "No Bozo Jam," featuring  four-song sets by up to a dozen acts. However, Columbia Records' A&amp;R man  Nick Terzo finds the atmosphere too "zoo-like" for his taste. Other nights are  more variable in terms of talent. "It depends on which promoter is renting it  out that night," says one pub crawler.  </P> <P> The Roxy (9009 Sunset Blvd., (213) 276-2222). The comment about variable talent  depending on which promoter rents the room also applies. Both the Roxy and  Whisky -- two of Los Angeles' most historic clubs, are jointly owned and  managed.  </P> <P> Gazzarri's (9039 Sunset Blvd., (213) 273-6606). While the room, just up the  street from the Roxy, is widely considered an unintentional parody of a rock  club, several prominent bands, including Poison and Warrant, got their starts  there.  </P> <P> Also worth checking out are the "revolving clubs" -- the theme clubs that take  over existing venues one night a week. The most notable: English Acid  (Wednesdays at Peanuts, 7969 Santa Monica Blvd., (213) 654-0280, Xposeur 54  (Sundays at Circus Disco, 6655 Santa Monica Blvd., (213) 462-1291) and the  parade of events at Hollywood Live (6840 Hollywood Blvd., (213) 461-6266).

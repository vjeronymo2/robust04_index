			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Council chief attacks Banham The chief executive of Cleveland County Council, Mr Bruce Stevenson, yesterday accused Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, of misrepresenting the council's popularity, John Authers writes. The commission has recommended abolition of the county council. Mr Stevenson rejected Sir John's claim that Cleveland was unpopular, and said results of MORI opinion polls for the commission itself showed that the level of community identification with Cleveland was above average and higher than that for Lincolnshire and Gloucestershire. The commission has said both of those counties should remain intact. Lobbying of MPs by councillors intensified over the weekend as they reacted to last week's proposals from the commission that eight county councils should be abolished. In Cumbria, which the commission wants to split into two all-purpose authorities, one district council described the proposals as 'anti-democratic'. However, the Association of District Councils, which is campaigning for all-purpose unitary authorities, published a telephone poll by MORI which showed that 76 per cent of people would rather their services were not split as they are at present between counties and districts.</p>

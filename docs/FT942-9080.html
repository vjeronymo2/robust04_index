			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Restructuring takes toll on Orenstein &amp; Koppel Restructuring costs continued to dent results at Orenstein &amp; Koppel, forcing the construction and mining equipment maker to a loss of DM65m (Dollars 39.1m) in 1993. However, this is an improvement on the previous 12 months when the group returned a loss of DM116m. The company reported an operating loss of DM3m and has set aside DM52m to finance redundancies and the re-siting of activities in Dortmund. Turnover in the construction equipment division, which accounts for almost 60 per cent of total turnover, fell 17 per cent resulting in a 'very bad operating result' which could not be offset by improved results in the mining and escalator divisions. The company expects 'a modest profit' this year as it begins to benefit from a three-year restructuring programme which runs until 1995. O&amp;K, which is 75 per cent owned by Krupp-Hoesch, the steelmaker, recently said it would raise DM144m with a rights issue. Escalator sales rose 53 per cent worldwide to DM382m, helped by the UK arm which won a DM125m contract from the London Underground.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: HK tycoon bids Dollars 64.3m to buy back warrants MR LI KA-SHING, the Hong Kong property tycoon, has put an end to a stormy chapter in his corporate history by making a HKDollars 495m (Dollars 64.3m) offer to buy back all of the remaining covered warrants issued by him and his holding company on Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa. The announcement followed statements from Mr Li indicating that Hutchison was planning a rights issue or a placement. As a result of the comments, the price of both sets of warrants fell on Friday by almost 20 per cent, and raised accusations of market manipulation. The offer for the warrants was pitched at Thursday's closing price, and with a combined turnover of HKDollars 171m yesterday, brokers assumed that many holders have chosen to accept the cash offer. Peregrine Capital, which is handling the warrant purchases, said the offer was made to 'avoid any criticism being levelled at Mr Li that he was taking advantage of the situation'. The Cheung Kong warrants were issued in February 1991 at HKDollars 5.30, compared with Mr Li's final offer price of HKDollars 3.60, while the Hutchison warrants were offered in May 1991 at HKDollars 3.80, compared with the offer price of HKDollars 2.175. The deal has therefore been lucrative for Mr Li. Mr Li owns 35 per cent of Cheung Kong and issued the warrants against his own shareholding. Cheung Kong in turn owns a controlling stake in Hutchison, and was the issuer of the Polycourt warrants. The warrants have taken a toll on investors' perception of one of Hong Kong's largest corporate groups. They were perceived as opportunistic, preceding a string of bad news on Hutchison.</p>

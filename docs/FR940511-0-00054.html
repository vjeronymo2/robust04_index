The regulatory prohibition on altering the seabed includes an exception for incidental disturbance resulting from traditional fishing operations. NMFS has conducted a limited study of the impact of trawl gear on the benthos and has not identified any resulting systematic destruction. However, the regulations could be modified to regulate any activity that is shown to cause significant disturbance of the seabed. This reflects adherence to the MPRSA's goals of preserving natural and human-use qualities of a marine area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> High-seas driftnets, defined as nets greater than 1.5 miles long, have been banned pursuant to United Nations resolution 46/215. While gillnets and setnets are currently used in the inland waters of the State of Washington, they are not used in Sanctuary waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NOAA should facilitate the regulation of resource extraction within the Sanctuary under a regulatory framework that is controlled by a single agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Regulatory authority over resources and resource extraction industries is expressly granted by state and Federal statute. NOAA does not have the primary regulatory authority over resource extraction. NOAA can act to coordinate the various regulators and can impose additional regulations, but cannot reassign itself or other agencies regulatory authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NOAA must clarify and acknowledge all tribal treaty fishing rights in the FEIS/MP, and the interaction of Sanctuary regulations with the right of tribes to fish in their Usual and Accustomed fishing areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This issue is clarified in the Designation Document and in Part II (under Socio-Demographic profile and Land Use). In addition, the coastal tribe's treaty rights are acknowledged in several sections of the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The entire study area must be considered as a ``fishing area'' since fish migrate along the entire Washington coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NOAA recognizes that fish ``know no boundaries in the sea.'' The fishing areas identified in the FEIS/MP only represent known locations where certain fishery activity is concentrated. The fishing areas displayed in the FEIS/MP are not related to regulatory jurisdiction in any way. They are simplified visual aids to complement the discussion of resources off the coast of Washington.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Aquaculture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Clarify NOAA's intention to regulate, condition, or prohibit aquaculture activities throughout the Sanctuary and adjacent to Indian reservations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Sanctuary regulations do not directly prohibit aquaculture operations within the Sanctuary boundary. However, discharge of matter into the Sanctuary, or alteration of or construction on the seabed in connection with aquaculture activities are prohibited. It is unlikely that permits would be granted for aquaculture activities in the Sanctuary that violate these prohibitions. This determination is based upon U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) guidance related to permits for fish pen mariculture operations, which prohibits fish farms in Federal natural resource areas, such as national seashores, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, parks or other areas designated for similar purposes (e.g., national marine sanctuaries).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NOAA should change the proposed regulation governing alteration of or construction on the seabed to ``maintenance and development of approved aquaculture operations'', and strike ``existing prior to the effective date of these regulations.'' Eliminating future aquaculture development off the Olympic Coast would preclude opportunities for both private shellfish and finfish production and for public enhancement. Technology is being developed which would result in minimal environmental imbalance, and would afford employment for regional communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See response to previous comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Sanctuary should not regulate aquaculture activities because there are sufficient regulations in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

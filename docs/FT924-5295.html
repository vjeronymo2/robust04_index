			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: Determined to move forward Sir, I should like to clarify your report about the re-signalling of the London Tilbury and Southend line ('BR halts Tilbury line upgrade', November 21). The renewal is authorised and we are examining ways of funding the cost within a difficult economic environment. We will know in the next two months whether we are in a position to take it forward, but there is a determination to do so. John Nelson, managing director, Network SouthEast, Network House, 1 Eversholt Street, London NW1 1DN</p>

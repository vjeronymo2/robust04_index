			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gantry pulls out of battle for Bridge Oil The hard-fought bid battle for Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based oil and gas group, appeared to be over last night, after Gantry, one of the two rival suitors, dropped out of the race. Gantry - which was the bid vehicle for Enron, the US natural gas company, and the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of the largest state pension funds - said it would not proceed with an offer. This leaves the way clear for Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texan oil independent, to go ahead with its 90-cents-a-share cash bid. Gantry said P&amp;P's public statement that it would not accept a 95-cents-a-share offer for its 21 per cent holding in Bridge, meant that Gantry had no hope of reaching its 90 per cent minimum acceptance level. 'Thus, we have decided not to proceed with this transaction,' it said. Gantry had bought Bridge shares in the market on Thursday at prices up to 95 cents. However, during yesterday's trading, Bridge shares eased to 91 cents.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LAWMAKER'S CHILD FACES JAIL OVER TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Cathie Wright's daughter failed to inform the Ventura County  Municipal Court about new three traffic offenses, as required, after a  municipal judge placed her on probation and gave her a 30-day suspended jail  sentence for numerous moving violations, the judge said Monday.  </P> <P> Victoria Catherine Wright, 24, was told by Judge Herbert Curtis III on April 18  that another conviction would result in a jail stint. He fined her, placed her  on probation for three years and stipulated that she inform the court of future  offenses within 10 days.  </P> <P> Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) said Monday that her daughter acted on the advice  of her attorney when she failed to heed the court order. The attorney, however,  said he never gave Wright's daughter such counsel.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said that his office,  which opened an investigation last week of allegations that Wright sought "to  influence the outcome" of her daughter's citations, had received new leads.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Complaint  </P> <P> The inquiry was triggered by a single complainant, Bradbury said Monday, but  "there are now numerous sources of information that are pertinent to our  investigation." He declined to disclose the identities of the assemblywoman's  accusers or to reveal details of the probe.  </P> <P> Cathie Wright reiterated that she has done nothing improper in contacting Simi  Valley, Ventura County and state Department of Motor Vehicles officials on  behalf her daughter. She has suggested that Bradbury is trying to score  political points at her expense.  </P> <P> "When does your child not become your constituent?" Wright asked. "Where do you  draw the line?"  </P> <P> State DMV officials say that Wright sought no preferential treatment for her  daughter, despite the lawmaker's intervention, and that Victoria Wright  received none.  </P> <P> James E. Dunn, a traffic safety manager, was dispatched from Sacramento to hold  an administrative hearing for the younger Wright in Van Nuys in July after the  assemblywoman sent a letter to DMV Director A.A. (Del) Pierce on her daughter's  behalf. Dunn, who reviews DMV appeals for Pierce, overturned a decision by a  DMV hearing officer a month earlier to suspend Victoria Wright's license for  six months.  </P> <P> Instead, Dunn gave her a six-month license restricted to traveling to and from  work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 11 Violations  </P> <P> At the time of the July hearing, the younger Wright had been convicted of 11  traffic violations in the previous 18 months, including 10 for speeding. Her  four points for four speeding offenses in the previous 12 months had led to the  June suspension.  </P> <P> In overturning the suspension, Dunn said Monday that he took into account the  fact that Victoria Wright had never been convicted of driving under the  influence of drugs or alcohol, had never had a violation expunged from her  record by attending traffic violators' school, had only been brought before the  court one time and vowed that she "had grown up" and would not to break the law  again.  </P> <P> He said overturning the suspension was not unusually lenient treatment.  </P> <P> Cathie Wright said Monday that her June 22 letter to Pierce "was basically a  form letter in which you ask for an administrative review." She said she would  have sent it for any constituent.  </P> <P> "My daughter's presently suffering from financial hardships and must continue  working to alleviate the situation," said the letter requesting a restricted  license. "She is unable to get to her place of employment except by car."  </P> <P> Victoria Wright lives with her mother in Simi Valley and works in a supermarket  in Thousand Oaks. Cathie Wright's political colleagues say that the lawmaker,  whose husband died in 1982, has long complained of problems with her only  child. Said one: "This is part of an ongoing saga."  </P> <P> After the July hearing, Victoria Wright subsequently received tickets for five  additional moving violations, including three more for speeding, and faces a  one-year revocation of her license at a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. Dunn  said she also failed to keep a spoken agreement to alert him to any new  violations.  </P> <P> Curtis, who had placed Victoria Wright on a court-ordered probation in April,  said Monday that he only learned of the additional offenses from a newspaper  reporter last week. He said he expects Victoria Wright to be brought back  before him in two weeks to a month for sentencing.  </P> <P> Asked whether Cathie Wright had sought to intercede in the case, Curtis cited  Bradbury's investigation and declined comment. Wright said she had never spoken  to Curtis.  </P> <P> The lawmaker, who said she was speaking for her daughter, recalled that  Victoria Wright wanted to contact Curtis when she got two more tickets in  September and a third in December but found herself "caught between a rock and  a hard place."  </P> <P> Wright said her daughter "was taking the advice of the attorney who appeared  with her at that time not to say anything." Wright said the lawyer, Frederick  Rosenmund, told her daughter: "Let the judge take action."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denies Advice  </P> <P> But Rosenmund, who represented Victoria Wright before Curtis, said Monday that  he never gave such advice.  </P> <P> "It's something that I wouldn't do if I knew there was a court order to report  additional violations," Rosenmund said. He said such a requirement is "often a  standard term of probation."  </P> <P> Rosenmund, who has a practice in Oxnard, is an attorney that Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) recommended to Cathie Wright last year.  </P> <P> Cathie Wright acknowledged Monday that she also called John Paventi, a Ventura  County Municipal Court commissioner, about Victoria's September tickets.  Paventi is a former Republican Party official whom Wright recalled supporting  in his bid to become a judge. He subsequently disqualified himself from hearing  the case.  </P> <P> "Vicki wanted to fight" the tickets, Wright said, explaining her contact with  Paventi. "I called him and asked him what the procedures would be and he  suggested she just pay the tickets. And he decided he would not have anything  to do with the case . . .  </P> <P> "He would have done that if Vicki had just walked in. He knows her."  </P> <P> Paventi could not be reached Monday.  </P> <P> Staff Writer Gerry Brailo Spencer contributed to this story.  </P></p>

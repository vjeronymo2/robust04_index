			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Focus" by Takehiko Kajita: "Japanese Politics </F> Rudderless After Hata's Resignation"]    [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Although Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata is scheduled to exit, it is anybody's guess how  soon he will be freed from his duties as a caretaker premier.    With the end of the current ordinary Diet session only two  days away, major political parties in Japan have yet to decide  on who should head the next government, let alone which parties  should fashion a new administration.    So far, the coalition parties that constitute Hata's fragile  minority government are adopting a wait-and-see tactic toward  the formation of the next government as major opposition parties  are vigorously trying to launch an administration that includes  them.    The country's two largest parties, the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social  Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ], both in the opposition camp,  are playing a pivotal role in livening up the intensifying power  game triggered by Hata's announcement of his resignation with  the two-month-old cabinet.    The LDP, a party that governed the nation unchallenged for  nearly four decades until last August, is anxious to seize this  occasion to wrest back power. The problem is the party needs a  partner -- or partners -- to launch a new government as it lacks  a majority force in the Diet.    The once-dominant party is thus wooing the SDP, the LDP's  archrival under the LDP's 38-year rule and the largest  contingent in the administration of former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government, into its fold to  create a grand coalition government.    But the move has already sparked resistance from within the  LDP because it is taken to be tantamount to the revival of the  old political setup in which the LDP and the SDP were ostensibly  locking horns with each other but in reality having a cozy  relationship.    The tie-up with the LDP is also not easy for the SDP. While  the left-wingers within the SDP, led by SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama, show great interest in joining forces with the LDP,  the right- wingers headed by SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo  favor the party's realliance with the present coalition.    The LDP and the SDP have also too wide a gap over key policy  issues such as foreign policies and national security to govern  together. It is uncertain whether New Party Sakigake, a tiny  LDP splinter party headed by former Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura and having close ties with the SDP, can play  cupid for the two parties.    As of Monday [27 June] night, the SDP leadership has yet to  decide on which the party should choose, forming a partnership  with the LDP or mending fences with the coalition parties, due  to the schism between the right-wing and left-wing members of  the party.    Whichever the party leadership chooses, the SDP could face a  moment of breakup and accelerate moves toward a full-scale  reconfiguration of political parties in Japan.    The ruling coalition parties are closely watching dialogue  for the formation of a new government among the LDP, the SDP and  Sakigake and have given the silent treatment to the SDP's call  for the reopening of realliance talks.    It is widely believed that behind the coalition's attitude  lies its conviction that the LDP and the SDP will never be able  to get married and that the ruling alliance can certainly break  a political impasse in its favor.</p>

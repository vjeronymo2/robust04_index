			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Nearly 3,000 deputies  to the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) have arrived in  Beijing by this afternoon to attend its second session due to  start Thursday (March 10).    The annual NPC session is an important event in China's  political and economic life. During the coming session,  deputies will deliberate Premier Li Peng's government work  report, the national economic development plan, the state  budget, and work reports of the Supreme People's Court, Supreme  People's Procuratorate and the NPC Standing Committee.    This year's NPC session comes about 10 days earlier than  usual, and future sessions are expected to be convened still  earlier in the year. Observers say this is to ensure better  planning of government work for the whole year.    Deputies know what business they will be doing during the  session. In the past year most of them have made extensive  investigations in their respective constituencies. Upon their  arrival in Beijing, they start reading documents, preparing  motions and exchanging information with one another.    Punco, a Tibetan deputy from Monba, an ethnic minority in  China with the smallest population, said participation in state  affairs was beyond the dream of Monba people in the past.  Though the "gexia" (parliament) of old Tibet held meetings  every year, it had nothing to do with Tibetan serfs.    Punco said he plans to raise a motion on developing Tibetan  economy, especially its agriculture and animal husbandry.    Wang Dazhong, a deputy from a big state enterprise in  Shaanxi  Province, said that, as the country is probing ways for the  establishment of a modern enterprise system in 1994, he plans to  express his opinions on the necessity of establishing standards  for market behaviors and strengthening law enforcement.    The Eighth NPC has 2,978 deputies. In the past year, five  deputies passed away, one resigned, and two were disqualified.  Standing committees of local people's congresses elected  deputies for the vacancies according to law.</p>

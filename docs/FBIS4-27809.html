			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A government panel released  a rough outline Thursday [2 June] for the boundaries of 300 new  single-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives.    The group will begin drawing up concrete boundaries for the  electoral districts after submitting the outline to the lower  house special committee on political reform, government  officials said.    The ruling coalition wants the panel to report as early as  Monday so that a bill can be enacted during the current Diet  session which ends in late June, but the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) has insisted on June 9 or later,  political sources said.    A new electoral system was enacted in January, but it will  not take effect unless the boundaries for the new electoral  districts become law.    The outline provides a basic policy for defining  constituencies, the officials said.    It suggests that cities, wards, towns, villages and counties  should not be divided into two constituencies, and detached  districts should be avoided.    Social and natural conditions, including geography, history  and transportation, should be considered in drawing up the  boundaries of the constituencies, it said.    The panel, headed by Tadao Ishikawa, former president of  Keio  University, was launched on April 11.    Under the new electoral system, 300 of the 500 lower house  members will be elected from single-seat districts and the  remaining 200 through proportional representation.    The current 511-seat House of Representatives was elected  last July from constituencies supplying two to six members each.</p>

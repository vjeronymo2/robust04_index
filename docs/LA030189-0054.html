			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  PLAN WOULD EXPAND RETAIL PARKING SPACE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Planning Commission gave initial approval Tuesday to a plan to  dramatically boost parking requirements for new commercial buildings.  </P> <P> Under the plan, new retail buildings would have to provide four parking spaces  for every 1,000 square feet instead of the current two. Large restaurants would  need 10 spaces for every 1,000 square feet rather than the two now required.  The plan would not affect parking requirements at new office buildings.  </P></p>

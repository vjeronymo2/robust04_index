			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts lifted by failure of Labour to advance in polls UK GOVERNMENT bond prices ended yesterday slightly higher than at their Friday close, helped by weaker-than-expected showings for the opposition Labour party in weekend opinion polls. The Liffe gilt futures contract, which closed at 94.19 on Friday, opened at 94.29 after opinion polls at the weekend failed to show a large Labour lead in the UK general election campaign. The market had fallen back on Friday on expectations that Labour would show a six-point lead in the weekend polls. The Liffe gilt futures contract fell to a low of 94.10 before picking up again to trade at 94.25 by late afternoon on a volume of about 22,500. Traders said gilts slipped back after the Labour party announced its alternative budget proposals, but the US Treasury bond market helped to lift gilt prices as it picked up slightly later in the day. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 112 23/32 and slipped back to trade at 112 5/8 by late afternoon to yield 9.82 per cent. US TREASURIES marked time yesterday in thin, range-bound trading as the market waited for a slew of economic statistics for February slated for release today. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was quoted  1/8 lower at 99 3/32 , yielding 8.07 per cent after posting slim gains in morning trading. Shorter-dated maturities were unchanged to narrowly higher, with the three-year note unchanged on the day to yield 5.84 per cent. The Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system by arranging three-day system repurchase agreements. Fed funds - the rate at which banks lend to each other - were trading at 4 1/8 per cent when the Fed entered the market. The Fed's operation was widely expected. The perceived target for Fed Funds is 4 per cent. Although the long bond received some attention in Tokyo as investors turned their sights to bonds amid a falling stock market, there was little to move the US Treasury market yesterday. For the most part, participants were waiting for today's release of the February consumer price index, housing starts and industrial production figures. GERMAN government bonds drifted lower in dull trade as many dealers and investors continue to wait for further developments on the wage front. The bund futures contract was trading at around 87.97 by late afternoon, compared with 88.04 on Friday afternoon. The Bundesbank announced yesterday that it was inviting banks to tender for an issue of medium-term Treasury notes on March 24. The notes are being launched for the Unity Fund, which was set up after the reunification of Germany. THE fall in the Nikkei stock index yesterday to below the psychologically important 20,000 level - its lowest level in five years - helped to push up Japanese government bonds, although bond prices ended either unchanged or only slightly firmer after profit-taking. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue, which opened at 5.435 per cent, traded in a range of 5.405 per cent to 5.44 per cent and ended the day at 5.425 per cent. The futures contract rose from its opening of 102.31 to a high of 102.51 before closing at 102.34. Traders said the Bank of Japan remained neutral in its money market operations, giving no indication of an easing in interest rates. However, the market is hoping the Bank of Japan will soon cut the official discount rate.</p>

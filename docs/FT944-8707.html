			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Receivers in at Beckenham Receivers called in yesterday to Beckenham Group, the heating and ventilation engineer, said the group had outstanding liabilities of about Pounds 8m. The receivers were appointed by Tapul SA, a Panama-registered group, which has a 39.8% stake in the group. The receivers, Mr Peter Spratt and Mr Michael Gercke, both partners at Price Waterhouse, said the bulk of the liabilities were to trade creditors. The group's outstanding bank debt was replaced after a rights issue and placing which was completed in March. Five of the group's specialist subsidiaries were to continue trading and be sold as going concerns. Beckenham Ductwork, the ductwork engineer and contractor which employs 200 of the group's 260 employees, had been put into receivership.</p>

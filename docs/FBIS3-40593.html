The majority are  individuals who play central roles in Pakistani politics.  According to sources, the prime minister has instructed General  Termazi to place these "big fish" under immediate arrest and  bring them to trial in the high courts. Reportedly General  Termazi has met with high officials and informed them of the  situation. Meanwhile, as a result of the activities of the  Special Task Force, the owners of heroin factories on the Toor  Kham Kabul border are selling their heroin at cheap prices. Most  well-known heroin dealers have moved their factories and  themselves to Afghanistan in order to stay out of the reach of  the Task Force. According to informed sources, Ayub Afridi, the  king of drugs, is sending all his furniture to Switzerland, and  has gone into hiding. Ayub Afridi is wanted by Interpol in  several drug smuggling cases. Several other drug dealers, some  of whom are women who observe purdah [veil], have ordered their  agents to cease operations and to go underground temporarily. It  has also been learned that, in its initial activity, the Task  Force arrested a number of agents working for drug sellers, and  is interrogating them in secret locations.</p>

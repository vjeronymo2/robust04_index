			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LIN DROPS AS MCCAW RETHINKS BID  </P> <P> Stock in LIN Broadcasting Corp. fell sharply for the second straight session  today amid speculation that McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. might lower its  $120-a-share bid for the company.  </P> <P> McCaw said Friday that it will review its bid after the New York Court of  Appeals rejected LIN's claim that it had the right to purchase additional  cellular telephone interests in the lucrative New York and Philadelphia  markets, where it already operates.  </P> <P> Even without the rights in the two East Coast cities, many analysts said LIN  was worth more than $120 a share, or about $5.8 billion. Nevertheless, LIN was  down $2.375 a share to $113.50 in very active over-the-counter trading today,  nearly $10 below its close Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments monitored by Panama  Bureau through 17 January; source follows in parentheses after  each item.    The Treasury is easily losing nearly 1 trillion pesos in  uncollected taxes per year due to contraband, which represents a  little more than 25 percent of the country's total annual  imports. Cigarettes are the leading contraband product. (Santa  Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 6 Jan 94 pp 1, 17)    Colombian exports increased only by 2 percent from January  to  September 1993, totaling $5.269 billion. A huge reduction in  the export of coffee, oil, fuels, and other traditional products  are to blame for the poor showing. A 13.5-percent increase in  nontraditional exports saved the situation, keeping the export  percentages from falling into the negative side. (Santa Fe de  Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 7 Jan 94 p 2b)    Colombia and the UK have made significant progress in  negotiating an investment agreement. Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin has said she hopes the negotiations will conclude in two  months; in addition, the Colombian foreign minister has signed a  technical cooperation agreement to modernize the state.  According to the agreement, the UK will contribute 130,000  pounds and Colombia will contribute 144 million pesos to a  program that seeks to improve management in government  institutions. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 12 Jan 94  p 7a)    The manufacturing industry grew by 5.69 percent from January  to October 1993, according to the National Administrative  Department of Statistics. The production of transportation  equipment and material increased by 49.5 percent. (Santa Fe de  Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 12 Jan 94 p 6b)</p>

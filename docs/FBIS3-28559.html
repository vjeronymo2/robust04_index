			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Japan launched a new package  of stimulus measures Tuesday [8 February], pouring a record  15.25 trillion yen into the economy in a bid to stem the  prolonged recession and show its commitment to reducing the  country's huge trade surplus.    The centerpiece of the package, endorsed at an evening  special cabinet meeting, is income and other tax cuts worth 5.85  trillion yen decided earlier by the coalition parties after four  days of marathon debate on how to cover the resulting revenue  shortfall.    Other key elements are 6 trillion yen in additional spending  on public works for the current fiscal year through March, 1.2  trillion yen to boost public housing loans, 1.36 trillion yen in  measures to help smaller businesses, and deregulations to  stimulate the real estate market and facilitate the liquidation  of nonperforming bank loans.    With previous four public works-led packages already  totaling  some 30 trillion yen failing to lift the economy, the government  decided for the first time to include tax cuts, hoping to make  the package its final and decisive pump-primer.    The tax-led measures also came amid U.S. pressure on Japan  for an income tax cut to boost domestic demand as a contribution  to reducing its huge trade surplus.    Japan posted a record surplus for the second straight year  in  1993 in its politically sensitive current accounts, including  goods and services trade. The statistics were released Monday.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is no doubt relieved by the  agreement after a two-week delay caused by disputes over the  now-enacted political reform bills as well as the tax issue.    Hosokawa said at a press meeting he expects "substantial"  effects from the tax cuts, "to meet expectations both at home  and abroad."    Hosokawa had been urging his ministers to prepare the  package, to be followed by a third fiscal 1993 extra budget and  the fiscal 1994 budget, in order to have it ready before his  meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday.    The Finance Ministry is to compile its draft budgets on  Thursday, but uncertainty still remains because of the extremely  tight schedule, ministry officials said.    An official of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) which  compiled the package told reporters that a large chunk of the  new outlays would be funded by the third extra budget, and the  tax cuts would be included in the fiscal 1994 budget.    Of the total, 10.2 trillion yen is to boost the economy, he  said, estimating that the gross national product (GNP) would  expand by a nominal 2.2 percent beyond the fiscal 1992 GNP, the  latest available figures, over a one-year period.    But he noted that the effects would not appear all at once  in  fiscal 1994.    The package is broadly divided into three parts, in line  with  their expected effects and results in stimulating the economy.    With the first part that includes tax cuts, public works and  housing loans, the government is aiming to boost domestic demand  to help the economy "overcome the current tough condition" in  the short term, the EPA official said.    The second and third parts are intended to put the economy  "on a full-fledged recovery phase in fiscal 1994" and to promote  "stable growth in and after fiscal 1995" by solving structural  problems since the collapse of the "bubble" economy in the late  1980s and by facilitating forward-looking corporate activities.    Under the second part, the package calls for special tax  breaks, 2.78 trillion yen advance purchases of public works land  sites and other measures to stimulate the real estate market.  It also calls for various deregulations in the financial and  securities market primarily to help banks liquidate their  nonperforming loans.    For the advance land purchases, the government will also  earmark 500 billion yen for a quasi-public institute that  supports private-sector city developments.    Also included are additional lending and other forms of  support for smaller businesses and 10 billion yen for job  programs amid increasing labor adjustments.    Farmers will be granted 230 billion yen in public works and  through other plans to help them cope with international  competition following Japan's decision to free its rice and  other agricultural markets under the GATT-sponsored Uruguay  Round of multilateral talks.    With the third part, the government is pushing for the  easing  and lifting of various microeconomic regulations, including  those under the Antimonopoly Law.    A loan system worth 10 billion yen is to be offered by the  Japan Development Bank and other public financial institutions  to assist investment in new businesses.    Import promotion is also spelled out in the third part, with  the emphasis on exhibitions and import centers, along with the  recently-revealed action plan for government procurement.    Aside from all these government measures, the package also  calls for "appropriate and mobile management in monetary policy  with a careful watch on domestic and overseas economic trends  and the international currency situation."</p>

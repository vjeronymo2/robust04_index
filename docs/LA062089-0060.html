			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: DAILY NEWS PUBLISHER MORRIS QUITS  </P> <P> Robert Steven Morris has resigned as publisher of the Daily News after nearly  two years in the job.  </P> <P> Morris, 37, declined to comment on his resignation. Lynne Jewell, public  relations manager for the newspaper, also declined to answer questions on why  Morris resigned, except to say that he plans "to pursue other business  interests."  </P> <P> Morris' resignation comes amid a period of labor strife at the Woodland  Hills-based newspaper. In April, reporters, photographers and copy editors  voted overwhelmingly to elect the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild as their union  representatives after a three-year organizing drive. Contract negotiations  opened last Wednesday, a Guild spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Morris was named publisher in August, 1987, by the newspaper's owner, Jack Kent  Cooke, a sports and cable television multimillionaire who bought the newspaper  for $176 million in 1985. Morris, previously vice president of advertising at  the Denver Post, succeeded Byron C. Campbell, now publisher of the Record in  Hackensack, N.J.  </P> <P> Cooke, who once owned the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings, could not  be reached for comment. Jewell said the announcement was made by James Lacher,  executive vice president of Jack Kent Cooke Inc. Lacher is a top executive in  Cooke's organization.  </P> <P> In the six months ending March 31, the Daily News had circulation of 183,402  daily and 201,533 on Sunday, according to figures reported to the Audit Bureau  of Circulations.

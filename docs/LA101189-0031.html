			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Rock musician David Crosby is launching a new career on the lecture circuit.  After a speaking appearance before 300 students at the University of Maryland,  Crosby said he's testing these new waters "because I'm a very opinionated guy  and I love communicating with other people." Jan Dance, his wife and partner in  a downward spiral of drug addiction and like Crosby a recovering addict,  offered another reason. "As a musician for many years he gave the impression  that it was OK to do drugs. He understands now that he made a mistake and set a  wrong example and now he's trying to set another example," she said. Dance said  Crosby hopes his message will help others in trouble with drugs. "He does it  from the heart, to help anyone listening understand it's a path they don't have  to travel." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (5): Making the most of a valuable legacy - Integration: EIS reporting / A management information system that would work across Europe was the aim for Boots Healthcare International's financial reporting software The formation of a new business unit in 1991 - Boots Healthcare International - threw into relief a gap in management information for the Boots Group. The newly-formed business unit deals with consumer (over-the-counter) healthcare products, and has a turnover of Pounds 150m. The problem was that the 'legacy' accounting systems that provided management information to the Boots Group had no way of reflecting the change. 'Our starting point in looking for a decision support system was the weakness of management information for the new business,' explains John Rycroft, head of information technology (IT) in BHI. 'Consumer healthcare products had been part of pharmaceuticals, and there was no way of stripping out that information from systems designed before the split.' However, those systems, tailored versions of the MSA accounts package now owned by Dun and Bradstreet, were still essential to day-to-day running. Nor were there any criticisms about the accuracy or operational aspects of the accounts; only of the reporting facilities. 'We did consider replacing the systems, but rapidly realised that we'd make better progress by 'wrapping' them in a more flexible information system,' explains Mr Rycroft. A look at EISs, such as PC Express, convinced his team that an EIS could provide the right functions, and the ease of use. Flexible, powerful functions and the handling of large volumes of data were high on the shopping list, but design was the critical factor, especially as the system would have to serve the entire European BHI operation. Boots staff already had in-house understanding of Holistic Systems' Holos EIS software, gleaned from a sales and marketing application built four years previously on a DEC Vax. It was this existing experience that swung the decision in Holos' favour. For the management system, running on a 'downsized' Hewlett Packard Unix-based computer, BHI brought in some Holos expertise from consultants KPMG: 'We had used them for other decision support systems, but the partnership worked well because we wanted ideas, not just development experience.' John Rycroft's five-strong design team, led by project manager Phil Carter, grew their own Holos expertise, and developed their own in-house BHI standards for consistent design features, such as navigation round the system. An EIS is only as good as the analysis effort that goes into it, and Rycroft attributes the success of the project to this attention to detail. Paul Harmer, lead designer on the team, explains the balance: 'Obviously you need data analysis, but the design of the systems that sit above that is critical. I've seen developers turn out gimmicky applications whose poor design seriously impairs use. 'The senior people using the system here don't have time to explore every facility: the systems must bring the right information up straight away. 'You need to combine power with operational simplicity, which is all down to design. Neglect that at your peril,' he adds. 'We haven't come across anything that we need to do that we can't do in Holos.' John Rycroft assessed the in-house effort involved at three man-years, costing Pounds 150,000: significantly, more than twice the Pounds 70,000 spent on the actual Holos software. The system is already live, and about to be implemented across Europe, with a projected 300 or so users. Typically, the 100 or so UK users are looking at such issues as brand performance in part of a market, or across a market: for example, sales of the Strepsils throat pastilles. Mr Rycroft estimates there are about 71m 'cells' of information: well beyond the reach of a spreadsheet - 'managers now have information about the financial performance of the brand that they didn't have before: that's all about improving the quality of decision-making,' he concludes. Software details: Holos This product, (current version 3.2), was launched in 1988, and combines executive information (EIS) and decision support (DSS) in a seamless management information system that incorportes dynamic linkes to most relational databases and can access all types of data from PCs, mainframes and external text retrieval services. Supplier: Holistic Systems, founded in the UK, 1986; turnover Pounds 6m in year ended March 1993. Price: Pounds 50,000 entry price. Sold direct in UK, but through distributors in some European countries. Maintenance: 12 per cent of contract value. Hardware and operating systems: DEC Vax, DEC Alpha, Unix platforms including IBM RS6000, Sequent, HP 9000, ICL DRS, Sun. User views: 'Powerful software for development - handles large volumes, links with Oracle, pro-active development of enhancements.' Also quality of support ('much improved').

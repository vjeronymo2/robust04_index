			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Universities' fears grow about cut in income UNIVERSITY CHIEFS are increasingly concerned that the government's determination to slow the rise in the numbers of higher-education students will lead to cuts in fee income, causing severe financial difficulties for some institutions. Until last week's Autumn Statement, universities expected tuition fees for next year to be increased by at least the rate of inflation, in accordance with the government's policy of encouraging institutions to raise intake to match demand. Mr John Patten, education secretary, announced last week that government funding projections would allow for only a 13 per cent increase in student numbers over the next three years - which is far below most recent estimates of growth and is equivalent to the increase in polytechnic student numbers for last year alone. Mr Patten has also asked the Higher Education Funding Council to use its funding leverage to give greater incentives for recruitment to engineering and science courses. The council is considering 'adjustments' to the fee structure for next year and is having intensive discussions with Department of Education officials. At present, the government pays universities Pounds 1,855 for each undergraduate on a classroom-based course, Pounds 2,770 for those on laboratory-based courses, and Pounds 4,985 for clinical courses. In 1987 universities received only Pounds 556 per student for all types of courses. The partial shift from block grants to fees was a deliberate attempt to boost numbers and make higher education more responsive to demand. It has been so successful, particularly among the former polytechnics, that in some institutions a third or more of students are already funded by fees alone and are beyond the numbers covered by the block grant. Mr John Stoddart, principal of Sheffield Hallam university, said he was 'worried' about reform of the fee structure. He said: 'If they are aiming to choke off supply, fairly drastic changes will be needed. It will be difficult for the funding council to dampen down expectations which the government has built up over several years.' Dr David Harrison, chairman of the committee of vice-chancellors, said he was 'concerned at a sudden and possibly ill-thought-out change which will cause considerable planning difficulties all round, and very serious problems for institutions relying on expansion to fund capital projects'. The Higher Education Funding Council's most likely course of action is to allow a nil or tiny increase in overall fee levels, with a larger differential between classroom and laboratory courses. One vice-chancellor speculated that if that failed to stifle growth, the council might be forced back to slashing fee levels and fining institutions taking 'too many' students.</p>

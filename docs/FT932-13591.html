			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM's German unit records its first annual loss IBM Deutschland yesterday recorded its first annual loss as a result of recession, weak prices and restructuring. The company recorded a net loss of DM443m (Dollars 277m) for 1992. The costs of restructuring the company, which entailed dividing IBM Deutschland into several independent companies under the umbrella of the holding company, as well as reducing the workforce, totalled DM892m.

However, total revenue from services showed a small increase, from DM3.8bn to DM3.9bn. Software and services now account for 41 per cent of total domestic revenue. IBM Deutschland believes it was lulled into a sense of false confidence once the Berlin Wall was removed in November 1989. 'With unification we had a boom. Large western German companies were ordering from us. Investment in eastern Germany was high on the agenda of the business community in western Germany,' said a senior IBM official.

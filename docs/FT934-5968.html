			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils savaged Opec's move to hold its output ceiling at 24.5m barrels a day drew gasps of despair from oil sector specialists and was accompanied by a steep slide in oil shares. The oil sector was easily the worst performer in the FT-SE Actuaries indices, posting a 0.5 per cent decline, against the FT-SE 100's near 1 per cent rise. Crude oil prices, already sliding before the Opec meeting in Vienna, came under relentless pressure yesterday, retreating to around the Dollars 14 a barrel level at one point, the lowest for around five years. Many analysts adopted an extremely bearish view of the short and medium-term outlook for oil prices, saying that the current situation bears a striking resemblance to that of 1986 when Opec failed to get a grip on supply and crude prices fell to around Dollars 8 to Dollars 9 a barrel. Specialists said that although weak oil prices would inevitably impact on the majors, it would be the exploration and production stocks, such as Lasmo and Enterprise, which would suffer the most. Traders pointed out that Lasmo was by far the most heavily traded stock in the oil sector yesterday, with turnover reaching 13.5m - the highest single day's trade since early October. Lasmo lost 6 to 128p. 'Lasmo's final dividend is now under extreme threat,' said one analyst, who pointed out that the company had emphasised it would maintain the payment 'barring extenuating circumstances'. 'It is very likely that we will be looking at extenuating circumstances,' was the view of the analyst. Enterprise Oil shares were equally mauled, closing 15 1/2 lower at 439 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 1.5m. BP, vulnerable to weak oil prices, performed creditably, closing only marginally easier at 342p, while Shell slipped 3 to 684p.</p>

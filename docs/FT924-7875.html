			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HK at another high as Nikkei recoups loss A CALL for lower interest rates by a government official bolstered sentiment, and the Nikkei average recouped an initial loss on late afternoon buying by investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei finished 58.78 up at 16,376.93. Traders had braced themselves as foreign selling and margin unwinding sent the index closer to the 16,000 psychological level; but it bottomed out at 16,089.37 after Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said short-term money market rates were too high. It attained the day's high of 16,449.45 just before the close. Volume remained flat, at 200m shares against 201m. In spite of the recovery in the Nikkei, declines still led advances by 586 to 309, with 186 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost a net 1.45 at 1,246.88, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.26 at 1,005.82. Some traders attributed the last-minute rise in share prices to options-related trading ahead of today's settlement of stock index options. Dealers' short-term trading revived theme stocks, which had declined in the morning. Green Cross, the day's most active issue, rose Y20 to Y1,280. Sega Enterprises, the game manufacturer, was one of the bright spots, moving ahead Y80 to Y9,150. Investors were encouraged by speculation of a good rise in profits for the current year. After the market closed, Sega reported an 83.4 per cent jump in pre-tax profits for the first half and a 91.3 per cent increase in sales. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 195.04 to 17,637.20 in volume of 30.6m shares, its fifth consecutive fall, on stop-loss selling and margin-unwinding. The Nagoya Stock Exchange announced that three brokerage houses - Kyoritsu Securities, Chuo Securities, and Ace Securities - will withdraw from options trading on the exchange, taking the number of withdrawals to 10. Cost-cutting may lead to further decreases in the number of brokers trading options on the NSE. Roundup ANOTHER mixed day for the Pacific Basin region was again featured by the Hong Kong market. Taiwan was closed because of a public holiday. HONG KONG rose to its second consecutive record high as confidence in future Hong Kong profits outweighed worries over current Sino-British friction. The Hang Seng index recouped an early fall before ending 25.05 ahead at 6,447.11 in brisk turnover of HKDollars 4.25bn. HSBC Holdings, which placed HKDollars 5bn in new stock on Wednesday, led turnover at HKDollars 446m as it closed 50 cents lower at HKDollars 67. Hutchison Whampoa and Cheong Kong were active on persistent rumours that the former is planning a substantial placing. Hutchison added 40 cents at HKDollars 17.50, while Cheong Kong dipped 20 cents to HKDollars 22.90. A Hutchison spokesman declined to comment on any placing. AUSTRALIA dropped to a 21-month low as a rise in October unemployment to 11.3 per cent from September's 10.8 per cent came in way above expectations and soured sentiment. After gaining 5 in early trading, the All Ordinaries index closed 19.2 down at 1,375.3 in turnover of ADollars 226.3m. News Corp defied the trend, climbing 30 cents to ADollars 27 on the back of New York's overnight gains and reports that Merrill Lynch had added the stock to its research list. TNT, down heavily on Tuesday, recovered 2 cents to 57 cents. SEOUL fell for the third day on profit-taking. The composite index lost 21.97 to 636.99 in Won64.6bn turnover, against Won97.8bn. Selling centred on heavily weighted Kepco and other large-capitalisation shares. Kepco and Posco shed Won1,000 each to go limit-down, closing at Won20,300 and Won25,700 respectively. BANGKOK declined across the board as finance and securities firms heeded a request by the Bank of Thailand to reduce lending to investors. The SET index fell 22.24, or 2.4 per cent, to 914.88 in turnover of Bt9.81bn, the biggest daily loss since May and thinnest trade in three weeks. KUALA LUMPUR swept to a higher close after a mild correction in recent days. The composite index put on 5.43 at 652.23 in 233m-share volume. NEW ZEALAND ended broadly firmer in spite of softness in Australia. The NZSE-40 index rose 9.14 to 1,405.96 in turnover of NZDollars 18m. BOMBAY saw widespread gains after the BSE board imposed restrictions on sales to halt a market slide. The BSE Index added 45.28 at 2,641.81.</p>

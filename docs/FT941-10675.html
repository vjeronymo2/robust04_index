			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft board 'not at fault' The supervisory board of Metallgesellschaft was not at fault in failing to prevent the events which led to the near collapse of the German mining, metals and industrial group last month, a senior banker said yesterday. Ms Ellen Schneider-Lenne, a member of the Deutsche Bank management board, said this would become obvious at Metallgesellschaft's extraordinary meeting on February 24. At this meeting Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the supervisory board chairman and a colleague of Ms Schneider-Lenne on the board of the Deutsche Bank, will break his silence about events leading up to the dismissal of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, former chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, and other directors in December. Ms Schneider-Lenne refused to give details about what Mr Schmitz would reveal but maintained that the Metallgesellschaft affair 'was not a question of the supervisory board going wrong'. She said she expected the Metallgesellschaft affair to act as a catalyst to a debate on corporate governance within Germany similar to that in the UK in the wake of a number of corporate crashes in the late 1980s. Ms Schneider-Lenne, who is a non-executive director of ICI, the UK-based chemicals group, said German companies could learn from best practice in the Anglo-Saxon world. Whereas German supervisory boards normally meet no more than four times a year, UK boards - including non-executive directors - tend to meet 10 times a year. Members of supervisory boards should devote more time to these mandates and should sit on fewer boards than they do at present, Ms Schneider-Lenne argued. Germans are allowed to hold a legal maximum of 10 such directorships but Ms Schneider-Lenne said she had refused to take on more than four. Supervisory board members should be aggressive in requiring managing board members to provide information when this was not forthcoming. There was a case for establishing the formal institution of the audit committee in Germany as in the UK. The near failure of Germany's fourteenth-largest industrial group has led to criticism of Mr Schmitz and colleagues on the supervisory board who voted unanimously to extend Mr Schimmelbusch's contract for five years shortly before he was ousted. It has led to criticism of the German corporate governance system which divides responsibility for a company between the management, which takes operating decisions, and the supervisory board which is responsible for overseeing management performance.</p>

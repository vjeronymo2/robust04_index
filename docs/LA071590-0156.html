			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: FIVE WEEKS THAT WERE ARE TOUGH TO ACCEPT  </P> <P> Five weeks out of the country can do strange things to a guy.  </P> <P> When I left for the World Cup, evidently I lost all touch with what was going  on back home. For example, I just got a phone call from my friend, Kay Talk.  This is not her real name. I call her Kay Talk because she talks more than an  all-news radio station.  </P> <P> "Glad you're back," Kay said. "Did you enjoy the soccer?"  </P> <P> "Yeah," I said. "Did you?"  </P> <P> "Oh, sure," she said. "I especially liked the game where somebody scored a  goal. I forget when it was. June-something."  </P> <P> "So, what else is new?" I made the mistake of asking.  </P> <P> "Well, how about all those no-hitters?" Kay asked.  </P> <P> "What no-hitters?"  </P> <P> "Whaddaya mean, 'What no-hitters?' Seven of them. Seven no-hitters."  </P> <P> "Get outta here."  </P> <P> "No, seriously."  </P> <P> "There haven't been seven no-hitters in seven years," I said.  </P> <P> "Wanna bet?"  </P> <P> "Yeah? No-hitters by who?"  </P> <P> "Whom. Well, Fernando, for one."  </P> <P> "Fernando whom?"  </P> <P> "Who. Whaddaya mean, 'Fernando who?' How many Fernandos you know?"  </P> <P> "Well, you can't mean Valenzuela."  </P> <P> "Why not?"  </P> <P> "Because before I left, Fernando Valenzuela couldn't have no-hit Bakersfield."  </P> <P> "Well, he no-hit St. Louis," Kay said.  </P> <P> "St. Louis who?"  </P> <P> "And Nolan Ryan threw a no-hitter, too."  </P> <P> "That I believe."  </P> <P> "That guy is RoboPitcher, man."  </P> <P> "Who else?"  </P> <P> "Uh, Andy Hawkins threw one."  </P> <P> "In what league?"  </P> <P> "Against the White Sox. Except he lost, 4-0."  </P> <P> "A guy threw a no-hitter and lost, 4-0? I don't understand."  </P> <P> "He pitches for the Yankees."  </P> <P> "Now I understand."  </P> <P> "Oh, and then there were the Perez brothers."  </P> <P> "What about the Perez brothers?"  </P> <P> "Melido Perez of the White Sox threw a no-hitter, just like his brother Pascual  once did."  </P> <P> "Two brothers threw no-hitters?"  </P> <P> "Yeah. Isn't that the weirdest thing you've ever heard?"  </P> <P> "Are they Siamese twins?"  </P> <P> "No."  </P> <P> "Then it's not the weirdest thing I've ever heard."  </P> <P> "Neither game went longer than seven innings."  </P> <P> "Did Melido's involve the Yankees?"  </P> <P> "Yes."  </P> <P> "If you had to play for the Yankees, would you want to play longer than seven  innings?"  </P> <P> "Good point."  </P> <P> "Anything else happen?"  </P> <P> "Well, Whitey Herzog quit."  </P> <P> "As manager of the St. Louis Cardinals?"  </P> <P> "No, as manager of a 7-Eleven. Of course as manager of the St. Louis  Cardinals."  </P> <P> "Why? Because they got no-hit by Fernando?"  </P> <P> "I don't think so. Oh, and Jack McKeon's not the manager in San Diego anymore."  </P> <P> "Did he trade himself?"  </P> <P> "No. But there was a rumor that San Diego was going to trade for Bo Jackson."  </P> <P> "In what sport?"  </P> <P> "Baseball."  </P> <P> "Well, I don't blame them. Bo's an All-Star."  </P> <P> "No, he isn't."  </P> <P> "He isn't?"  </P> <P> "No, Bo didn't make the All-Star team. Matter of fact, nobody who's anybody  made the All-Star team."  </P> <P> "Who did make the All-Star team?"  </P> <P> "Jeff Brantley. Gregg Olson. Some other Greg Olson. Rob Dibble. Sandy Alomar.  Jack Armstrong . . . "  </P> <P> "No, seriously."  </P> <P> "I am serious."  </P> <P> "You picked those names out of the phone book."  </P> <P> "No, I picked those names out of the All-Star game box score."  </P> <P> "I've heard of more guys on the Argentine soccer team."  </P> <P> "I'll bet."  </P> <P> "Was it a no-hitter?"  </P> <P> "No, but you're close."  </P> <P> "How did Devon White do?"  </P> <P> "Devon White's in the minors."  </P> <P> "How about Mark Langston?"  </P> <P> "Langston's won four games."  </P> <P> "What place are the Angels in -- eighth?"  </P> <P> "They're still behind Oakland and the White Sox."  </P> <P> "The White Sox?"  </P> <P> "Yeah. Even Oakland was behind the White Sox last week."  </P> <P> "Uh oh. Those White Sox must be fixing things with the gamblers again."  </P> <P> "What?"  </P> <P> "Have any Oakland players come into a lot of money lately?"  </P> <P> "Well, Jose Canseco did get $23.5 million."  </P> <P> "From Oakland? Oakland doesn't have $23.5 million. If Oakland had $23.5  million, it would have pro football."  </P> <P> Kay said: "That's about all you missed while you were gone."  </P> <P> "OK."  </P> <P> "I assume you already heard about Pat Riley quitting the Lakers, Hale Irwin  winning the U.S. Open and Martina Navratilova winning Wimbledon."  </P> <P> "Yeah, right," I said. "And Magic Johnson joined the Peace Corps, Jack Nicklaus  became a Hare Krishna and Steffi Graf is mud-wrestling at the Tropicana."  </P> <P> "No, seriously."  </P> <P> "Sure."  </P> <P> "And did you hear about the trouble in Detroit?"  </P> <P> "Did it have anything to do with the Perez brothers?" I asked.  </P></p>

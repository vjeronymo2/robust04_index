			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / BBC to review subscription service's future THE FUTURE of BBC Select, the corporation's specialist commercial subscription service, is to be reviewed at next week's meeting of the BBC board of management. The review is on the agenda for Thursday's meeting, the first time BBC Select has been looked at in detail since Mr John Birt took over as BBC director-general at the beginning of the year. BBC Select, part of the BBC's education directorate, broadcasts specialist services for business people, accountants and lawyers in the middle of the night to specially adapted video recorders. It has developed more slowly than originally expected. It cost between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m to set up and has running costs of Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m a year. Accountancy Television, the service for accountants launched in October, has fallen behind projections, and investors holding 40 per cent of shares have written them off on their books. The service for lawyers, Legal Network Television, says it is ahead of target. Apart from subscription services, which are scrambled so that only those who pay can see them, there are also openly broadcast services, such as those run by BMH Communications. BMH broadcasts events such as annual meetings. The review of BBC Select is taking place against a background of cost-cutting throughout the BBC, where all the commercial activities are being looked at carefully. Some BBC Select staff fear that closure could be an option, although senior executives think this unlikely. Another possibility is that BBC Select will provide more training and education programmes, and that plans for leisure subscription services, such as one on yachting, will be delayed further. Mr John Radcliffe, managing director of BBC Select, said yesterday: 'We are well into negotiations for at least four new services - for the computer industry, small businesses, French language training and arts performance.' Some of the new services could be launched early next year. BBC Select was set up to make use of the corporation's night hours. During Baroness Thatcher's premiership, there were fears the night hours might be given to the commercial sector.</p>

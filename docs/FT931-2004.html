			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (14): Faster and cheaper data links - Wide Area Networks WIDE area networks (WANs), using high-speed private or public telecommunications lines, are common among large organisations needing an efficient and cheap method of information exchange between head office and branches. There are various means of achieving the links using multiplexers, modems and packet switched technologies. The transport mechanisms used by most companies requiring a degree of information security are leased circuits from Mercury or BT (eg KiloStream or MegaStream) for point-to-point connections or X25 for multi-site connections. Choice is largely dependent on distance between the various sites, traffic volumes and data transfer rates needed. However, with downsizing driving the move towards multiple LANs and distributed computing, it is unlikely that the traditional WAN will be able to cope. Increasingly, computer-users need to be able to work on collaborative projects and communicate with colleagues as easily as if they were sitting at the next desk, no matter where they are located and no matter how many network gateways, bridges and servers they have to be routed through. Interconnection with seamless, real-time inter-operability are key. The Enterprise Wide Network (EWN) of tomorrow will, then, need to be based on high-speed transport mechanisms capable of providing the aggregate network bandwidth required for increasingly popular workgroup applications such as CAD/CAM and real-time full-colour multimedia, as well as corporate workflow applications such as video-conferencing, multiple messaging services and EDI (electronic data interchange). That data communications will increase for most organisations there appears no doubt. This is highlighted by a report published by network specialists 3Com, entitled The Myth of the Global Village, which shows that 81 per cent of companies expect their data communications across Europe will increase over the next 12 months, with 20 per cent expecting an increase of over 100 per cent. Tom Plimmer, managing director of 3Com UK notes: 'Few have the network infrastructure capable of supporting that expansion. Very soon, companies will find themselves facing unforeseen and therefore unmanageable and very costly network growth.' The answer? 'Rather than be overwhelmed and held back by over complex implementations, they will need to form new partnerships with (networking) suppliers and integrators,' he says. Don Parry, manager of customer systems, Mercury Communications, agrees: 'It is even more important now that integrated voice and data solutions are, at last, deliverable. The WAN marketplace has been very fragmented, with some market leaders going through some disturbing periods of instability. 'What customers need to do is follow the example of organisations like BT and Mercury and look for partners with a solid foundation they can have confidence in, can understand their business aspirations and can offer flexible, standards compliant solutions.' IF the Enterprise Wide Network is set to become the central nervous system without which no corporate body will be able to function nor grow, what are the standards-compliant, multiplexed broadband solutions of the future? Most R&amp;D investment, it seems, is being directed towards Frame Relay, ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy). Market research organisation, Frost &amp; Sullivan, believes that it is these more robust OSI (Opens Systems Interconnect) standards, when finalised, that will take market share from currently available but functionally limited standards like TCP/IP (Transaction Control Program/Internet Protocol) and SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). According to a new Frost &amp; Sullivan report,* fast packet switching, as it is generically known, is forecast to rise in value from USDollars 74m in 1992 to more than USDollars 2bn by the end of 1997. Within that period, shipments of frame relay are set to treble from the current value of USDollars 166.5m. Because of its ability to switch both voice, data, image and video, analysts forecast that the European market for ATM/cell relay technology will grow even more dramatically, rising from USDollars 51m in 1992 to over USDollars 1.17bn by 1997. Frame relay is ideal for complex, geographically dispersed networks. Based on Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) standards, frame relay enables WAN managers to consolidate traffic from multiple protocol environments over a single circuit. Above all, it provides bandwidth on demand at speeds over ten times faster than X25 packet switching. Steve Priestley, UK sales manager at Dynatech Communications, says: 'We firmly believe that frame relay will become the network of the future because it has so many obvious advantages. It enables different applications and protocols to be transported transparently across the network. Coupled with this, it reduces bandwidth costs and can offer substantial savings to heavy networks users.' Private network managers have been among the first to consolidate traffic over existing lines with frame relay, according to Robert McGuire, technical director at Ascom Timeplex. This, he says, is 'because the capital investment pays off quickly and the additional cost of adding more facilities that need more bandwidth is delayed. If connecting remote locations to the backbone involves fairly high leased line charges then public frame relay becomes an attractive alternative.' But as promising as frame relay is, says McGuire, it is no panacea - 'like all technologies, it provides dramatic benefits where it is deployed in the correct setting to achieve realistic goals. 'Frame relay is ideal for WAN traffic originating from LANs, but it is not deemed appropriate, for example, for time-critical transfer of financial information, where point-to-point leased lines would be a better, more secure option.' Similarly, 'X25 packet switching would provide ample throughput rates where the network consists primarily of cluster controllers for host terminal or other low-speed transmissions.' ATM makes the ultimate goal of seamless enterprise wide networks a reality, say its proponents, because it means there is no longer any need to run two separate and non-interlinked networks. The only problem with ATM is that the CCITT standards have not been yet finalised. Nevertheless, the 150 members of the ATM Forum are pressing ahead with systems developments that can be upgraded in the field via software. The first implementations will be on private networks. It will then take 18 months before ATM is generally available. Only then, it is said, will the bandwagon effect take over. By launching a very low-cost ATM LAN solution, SynOptics aims to be at the forefront of that. Product line manager, Robert Newman, cites the benefits of ATM when it becomes available at WAN level: Massive performance increases, with high-speed dedicated connections and high aggregate network bandwidth. Flexible breakthroughs, with scalable end-node connection speed, scaleable aggregate network bandwidth; and global workgroups through WANS. Data and real-time multi-media support. Standards shared by local and public network vendors. Enhanced management and control. Newman adds: 'The initial drive for ATM is coming from graphics-intensive users on LANs who, individually, may only need file transfer at 10Mbps but, collectively, need 100Mbps or more if bottlenecks are not to bring projects to a grinding halt. 'With an X25 WAN you drop down to 56Kbps and that does not make sense. ATM provides 155Mbits per second.' There are a number of initiatives underway. For example, GPT, Siemens and BT are set to deploy Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), heralded as the first evolutionary step towards ATM broadband networks of tomorrow. AT&amp;T, Cisco and Stratacom have just announced that they will be working together to launch products for the first public full ATM service in the UK. Northern Telecom believes that the ability to support both narrowband and wideband applications within a consolidated network of the future is crucial, hence the development of Magellan Passport. Its frame-switching capabilities within an open architecture deliver cost-effective bandwidth utilisation for data communications, while its cell capabilities allow consolidation of bursty, high-speed data with delay-sensitive voice and video. * The European Market for Frame Relay and Broadband, E1737, USDollars 3,500</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Voters cool on council reforms VOTERS in Derbyshire and Durham have delivered an embarrassing rebuff to the English local government review. People in both counties told MORI pollsters working for the government-appointed Local Government Commission that they preferred the status quo of two-tier county and district councils to the commission's proposals for reform. Last month Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, told the commission that he expected it to recommend a change from the present tiers of local government to unitary authorities even if that involved extra costs in some cases. The findings appear to bolster the view of the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils that the case for change has not been made. The commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, had advocated creating two unitary authorities in each county. But in Durham 56 per cent favoured the status quo. Nine per cent favoured the commission's recommendation, with 39 per cent supporting the principle of unitary authorities. Derbyshire produced a less clear-cut result, with 39 per cent giving the status quo as their first preference. Second with 11 per cent was the commission's recommendation of two unitary authorities.</p>

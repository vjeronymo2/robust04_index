			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Clark shoe board argued over new equity ATTEMPTS to introduce a foreign investor brought to a head the boardroom row at C&amp;J Clark, one of Britain's largest private companies, and resulted in calls for the chairman's dismissal. The disclosure that Mr Walter Dickson, who became chairman in July last year, sought to introduce a big foreign equity partner was made in a letter to shareholders sent out on Monday night. The company is currently in talks over a possible Pounds 150m bid backed by Electra Investment Trust. The foreign investor proposed by Mr Dickson was to have provided between Pounds 20m and Pounds 40m to pay for rationalisation in return for 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the shares. This would have diluted existing investors, including the 70 per cent held by the Clark family. The letter claims Mr Dickson 'explicitly stated' that 'without this equity injection, the company would be likely to fail'. However, a spokesman for Clark strenuously denies that the chairman ever made such a statement. The letter was compiled by four directors, who claim to represent a majority of the 500 family shareholders, in preparation for the extraordinary general meeting on October 16. The rebel board members are proposing to replace Mr Dickson, only the second non-family chairman in 167 years, and Mr James Power, a non-executive director. The letter reveals that Clark, Britain's largest shoe manufacturer, warned in August that profits would fall substantially in the year to January 31, 1993. The company, like many other UK shoe manufacturers, has been caught out by recession, cheaper imports and sharply higher rents and rates. However, the rebels say failure to act on recommendations made by consultants McKinsey &amp; Co as early as 1988 has also contributed to Clark's decline. For example, the consultants forecast that Clark could achieve big savings from imported shoes and uppers. Yet, 'less than half of the McKinsey planned savings had been achieved by 1991'. The company still manufactures 60 per cent of its output in the UK. The rebels say they have been thwarted in attempts to introduce management to address the problems of trading performance and product improvement.</p>

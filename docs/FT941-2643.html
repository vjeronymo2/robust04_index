			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Anglian Grp shares slip 10% A warning yesterday from Anglian Group that full year profits were unlikely to meet market expectations prompted a 10 per cent fall in the double glazing company's share price to 287p. The Norwich-based group has been hit by a fall-off in orders following the privatisation of the Property Services Agency, which represented 75 per cent of its commercial business, and increased research and development expenditure. Mr David Herman, group finance director, said: 'Trading in the commercial division has been disappointing. Both turnover and margins have suffered.' He claimed, however, that the 28p fall in the share price was 'totally unjustified'. Although Anglian admitted that orders placed by the PSA's successors were negligible, it said that its retail business had picked up and it had won new commercial business from local authorities. 'Business is now being placed solely on price rather than quality,' said Mr Herman. Following his statement, analysts downgraded full year profit forecasts by 6 per cent to Pounds 25m.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SHIRLEY, YOU JEST!  </P> <P> Shirley MacLaine will be able to tap her enthusiasm for spiritualism --  comedically -- when she starts "Waiting for the Light," an Ed Pressman  production scheduled to begin filming in Seattle in April.  </P> <P> Written and directed by Welshman Chris Monger, the story's about a mom, two  pre-teen kids and great-aunt MacLaine, who move to a small Midwest town in 1962  to run a diner and lead a quiet life. When they move in next door to the  meanest man in town, the kids decide to scare him to death with the help of  aunty -- a former carny who dabbled in phony spiritualism. She concocts a  dazzling illusion, convincing the man he's had a "visitation" and turning the  town into a latter-day Lourdes.  </P> <P> Co-producer Caldecot Chubb calls the film "a comedy about the need for faith in  society . . . a positive, emotional comedy."

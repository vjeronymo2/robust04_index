Meng Fulin, chairman of the provincial people's congress  Standing Committee, presided over a plenary meeting on the  morning of 22 February. Present at the meeting were Vice  Chairmen of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee  Shao Ming, Liu Guangcai, Lu Shengdao, Wu Changqi, Lu Zixiu,  Jiang Zehui, and Chen Jiyu as well as Secretary-General Lu  Desheng. Present as non-voting delegates were Wang Yang, vice  governor of Anhui; Han Yunping, president of the provincial  higher people's court; Liu Sheng, chief procurator of the  provincial people's procuratorate; and persons in charge of city  and county people's congress Standing Committees and perfectural  people's congress Liaison Committees.    The meeting heard explanations by Jiang Dexin, vice chairman  of the Rural Economic Work Committee of the provincial people's  congress Standing Committee, and by Hou Yukun, vice chairman of  the Legislative Affairs Committee of the provincial people's  congress Standing Committee, on revision of the drafts of the  "Regulations of Anhui Province for Handling Disputes Over Land  Use Rights" and the "Regulations of Anhui Province on the  Protection of Minors" respectively.    Zheng Zikuan, director of the provincial Department of  Agriculture, explained the draft of the "Procedures of Anhui  Province for Implementing the `Agrotechnique Diffusion Law'" on  behalf of the provincial people's government. He said: The  utility rate of agrotechnical achievements is low, and many  major agrotechnical achievements have not yet been widely used  in Anhui Province. This has become a major factor impeding  further development of Anhui's agriculture and rural economy.  For this reason, it is necessary for us to sum up our own  practical experience, learn from others' experience of success  both at home and abroad, and formulate local regulations for  agrotechnical diffusion which suit the conditions of this  province so as to ensure sustained agricultural development and  rural prosperity in this province.    Huang Rongzong, vice chairman of the Financial and Economic  Committee of the provincial people's congress Standing  Committee, explained the drafts of four regulations and  provisions concerning the Wuhu Economic and Technological  Development Zone. He stated: Since its promulgation, the  "Regulations on the Wuhu Economic and Technological Development  Zone," adopted by the sixth session of the provincial people's  congress Standing Committee, has played a guiding, promoting,  and protecting role. However, the "regulations" deal more with  principles. In view of the current situation and  contradictions, we are urgently in need of more clear and  definite legislation governing land management, the sale and  transfer of land use rights, construction planning, project  examination and approval, enterprise registration, and labor  management in foreign-funded enterprises. The new legislation  will certainly promote further development of the economic and  technological development zone, improve the investment  environment there, improve the rules and regulations for the  development zone, and accelerate the process of attracting  foreign investment in the development zone.    The revised draft of the "Regulations of Anhui Province for  Handling Disputes Over Land Use Rights" was examined and  discussed at small group meetings in the afternoon.</p>

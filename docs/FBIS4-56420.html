			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, 3 May (EFE) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro  has said, "The aggression the Cuban people have suffered because  of the U.S. embargo has been an encouragement for them."    In an interview published in the latest issue of the Spanish  weekly LA TRIBUNA, the Cuban leader said: "The blockade has  caused billions of dollars in losses to our country's economy.  We estimate them at $10 billion."    Castro said, "If we have been able to resist for 35 years,  we  can certainly resist another 25," adding, "The United States and  the industrialized countries have always dictated economic and  trade policy to poor countries."    The revolutionary leader said he expects no significant  change in U.S. policy toward Cuba, because "it has preferred to  continue harassing the island with an economic boycott that in  no way benefits the United States but, rather, seriously hurts  Cuba's civilian population."    Castro said he believes "an end to the blockade would only  help Cuba in terms of medical equipment and the pharmaceutical  industry," because "the United States has increasingly less to  offer Cuba."    As for payment of the foreign debt, the Cuban president  said,  "The debt should be forgiven because this would benefit the  United States, international trade, and all other countries." He  added, "I am certain that the U.S. foreign debt is larger than  that of all Latin American countries put together."    Fidel Castro also said, "A nearly unanimous consensus is  building on the issue of the foreign debt and the impossibility  of paying it, particularly in terms of the unjust and  intolerable demands imposed on Third World countries by  organizations such as the IMF and U.S. banks."    The Cuban leader, 67, said he has no worries about his  country's fate after he departs from the presidency because  there are "many people prepared to ensure continuity in our  country, a country that is developing day by day through the  efforts of genuine Cubans."</p>

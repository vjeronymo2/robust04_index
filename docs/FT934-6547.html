			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Nesco Nesco Investments is selling 70 per cent of its Nigerian interests to its chairman and managing director and is to concentrate on its software side. The name is to be changed to DCS Group. It has also announced pre-tax profits up from Pounds 222,313 to Pounds 231,406 for the year to June 30. The results of its Nigerian offshoot were excluded on the grounds that the recent political unrest meant that Nesco had diminished control. The consideration is Pounds 180,000 cash. Nesco also has an option to sell the remaining 30 per cent for Pounds 90,000 within five years. In the year to May 31 the Nigerian company showed a pre-tax profit of N2.85m (Pounds 55,000). The book value at June 30 was Pounds 152,517. The sale will realise about Pounds 115,000 for working capital. Turnover for the year was Pounds 5.55m, against Pounds 5.31m, which included Pounds 425,000 from the Nigerian side. Earnings per share were 2.92p (2.45p).</p>

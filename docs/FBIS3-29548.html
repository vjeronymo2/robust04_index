			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The U.S. ambassador to Phnom Penh, Mr. Twining,  hastily provided the two-headed government with medical aid on  18 February. The bulk of this was surgical equipment and  medicine. This was emergency assistance to the two-headed  government's raiding forces, who have been engaged in major  military operations especially at Anlung Veng and have suffered  heavy casualties. Their many wounded are being treated at all  the hospitals. The United States must stop interfering in  Cambodia and desist from continuing to kindle the communist  Vietnamese war of aggression in Cambodia.    Which is more beneficial: kindling the flames of war or  letting Cambodians achieve national conciliation? The Cambodian  people need national conciliation. They are resolutely opposed  to all forms of aggressive war, wherever they may come from.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> TRICK OR TREAT: On Halloween, Sire Records is releasing "Where the Pyramid  Meets the Eye," a tribute to Roky Erickson, one of rock's great outcast  eccentrics. Put together by Warner Records staffer (and Texas-rock maven) Bill  Bentley, the album features 20 Erickson covers by such disparate fans as ZZ Top  and Jesus &amp; Mary Chain (who both do "Reverberation"), R.E.M. ("I Walked  with a Zombie"), Doug Sahm and Sons ("You're Gonna Miss Me"), T-Bone Burnett  ("Nothing in Return"), Poi Dog Pondering ("I Had to Tell You") and BH Surfers  ("Earthquake").  </P> <P> The profits from the album's song publishing are earmarked for a trust fund for  Erickson's mental care. . . . Speaking of Poi Dog Pondering, the Austin-based  band can also be heard on an upcoming episode of David Lynch and Mark Frost's  "American Chronicles." The group recorded seven new instrumentals for the show,  titled "Guns for Hire," which chronicles a recent Soldier of Fortune magazine  convention in Las Vegas.  </P></p>

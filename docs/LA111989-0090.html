			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEALING WITH 'MINIDORMS'  </P> <P> San Diego is not a college town in the sense of Berkeley or Iowa City. But San  Diego State University and UC San Diego still dominate their immediate  communities.  </P> <P> At UCSD, 38% of the 17,600 students live on campus, the second-highest  proportion of any public university in the state, and the university plans to  increase that to 50% as it grows. But only 7% of SDSU's 35,000 students live on  campus. More than 5,000 others live within a mile of it, mostly in apartments,  but increasingly in single-family homes.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, this has caused parking, traffic and noise problems,  exacerbated by some landlords who rent to large groups, turning two-, three-  and four-bedroom homes into "minidorms." Thus far, attempts to control  minidorms have been mostly ineffective. Zoning restrictions limiting the number  of residents in a home, based on the size of bedrooms, the number of baths and  the amount of off-street parking, are difficult to enforce.  </P> <P> Now some city officials and community leaders want to revive a concept struck  down by the state Supreme Court in 1980 and impose different standards on  "traditional" and "nontraditional" families. The city attorney's office is  working on a measure that would impose stricter parking requirements on  households of unrelated people. A citywide planning group wants to prohibit  more than three unrelated people from living together in single-family  neighborhoods. Proponents hope today's more conservative court would rule  differently than the 1980 court.  </P> <P> But both proposals are inherently unfair and violate individual rights as much  today as 10 years ago. They are also likely to be as difficult to police as the  current zoning restrictions. And, in the country's least affordable rental  market, any restrictions on unrelated people sharing quarters would only make a  bad housing problem worse.  </P> <P> Cal State San Marcos may bring some relief, and the SDSU foundation plans to  develop more student housing. But there will always be students wanting to live  in single-family homes, and the city needs to find better ways to enforce  zoning and parking restrictions. One promising proposal would treat rental  properties as the business they are and require landlords to obtain permits.  This makes more sense than the city trying to define a family.  </P></p>

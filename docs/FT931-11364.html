			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Attack on notorious fire rules: Home Office THE MAIN item on the Home Office agenda is streamlining fire regulations, which have been notoriously onerous for some businesses. Action might be some way off, however, as the department is having to await publication of the latest European Community regulations later in the year. Moves are expected on Sunday trading regulations, but the timing is uncertain. Options will be put to the Commons, but this is unlikely to happen until the next session of parliament. Immigration controls are to be eased for business travellers, but implementation is also some way off. Other proposals cover reform of the licensing laws with the introduction licences that would allow children to go into pubs when accompanied by adults. In gambling, off-course betting for summer horse racing and the relaxation of bingo advertising regulations have already been announced. Changes in the way pools and lotteries operate are included in the Lotteries Bill before parliament.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / International Company News: Dofasco takes CDollars 202m charge for restructuring DOFASCO, one of Canada's two biggest steel makers, has taken a CDollars 202m (USDollars 159m) special charge to cover restructuring costs over the next 18 months and has reported a heavy loss for 1992. The charge will cover the shutdown of 3m tonnes of older capacity this summer at Hamilton, near Toronto. Dofasco's payroll will be reduced from 8,700 to 6,400 by early 1994 and its raw steel capacity will drop to 3m tonnes produced at its most modern and efficient plant. The company is also moving ahead with detailed planning for a joint venture mini-mill project, to be located in Canada or the US. Its partner has been widely reported as Co-Steel, a mini-mill specialist which controls Sheerness Steel in Britain. But Dofasco has resolutely refused to identify the partner. Final net losses came to CDollars 207m, or CDollars 2.96 a share, for 1992, against losses of CDollars 25m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. Turnover slipped to CDollars 1.95bn from CDollars 2.1bn. Dofasco said prices have begun to improve, costs would decline further in 1993 and a lower Canadian dollar is helping recovery.</p>

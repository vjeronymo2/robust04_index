			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 202. As we noted in paragraph 86 of the Notice, Big LEO systems may not be used in lieu of emergency beacons required to be carried by statute or treaty. In response to Comsat's request, we note that Big LEO systems cannot now be used to comply with the requirements of the GMDSS. The requirements for GMDSS equipment and the approval process are contained in &sect;&sect;80.1101 and 80.1103, respectively, of the Commission's Rules. <FOOTCITE>285</FOOTCITE>  There are, however, no restrictions prohibiting any Big LEO system from carrying distress and safety communications on an ancillary basis. Finally, in response to Mobile Datacom's request for clarification of whether position determination information can be supplied by an RDSS licensee, we proposed that Big LEO systems be capable of determining the position of a user transceiver, but did not specify how licensees have to derive the position information. We believe that decision is best left to the system provider. In conclusion, we are clarifying the language in Section 25.143(f) regarding a licensee's responsibility to protect distress communications and to make clear that although it is the licensee's responsibility to determine position information of transceivers that we are not prescribing how this must be accomplished. <FOOTCITE>286</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 285 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 47 CFR 80.1101 and 80.1103. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 286 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> TRW states that Big LEO system licensees operating on U.S. territorial waters are required to give priority to distress communications. See TRW Comments at 194. Motorola stated that the requirements of proposed rule section 25.143(f) would apply only for MSS stations used to comply with an international agreement or statute. See Motorola Comments at 68 and Reply Comments at 58. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Other Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 203. As proposed in the Notice and without objection from any interested parties, we will adopt a specific rule that prohibits any licensee from selling a bare license for a profit. <FOOTCITE>287</FOOTCITE>  This provision is critical to discourage speculators and to prevent unjust enrichment of those who do not implement their proposed systems. This provision is not intended to prevent the infusion of capital by either debt or equity financing, but any such transaction will be monitored to ensure that it does not constitute an evasion of our anti-trafficking provision. <FOOTCITE>288</FOOTCITE>  This rule, however, will not apply if auctions are implemented. It is not intended to prohibit applicants who obtain licenses by competitive bidding from negotiating post-auction resale transactions. <FOOTCITE>289</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 287 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Notice, note 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at para. 84. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 288 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Motorola is concerned that one applicant might prop up another simply to guarantee access to the maximum possible spectrum by CDMA operations. This concern can be appropriately addressed as a real party in interest question if the issue arises. Motorola's speculation about a possible future occurrence does not warrant further consideration or action at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 289 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See para. 96,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

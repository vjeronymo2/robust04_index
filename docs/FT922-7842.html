			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: On the runway to wider horizons - Roland Rudd meets the chief of the Irish aircraft leasing group WE ARE a very big British company,' says Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of the Shannon-based aircraft leasing company which is going public next month. Puffing on a large cigar in the Trafalgar Suite of the Ritz Hotel, Mr Ryan, the quintessential Irishman, is undeterred by a look of astonishment. GPA is the third biggest buyer of Rolls-Royce engines and British Aerospace has a 20 per cent stake in its airbus programme, he says. Mr Ryan wants GPA to be listed among the top 100 Footsie stocks in London. At an expected post flotation valuation of Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) the company easily qualifies on size. The fact that GPA is based in Shannon and does not pay tax in the UK has disqualified it from what its chairman calls the 'London Club.' Whatever happens over the listing - and Mr Ryan says he will not allow the issue to go away - the group is unlikely to be referred to as the Irish aircraft leasing company after the flotation. It may move its headquarters to London or at the least upgrade its UK office. Mr Ryan, who is not given to looking pleased with himself, cannot hide his relief that with the pathfinder prospectus out the controversial issues of pricing and persuading shareholders to sign binding agreements not to sell their shares immediately after the sale are mostly behind him. There are still problems ahead, but they are likely to be industry related - which Mr Ryan prefers to talk about. GPA is not like Atlantic Computers, the leasing arm of the now defunct British &amp; Commonwealth, because it specialised in computers which went out of fashion. 'What is today's technology is tomorrow's junk.' But everyone is still going to need aeroplanes. Mr Peter Villa, managing director of the International Bureau of Aviation, which publishes the Residual Value Journal, agrees that the company has been skilled at selling the income stream and aircraft to groups of investors. 'The value of all aircraft has dropped. Values will improve over the next five years. The question is are they strong enough to survive until values improve?' Mr Ryan says he knew what he was doing when GPA began marketing aircraft sales. He is confident that with most analysts forecasting 5 per cent annual growth in air traffic, values of aircraft will improve. He also feels confident enough to dismiss the possible downgrading of GPA's short and long-term debt by Moody, the credit rating agency, which has put the company, along with many others in the airline industry, on credit watch. 'If the sale goes well we are unlikely to be downgraded.' Over the next month Mr Ryan, who prefers the anonymity of his Tipperary home, will be on the road selling the company. 'I feel a bit like Jesus Christ trying to convert people to this business.'</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Greece unveils tough budget Mr Stefanos Manos, the Greek economy minister, yesterday proposed an austerity budget for 1993, aimed at narrowing the economic gap with the rest of the European Community, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The budget projects a primary surplus of 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product but calls for heavily increased spending on interest payments to service the public debt. As a result the central government borrowing requirement will remain at around 7.9 per cent of GDP for another year. Growth in 1993 is forecast at 2 per cent, while year-on-year inflation should come down from 15.5 to 12.3 per cent, making it possible for Greece to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism early in 1994.</p>

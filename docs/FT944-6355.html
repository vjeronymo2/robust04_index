			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Management: Adding value to the UK's tax system - Public Services Management / John Willman meets a civil servant who initiated a radical overhaul of the Inland Revenue Change management, partnership sourcing, empowerment and benchmarking - terms in the argot of modern management science that few would associate with Britain's civil service. Yet the Inland Revenue, one of the oldest government departments, is in the middle of a change programme to rival the most ambitious private-sector corporate re-engineering projects. It will turn upside down the assessment and collection of income tax and other direct taxes, totalling Pounds 77bn in the last financial year, with the aim of hugely improving the quality of service to the public. In the 1980s, the department pulled off one of the most successful large-scale computerisation projects in Europe, without the disruption to service normally associated with such projects in both public and private sectors. It also cut staff numbers from 84,000 in 1979 to around 63,000 today. Now the department is involved in a change programme that by the end of the 1990s will provide every taxpayer with a single tax office, a simple statement of tax paid each year, and access to high-street offices to sort out tax problems. 'The aim is to create a flexible, efficient and responsive department that stands comparison with the best service organisations in the public and private sector anywhere in the world,' says Steve Matheson, deputy chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, the de-partment's top management body. Matheson has been at the sharp end of the Revenue's organisational development since the late 1970s when he devised a strategy for computerising the tax system. He implemented it during the 1980s, and two years ago launched the current change programme. Until 1977, his Inland Revenue career followed a conventional civil service pattern, when he became a trainee tax inspector in 1961, on graduating from Aberdeen University. After running a Croydon tax district, he moved into policy, working on the reform of corporation tax at Revenue head office. Like many promising young civil servants, Matheson spent two years in the Treasury working in ministerial private offices. Back at the department, he reviewed the Revenue's computerisation plans and managed what was then Europe's largest computer project. In 1989 he became director general of management, effectively in charge of the day-to-day running of the department. He realised that improving the service to the public would have to be paid for from the existing budget. Hence a root and branch reorganisation of the Revenue, with changes to the tax system to refocus the department on the taxpayer. Reforms such as letting taxpayers calculate their own tax bills and changes in taxation of the self-employed will end many cumbersome procedures required to assess and collect tax. To make this possible, the Revenue has forged a unique outsourcing partnership with the private sector that will allow it to use the most up-to-date information technology. Some 2,000 Inland Revenue IT staff will transfer to EDS, the US computer services company, which will take over responsibility for processing tax data. The plans are controversial because confidential tax data will be processed by a foreign company. But Matheson believes that without private-sector skills and capital, it would have been impossible cost-effectively to make the changes needed to improve the service. 'Our IT plans will empower the frontline staff so they can deal with taxpayers' problems on the spot,' he says. 'This requires changing from a culture that is procedural and instruction-based to one based on leadership, delegation and empowerment.' Despite recent criticisms of the use of management consultants in Whitehall, the Revenue has relied on consultants in change management. 'We couldn't have done so much without them,' says Matheson. 'They can clear blockages and help us to achieve what we want to do. You can't hand over responsibility to them, however - consultants have to be managed.' With such a track record, it is hardly surprising that Matheson has often been headhunted by the consultants he uses. But although he sometimes gets frustrated, he has never been tempted to join the private sector. 'It's the scale of the challenge in the civil service that is attractive.' This concludes the series.

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: No reason for allowing BT to be a special case Sir, Your leader 'Cable telecoms' (May 19) invites one clarification, without my encroaching on issues of government policy. BT has not been, and is not, excluded from the provision of fibre optic networks carrying both entertainment and telecommunications services. Indeed, the Cable Authority accepted BT's plans for such a development in the Thames Valley and awarded the cable franchise for that area to a BT subsidiary rather than its north American competitor. For whatever reason, BT decided subsequently to forgo the opportunity presented to it and it sold the Thames Valley franchise to a North American company, from which it will be facing competition in the provision of telephone services. In the circumstances it is difficult to see on what basis BT can expect sympathy either for having part of its market taken away from it or for being deprived of the right to exploit fully any information super-highway it may build in that area or in any other area. The ITC will be advertising franchises for those parts of the country where there is not yet a cable franchise. BT - or for the time being its subsidiaries - may compete with others for the right to construct and operate in those areas a new network capable of combining entertainment and telecoms. What your leader suggests is that, for BT only, those processes be abandoned and that instead all necessary rights should simply be bestowed on BT forthwith. The arguments for by-passing the statutory processes, granting privileges to one company to the exclusion of its competitors and denying to many businesses and householders the possibility of benefiting from competition in telecommunications, surely need more rigorous examination.

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour spells out plan for 'New Deal' LABOUR called on the government yesterday to abandon its hostility to an industrial policy, set aside its planned spending cuts and use the public sector as 'an engine of growth' to save the country from a slump. Its plan for a 'British New Deal' also proposed to finance the package costs by retaining stamp duty on share trans - actions, due to fall in April, and by raising revenue through a one-off windfall levy on the turnover of the privatised utility companies. The measures could be worth about Pounds 1.8bn to the exchequer. Labour's recovery programme came before a similar exercise today by the Liberal Democrats as both parties try to pre-empt Thursday's Autumn Statement by issuing alternative public-expenditure prescriptions. Both parties will use their proposals as benchmarks against which to measure those of Mr Norman Lamont. If the chancellor adopts some of their plans, he will be accused of poaching and, where he does not, he will stand charged of failing to do enough. The Labour package fleshes out earlier demands for a comprehensive programme of employment and training measures, valued at about Pounds 350m, capital spending on environmental improvements and the phased release of local authorities' capital receipts to boost house-building. Announcing the package, shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown also called for a cut in interest rates, investment incentives for industry, grants for medium and smaller businesses, an export drive and talks with industrialists on boosting output and sales. Questioned on whether Labour would raise tax, he dismissed any such move as likely to depress demand and rejected increased national insurance contributions, now rumoured to be part of Mr Lamont's proposals. He also appeared to have put on ice Labour's controversial 'shadow budget', unveiled before the April election, which included the lifting of the ceiling on NICs. Mr Brown also said there should be changes to public accounting procedures, supervised by a new council of independent economic advisers and co-ordinated Community-wide efforts to stimulate growth. Warning against 'one-off cosmetic initiatives' and short-term packages, he said: 'The key is the immediate recovery programme accompanied by a long term strategy for sustainable growth.' In advance of unveiling the Liberal Democrats' recovery proposals today, Mr Malcolm Bruce, the party's trade and industry spokesman, yesterday gave examples of construction projects which could be launched quickly and would create at least 450,000 jobs. The measures, which they estimate would cost more than Pounds 4bn of public money, include track renewal for British Rail; support for light railway systems in areas such as the west Midlands and Leeds; and improvements to the trunk road system. The Liberal Democrats are keen that the row between the two main opposition parties over last week's vote on Europe should not prevent them from working together against the government's public spending plans. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, has written privately to Mr John Smith, urging co-operation over the Autumn Statement.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Multiple damages: Lloyd's faces a crunch on several fronts Over the past year City observers have watched in horror as the Lloyd's insurance market and its participants have apparently driven towards an unavoidable brick wall. There has been much waggling of the steering wheel, a great deal of tooting of the horn, and some heroic work on the brake-pedal  -but the relentless skid has continued. This may be a somewhat apocalyptic view, but events over the past week - in which Lloyd's has been pilloried in the House of Commons and the press - have done little to dispel the impression. In reality, the crunch has two components: financial and legal. Multi-million-pound insurance claims from asbestosis and pollution-related claims in the United States, and from a string of catastrophes between 1988 and 1990, have driven hundreds of the market's Names to seek legal redress for their losses. Now the impact of the legal cases themselves could begin to aggravate the market's underlying financial problems, as some Names seek court injunctions to avoid having to pay out on claims. The Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement won by Outhwaite Names last week is likely to prove a significant contributor to a wave of further legal action. Names are the individuals whose personal assets support underwriting at Lloyd's; they are committed to risks by managing agents acting on their behalf. In the Outhwaite case, 1,614 members of a syndicate managed by Mr Richard Outhwaite ran up losses of more than Pounds 200m as a result of reinsurance contracts that fell foul of court awards to victims of asbestosis in the US. Just under 1,000 of the Outhwaite Names brought a lawsuit against 81 Lloyd's agents, which resulted in a settlement giving them back more than 90 per cent of money paid out so far in claims. The Outhwaite settlement could spur further action in three ways: The demonstration effect. Evidence that suing brings success could stimulate new actions by Names in addition to the seven actions under way at the moment (four in the UK and three in north America). The 'me, too' effect. The Outhwaite settlement did not apply to 627 Names in the syndicate who did not join the legal action. Many of these were 'working Names' who may have found it difficult to take action because their employers were either Lloyd's agencies or brokers. These non-litigating Names are now considering legal action of their own. The 'why me?' effect. The settlement passed the costs of the Outhwaite losses on to the agents' 'errors and omissions' insurers - which cover the cost of legal awards against syndicate managers. Many 'e and o' policies are written by Lloyd's syndicates. The Outhwaite case is not the only spur to legal action, however. Also about to join the fray are Names on 'spiral' syndicates. These are catastrophe reinsurance syndicates which reinsured among themselves in a continually evolving spiral of reinsurances. They are in desperate straits as the claims from catastrophes at the end of 1989 and beginning of 1990 - Hurricane Hugo, the San Francisco earthquake, a Phillips Petroleum explosion in Texas and storms in January 1990 - come home to roost. Syndicates managed by Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young, Gooda Walker and Devonshire agencies are among those affected. In some cases solicitors are advising their Names to seek court injunctions to stop Lloyd's drawing down on funds deposited with their agents. A firm of solicitors  - Michael Freeman - is seeking injunctions on behalf of 600 Names on the grounds that the cash calls were legally 'improper'. Another group of Names believes that the reinsurance contracts may be 'voidable' - contain flaws which would allow Names to apply to have them set aside. If legal advisers agree, another group of Names may seek separate injunctions. Separately, Names are also conducting a vigorous public relations campaign, which has recently heightened the political profile of these matters. The most influence has been brought to bear by a loosely knit alliance including action groups formed by members of the Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire syndicates. These groups have links with the Society of Names, an umbrella group formed by Mr MP, last year. They have contacts with several backbench Conservative MPs, including Mr Paul Marland, who is a member of the Gooda Walker and Rose Thomson Young syndicates. The protesters have made a wide range of allegations about the way Lloyd's works, including accusations that underwriters are overpaid and that the market is prey to malpractices that favour insiders. Some of their allegations - especially those about the scale of remuneration of some Lloyd's participants - are well-founded, although the information on which they are based has been in the public domain for some time. Much of what they say must be treated with considerable caution: some of the syndicates accused last week of being given better-quality business because they are dominated by Lloyd's insiders actually made losses in the last underwriting year. Evidence cited in an extensive review by a 14-man task force into the market's business structure shows that in two of the last three underwriting years, outside Names obtained better results than their counterparts who work in the market. More general allegations about malpractice also appear overblown. The market's regulation has improved markedly since the Lloyd's Act of 1982. An independent inquiry into Lloyd's in 1987, headed by Sir Patrick Neill, reported: 'We know of no equivalent organisation which has accomplished such a major programme of reform in such a short timescale.' But the complaints, though distorted, have served to highlight the market's problems at a time when it is facing acute financial difficulties. Over the next six to 12 months, the combination of continuing losses and legal challenges from Names refusing to pay up could be devastating. Lloyd's would be especially vulnerable if Names continue to enjoy the legal successes they experienced in the Outhwaite case. Lloyd's solvency is not under threat. The market's ability to pay claims is backed by at least Pounds 18bn which represents the gross assets of more than 20,000 Lloyd's Names. However, the market's liquidity and cash-flow problems are serious. At least Pounds 2bn must be paid out in losses between June 1992 and the end of next year. These losses, together with a flood of legal challenges, could eat into the immediately available reserves of more than Pounds 4bn. Many syndicates are desperately short of cash, especially of sterling. Reserves have been depleted by several recent claims: last September's Japanese typhoon is the latest. Ironically the Pounds 116m needed to pay the errors and omissions claim incurred as a result of the Outhwaite settlement could exert further pressure. 'There is a serious shortage of sterling on the market,' said one agent this week. These worries explain why some leading market figures have started preliminary talks with ministers and the Bank of England about what could be done to ease a cash crunch should one arise in the next few months. Neither the Lloyd's Corporation - which provides back-up services for the market - nor the Lloyd's Council - the market's governing body - have been involved in the discussions. But the dynamic of current developments is such that future high-level talks cannot be ruled out. At the least, recent events will keep the pressure on Lloyd's to implement the 65 recommendations of the task force which reported last month. In particular, Lloyd's would need to initiate changes in legislation if the market wanted to attract corporate capital. The three scenarios sketched out by the task force all assume that Lloyd's will eventually be forced to supplement its existing source of capital - from individual Names - with capital from corporate entities. One scenario envisages 'legal challenges threaten(ing) the sustainability' of the relationship between Names and their agents and suggests that limited liability capital could rapidly become the predominant form of capital in the market. Two months ago the authors of the task force report were expecting that process to take from five to seven years. Given the pace of legal, financial and political developments over the past few weeks, the move towards a market dominated by corporate capital could be much quicker.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren in Beijing and Michael Smith] </F>   [Text] China's advisory body on transitional matters--the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC)--has given the strongest  indication yet that district board and municipal council members  may be able to retain their posts after 1997.    The PWC's government and administration sub-group, which  will  determine the function and the formation of Hong Kong's post-  handover government, resolved yesterday to allow members of  local government bodies to ride the through train beyond 1997.    Sources said there was growing opposition within PWC ranks  to  China's threat to dissolve membership of municipal councils and  district boards established under Governor Chris Patten's  electoral reforms.    But the chances of legislators hanging on to their seats  after the transfer of sovereignty remained slim.    Group leader Xiao Weiyun said a more flexible approach was  possible to district board and municipal councils which were not  considered to embrace political power.    Group member and professor at the Chinese University Lau  Siu-kai said: "Although the three tiers of government should  end with the end of the British administration, the two-tier  bodies should survive... given that they have no political power  and their job mainly concerns people's livelihood."    He added the move would benefit a smooth transition and  boost  public confidence. It would also encourage existing members to  continue to run for elections.    The group also issued a statement yesterday setting out the  legal principles behind China's decision to disband Hong Kong's  three tiers of government.    The statement said that under the principle of the Joint  Declaration, government bodies formed under British rule would  end on 30 June 1997.    "Obviously, the existing laws which set four years as the  term of office for the three-tier bodies will therefore be  invalid," it says.    It goes on to say that the status, function and formation of  the three-tier bodies under the Special Administrative Region  (SAR) would be entirely different from those under British rule.</p>

Referring to recent trends in the foreign exchange market,  which saw the dollar plummet nearly 6 percent Monday and Tuesday  on trade woes, Mieno told a Diet panel that "the movements have  gone too far."    Answering questions in the House of Representatives budget  committee, he stressed an agreement is still in effect among the  Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial nations that calls for  exchange rates to move in a stable fashion reflecting economic  fundamentals.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii made the same point earlier  in the morning.    Mieno said he wants to work in close contact with other G-7  members for exchange rate stability. Tokyo currency dealers  reiterated Friday that the Bank of Japan appeared to be  intervening in the market, selling the yen.    Mieno also appeared to quash expectations that the central  bank will soon cut its already record low official discount rate  to spur the economy.    If capital stock and other adjustments proceed smoothly,  "current interest rate levels are sufficient to support an  economic recovery," he said.    He repeated that the economic picture is a mix of good and  bad, citing recent yen gains and gradually worsening employment  conditions as minuses, pitted against the expected effects of  last week's record 15.25 trillion yen fiscal stimulus package.</p>

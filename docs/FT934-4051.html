			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / PLO leadership rift widens as deadline nears on Israel talks Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation resumed talks in Cairo yesterday amid a growing PLO leadership rift and recognition that the start of Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will be delayed. The crisis in the PLO's upper ranks deepened after Mr Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen), the man who signed the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord in Washington, refused to participate in a newly formed PLO committee set up to avert criticism of Mr Yassir Arafat's handling of the peace talks. With only seven days left before Israel and the PLO were supposed, under the terms of the peace accord, to sign a protocol marking the start of a four-month troop withdrawal, the two sides remain deeply divided on a complex set of issues. The talks, being held at a secret location in Cairo, have yet to agree the size of the Jericho area; who should control the border crossings between Jericho and Jordan and between Gaza and Egypt; the extent of the troop withdrawal; security arrangements for Israeli settlers; and the timetable for further releases of up to 10,000 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. The PLO has until now insisted on keeping the December 13 deadline, being under pressure to deliver results to increasingly sceptical Palestinians. But there were signs yesterday that it was prepared to accept a two-week delay. Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator, said the organisation was sparing no effort to finish on time in spite of recent comments by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, suggesting the need for a delay. But Mr Shaath accepted that Israeli reservations about the progress in the talks might force a delay. In Amman, PLO officials said Mr Arafat, PLO chairman, had told the central committee of his Fatah faction that he was reluctantly prepared for a two-week delay in the face of Israeli intransigence on key issues. Palestinians say any delay will arouse suspicions about Israeli intentions and fuel violence by extremists on both sides. The delay will further deepen the PLO leadership crisis. Criticism of Mr Arafat's handling of the peace negotiations has solidified around three senior PLO officials - Mr Abbas, Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo and Mr Suleiman Najjab. All three are members of the 12-strong PLO executive committee and have been among the most important voices for peace and moderation within the PLO, backing Mr Arafat against more extremist factions. Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala), the PLO's chief economics negotiator, is also said to have supported the campaign to force Mr Arafat to democratise the PLO, bring in professionals from outside the organisation and allow the PLO's senior officials a greater say in policymaking. In a move to quell the criticism, Mr Arafat had asked Mr Abbas to head a PLO committee to direct detailed peace talks with Israel. Mr Abbas refused the appointment and said he would have nothing to do with the committee. Crackdown threatened for Jewish settlers Page 4</p>

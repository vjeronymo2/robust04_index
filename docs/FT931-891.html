			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: Why consumers need financial advice Sir, Your coverage of the two reports from the Office of Fair Trading and its reactions to the Securities and Investments Board rules on investment regulation (March 19 and March 22) have not addressed the full implications of this further blow against the independent financial adviser. The OFT is rightly concerned with the interests of the consumer, but it is difficult to see how these interests are best served by the extermination of the IFA as a species. Insurance has been described as a very simple business made complicated by insurance practitioners. While consumers are growing in sophistication, it is doubtful if their sophistication and the insurance industry's de-mystification are converging rapidly enough to make professional financial advice redundant. Of course the question is, who pays for this advice and how much? The industry does not believe that it can justify its distribution costs - hence the opposition to disclosure. The trouble is that customer resistance makes life insurance a very expensive commodity to sell. It is ironic that the less the customer wants the product the more he ends up paying when finally persuaded to buy. So why not simply leave the customer alone to buy or not if he feels the urge? No one can justify hiding from customers the cost of advice, but perhaps the life insurance industry, and the OFT could do more to educate the public into an appreciation of the value of such advice.

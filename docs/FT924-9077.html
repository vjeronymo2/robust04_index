			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade war - what it means to you: David Dodwell answers the questions arising from the crisis in the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations 1. What difference has the Gatt made to my daily life? More than you realise. The rapid growth of world trade since the end of the second world war - much of which was made possible as a result of reforms negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) - has played a critical part in boosting incomes, jobs and national wealth, as the charts show. The rise in trade doesn't just mean a wider variety of goods on the shelf at Sainsbury or K-mart, it also means lower prices from producers, who have to be more efficient because of the competition they face through open trade. For companies, improved trading opportunities have led world economic growth over the past four decades. More than 50 per cent of the UK output of ICI, Courtaulds and British Aerospace is exported. Successive trade rounds under Gatt have cut average tariffs on manufactured goods from over 40 per cent in the 1940s to less than 5 per cent today. 2. How - and how successfully - has the Gatt policed world trade? Perhaps the most important single contribution of the Gatt is 'national treatment' embodied in its 'most favoured nation' (MFN) principle. What this means is that any trade concession offered by one country to another must be extended to every other country. So if the Ivory Coast were to cut all import duties on, say, trousers imported from Mauritius, then it would be forced by Gatt rules to do the same thing for trouser-makers in every other country. Its next critical role has been to act as an 'honest broker' if two countries have a trade dispute. Without this, small countries - particularly those in the developing world - fear they could be bullied into disadvantageous trade arrangements by larger nations. The failure of the Gatt to find a solution in the present US-European Community dispute therefore creates a crisis which goes to the very heart of Gatt's credibility. By declaring sanctions against the EC - initially of just Dollars 300m, but potentially amounting to Dollars 3.7bn - the US is serving notice that it has run out of patience with the multilateral dispute settlement system provided by Gatt. If it and other countries now proceed down the route of bilateral dispute settlement, the law of the jungle will follow. 3. What is the 'Uruguay Round'? Why is it named after an obscure Latin American country and why has the negotiation dragged on for six years? Of the eight negotiating 'rounds' since the birth of the Gatt in 1947, the Uruguay Round, launched in the coastal resort of Punta del Este in Uruguay in 1986, is by far the most ambitious. It has embraced previously taboo areas such as trade in farm products and in textiles and garments. It has also for the first time made demands on developing countries, calling on them to open their markets to trade in services, and to enforce strict laws on patent and copyright protection. It has involved an unprecedented number of countries - 105 as opposed to just 23 signatories to the first 'Geneva Round'. This helps to explain why the round has taken so long - though it is worth remembering that the Tokyo round took six years to complete (in 1974-1979). Another headache has been recession in the major industrial economies, which has made it tougher for national negotiators to ignore protectionist pressures from industrial and trade union lobbies at home. Nevertheless, by the end of last year agreement was reached on most of the subjects covered by the Round, in the so-called Dunkel draft, named after Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director general. Agriculture was the most important exception. 4. Why should I care about the Uruguay Round? What difference would it make if it reached agreement and what would happen if it collapsed? Would it help to end recession? Some of the reasons for caring should already be apparent. By reducing the subsidies paid to farmers in the EC and US, a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round would mean lower food prices. Sugar prices inside the EC are about three times the world price, for example. The phasing out of the complex Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which sets quotas, and hence prices, for textile products, would also mean cheaper clothing. A successful round would boost export opportunities for every one of the 105 countries involved. For industrial countries, agreement would particularly help chemicals and pharmaceuticals exporters (who are wary of selling to developing countries at present because of poor patent protection) and service-sector businesses such as banks and insurance companies. For exporters in the developing world, agreement would increase prices for farm exports ranging from timber to tropical fruits, and new opportunities for textiles and garment manufacturers. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris estimates that a successful round would add about Dollars 200bn a year to world trade. It is impossible to say how many new jobs that amounts to, but the increased business would certainly help the international economy recover from its current recession. If the talks collapse, then these potential gains will be lost. But worse, a tit-for-tat trade war would lead to higher tariffs, higher prices, reduced sales, lost export opportunities and lost jobs. 5. Who would bear the blame if these negotiations were to fail? Would it be the fault of the French? And what about the US and the other hundred or so participants? As far as farm trade is concerned, neither the US nor the EC is blameless, but it is hardest to find sympathy with the EC regime and the EC's protectionist attitudes. The US has, to its credit, been on the liberalising side of the argument. The EC has been dragged kicking and screaming in that direction. This is so even though the EC farm subsidy regime costs Europeans as consumers and taxpayers around Dollars 120bn a year. The French are the main beneficiaries of the status quo and have resisted reform most fiercely. But the French have support from farm producers across southern Europe. The German government can also be blamed for refusing to use its weight inside the EC to force the French to compromise. 6. Why does farm trade matter so much in these negotiations? Have all the other issues been resolved? It is baffling that farmers - who account for less than 11m people out of Europe's 340m population - can hold the rest of the population to ransom. The reason is that powerful lobby groups and the composition of electoral constituencies give the agricultural community an exaggerated influence in Europe's democracies. The French have argued that farm trade could be dropped from the package - as it was in past rounds. This is not possible because developing countries who are being asked to open up their markets to our banks and insurance companies say they will only do so if the industrial north in turn opens its markets to their farm products. It is also important to remember that the US-European Community farm row is only one of the obstacles to wider multilateral agreement. If a deal had been found on US-EC farm trade, Japan or South Korea - both of which are refusing to open up their markets to rice imports - might have frustrated progress towards a multilateral deal. 7. Why does an economic superpower like the US care so much about an obscure farm product like soyabeans? Oilseeds - which include soya beans, sunflower and rapeseed - may seem obscure, but they are critically important. We are all aware of them as cooking oils, but they are also used in animal feeds, and as lubricants in industry. Nor is trade so small. The US is the world's largest OECD producer - accounting for 63m tonnes out of world production of 86m tonnes in 1991. It is also the world's biggest exporter, selling over 18m tonnes last year. The EC is the world's biggest importer (14m tonnes last year), and so is a much-coveted market for US farm exporters. The oilseed is also important symbolically: EC subsidies to oilseed producers mirror subsidies across the farm sector. As the dispute has dragged on, with the EC defying two Gatt rulings which condemned its subsidy regime as a violation of its commitment of the early 1960s to provide duty-free access for soyabeans, the impasse has also come to symbolise the shortcomings of the Gatt dispute settlement system. This threatens the reputation of Gatt itself and the multilateral trading system it stands for. 8. What is a trade war and why would it matter to me? Which companies would be most vulnerable? Trade war is death by a thousand cuts. 'Punitive tariffs' on one product are matched by tit-for-tat 'counter-retaliation'. They would then spread to other products. The first signs would the disappearance of certain products from the shops and higher prices. Then jobs would be lost as export-dependent companies started to lose business. 9. Will the world divide into regional blocs and, if it does, would that make the Gatt just four dead letters? There is a danger this could happen. The EC and the North American Free Trade Area are already clearly defined trading blocs. In the EC 62 per cent of exports last year were between member states. There are also moves to create trade areas in Asia and South America. But these trading areas are no substitute for global free trade. In 1991, the US sold 36 per cent of its exports to the EC and Japan. Japan in turn relies on the US or the EC for 48 per cent of its exports. In short, the world economy is too interdependent for regional trading blocks to provide save havens from a trade war. 10. What difference might the election of Bill Clinton make to world trade? The first result of Mr Clinton's election was to undermine the credibility of the current team of US negotiators. Just when talks were at a particularly delicate stage, the US negotiating teams of the past six years found they were about to be replaced. It is uncertain what mandate they will have to speak for the US in the hiatus before Mr Clinton becomes president. It is even more uncertain whether Mr Clinton's incoming team will share their priorities. A decision at this stage to inject new demands into the Uruguay Round could well be ruinous. Mr Clinton steered clear of trade issues during the election campaign. Democratic Party aides say this was deliberate, to keep his options open. They say he is a free trader in principle, but one cannot ignore that his victory was underpinned by support from powerful protectionist interests - among them trade unionists and environmental lobbyists.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board used ``real property'' and ``real estate'' interchangeably throughout its appraisal rule to mean interests in an identified parcel or tract of land and improvements. However, the Board did not intend these terms to include mineral rights, timber rights, or growing crops when they are considered separately from the parcel or tract of land. Valuation of such interests generally requires the services of a professional other than a real estate appraiser.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To clarify this distinction, the Board has amended its regulation to define ``real property'' and ``real estate'' for purposes of the appraisal regulation as an identified parcel or tract of land, including improvements, easements, rights of way, undivided or future interests and similar rights in a tract of land, but excluding mineral rights, timber rights, or growing crops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Few commenters expressed an opinion on this proposed change. Those few commenters who opposed the definition stated that timber and growing crops should not be excluded from the definition of real estate in that the value of such items is tied to the value of the land. Comments opposing this definition were generally from appraisers who perform farm and timber appraisals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In many states, minerals, timber, and growing crops that have not been severed from the land are considered interests in real estate or real property. Consequently, if mineral rights are collateral for a loan in one of those states, a question arises whether the institution must obtain a real estate appraisal of the parcel or tract of land to which the mineral rights are attached but in which the institution has no interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board's final rule clarifies that regulated institutions are not required to obtain appraisals of the parcel of land to which mineral rights, or similar severable interests in real estate are attached, if the transaction only involves the severable interest rather than the parcel or tract of land. Where mineral rights, timber rights, or growing crops,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the associated parcel or tract of land, are the subject of a real estate-related financial transaction, the services of a licensed or certified appraiser would be required unless the transaction is otherwise exempt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the contribution of relevant mineral rights, timber rights, or growing crops should be included when appraising a parcel of land which possesses any of these features. However, valuation of these interests would not be required if they are not part of the transaction or if they are not relevant to the analyses which the appraiser needs to perform to arrive at an estimate of value for the parcel or tract of land.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> .3(a)&blank;Appraisals required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies proposed an increase from $100,000 to $250,000 in the threshold at or below which a Title XI appraisal is not required, and specifically asked commenters whether a $250,000 or some other threshold would be appropriate. In addition, the agencies requested information on loss experience of depository institutions for loans greater than $250,000 and loans of $250,000 or less. On November 10, 1993, the agencies made available supplemental information on the proposed rule and extended the comment period for 30 days in order to allow commenters to consider and comment on the information. The supplemental information related primarily to the proposed increase in the threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A majority of the commenters addressed the threshold issue. Almost all of the commenters opposed to the increase were appraisers, while almost all of the commenters in favor of the increase were depository institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

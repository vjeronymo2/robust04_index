			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The Postal Ministry will  consider removing the telecommunications market barrier between  KDD [Kokusai Denshin Denwa -- International Telephone Company]  and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) as part of  economic deregulation, ministry officials said Tuesday [7 June].    KDD controls Japan's international telecommunications market  while NTT handles domestic telecommunications.    The NTT and KDD laws clearly define their business  territories.    The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry will consider  removing the barrier when it conducts a complete review of NTT  operations in fiscal 1995, the officials said. The review is  expected to cover a possible split-up of NTT.    KDD was set up in 1978 as a result of the separation and  privatization of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corp.'s  international division. NTT was born in 1985 when the  corporation itself was privatized.    If a division of NTT were allowed to enter the international  telecommunications market, the effect on the structure of  Japan's telecommunications market would be serious, the  officials said.    An advisory group for Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata earlier  called for removal of the barrier between the international and  domestic markets.</p>

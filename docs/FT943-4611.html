			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Industry warns on cuts in funding The construction industry yesterday warned of adverse effects on training if the government cuts its financial contribution. Leading members of the industry, which has traditionally been a large trainer of young people through Youth Training, expressed their fears at a meeting with Miss Ann Widdecombe, minister for employment. Miss Widdecombe was attending the launch of new occupational standards for professional and managerial workers. The industry-wide standards, developed by the Construction Industry Standing Conference, build on the national vocational qualifications (NVQs) developed by the industry for manual and craft workers. The industry believes better workplace training, through the introduction of NVQs, could bring a 10 per cent improvement in efficiency and produce a Pounds 4bn savings for its customers. However, Mr Allan McDougall of the specialist engineering contractors group said that there were enormous benefits for everyone in the industry. But the 'narrow margins within which hard-pressed employers are required to work mean they will need maximum encouragement to play their full part in the necessary implementation and take-up'. The industry has traditionally met its training needs through the Construction Industry Training Board, which makes a training levy on members. The Department of Employment is examining its Pounds 1.8bn training budgets and there has been speculation that substantial cuts are planned. Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman of the CITB, said he would urge the government to fund the CITB directly for its new entrants' schemes, rather than through the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils which deliver government funded training in England and Wales. He said such a move could save Pounds 4m in administrative costs.</p>

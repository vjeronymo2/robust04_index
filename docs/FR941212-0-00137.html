The Federal Claims Collection Standards, (4 CFR chapter II, parts 103 and 104, reprinted in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix M), prescribe standards for compromising and litigating property damage claims, and provide general guidance for compromising and litigating medical care claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Time limitations. (1) Property damage claims. Claims asserted under the Federal Claims Collection Act for damage to Government property are founded in tort and must be brought within three years after the action ``first accrues'' (28 U.S.C. 2415b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Medical care claims asserted under the FMCRA or 10 U.S.C. 1095. Claims asserted under the FMCRA or against an automobile liability insurer under 10 U.S.C. 1095 are also founded in tort and must be brought within three years after the action ``first accrues'' (28 U.S.C. 2415b). Although no court has ruled on this issue, claims asserted under 10 U.S.C. 1095 against a no-fault or PIP insurer are presumably founded in a contract ``implied in law''; if so, they must be brought within six years (28 U.S.C. 2415a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Computing the statute of limitations. Normally, a medical care claim ``first accrues'' on the initial date of treatment, and a property damage claim accrues on the date that the property was damaged. However, in computing the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2416(c) excludes the period of time before a U.S. official charged with the responsibility to act in the circumstances knows or should know that there is a basis for a claim. See United States v. Hunter, 645 F. Supp 758, 760 (N.D.N.Y. 1986). For example, the three year statute of limitations would not begin to run on most medical care claims paid by CHAMPUS at least until the date on which CHAMPUS received the bill from the provider. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Medical care claims asserted under state law. Claims asserted against an insurer on a third party beneficiary theory or against a state workers' compensation fund must be brought within the applicable state statute of limitations which can range from one to six years. Normally, the statute of limitations would begin to run when the injury occurred, rather than the date of initial treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Applicable law. Federal law does not define what constitutes a tort. Unless the RJA can properly apply the law of another jurisdiction under conflict of law rules, the RJA will apply the law of the state or country where an incident occurred in determining whether the Government has a cause of action founded in tort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Concurrent claims. (1) Claims for damage to Army property and claims for medical care arising from the same incident will be processed under the section applicable to each. However, efforts should be made to include all medical care and property damage claims in a single demand against a third party or insurance company. Settlement agreements will be drafted so that settlement and release of one claim shall not prejudice settlement of the remaining claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the incident giving rise to a claim in favor of the United States also gives rise to a potential claim against the United States, the claim in favor of the Government will be asserted and processed only by a claims approval or settlement authority who has jurisdiction to take final action on the claim against the Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.218 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims against certain prospective defendants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) U.S. Government agencies. RJAs will not assert a claim against any department, agency or instrumentality of the United States. A self-insured NAFI, whether revenue producing, welfare or sundry, is considered an ``agency or instrumentality of the United States''; a private association is not. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Property damage assertions against soldiers and employees. The report of survey system (chapter 13, AR 735&hyph;5) is the primary mechanism for collecting from a civilian employee or a soldier (including an AR or NG soldier) for damage to government property. Report of survey procedures should normally be used whenever applicable. AR 735&hyph;5 requires claims offices to assert property damage claims against soldiers and employees in two instances: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Damage caused by POV's. Pursuant to paragraph 14&hyph;30, AR 735&hyph;5, if a report of survey approving authority assesses liability against a soldier or civilian employee for negligently damaging Government property using a POV, and the soldier or employee does not make restitution, the approving authority will forward the approved report of survey to the claims office. The RJA will assert a demand against the soldier or employee's liability insurance for the full value of the damage. If the soldier or employee does not have insurance, the RJA will return the action for the approving authority to withhold a month's pay from the soldier or employee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Exhaustion of collection remedies. Pursuant to paragraph 14&hyph;4b(7), AR 735&hyph;5, if an F&amp;AO has exhausted all administrative mechanisms, including IRS offset, for collecting amounts assessed under a report of survey from a soldier, ROTC cadet or employee, the F&amp;AO may refer the action to the servicing claims office for recovery action under the Federal Claims Collection Act. The RJA will assert such claims and initiate litigation if appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Medical care assertions against soldiers, employees, family members, and retirees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Acting within scope of employment. The RJA will not assert a medical care claim against a tortfeasor who is a civilian employee or service member (including a reserve component member) acting within scope of employment, whether or not the employee or member has private insurance (cf. U.S. v. Gilman, 347 U.S. 507 (1954)). ``Scope of employment'' is determined by the laws of the state where the injury occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Persons not in scope who injure themselves. An RJA will not assert a claim based on a tort liability theory against a tortfeasor who is a soldier, family member or retiree for the tortfeasor's own medical care; a person cannot create tort liability by injuring himself or herself. In such instances, however, the RJA may assert a claim under 10 U.S.C. 1095 against the injured tortfeasor's personal injury protection (PIP) or medical payments insurance coverage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Persons not in scope with liability insurance. An RJA may assert a medical care claim against the liability insurer of a service member, civilian employee, family member or retiree who injures some other person entitled to medical care. Interfamilial tort immunity would not preclude the RJA from asserting a medical care claim based on a tort liability theory for care furnished to a tortfeasor's family members (see, e.g., U.S. v. Haynes, 445 F.2d 907 (5th Cir. 1971); U.S. v. Moore, 469 F.2d 788 (3rd Cir, 1972). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Persons not in scope with no insurance. An RJA may assert a medical care claim against a soldier, civilian employee, family member or retiree without insurance coverage with the approval of the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS, or designee. Approval will be granted if there are aggravating circumstances, such as willful misconduct, and the tortfeasor has sufficient assets to satisfy both the injured victim and the Government's claim. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

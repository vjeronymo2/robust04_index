			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC-ILLINOIS GAME SET FOR LABOR DAY  </P> <P> The USC-Illinois football game, originally scheduled to be played in the Soviet  Union Sept. 2 as the Glasnost Bowl, has been rescheduled for Labor Day evening,  Monday, Sept. 4, at 5 p.m., in the Coliseum.  </P> <P> The game will give USC seven at home next season and will be shown nationally  by ABC-TV.  </P> <P> The Glasnost Bowl was canceled last week by Raycom, Inc., the game's organizer,  because of contract difficulties with the Soviets. The contract, however,  provided that in case of a cancellation, a home-and-home series between the  teams would go into effect, the first game to be played in 1989 in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

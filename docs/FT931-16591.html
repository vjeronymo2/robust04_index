			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Wildlife at risk as oil spreads: Braer spillage 'potentially catastrophic' THE environmental impact of the wrecked Braer oil tanker near Sumburgh Head in Shetland was described last night by the World Wide Fund for Nature as 'potentially catastrophic'. Lord Caithness, the shipping minister, said after briefing the prime minister: 'We have got the dispersants, the planes and the tugs. We are very clear what we are going to do. At the moment the sea is doing the job for us. 'Nature has taken over,' he continued. 'It is perhaps a good thing there is a gale because that will help to diversify the oil, break it down and get rid of it. If it calms down, we will try to spray tomorrow.' He said there would be a wide-ranging inquiry into the disaster. Mr Jonathan Wills, a wildlife expert living on Shetland, said such a shipwreck had been feared for 15 years: 'This was the disaster that was not supposed to happen.' Ms Sian Pullen, marine conservation officer with the wildlife fund, said the organisation was asking for special routeing for certain types of tankers around environmentally sensitive areas. 'Questions should be asked about why a ship carrying such a hazardous substance was navigating through this area in dangerous conditions,' she said. The southern tip of Shetland, which has four sites designated as having special scientific interest, is recognised as an internationally important area for seabirds and marine life. A chain of life from microscopic marine organisms to birds, porpoises and whales is at risk from pollution. Ms Nancy Harrison, marine policy officer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: 'This is a potential major disaster for wildlife. Questions must be asked why a single-hulled tanker, which is banned around sensitive coastlines in other countries, is allowed to be in one of Britain's most vulnerable sites for marine wildlife.' She said that thousands of seabirds might be lost in the oil spillage, but that the catastrophe would have been worse had the ship been wrecked in summer, when more birds would have been nesting on shore. 'In a sense, we're lucky it isn't summer, but I don't want to understate the importance of the area for birds in winter.' The oil spill from the wreck of the Aegean Sea off the north-west coast of Spain just before Christmas killed about 3,000 seabirds, but that area is not noted for its bird populations. 'My feeling is if we come out that lucky we will be very, very happy,' Ms Harrison said. 'I think it will be more than that.' The birds most immediately under threat in the Shetlands are sea duck and diving species. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust rates Shetland as probably Britain's most important site for wintering sea ducks, with about 10,300 wintering birds - roughly 7 per cent of the UK population. Shetland has colonies of eider, long-tailed duck and large numbers of guillemots and shag. Other seabirds such as the fulmar, little auk and great northern diver are also vulnerable. Dr Harrison said the threat to colonies of black guillemot was particularly worrying because local populations would be unlikely to recover quickly. Some colonies have still not recovered from the last big spill in the area in 1979, when the tanker Esso Bernicia ran into a terminal at Sullom Voe. About 3,700 birds died and the eider duck population declined by more than a quarter between 1979 and 1984. Mr Ian McCall, conservation officer at the RSPB's Scottish office, said the tanker could not have run aground at a more sensitive spot: Shetland was one of the most important wildlife centres in the whole north-east Atlantic region. Wildlife conservationists were hoping last night that coast-dwelling species in the Sumburgh area would have been on the opposite side of the headland, sheltering from the storm. Tens of thousands of other seabirds that nest among Shetland's cliff colonies are well out at sea, where they feed and live after the breeding season, returning in the spring. There are fears that if much oil leaks into the sea it might circulate around the islands, making a rapid clean-up difficult. In such circumstances, it would be a struggle to have the shores cleaned before the sea-ranging birds return to nest in a few months.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BRAER: ROUTE TO DISASTER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE COUNTDOWN  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 05:30  Braer engines fail. 07:20  Tug Start Sirius despatched from Lerwick Harbour, 30 miles away.        Sullom Voe tug Swaabie also en route. Lerwick lifeboat and        Coastguard Rescue helicopter at scene. 08:45  Tanker only one mile off rocks at Horse Island, Sumburgh Head. 09:00  RAF rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth lifted off last of the        34 man crew. 10:55  Tanker taken in tow by Star Sirius and Swaabie in attempt to        pull clear. 11:15  Tanker aground on Fitful Head. Oil already leaking. Shetland        Islands Council activated major disaster plan to try to limit        environmental damage. 11:25  Shetland Coastguards confirm Braer aground on rocks at Garths        Ness on southern tip of Shetland Islands.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE VOYAGE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Braer left Mongstad near Bergen in Norway on Sunday heading for    Quebec in Canada. Chartered course through the middle of the notoriously choppy    22-mile-wide channel between Sumburgh Head and Fair Isle. It kept 10    miles away from the coast in line with advice from maritime    authorities. Seas are usually calmer taking route around Herma Ness, but that adds    60 miles to journey. In the early hours of yesterday morning, in a force 10 storm, engine    problems caused the tanker to begin drifting. It ran aground at    Garths Ness near Sumburgh Head.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ENDANGERED WILDLIFE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Great northern divers Eider duck Black guillemot Other birds which nest on Shetland are currently at sea and will not return till the spring.

The grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound, Alaska, on 24 March 1989 ranks outside the 10 worst spills at about 35,000 tonnes, but resulted in major ecological damage. In addition to these major slicks, it is estimated that an average of 2,000,000 tonnes is spilled into the world's seas every year. The tanker, Aegean Sea, ran aground of La Coruna in northwest Spain in early December, spilling 500,000 barrels of oil.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said the  current fluctuation of major currencies should be temporary and  that the situation would stabilize soon. In an interview with  reporters at Government House this morning, the finance minister  said the current appreciation of the baht is both good and bad  for Thai exports.    [Begin recording] [Tharin] This is an ordinary realignment  of international markets. The situation is being monitored by  the Exchange Equalization Fund. There is a little fluctuation  at foreign exchange markets, but we believe the situation would  stabilize soon.    [Unidentified reporter] Will the stronger baht have an  impact on our exports?    [Tharin] There is no big change at present. What has  happened is an ordinary adjustment to global changes.    [Reporter] The dollar is said to have slipped very low, and  there has been a call for the government not to peg the baht to  the dollar. What is going to be done on this matter?    [Tharin] Our exchange system has the baht tied to a basket  of currencies. Under this system, we tie the baht to foreign  currencies and we use this as a medium of trade. This is the  reason why the value of the baht has to be adjusted in  accordance with realities. However, we rely heavily on  U.S.dollars. Since the dollar has weakened slightly, the baht  has become stronger compared to the dollar. But, compared to  the yen and mark, the value of the baht has dropped slightly.  Therefore, the current situation favors our exports to Japan  and Europe. [End recording]</p>

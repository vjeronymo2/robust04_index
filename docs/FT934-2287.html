			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / More held over Austria bombings The Austrian police have arrested two more suspects bringing to four the number of people held in connection with last week's letter-bombing campaign in Austria, writes Patrick Blum in Vienna. Several people, including Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's Social Democratic mayor, were injured in the campaign which was aimed against human rights activists and politicians sympathetic to the plight of immigrants. Two men, both with connections to an illegal Austrian neo-Nazi organisation, were arrested last Thursday, and since then investigations have focused on neo-Nazi groups in Austria and Germany. The German police are co-operating closely with the Austrian police in the search for possible German neo-Nazi links.</p>

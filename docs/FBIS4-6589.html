			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Korea is putting big  efforts into agricultural production this year, too.    According to the state budget for 1994, a huge amount of  fund, or up 6 percent from last year, will go to the  agricultural sector.    This year, Korea will consolidate the achievements of the  rural technical revolution which has been completed in the main  and bring its might into full play and further expand and  develop the successes in mechanization and extensive application  of chemicals in keeping with the high level of irrigation and  electrification.    Many farm machines of various kinds are supplied to the  countryside to develop the comprehensive mechanization of  agriculture to a higher level. Only recently, 500 tractors and  250 trucks were supplied at a time to Chongdan, Yonan and  Paechon Counties.    Large quantities of various chemical fertilizers are  produced  and supplied as well.    Last year, the state allocated funds, or up 2.8 percent from  the previous year, to agriculture.    One of the most important successes registered in the  countryside of Korea last year is that an unusual bumper harvest  was reaped even under the unfavorable weather conditions.</p>

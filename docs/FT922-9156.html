			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Saga Petroleum setback blamed on marked fall in crude oil price SAGA Petroleum, the independent oil company, yesterday disclosed a fall in first-quarter pre-tax profits to NKr187m (Dollars 29m) from NKr339m last year due to a marked fall in crude oil prices. However, group operating revenue rose to NKr1.26bn from NKr1.09bn, helped by higher petroleum production which rose to the equivalent of about 1m tonnes of oil. Operating profit fell to NKr280m from NKr393m. The reduction in operating profit was due largely to lower oil prices compared with the first quarter of 1991, which was affected by the Gulf war. There were increased costs relating to expansion in exploration activities and higher field depreciation. A royalty in the Oseberg (oil field) was also reflected in increased costs, the company said. Saga did not detail exploration costs but said that depreciation had risen by NKr81m to NKr279m. Group operating expenses rose to NKr977m from NKr694m. First-quarter crude oil sales were lifted to 6.4m barrels from 5.1m barrels in the same period last year. Saga said that it obtained an average sale price of NKr114 per barrel of oil in the first three months compared with NKr136 last year. To improve the company's financial structure, Saga said it issued a NKr1bn bond with a 10-year maturity in Norway in January. Exportfinans, the export credit guarantee bank owned by the commercial banks, reported a 19 per cent improvement in first-quarter operating profit to NKr87m from NKr73m last year. Exportfinans explained the increase was due to improvements in asset management and non-recurring income from certain financial transactions. The company said that as a result of balance sheet growth, its capital adequacy ratio declined from 21 per cent at year end to 16.7 per cent at end-March. Loans disbursed in the first quarter were 15 per cent up on last year and totalled NKr598m. Of that, about 65 per cent was extended on market terms while 35 per cent was government-supported credits. The grant element of mixed credits in 1992 was increased by NKr250m to NKr340m. This, and the adjustment of regulations governing maturities and the proportions that could be financed, provided the industry with a greater opportunity for contracts, the company said. It said there was increasing interest in export credits on market terms for exports to industrialised countries.</p>

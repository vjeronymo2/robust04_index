			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AWARDED TO GORBACHEV  </P> <P> It is tragically ironic that the Nobel Peace Prize, which has honored in the  past some of the greatest champions of justice and models of virtue, has fallen  this year upon Gorbachev, the man who chose to use force to suppress the  Lithuanian democratic uprising, one of Eastern Europe's most peaceful  revolutions of the last year.  </P> <P> Armed only with their national songs and tri-color flags, the Lithuanians took  to the streets and polling booths to express their intentions of regaining  their rightful independence which was stolen in 1940; yet Gorbachev responded  by ordering Soviet tanks to roll through the streets of Vilnius.  </P> <P> It was Gorbachev who insisted on strangling the nation by shutting off its gas  lines and cutting off vital medical supplies. It was Gorbachev who allowed Red  Army soldiers to storm Red Cross hospitals in Lithuania, seize Lithuanian  youths who had fled their occupier's army and beat them into submission. By  choosing to overlook Gorbachev's stomping of the human spirit and violations of  human rights, the Nobel committee has greatly compromised the ideals which the  prize represents.  </P> <P> The Nobel Prize committee should be honoring a noble people, the Lithuanians,  instead of the man who continues their oppression.  </P> <P> AURIS JARASUNAS, Santa Monica  </P></p>

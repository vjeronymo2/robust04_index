			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIFFERING VIEWS OF DAY-CARE DILEMMA  </P> <P> It was enlightening to find that 68% of pediatricians think it's detrimental  for a baby under the age of 6 months to be cared for by day care.  </P> <P> Even ducks spend more than the two-week maternity leave many human mothers feel  is adequate for bonding.  </P> <P> Our economy and values are so screwed up, we ignore the needs of babies. There  should be a new charity, "Whaaaa! I want my mommy!" Mothers who want to stay  home with their babies could go to this fund to pay them to stay with their  newborns. The best day care is do-it-yourself. Are you listening, legislators?  </P> <P> MARY JACOBS  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

President Mircea Snegur announced that he has received a  mediation proposal from Boris Yeltsin and that a Moscow envoy  will arrive in Chisinau after tomorrow's parliamentary elections.    Insofar as relations with the CIS are concerned, Snegur  expressed the hope that the future parliament will ratify  Moldova's adherence to this community, but said that the problem  of signing certain accords with it in the area of defense is not  in question.    He also added that he wants the Russian 14th Army to begin  its withdrawal from the territory of the Republic of Moldova  this year.    The ambassador in Moscow, Anatol Taranu, told the INTERFAX  agency that at the beginning of March, a working meeting will be  held in Chisinau by military experts from Moldova and Russia to  clarify the status of the Russian 14th Army, as well as methods  and a timetable for its withdrawal from the territory of  Moldova.    He also mentioned that Chisinau will insist on the  withdrawal  of the 14th Army from Dniester by 1 July. This piece of news  was also broadcast by Rossiya radio.</p>

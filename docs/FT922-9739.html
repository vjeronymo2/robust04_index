			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (6): Strong emphasis on new product development - The UK is still the world's seventh biggest producer AFTER two years of hard times and a steadily increasing sense of exasperation in the British machine tool industry, producers will view today's opening of the Mach '92 Show as a chance to put the past behind them and look to the future. The outlook, however, is tinged more by hope than expectation. After production sunk last year by 22 per cent to about Pounds 730m, 1992 has been a year of uncertainty - about the economy, then the Budget, and more recently the General Election. As a tonic for an industry that badly needs to remind people that it still exists - last year's output may have been the lowest in real terms since 1984, but the UK is still the world's seventh biggest producer - Mach '92 could not have been better timed. It comes within weeks of the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine as Trade and Industry Secretary, a move viewed with considerable anticipation by an industry whose quiet campaign for short-term stimuli to manufacturing investment fell on deaf ears when the unlamented Mr Peter Lilley ran the DtI. With the political uncertainty resolved, machine tool builders now sense faint stirrings in the economy, and among manufacturing customers in the UK and overseas. Mr Stan Vaughan, managing director of Hahn &amp; Kolb (GB), the German owned manufacturer and importer, says inquiries from potential customers have been rising since December. Mr Vaughan, chairman of the Mach '92 Exhibition Committee, expects almost as many exhibitors - about 500  - as at Mach '88, a time of buoyant conditions virtually worldwide. Some of the stands this time are smaller and less lavish, he says, but exhibitors' will share a common aim: to turn the current flickers of customer interest into real orders. Their strategy will be simple: to emphasise through machines launched at the exhibition that new product development has not taken a back seat in the fight for survival and that the UK can still make some claims to global technology leadership, albeit in niches such as laser-cutting machines and probes. For the longer this recession has continued, the more it has become a battle for survival for many UK machine tool builders, scattered across 120 manufacturing sites. 'A lot of manufacturers are at a very critical stage,' says Mr Ron Bull, president of the Machine Tool Technologies' Association. He warns that some UK producers could collapse if business conditions do not improve by the end of the year. Given the many disasters in British machine tool history, it is, perhaps, surprising that the latest recession has not produced any big corporate casualties. This partly reflects a dogged determination to survive against all the odds, coupled with the industry's ability to learn from previous recessions and to act firmly to survive. At Leicester-based Bridgeport Machines, the big US owned producer, there has been no pay award for two years, labour has been halved and costs reduced costs. Mr Malcolm Taylor, managing director, contrasts the company's approach with the slower response of German competitors more recently hit by a market downturn. Exports have also provided a cushion against recession. Last year, exports of UK machine tools fell 16 per cent to Pounds 411.1m, but would have fallen a lot further if European Community markets had suffered as deep or prolonged recession as that in the UK. The jobs picture is less happy, with total employment falling to 18,200 in September from 20,800 a year earlier. In the past six months it has sunk further, to about 17,000, due to closures such as 600 Group's Colchester lathe plant, Bridgeport's Bridlington plant, and Matrix-Churchill's Fletchamstead Highway, Coventry plant. And there is almost certainly more to come. B Elliott, one of the UK's last three publicly-quoted machine tool builders, is undergoing a restructuring which could lead to the divestment, rationalisation or closure of its machine tool division, which includes Butler Newall and Addison. On the bright side, the job cuts that have been announced this year involve a prudent concentration of manufacturing rather than a wild swipe at research and development budgets. The evidence suggests that UK machine tool companies have realised this is one option they cannot consider if they wish to remain competitive long-term. For example, FMT Holdings, the Brighton-based machine tool group, is launching new products for Mach '92 at all three group companies, including a new cutting head for Noble &amp; Lund's aerospace profiling machines. This comes despite heavy job cuts overall and the decision last month to turn Noble &amp; Lund's Gateshead plant into an assembly operation, shedding 60 manufacturing jobs. On the other hand, a reduction of employment of 3,000-4,000 over the course of a recession, on such a small base, raises the inevitable question about whether the industry is losing its 'critical mass.' The loss of expensively-trained skilled workers could affect the ability of UK producers to exploit fully the upturn, says Mr Bull. With many companies now relying on the good will of their banks to continue in business, the recession has clearly exposed the financial weakness of a highly-fragmented industrial sector. To avoid bankruptcy next time demand declines for British machine tools, producers should now be looking to step up the hitherto pedestrian pace of mergers, joint ventures and bilateral co-operation, especially in Europe. The recent marketing agreement between Bridgeport and Maho, the big German milling machine company, was beneficial for both companies, but more full-blown mergers among UK machine tool companies might be a step towards greater financial strength while avoiding the cultural problems of cross-border takeovers. Mr Bull is right, however, to stress that this is a problem for the industry to sort out itself. Precedents suggest that absorption by conglomerates or government-imposed rescue plans do not work in an industry withan entrepreneurial, owner-manager tradition. The development of larger companies might also help the UK machine tool industry take advantage of the new approach at the Department of Trade and Industry, simply by generating some clout. The industry has maintained a united approach in its lobbying of government, but insiders describe meetings with the DtI as 'like talking to a brick wall.' Over time, relations between the government and the industry could be very different. Machine tool builders are naturally hopeful that Mr Heseltine will have the influence to move the Treasury on subjects such as capital allowances to spur investment by manufacturing industry. But Mr Taylor points out that 'even if Mr Heseltine does no more than say a lot of the right things, it will increase the confidence of the manufacturing sector.' If the machine tool industry can sort out its internal structural problems and gain the ear of government to ensure a 'level playing field' on manufacturing investment compared with other countries, notably Japan, British machine tool makers can flourish in the rest of the 1990s. It is a big 'if', of course, but Mr Bull says the reason reason why companies have worked so hard to survive is precisely that they think they do have a future.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         UK MACHINE TOOL TRADE, VALUES IN POUNDS MILLION  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Year        Sales of    Exports  Imports  Implied              m/tools                     consumption 1980         593         292      268     569 1981         434         281      213     366 1982         477         273      234     438 1983         414         210      194     398 1984         497         226      256     527 1985         606         266      304     644 1986         614         269      381     726 1987         645         306      323     662 1988         843         386      411     868 1989         905         399      519   1,025 1990         941         489      523     975 1991         730*        411      451     770*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Estimates; values at current prices; Sources: DTI; Customs and Excise.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

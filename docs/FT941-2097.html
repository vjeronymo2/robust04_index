			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Portuguese group to invest Es60m in cable TV system A Portuguese company is to invest Es60bn (Dollars 430.7m) to supply cable television to 2m homes over the next six years, using a fibre-optic network that will enable the system to evolve into a multimedia information highway. TV Cabo Portugal (TVCP), wholly owned by two of Portugal's state-owned telecommunications operators, will choose a company to supply the infrastructure for the project by April. It is negotiating with Philips of the Netherlands, Siemens of Germany, Sirti of Italy and Intelcis of Spain. The contract is estimated to be worth Es20,000 for each home supplied. The company is also holding talks with 40 programme producers, mainly European satellite TV companies. TVCP will offer a service of 30 channels for Es5,000 a month plus an installation charge of Es15,000. Additional channels will be added on a pay-per-view basis, pending the approval of new legislation. Broadcasting is due to start in October. TVCP will act as a holding company for nine regional cable TV operators. It will own 51 per cent of each company. Municipal authorities and private investors will subscribe to the rest of the capital through negotiation. The regional companies are expected to be floated on the stock market after two years. The capital of TVCP itself will be opened to private investment after the partial privatisation of Portugal's telecommunications sector due to take place by mid-1995. Mr Jose Manuel da Graca Bau, TVCP president, said the project should show a profit after six years. 'Being a later starter means Portugal can avail itself of more advanced technology,' he said. 'Installing an optic fibre network means that the cable TV system can later be used for multimedia products such as interactive computer and television technology.' The Portuguese government has authorised TVCP to use the optic fibre network of the basic telephone system for cable TV. Investment in the project would otherwise be double.</p>

He stressed that an atmosphere of complete frankness  prevailed at his talks with officials in the Kingdom, and added  that there is a feeling of deep and sincere friendship between  the two sides which would serve the relations of cooperation  between them, which he described as having reached a very good  level.    In his replies to journalists, the German economics minister  expressed his great admiration for the investments made in the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He said in this respect: "I have seen  a country with an abundance of investments which follows a wise  policy and which has huge natural resources that it endeavors to  preserve and expand."    He described the relations between the Kingdom and Germany  as  close and marked by mutual trust and respect, and said that the  Kingdom is a country which values traditional relations. He  added: We are very pleased that Germany is among the most active  commercial and economic friends of this country.    Asked if agreements were signed during his visit to the  Kingdom, his excellency said that no agreement was signed during  the visit. He added: "The two countries believe in a free market  economy and this is why we have left the commercial issues to be  tackled by companies in the two countries."

The German minister then mentioned the  forthcoming meeting of the joint Saudi-German committee due to  be held in Germany in the next few months.

He added that Germany is  prepared to play a role in this respect out of its belief in  free world trade.    Regarding Germany's stand on the imposition of a carbon tax  on energy, Dr Rexrodt said: "No early decision will be taken on  the matter, and there is no scope at the moment for the  imposition of such a tax."    In reply to a question on the purchase by the Kingdom of  civilian aircraft to modernize the fleet of Saudi Airlines and  on possible German participation in this, the German economics  minister said: We know that the Kingdom is thinking of renewing  its fleet and every large company capable of delivering the  required equipment is trying to enter the competition in the  Kingdom. We are interested in the participation of our large  companies in the renewal of the fleet of Saudi aircraft.</p>

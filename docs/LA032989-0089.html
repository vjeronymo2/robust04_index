			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S SHOWTIME FOR OSCAR;  </P> <P> AND THE ENVELOPES, PLEASE. . .  </P> <P> All right, friends. Too late for office pools but just in time for Academy  Awards parties, here are the Benson Oscar predictions, which come with the  headstrong fearlessness of someone who has yet to win an office pool herself.  </P> <P> As usual, I'll list the way I think academy members will vote first and if I  disagree, my own immodest favorite. Reasons are given as much as practicable.  Let's tackle the acting categories first.  </P> <P> Best actor: Dustin Hoffman, because there seems to be a readable groundswell  for him this year. My own choice would be Tom Hanks, who probably will suffer  because academy members think it's too early in his career. Nonsense. The  nomination was certainly for two movies, not simply one and when you consider  "Punchline" as well as "Big" in the same year, we seem to be dealing with a  huge and many-faceted talent.  </P> <P> Best actress: Jodie Foster, from a hunch based on the affection I've seen her  generate in appearances at various awards groups. She's regarded as a real  Hollywood product, as a veteran and even, as one friend suggested, as the  prodigal daughter come home again. And it is a phenomenal performance. My own  choice, in a far less-seen and deliberately astringent film, is Meryl Streep in  "A Cry in the Dark," who now seems to be able to throw away her formidable  technique and come up with the pure essence of a character.  </P> <P> Supporting actor: Martin Landau in "Tucker: A Man and His Dream," because it's  a nice, safe, sentimental performance by a warmly regarded veteran. I shall  never give up on Alec Guinness' performance in "Little Dorrit" myself, since it  seems the distillation of a life's experience, on stage and off.  </P> <P> Supporting actress: I think this is where the vote for Sigourney Weaver will go  because I don't think she'll win in the best actress category. I guess, of the  choices available, I'd go with Frances McDormand's delicate shadings in the  indelicate "Mississippi Burning," although I wish enough of the academy  nominators had seen Miriam Margolyes' Flora Finching in "Little Dorrit." Ah  well.  </P> <P> Best picture: "Rain Man" is all we hear, so it seems a safe-enough bet. For me:  "The Accidental Tourist," whose humanity was a little less on display and thus  a little more appealing, personally. And what a rainbow of performances it hid  behind its quiet exterior.  </P> <P> Director: Barry Levinson, for the reasons cited above. Also for the reasons  cited immediately above, it pains me to make a personal choice from what seems  a foreshortened field. I want "The Accidental Tourist's" Lawrence Kasdan to  win, but he was not nominated. Deprived of that choice, I'll say Charles  Crichton because comic charm is far too rarely encouraged.  </P> <P> Art direction: "Dangerous Liaisons" feels like the solid, showy pick that the  academy might make. My heart, in this case, belongs to the less staid and  classic but equally difficult "Tucker."  </P> <P> Cinematography: Peter Biziou's work in "Mississippi Burning" seems to be the  sort that academy members best remember. My own choice would be Sven Nyquist's  multifaceted contributions to "The Unbearable Lightness of Being."  </P> <P> Costume design: The extremely showy costumes of "Dangerous Liaisons," where you  could practically picnic on those panniers and pluck every one of those  diabolical roses, would seem to be aimed straight at academy members' hearts.  For me: the exquisite restraint and beauty of "A Handful of Dust."  </P> <P> Documentary features: Nice to know that the handful who voted in this category  actually saw the films (they had to, or they would not have been given a final  ballot). And since that is the case, I would think that Marcel Ophuls' "Hotel  Terminus: the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie" would have made its singular  impression on this thoughtful body. No quibble from me on that.  </P> <P> Documentary shorts: "You Don't Have to Die," adapted from a young cancer  patient's book addressed to children his own age would seem to be the winner  here. The dark horse here would be "The Children's Storefront." I haven't seen  the entire category; this hunch comes from (relatively) trustworthy friends who  have.  </P> <P> Film editing: You hear an awful lot of talk about "Die Hard" in this category,  which may be the way the academy will swing. I think my own choice would be  "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"  </P> <P> Foreign language film: For a long while it seemed as though "Pelle the  Conqueror" had a lock on this award. Now, one hears rumbles that supporters of  "Pelle" and "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" will cancel each other  out and "The Music Teacher" will sneak through. Meanwhile, I'll be rooting for  "Salaam Bombay!"  </P> <P> Makeup: Let's be lighthearted and go with a double vote for "Beetlejuice" here,  just as though Rick Baker ("Coming to America") didn't seem to be attached to  this award like Velcro.  </P> <P> Original score: John Williams is an even harder man to beat than Rick Baker, so  this may be one place where "Accidental Tourist" wins. Two of the finest  scores, Mark Isham's magical work on "The Moderns" and Peter Gabriel's  superior, atmospheric music for "The Last Temptation of Christ," didn't even  make the cut, so I feel vastly disinterested. If pushed, I guess I'd go with  "Tourist" too.  </P> <P> Original song: Could the academy resist "Calling You" from "Bagdad Cafe"? No!  And I certainly couldn't either.  </P> <P> Short film, animation: "The Cat Came Back," which is as lively as its old  children's song, and even more fun. A double vote here.  </P> <P> Short film, live action: Thin pickings this year.: "The Appointments of Dennis  Jennings" might well be the academy pick, again on the hint of those who saw  all three.  </P> <P> Sound: Certainly, this is one of the places where the many virtues of "Who  Framed Roger Rabbit?" is recognized, no? Yes. A double yes.  </P> <P> Sound effects editing: And again, I would imagine that "Who Framed Roger  Rabbit" would make its paw print here too. For me, as well.  </P> <P> Visual effects: This gets down to imagination versus hard-core realism, but I  think that "Roger Rabbit" may squeak by over "Die Hard." That would be my own  vote too.  </P> <P> Original screenplay: I think the voters will let poor old "Bull Durham" have  its one chance in the sun here. But because I think its dialogue is more like  great reading than great talking, my own vote slides over to "Big."  </P> <P> Screenplay adaptation: Personally, this is the hardest one to psyche out. The  Writers Guild went for "Dangerous Liaisons," which makes me think that the  academy might too. It's hardly a secret that I am a great admirer of the work  that Christine Edzard did in adapting "Little Dorrit" so, much as I love "The  Accidental Tourist," I would defect here to writer-director Edzard.  </P> <P> So there you have it, bets for what has certainly seemed like one of the most  lethargic and least interesting Oscar races in years. Just think of the furor  that might have been stirred up if a few of the notable non-nominees had been  in the running: combinations of actors or behind-the-camera artists from "The  Moderns," "Dead Ringers," "Clean and Sober," "Clara's Heart," "Patty Hearst,"  "Eight Men Out," "Dominick and Eugene," "The Thin Blue Line," "Crossing  Delancey," "Hairspray," "Punchline," "Stormy Monday," "Red Sorghum," "A World  Apart," or even the great, ineligible "Wings of Desire."  </P></p>

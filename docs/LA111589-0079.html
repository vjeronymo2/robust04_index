			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $2 MILLION DISTRIBUTED FOR ADDED HOMELESS SHELTERS  </P> <P> More than $2 million in new grants to homeless shelters in Los Angeles County  are being allocated to pay for 800 permanent emergency shelter beds in the  region, state officials announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> Senate Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) announced the awards as part of  an overall $5.8 million distributed as a result of Proposition 84, the  emergency shelter bond measure passed by voters in November, 1988.  </P> <P> "Over 1,800 people are being turned away from shelters every night," Roberti  said at a press conference, referring to a recent study of shelters in Los  Angeles County. "Today I am announcing one significant step toward the  lessening of that crisis."  </P> <P> The money will either preserve beds that would otherwise be lost due to funding  shortages or create new ones, said Eugene Boutilier, administrator of the Los  Angeles Emergency Food and Shelter Program Local Board, which selected the 12  local grant recipients.  </P> <P> "This will help pay for the permanent beds we desperately need," he said.  </P> <P> At present, there are 6,400 emergency shelter beds in the county, Boutilier  added.  </P> <P> The Housing Authority of the city of Los Angeles is receiving a $200,000 grant  to place 40 mobile homes out of 102 originally acquired by Mayor Tom Bradley  two years ago to shelter the homeless.  </P> <P> The trailers became controversial when various community groups objected to  having them in their neighborhoods, and by early this month only 61 had been  placed.  </P> <P> The 40 trailers, Boutilier said, will be placed on Century Freeway land and  operated by the Watts Labor Community Action Committee.  </P> <P> Another recipient is West Hollywood, which has been operating a temporary  shelter in West Hollywood Park where Roberti's press conference was held. The  shelter's $216,000 grant will help complete a permanent 70-bed facility planned  at 1033 N. La Brea Ave.  </P> <P> The largest local grants, which amounted to $250,000 each, went to the Mary  Lind Foundation, which operates three Los Angeles shelters treating homeless  alcoholics and wants to acquire another 42-bed facility; Triangle Christian  Services, a volunteer church organization expanding its shelter in  South-Central Los Angeles, and Valley Shelter Inc., the largest shelter in the  San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The Valley Shelter grant will create new beds for families at its North  Hollywood facility, according to Nancy Bianconi, director of housing operations  for the L.A. Family Housing Corp., which operates the shelter.  </P> <P> "We're taking five rooms and enlarging them to facilitate larger families," she  said, "and some of our rooms need extensive renovation to keep up with health,  building and safety standards. If we hadn't received that money, those rooms  would have been closed down."  </P></p>

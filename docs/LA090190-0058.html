			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> SCREENINGS PRESENT PACIFIC RIM CULTURES  </P> <P> City of Sadness  </P> <P> Taiwan  </P> <P>  Today, 8 p.m., Laemmle Grande, 349 S. Figueroa St.; Monday, 8 p.m., Melnitz  Theater, UCLA  </P> <P> The first Taiwanese film ever to take a major festival award -- Grand Prize at  the Venice Film Festival -- Hou Hsiao-hsien's "City of Sadness," is remarkable  in many other ways. It has the density of a good novel, compressing years of  frenzied social history, from the end of World War II to the end of the  mainland Chinese revolution, into the experiences of one family.  </P> <P> That family, touched by the local underworld, slides dizzily to disaster;  meanwhile, their country careens through one social convulsion after another.  The movie keeps a calm, ironic view, even during the most horrendous events:  the street fights, disorder, repression and the escalating series of vendettas  that drive the story's events. Hou's brilliant staging of fight scenes -- which  explode seemingly out of nowhere and then surge right and left past the frame's  edge -- is utterly distinctive and unnervingly realistic. His eye for  significant detail is unerring, his images restrained and lovely -- and he is  capable of suggesting deep, painful emotions without ever tumbling over into  bathos. "City of Sadness," a masterpiece, is so packed with life, incident and  rich detail, it can barely be assimilated on a single viewing. MICHAEL  WILMINGTON  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY WEINTRAUB QUITS HIS FIRM, JOINS WARNER  </P> <P> Jerry Weintraub resigned Monday as chairman and chief executive of Weintraub  Entertainment Group, which has sought protection in bankruptcy court, to  produce movies for Warner Bros.  </P> <P> The resignation appears to leave Kenneth Kleinberg, Weintraub Entertainment's  president, as the company's top-ranking officer. But it wasn't immediately  clear whether Kleinberg, 47, would assume the chief executive's post.  </P> <P> At least one Weintraub Entertainment bondholder said he believed that  Kleinberg, a longtime entertainment attorney, would leave the independent film  studio. "I think Kleinberg's going to resign too," the bondholder said.  Kleinberg didn't return a call to his office, and Weintraub declined to be  interviewed.  </P> <P> Weintraub, 52, produced the major hit "Oh, God" for Warner Bros. before forming  his ill-starred independent company in 1987. In a statement, Warner Bros.  Chairman Robert Daly and President Terry Semel said: "(Jerry Weintraub's)  creativity as a producer, along with his broad-ranging relationships with key  members of our creative community, make us happy to welcome him into the Warner  family."  </P> <P> Weintraub's resignation follows a tug of war among Weintraub Entertainment  creditors over his services. Some creditors had argued that Weintraub should  remain with the company while seeking to associate it with Warner under a deal  that might provide some payoff to creditors from his future productions.  </P> <P> Others, who ultimately prevailed, argued that Weintraub Entertainment might  fare better under new leadership. "Jerry originally wanted to do this through  the company, and I think that would have been a good thing. . . .  Unfortunately, there were creditors who didn't want it," a person familiar with  the situation said.  </P> <P> Weintraub Entertainment, which owes about $175 million to its banks and  bondholders, filed earlier this month for protection from creditors under  Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and has been trying to reorganize.  </P> <P> In addition to "Oh, God," Weintraub scored hits with "The Karate Kid" for  Columbia, "Diner" for MGM/UA and "Nashville" for Paramount.  </P> <P> But that golden touch never materialized at the Weintraub company, which lost  millions of dollars on "My Stepmother Is an Alien," "Listen to Me," "Troop  Beverly Hills" and other films.  </P> <P> Under the deal with Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc., the studio will  provide Weintraub with staff, office space and film development funds.  Weintraub Entertainment remains attached to Columbia Pictures under an overall  distribution agreement for its films.  </P></p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / School ski trips wreck Abta's insurance hopes: Steep claims mean that Pounds 1 of premium buys only Pounds 1 of cover LAST FEBRUARY Mr Larry Cahn, head of careers at Alderbrook School in Solihull, West Midlands, received a call telling him the ski company to which he had paid Pounds 18,000 of parents' money had collapsed. With 48 pupils due to leave for Austria in two weeks, the news came as a shock, particularly as he had happily dealt before with the company, Travels by Design. The caller, from another ski company called ESL Holidays, told Mr Cahn not to worry. ESL would ensure the trip went ahead. It did, without the school having to pay any additional money. Last month ESL collapsed. The Association of British Travel Agents says school ski trip failures threaten its future. Claims on Abta's shortfall insurance have been so high that the association has to pay Pounds 1 of premium for each Pounds 1 of cover. Premium contributions from members are expected to be seven or eight times as high as last year. Like Mr Cahn, most teachers and parents emerge from ski company failures unscathed. Provided the company is one of its members Abta picks up the tab, ensuring trips go ahead. What worries Abta is the ease with which the customer lists of failed companies are sold to other operators. Schools are usually asked to assign their bookings to the acquiring operators, which claim the failed companies' refunds directly from Abta. Schools are happy that their trips are going ahead. The acquiring operators use the Abta money to pay other creditors, such as hotels and coach companies. The losers are Abta, its remaining member companies, and ultimately - through the weakening of the association - the travelling public. Last April Abta wrote to schools and education authorities saying open-ended compensation could not continue. Deposits would be refunded only if paid less than a year in advance and only up to Pounds 25 per person. Other payments would not be returned if paid more than 10 weeks before departure. Ski operators reacted furiously, saying the letters would damage their business. This week six operators obtained an injunction suspending Abta's threat. Undercapitalised companies have long been attracted to the travel industry - encouraged by the low barriers of entry into the market and by the ease with which business can expand. The ski tour market, in which schools are prepared to pay deposits a year or more in advance, has been particularly enticing. Mr John Shepherd, managing director of Equity, one of the ski companies that took Abta to court, said: 'Expansion in the travel business is quite simple. All you do is contract for more beds. You don't have to buy any new plant and tool up for the next 15 years.' Mr Cahn says his school receives brochures every year from up to 40 operators. He constantly gets telephone calls from ski companies wanting to make appointments to visit the school. Abta said in an affidavit to the court that school trip operators 'are particularly open to exploitation by the more opportunistic and even fraudulent members of the industry'. There have been instances of the company that acquires a client list having close links with the failed organisation, although that does not appear to have been the case with Travels by Design and ESL. Abta has expressed concern about acquiring companies' practice of employing executives of failed groups as consultants. The association has not yet decided whether to appeal against the injunction, or whether to fight its case when a full hearing takes place at the end of the year. Mr John Dunscombe, Abta's chief executive, conceded that the association would have to examine other ways of protecting its finances. But he insisted that the threat to the association should not be underestimated. Abta tour operators have to arrange bonds, usually equivalent to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of turnover. If the bonds prove insufficient to compensate customers, the association draws on its shortfall insurance. In the year to the end of last month, five school tour operator failures resulted in claims of Pounds 4.2m, of which the companies' bonds covered only Pounds 1.8m. The remaining Pounds 2.4m had to be met from the shortfall insurance, representing 85 per cent of claims on the fund. Mr Dunscombe said: 'The insurers, to some extent understandably, have said that this is not insurance. Insurance is meant to cover unlikely events.' Abta will have to pay Pounds 3m in premiums this year to get Pounds 3m of shortfall insurance. Abta has been driven to the point of financial collapse before. In 1991 ski company failures exhausted its shortfall insurance. The association had to impose an emergency levy on its tour operator members to ensure its survival. Mr Dunscombe doubted that Abta members would agree to pay another emergency levy if the shortfall insurance was exhausted again. The association is divided about its future, with the larger companies threatening to leave unless the cost of running Abta is cut. The imposition of a levy could lead to the large groups deciding that association membership is no longer worth the trouble. Abta will have to find other ways of reducing school operator failures. Mr Andrew Lay, commercial director of Skibound, the market leader, said Abta should rely on large operators to warn it of companies in trouble. He said his company had told Abta of holidays on which rivals undercut it by Pounds 20 even though the margin made by Skibound itself was only Pounds 5.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow trims losses in face of jobs data Wall Street US stocks trimmed their losses yesterday afternoon even though bonds had broken into full retreat in the face of strong employment data, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 26.47 lower at 3,669.50, after battling back from a 54-point deficit in the final hour of trading. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.56 at 447.82, as declining NYSE issues swamped advances, 1,685 to 546. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 1.97 at 439.73, and the Nasdaq dropped 7.64 to 732.91. Keenly awaited data on April employment conditions proved to be a big letdown for investors who were hoping for a signal that the Federal Reserve would soon bring to an end a series of interest rate increases which began three months ago. An hour before the session began, the Commerce Department announced that US non-farm employers took on 267,000 more workers last month, against forecasts of about 160,000. Analysts said the sharp rise suggested an intensification of inflationary pressures and raised the likelihood that the Fed would now move more aggressively to slow the economy. Many were convinced the central bank would soon boost the Federal Funds and discount rates by 50 basis points each. At the opening the blue chips dropped nearly 35 points, but recovered to trade about 20 points down within the first hour. Such resilience was encouraging in view of the rout taking place in the bond market. But near midday, it became apparent that the Fed would hold off until Monday at the earliest. Its restraint blackened the already gloomy mood by suggesting the central bank may not act decisively enough to quell inflationary expectations. As a result, bond prices dropped further. Late in the session, the price of benchmark 30-year security was down more than 2 points, with the yield jumping to 7.53 per cent, its highest level in 18 months. With the Treasury market extending its losses, stocks began sliding for a second time before touching bottom an hour before the close. Stocks sensitive to economic trends were among the weakest. Caterpillar closed down Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 108 1/8 , Deere lost Dollars 3 to Dollars 72 7/8 and International Paper Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 7/8 . Sears was down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 47 1/2 and McDonald's shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 57 3/4 . Oil stocks, rising alongside crude prices, offset some of the losses. Arco, up Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 104, was given an extra boost by an upgrading by Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Mobil gained Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 79 1/2 and Amoco Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 56 3/4 . On the Nasdaq, Ben &amp; Jerry's, the Vermont ice cream maker, dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15 1/8 after reporting that frigid winter weather had held its first-quarter earnings to 13 cents a share, after 21 cents a year earlier. Canada Toronto stocks closed slightly lower in busy activity inflated by hectic trading of PWA Corporation shares. Almost all sectors were off, except for the precious metals group, up 5.5 per cent, higher on stronger gold prices. The TSE 300 composite index fell 5.75 to close at 4,254.06 in volume of 97.68m shares valued at CDollars 638.6m. The index dropped about 13 points on the week. About 38.5m PWA shares were traded and the corporation, in the midst of a restructuring, closed up 0.02 at 0.58. Brazil Brazil stock prices recovered from sharp losses to end up 4.3 per cent in a highly volatile market that traders said will probably continue as the October 3 presidential elections approach. The Bovespa index ended at 15,103 points, up 624 on the day.</p>

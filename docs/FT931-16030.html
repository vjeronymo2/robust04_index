			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Barclays introduces extra loan charges BARCLAYS is introducing controversial new charges for thousands of customers, including small businesses, who have pledged shares as security against loans. The annual charges, which can run to hundreds of pounds on comparatively small loans, will probably provoke an outcry from the small business lobby, which has complained that UK banks have been treating small companies insensitively during the recession. The new charges are in part a response to Taurus, the Stock Exchange's proposed computerised system for registration of shares and settlement of share transactions. Small shareholders have been concerned that they will be penalised under the new system, scheduled to be introduced in the autumn. The other reason for the charges is a policy change by the bank on the way it holds collateral. Traditionally Barclays has taken an equitable charge over shares pledged by a customer as security for a loan. This means the customer's share certificates are held at a bank branch and that he or she has filled out a form allowing the bank to take possession of the shares should the customer fail to keep up loan payments. A Barclays' executive said there 'was an unacceptable level of fraud risk' in having the shares pledged in this way. Another manager explained the bank had lost money in the past after discovering it was holding forged certificates. On other occasions it suffered because some customers held duplicate certificates elsewhere and had been able to sell pledged shares without the bank knowing. The bank has decided to take a legal charge over pledged shares. As a result, customers are being forced to transfer their pledged shares to Barclays' own nominee company. Even though the bank is taking the step to protect itself, it wants customers to pay Pounds 20 per shareholding to cover the costs of the transfer and a further annual charge of Pounds 20, which it says will help cover Taurus costs. There will be further charges if the customer decides to change the composition of shares held as security. Thus a customer who provided 20 shareholdings as security against a loan would face annual charges of at least Pounds 400, when previously they paid no fee. The bank said yesterday that anyone whose current loan is less than Pounds 15,000 would not be charged, because of complications in changing the borrowing agreement. However, anyone borrowing more and all new customers would face the charges. Mr Roger Peters, a Barclays customer who is managing director of Posh Pets, a North London petshop, has been told he faces a transfer charge of Pounds 620 and an annual charge of the same amount. He said: 'If a Barclays executive came and bought a packet of Shirleys diarrhoea tablets from me and I doubled the cost, he would soon be jumping up and down.'</p>

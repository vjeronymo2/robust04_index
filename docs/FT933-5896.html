			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / People: TSB Scotland's new local hero The so-called Scottish financial mafia which dominates the top jobs in Scotland's business world has a new recruit. Gordon Anderson, 62, the next chairman of TSB Bank Scotland, comes from a background markedly similar to many of his peers in the industry. He has spent most of his career as an accountant, like Forbes Macpherson, the current chairman. Anderson was deputy senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young and a former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland, while Macpherson is a former senior partner of Touche Ross in Scotland. They both live in the posh Glasgow suburb of Bearsden and share the same telephone code. Anderson lives in Manse Road just a couple of doors down from Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, who helped restore Guinness's fortunes after the excesses of Ernest Saunders' chairmanship. Anderson and Macfarlane both went to the High School of Glasgow and are members of Glasgow Golf club. However, one can't quibble with the incestuous nature of the Scottish financial establishment if it guarantees results like those of TSB Bank Scotland. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 79.4m, or nearly twice as much as the whole TSB group. Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of the TSB Group, says that the Scottish market has always been a significant contributor to TSB's business and with a mortgage book of Pounds 1.5bn, it is one of Scotland's largest lenders in the housing market.' Anderson, who has been a director of TSB Bank Scotland since 1991, takes over from the 67-year-old Macpherson next March. Anderson has also been appointed a member of the TSB Group, the parent of TSB Bank Scotland.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Canada Liberals pledgeto renegotiate Nafta CANADA'S opposition Liberal party has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and the 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Pact if it wins the October 25 general election. The country's Liberals yesterday issued their policy platform, which also includes a planned shift in government spending priorities away from defence and grants to business, in favour of apprenticeship and other training programmes, research and development and expanded child-care subsidies. The Liberals are at present slightly ahead of the ruling Progressive Conservatives in public opinion polls. However Mr Jean Chretien, their leader, trails well behind prime minister Kim Campbell in personal popularity. Many seasoned political observers predict that the most likely election outcome is a fragmented parliament with neither of the two main parties able to muster an outright majority. Besides the net savings from the switch in public spending priorities, the Liberals are relying on accelerating economic growth to bring down the federal budget deficit from 5.2 per cent to 3.0 per cent of gross domestic product by 1998. The Progressive Conservatives have promised to eliminate the budget deficit, which stood at CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.44m) last year, within the next five years. But they have yet to spell out precisely how this thorny task will be achieved. According to their policy document, the Liberals would seek to include a subsidy and anti-dumping code in the free trade agreements, and to set up a 'more effective' dispute settlement mechanism. A Liberal government would also aim to secure the same protection for Canada's oil and gas producers as that enjoyed by the Mexican energy industry. A Liberal Party official said yesterday that Mr Chretien would visit Washington soon after the election, in the expectation of making a 'convincing case' to the Clinton administration to re-open the free trade agreements. The Liberals are vague, however, about what would happen if the Americans and Mexicans turned down their demands. The official said that any decision on whether to implement Nafta as it stands, or to abrogate the two agreements would be up to the cabinet. According to the policy document the bulk of the savings in public spending under a Liberal government would come from the cancellation of Canada's CDollars 5.8bn order for 50 European designed EH-101 helicopters, which are built by the UK's Westland Group. Ms Campbell earlier this month said the Conservatives would cut the helicopter order from 50 to 43 aircraft if she was returned to office.</p>

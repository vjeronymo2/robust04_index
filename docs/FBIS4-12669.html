			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 11, IRNA -- The Foreign Minstry here  Monday condemned the savage Serbian attacks on the defenceless  people of Gorazde as "the explicit breach of the United Nations  Charter."    The ministry in a statement said the indiscriminate  aggressions of the Serbs against the city, declared as a safe  haven in the Security Council Resolutions 824 and 836, revealed  the indifference of the international community towards  "distortion of human dignity."    The statement called on all countries, particularly the  Muslim nations, to adopt serious and rapid measures against the  Serbian crimes.    Latest reports say that serbian occupiers, encouraged by the  indifference of the international circles, have intensified the  massacre and ethnic cleansing operatons in the city in voilation  of all security council's resolutions.    Meanwhile, the Bosnian presidency announced Saturday that  Serbs had used chemical gases to kill many people in Gorazde.</p>

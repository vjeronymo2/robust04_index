			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Fire prevention for Royal palaces - Public spending The government plans to spend Pounds 4.5m on fire prevention measures at historic royal palaces in the wake of the recent fires at Windsor Castle and Hampton Court. The National Heritage Minister, Mr Peter Brooke, seems to have fought his corner well against the Treasury's attempts to reduce public expenditure in 1994-95. The Heritage department's budget for the year will be Pounds 976m compared with Pounds 955m in 1993-94. The biggest projected victim was the Arts Council which a year ago was told it faced a 2 per cent reduction in its 1994-95 grant. It will now receive 1.69 per cent less. It was told to budget for a Pounds 4m reduction. Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, said last night. 'This is a black day for the arts and a national disgrace. This is a needless budget cut which will inflict disproportionate harm on the arts.' The full council will meet in mid-December to decide whether to share the reduction in grant equally among its clients or whether to concentrate its reduced resources on certain art forms and companies. About Pounds 1m will be spent on London's Albert Memorial, which has been under protective wraps for several years.</p>

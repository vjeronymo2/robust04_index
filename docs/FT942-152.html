			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / People: New broom sweeps through Macdonald Martin Distilleries Geoffrey Maddrell, aged 57, chairman of ProShare, succeeded David Macdonald as chairman of Macdonald Martin Distilleries yesterday. At the same time, Macdonald Martin - best known for Glenmorangie single malt whisky - announced that Neil McKerrow, the group's 49-year-old managing director, had resigned from the board. McKerrow, whose resignation was a surprise, joined the group in 1975 as sales and marketing director and took over as managing director in 1987. He is credited with the building of the Glenmorangie brand. The new chairman paid tribute to McKerrow for developing 'a sound platform for the strategic development of the company in the UK and international markets'. However, Maddrell said he had decided that the company now needed 'a different approach' and added that he felt 'it was the right time to make a change'. He said the parting was amicable. McKerrow was employed on a three-year contract and Maddrell acknowledged yesterday that there will be some form of compensation payment but that this was now 'the subject of negotiation'. Maddrell is a former chief executive of the Tootal textiles group which was taken over by Coats Viyella in 1991 and joined the Macdonald Martin board as an independent director in January. One of his first tasks as chairman will be to establish the next phase of development for Macdonald Martin and appoint a new managing director  - a process he hopes to complete over the next few months. Macdonald, who remains on the board as a non-executive director, retired as chairman after reaching 60 and having served the company for 43 years.</p>

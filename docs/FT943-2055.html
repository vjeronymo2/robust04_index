			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Ashdown struggles to control Lib Dems Mr Paddy Ashdown was last night struggling to restore his grip over the Liberal Democrats after the party's Brighton conference again overturned his efforts to present a more disciplined image to the electorate. A defeat for the leadership over its approach to a minimum wage was accompanied by renewed manoeuvring over the party's relationship with the Labour party. Sir David Steel, a former party leader, added his voice to the chorus of senior figures calling for the Liberal Democrats to abandon the pretence that it is neutral between a Labour or Conservative victory at the next general elections. He suggested that the Liberal Democrats could have substantial input into a Labour government led by Mr Tony Blair. With many of the party's activists vehemently opposed to a close relationship with Labour, Mr Ashdown has resisted publicly endorsing the stance of the majority of his senior colleagues. The Liberal Democrat leader sees the potential for much increased co-operation with Mr Blair but he wants to move slowly to ensure that he takes his party with him. He is concerned also not to put the Labour leader in a position where Mr Blair might be forced publicly to renounce the idea of any partnership. Mr Ashdown will be looking for signals from Labour that it wants a thaw in relations. In the longer term, any formal arrangement between the two parties would depend on Mr Blair embracing a proportional voting system for elections to the House of Commons. In yesterday's debate on employment, the conference defied a plea from Mr Ashdown and his colleagues at Westminster to avoid committing the party to a minimum wage. Encouraged by Baroness Williams to reject the unanimous position of the 23 Liberal Democrat MPs, the conference voted to bind the party to a regionally based system of minimum wage rates to prevent exploitation of low-paid workers. The decision marked the second defeat for Mr Ashdown in two days. On Monday the party voted against the leader to reject a motion to decriminalise cannabis. Both decisions were seen as a setback to Mr Ashdown's attempts to present the party to the electorate as distinctive but disciplined. Senior Liberal Democrats fear they face a third defeat this morning over their tax and spending proposals. The leadership, however, was spared further embarrassment when the conference rejected a motion calling for the abolition of the monarchy in favour of a republican constitution.

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Observer: Oscar Bravo In January Observer brought news of Edward Belgeonne, a veritable British entrepreneur who at the age of 30 had just sold his second mobile phone business, for Pounds 1.5m, in order to nurture a burgeoning career as a pop star fronting a band called Gone Tomorrow. Belgeonne investigated the business of musical recording and promotion - to discover the royalties from a big label would be a paltry 20 per cent. A businessman to the end, that kind of margin leaves him cold. So welcome Oscar Records, his own new label - where he will pay himself much healthier royalties of 75 per cent. One of the numbers on the band's first CD is 'I can't fly'; singularly inappropriate so far.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dutch insurer improves 7.2% FIRST-HALF net profits at Internationale Nederlanden Group (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance company, improved by 7.2 per cent to Fl 758m (Dollars 460m) on turnover up 3.6 per cent to Fl 23.9bn. In spite of higher personnel costs, ING held the overall increase in expenditure to 3.4 per cent and pre-tax profit climbed 6.9 per cent to Fl 1.02bn. On the insurance side, total premium income advanced by 5.5 per cent to Fl 9.9bn, with the strongest increase coming in the life insurance activities, which generated half the total income. Growth was strong on the North American and Australian markets and generally stagnant in Holland. The combined pre-tax result of the insurance operation was Fl 495m, an increase of 3.7 per cent against the same period in 1991. Profit fell in the re-insurance business. On Tuesday, ING announced plans to stop writing new business in its loss-making UK-based Orion subsidiary, which specialises in marine and aviation on the London market. Profit in non-life insurance was ahead. On the banking side, a continued strong growth in international lending pushed pre-tax banking profit up 10.4 per cent to Fl 550m. The total loan portfolio climbed 4.6 per cent to Fl 132.3bn. Domestic corporate and personal lending was stagnant. Overall group income from lending and investments was up 1.8 per cent to Fl 12.9bn, while commission and other income rose 7.7 per cent to Fl 1.07bn. ING has declared an interim dividend of Fl 1.55 per share.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION Defence Correspondent] </F>   [Text] The maiden flight of the 32 billion pound sterling  Eurofighter 2000 was a success, much to the relief of  industrialists and politicians in the four partner nations.    It will be the world's most advanced fighter aircraft apart  from the American F-22, which will be more than twice as costly  and several years later entering service.    Eurofighter is designed as a highly agile multi-role  aircraft, capable of ground-attack as well as its primary air  defence role.    Developed by Britain (33%), Germany (33%),  Italy (21%),  and Spain (13%), it will replace the RAF's Jaguars,  Tornado F3s  and now defunct Phantoms from the year 2000.    It is an aerodynamically unstable aircraft requiring  on-board  computers to make thousands of calculations every second to keep  it in the air by controlling the flaps, rudder and front  "canard" wings.    The single-seat cockpit is highly automatised to allow the  pilot maximum time to engage the enemy.    Powered by two new EJ200 engines, it has a top speed of  twice  the speed of sound and can operate between the limits of nine  times the force of gravity and minus three times gravity in  tight turns and other manoeuvres.    On normal missions it will carry two short-range and four  medium-range air-to-air missiles. A 27mm cannon is carried  internally.    The advanced ECR90 radar developed by GEC-Ferranti will  allow  pilots to detect, track and fire at enemy aircraft well beyond  visual range.    Eurofighter is also equipped with an infra-red search and  track system that will enable pilots to spot the enemy by  detecting minute differences in temperature between the target  and its background.    This will complement the radar as it is a passive system so  it cannot be detected and it makes "stealth" aircraft visible.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - Belgium Belgium has long prided itself on being a member of the 'hard-core' currency club built around the D-Mark, writes Lionel Barber. But the explosion in the ERM could be a mild plus for the Belgian economy which remains stuck in recession. Sixty per cent of Belgian GDP comes from exports, and 75 per cent of those exports are within the EC. If the new ERM flexibility spells lower interest rates and a pick-up in EC growth, Belgium will benefit. Luxembourg, which has a currency union with Belgium, would also benefit from lower interest rates. But this prospect must be offset against the disappointment of being excluded from the German-Dutch bilateral agreement to maintain the D-Mark/guilder parity. Luxembourg's commitment to price stability is the key to its appeal as a financial centre. Belgium's big economic problem is the public debt, roughly equivalent to 125 per cent of national output. The deficit has been the subject of tense negotiations within Beligum's fragile coalition government this past week. The discussions produced a commitment to cut BFr33bn (Pounds 620m) from next year's public spending plans. Officials acknowledge the talks are critical to persuading financial markets that their faith in Belgium's franc fort policy remains justified. The need for new credibility has grown after the central bank abandoned, reluctantly, its three-year-old policy of linking the Belgian franc to a 0.25 per cent margin of fluctuation with the D-Mark. Mr William De Vijlder, of Generale de Banque, said the central bank appeared to have accepted that the current fluctuation margin may, temporarily, have to be higher. Yesterday, it was intervening around BFr21.40, he said.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Manx officials let insolvent bank trade on, report says ISLE of Man treasury officials failed to monitor the Savings and Investment Bank (SIB) and allowed it to trade while insolvent for at least 16 months before it crashed 10 years ago, according to the Chadwick report published yesterday. They then refused to co-operate with Mr John Chadwick QC, who had been ordered by the Manx High Court to investigate why the bank collapsed owing Pounds 42m to 3,000 depositors, most of them local savers. His report appeared after six years of legal delays. In 1989 SIB depositors went to the Privy Council - the ultimate court of appeal for the Isle of Man, a self-governing Crown dependency. Their claim of negligence could not proceed because the council ruled that the government had no legal duty of care towards depositors. Mrs Frances Harper, a Douglas resident who lost Pounds 20,000, said yesterday: 'This absolutely stinks. 'If we had been able to have this report when we sued the Manx government, we might not have lost our case at the Privy Council. Justice delayed has been justice denied,' she said. It was only after a new Manx government was elected in 1986 that fraud squad investigations began into the bank crash, but charges against eight owners, managers or agents were dismissed in 1990 because of the delay in bringing them. Only Pounds 8m of the bank's Pounds 44m of loans has been recovered. Depositors have had a return of 27 1/2 p in the pound from the liquidators but are seeking compensation from the Manx government. Mr Miles Walker, the Isle of Man's chief minister, is planning ex gratia payments to depositors of up to Pounds 5,000, but Mrs Harper described the amount as a 'pittance'.

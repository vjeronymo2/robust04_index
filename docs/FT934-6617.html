			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Minister condemns council on planning North Cornwall district council is condemned for its planning practices in an inquiry report published today. Mr David Curry, planning minister, said in a Commons written answer yesterday: 'North Cornwall have granted planning permission for sporadic developments in the open countryside, on an inconsistent basis, contrary to national planning guidance and the structure plan. 'Some councillors seem to have also favoured certain applicants, often local people, because of their personal circumstances.' The inquiry by Miss Audrey Lees, a professor of environmental studies and chairman for England of the Nature Conservancy Council, was set up last August after numerous complaints about district council decisions. Mr Curry said that the inquiry had found that many of the complaints about the council had been justified. The council has been criticised by the local government ombudsman and the district auditor on several occasions over its planning decisions.</p>

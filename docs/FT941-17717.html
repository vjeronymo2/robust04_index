			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / 'Dictatorial' de Gaulle blamed for EEC crisis Ministers ruled out the possibility of continuing negotiations with the other five European Economic Community partners when France vetoed British membership in January 1963. The cabinet was told that the five governments were seriously disturbed by the 'dictatorial attitude' of President de Gaulle and might be willing to continue negotiations to embarrass France. But ministers concluded that the five would not ultimately abandon France in favour of Britain. On January 14, the day negotiations on Britain's application for membership resumed in Brussels, President de Gaulle made a public statement opposing British entry. Although the negotiations did not formally come to an end for another fortnight, the cabinet knew from this moment that the British application was almost certainly doomed. Cabinet minutes show that, after the president's statement, one of the government's overriding objectives was to ensure that the French took maximum blame for the failure of the talks. Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, told the cabinet that de Gaulle's intervention did not reflect his conviction that the Brussels negotiations had failed, but his realisation that they were within sight of success. Such success, said Macmillan, would have been incompatible with de Gaulle's ultimate purpose of creating a Franco-German alliance to dominate Europe. De Gaulle, the cabinet was told, had alleged that Britain had made secret agreements with the US designed to transform the EEC into an Anglo-Saxon free-trade area. The minutes make clear the extent to which the government regarded failure of the EEC application as a serious setback to its policies. Ministers agreed that they should not abandon the objective of joining the community, but saw little purpose in seeking to develop a more limited economic association with the EEC. This, they decided, would not enable Britain to take part in shaping the community's policies, while probable French conditions on any such association would be unacceptable.</p>

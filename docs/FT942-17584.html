			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Bank bails out units Mitsubishi Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, announced a Y91bn (Dollars 580m) rescue package to help its troubled finance subsidiaries. The bank will give up some of its loan claims and forgo interest on Y330bn in loans made to Daimond Teito Shoken and Diamond Factor. The subsidiaries face mounting debts due to the prolonged recession and further falls in land prices. However, Mitsubishi said the measures would not affect its profits for the year ended in March as the bailout would be financed through equity sales. Meanwhile, Standard and Poor's, the credit rating agency, downgraded the long-term debt rating of Mitsubishi from AA to AA-, and that of Sumitomo Bank and the Bank of Tokyo from AA- to AA+ due to continued bearishness over the banks' asset conditions.</p>

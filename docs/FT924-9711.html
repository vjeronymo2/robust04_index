			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Letter: R&amp;D tax breaks are needed up front Sir, When it comes to government incentives for firms to invest in research and development, tax incentives may well be preferred by certain companies, such as the 86 per cent of respondents to a recent KPMG Peat Marwick survey ('Tax boost switch urged to boost R&amp;D', October 12). Yet the full report which I have just received, ignores the important distinction between large and small firms. While larger companies may be able to lay out funds now in the expectation of a tax break later, smaller ones (which provide the bulk of new innovations) need the 50 per cent cash up front that most R&amp;D schemes provide. It would be unfortunate if the government, as it seeks to reduce overt public spending, acted on the survey's apparently well-grounded findings to cut the already modest budgets of British schemes such as Link and Spur. Small firms are finding life tough enough as it is. Ben Coleman, 108 St George's Square, London SW1 3QV</p>

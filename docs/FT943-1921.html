			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Danish premier clings to power Denmark's Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said last night he expected to return to power at the head of a new minority government despite a significant setback to his centre-left coalition in yesterday's general election. A surge in support for the Liberal party, led by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, gave the combined forces of three right-wing parties 80 seats in the 179-seat Folketing (parliament). This was five seats more than the total achieved by Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's coalition. Two government partners - the Social Democrats led by Mr Nyrup Rasmussen - and the Centre Democrats - lost ground, while the Christian Democrats failed to reach the 2 per cent threshold needed to re-enter parliament. The fourth government member, the Radical Liberals, added one seat. The Social Democrats, the country's biggest single party, lost seven of the 69 seats they won at the last election in 1990. However, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen can stay in power thanks to the certain support of the Socialist People's party, which won 13 seats, and the Unity List, a far-left, anti-European Union party which entered the Folketing with six seats. The prime minister said the government would resign today to make way for negotiations on a new coalition. But he said he fully expected to lead the new government, and Mr Ellemann-Jensen conceded he would not be able to form an administration. The biggest gains were achieved by the right-wing Liberal party, which increased its representation by 13 seats to 42, thanks to the aggressive campaigning of the popular Mr Ellemann-Jensen, a former foreign minister. He had hoped to lead a coalition with the Conservative party, backed by the populist right-wing Progress party. But the Conservative party slipped to 27 seats, a loss of three, and Progress dropped one seat to hold 11. For the first time in many years, an independent was elected - Mr Jacob Havgaard, a professional comedian. His Workshy party campaigned with promises of shorter supermarket queues and a following wind on cycle paths. Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's reliance on the left caused a slight weakening of the Danish krona in out-of-hours trading in Copenhagen last night. The Social Democrats came to power without an election in January 1993 when a Conservative-led government resigned in a scandal over government treatment of Tamil refugees.</p>

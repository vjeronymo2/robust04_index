			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (17): Second time lucky - Profile: Poole Potteries IT WAS second time lucky for Mr Peter Mills when his buy-in/buy-out (bimbo) of Poole Potteries in Dorset, succeeded in October this year. The Pounds 3.7m deal (including investment capital) which installed Mr Mills as the new managing director of the 119-year-old firm, was the realisation of a thwarted ambition. He was the predator when two years previously he tried to buy the company from Pilkington Tile, a subsidiary of BTR, for Dartington Crystal, the tableware and giftware company of which he was then sales and marketing director. In 1990 Dartington had been looking for an acquisition that would give it a retailing arm for the sale of seconds to tourists. The bid failed, because Dartington couldn't raise the then well-over Pounds 4m wanted for Poole. Rockware Group - the glass and packaging company which owns Dartington - made the mistake of turning to BTR for help in a cash-and-notes deal, and was itself promptly swallowed by BTR. The equity funds were raised through Murray Johnstone, County NatWest Ventures, and debt from Lloyds bank locally. They were advised by west country investment bank, Rowan Dartington. It helped that the price had dropped to Pounds 3.7m. (A large part of the price was for the site which had lost value in a depressed property market). Murray Johnstone took a major share of the equity, but the deal took the form of a ratcheted arrangement whereby the management share of equity increases if the venture performs well. The debt-to-equity ratio was around a modest 2:1, with only Pounds 1m of senior debt put in on day one. The buy-out team consisted of Mr Peter Mills, who left Dartington in 1990 and Mr Peter Henness, also formerly of Dartington Crystal. They became managing director and finance director respectively. The rest of the team consisted of Mr Peter Davis, who became operations director and Mr David Walton and Mr Tony Holdsworth - both of Poole Pottery - who became production and sales directors respectively. Mr Roland Denning, Sock Shop chairman, became non-executive chairman. The negotiations over the bimbo took a protracted nine months. 'It was an anxious time. As to be expected from a Scottish finance house, they went over every aspect of the business with a fine tooth comb,' says Mr Mills. 'But they were extremely supportive once they had decided to go ahead. 'For example, they put up more money in equity than originally intended, so that the pottery is very well structured financially.' Poole is one of Britain's best-known pottery firms. It was set up in 1873 and, in its premises at The Quay on the seafront at Poole, it is an important tourist attraction, drawing 750,000 people a year. The pottery's hand-made tableware of the 1920s and 1930s, with their striking floral and geometric Art Deco patterns, have become collector's items, selling at sale houses for as much as Pounds 500 an item. However, in the past decade the pottery had begun to show the result of neglect in the design department and a general lack of investment. 'It seemed an ideal candidate for a buy-out. There were obvious similarities with Dartington's, where I was then working as sales and marketing director. 'Also, the pottery had been suffering from neglect - its potential unexploited, especially in the tourism side of the business,' says Mr Mills. The new team plans to re-organise the tourist aspect at The Quay and to re-introduce the once-popular tours of the workplace. 'The root of the problem appeared to be that Poole Pottery was not part of BTR's core investment strategy. It was acquired almost inadvertently by BTR, whose target was Pilkington Tiles; the pottery was just part of the Pilkington parcel,' says Mr Mills. In the three or four years before the bimbo, Poole Pottery made little or no profit. 'Performance was flat and the real results easily get lost in a big group's figures,' says Mr Mills. The new team hopes to build on Poole's brand name - it consistently comes in the top three in public recognition surveys of the pottery field. Mr Mills plans to increase manufacturing capability and improve the marketing sides. 'The UK trade side is solid and just needs to be developed further. Exports, which make up 40 per cent of trade sales, also have massive potential which has never been exploited. It just needs effort.' The staff response to the bimbo has been positive and already more flexible working hours have been introduced. This may be partly due to the fact that, although there is the possibility of some rationalisation, Poole Pottery plans to increase its workforce by 30 per cent over the next four years. Staff reaction to a return to private ownership has been favourable, according to Mr Mills. Of the 190 people employed, at least 50 have been with the company for more than 20 years,' he says. Mr Mills claims that this buy-out is to be no quick in-and-out operation. 'We hope to see Poole Pottery in the long run as the core to a group of brand names in the same fields, so once we have the company growing again, we'll quite possibly be looking for acquisitions.'</p>

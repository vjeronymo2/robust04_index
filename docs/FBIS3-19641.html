Upon reading the first report by this newspaper on  comments "by French circles," the minister recognized the  contents of the comments, which Scheer made to her during his  first visit as new French ambassador in her office in the FRG  Construction Ministry. This became known in Bonn on Friday [18  March].    In the meantime, it has been heard in Bonn that,  occasionally, one can sense uneasiness in Paris about the fact  that France's influence might decrease as a result of the  expansion of the European Union. However, differences between  the concepts of Germany and France do not touch the substance of  German-French cooperation, because the French Government has  officially approved all joint actions, it was said.    Mr. Lamers, the foreign policy spokesman of the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, stated  that the behavior of the French ambassador was unusual and,  concerning the diplomat's summons to the Foreign Ministry, he  said: "One reacts with appropriate measures to unusual steps."  However, one must not simply brush aside the concerns and  complaints voiced by Scheer. If Germany takes the wrong steps,  it could "easily find itsel standing alone." The foreign  minister must take into account that self-assurance and  self-confidence must be linked with caution and care. Perhaps  this has not always been exercised to the necessary extent,  Lamers said. [passage omitted]</p>

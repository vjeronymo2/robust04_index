			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Swapo aims to strengthen its grip on power Namibia's ruling Swapo party is poised to strengthen its hold on power in the country's first post-independence elections this week and aims for a big enough majority to allow it to change the constitution at will, Reuter reports from Windhoek. Political parties and analysts say they expect Swapo to be re-elected with an increased majority in polls tomorrow and on Thursday. 'Opposition parties failed to unite around alternative ideas and policies during the past four years of democratic rule. They are in disarray,' said Mr Andre du Pisani, a political scientist at the University of Namibia. 'Swapo could well win two-thirds of the votes, the requirement to unilaterally change the constitution.' The former guerrilla movement holds 42 of 72 national assembly seats, against 21 for the main opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) and nine for smaller parties. In 1990, Swapo failed to win the two-thirds majority needed to write the new constitution alone. The present constitution, negotiated with opposition parties, restricts President Sam Nujoma from seeking a third term. 'We must go for more than two-thirds majority,' Mr Nujoma said. 'Our slogan is 72 seats, all for Swapo.' He and his colleagues would change some aspects of the constitution. 'There are some clauses which favour opposition parties and we might want to get rid of those clauses,' he said. Political analysts say the DTA, which helped run Namibia during rule by South Africa, had since independence in 1990 produced no alternative policies or fighting spirit. About 650,000 people are expected to vote in this week's presidential and parliamentary elections.</p>

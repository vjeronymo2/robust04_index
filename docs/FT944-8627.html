			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Copper market collapse possible next year' Copper prices will collapse at some point - possibly between June and August next year - when investors run out of confidence, and the fall might last as long as six months, suggests the Bloomsbury Minerals Economics consultancy group. 'At that time it may seem to many that the boom is over,' says Mr Peter Hollands in his latest Copper Briefing Service newsletter. He expects prices to peak in the second quarter of next year, as that quarter is usually the strongest period for copper consumption. BME estimates that in the April-June period next year the western world copper supply deficit will rise to 75,000 tonnes from 35,000 tonnes in the first three months. 'Accordingly, we expect the second quarter of 1995 to see high copper prices - Dollars 1.35 a pound (Dollars 2,975 a tonne) on average.' However, present price levels are already anticipating these promising fundamentals, says Mr Hollands. 'Nevertheless, we expect a firm period through to around May 1995, but we expect to see investment funds selling heavily into this price peak.' BME says it is hard to tell at present whether the copper boom will end in the second half of 1995. But in both 1995 and 1996, production of refined copper will grow at twice the rate of consumption growth - 6 to 8 per cent compared with 3 to 4 per cent. Consequently, in 1996 there will be a supply surplus of about 105,000 tonnes. Mr Jim Lennon, metals analyst at Macquarie Equities, points out in his latest market commentary that the investment funds which have been so influential in metals markets in recent months moved into these markets partly in reaction to a collapse in the US bond market. Metals were viewed as a natural hedge against interest rate and inflation rises. He adds: 'When US growth starts to slow and the bond market starts to rally, this could be a signal for the funds to switch out of metals - this seems unlikely before the second quarter of 1995.'

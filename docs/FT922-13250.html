			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / EC protectionism threatens east European growth THE POLITICAL rhetoric peddled by the European Community is regularly at odds with the reality of its activities. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the contradiction between its free trade propaganda and the protectionist bias of its trade policies. For eastern Europe, the EC's half-hearted response to their need for market access provides a disillusioning introduction to the practice of west European capitalism. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the distorted pattern of trade within eastern Europe makes the EC a vital source of new markets and foreign direct investment for eastern Europe. One-third of all east European exports were sold in EC markets in 1990. The extensive trade liberalisation undertaken by Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia suggests they have swallowed the free trade message. The response of the EC, while sluggish, is at first sight encouraging. Last December, the EC countries signed Association agreements with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia which appear to be the first step towards a European 'free trade area.' The agreements, which came into effect last month, have abolished most quotas and will remove many tariffs over the next 2-5 years. They are intended to create a free flow of industrial goods between the EC and these three east European countries within the next 10 years. There is much protectionism to dismantle. Energy, agriculture, textiles and apparel, iron and steel and chemicals together account for between a third and a half of these countries' exports. All have traditionally faced high levels of EC protection. The eastern European countries have been particularly hurt by the high level of EC agricultural protection. The Common Agricultural Policy has doubled the price of their agricultural exports, as the left-hand chart shows. Moreover, there has been a substantial increase in EC agricultural protection since 1985, compared with the US or Japan. Textiles, apparel and iron and steel exports have faced only modest tariffs; protection has been applied through non-tariff barriers instead. Half of all Polish, Czech and Hungarian exports to the EC have faced restrictions under the Multi-fibre Agreement. Barriers to iron and steel exports to the EC consist of quotas on the majority of east European exports. Much of this EC protection will survive the Association agreements. At a recent conference at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr Patrick Messerlin argued that substantial trade barriers will remain against eastern Europe's main industrial exports for at least the next five years. The agreed trade liberalisation will occur on a slower timetable for certain 'import-sensitive' sectors - textiles and apparel, and iron and steel - and not at all for agricultural exports. Member countries required these exceptions, despite the small scale of east European trade. Completely free trade with eastern Europe would be expected to reduce the EC output of these industries by a mere 2-4 per cent. Moreover the agreements are loaded with provisions - covering rules of origin, safeguards and standards - which may seriously undermine the announced trade liberalisation. Eastern European goods will have to demonstrate at least 60 per cent local content to qualify for duty-free entry into the EC; while Article 30 allows the trade barriers to be re-erected in order to safeguard a threatened domestic industry and prevent 'serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region.' This safeguard clause could be used to reverse all of the other trade liberalisation clauses in the agreements. Whether this will occur depends on the attitude of the EC. Its willingness to bow to the special pleading of certain 'import-sensitive' industries does not bode well for eastern Europe's future.

and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices.

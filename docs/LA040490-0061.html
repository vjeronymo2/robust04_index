			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BUILDERS' LEVY FOR FIREHOUSES PROPOSED  </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials, saying they need money to deal with a future  shortage of fire stations in fast-growing unincorporated areas, have proposed  taxing developers for every house and commercial facility built in those areas.  </P> <P> The plan, presented to the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, would add $471 to  the cost of building a 2,000-square-foot house. The recommended fee would be  slightly more than 2 cents for each square foot of floor space.  </P> <P> The development fee would be restricted to construction in the Santa Clarita  and Antelope valleys, as well as Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains  corridor. The money would be used only for fire stations in those areas.  </P> <P> Without discussion, the board set June 21 as the date for a public hearing on  the plan, which was written by the county's Fire and Public Works departments.  </P> <P> The assessment, which would generate $33 million in the next five years, is  needed to build 17 fire stations in that period, said Michael Freeman, the  county's fire chief. The extra revenue also would be used to build an  additional 33 stations that are expected to be needed by the year 2010.  </P> <P> Freeman said conventional methods of paying for new stations are inadequate  because of rapid growth in outlying areas. Without more money, Freeman said,  development would have to be curtailed, fire protection would diminish or  taxpayers in other parts of the county would have to subsidize the construction  of fire stations.  </P> <P> Because the alternatives would be worse, Freeman said, the building industry  has not opposed the plan.  </P> <P> "I would say generally the developers have been supportive of the fee," Freeman  said. "They're seeing it as a life safety issue."  </P> <P> The county also will ask the cities of Santa Clarita, Palmdale and Lancaster to  adopt the same fee schedule so needed fire stations could be built within their  city limits. The county provides fire service for the three cities.  </P></p>

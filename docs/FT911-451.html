			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Drexel settlement plan agreed THE future of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the controversial investment bank which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection just over a year ago, became clearer yesterday after its main creditors reached agreement in principle on a settlement plan. This would resolve all outstanding securities litigation against the bank, which sprang to prominence in the 1980s largely because of its role in developing the US 'junk bond' market. It should also allow a relatively small, reorganised company to emerge from the ashes of the former investment bank. The next step will be for a full 'plan of reorganisation' to be drawn up. This would then be subject to a favourable vote by Drexel's 14,000 creditors, and would also need the approval of the bankruptcy courts. An agreement acceptable to the creditors also has to be struck with the Internal Revenue Service, which has a large tax claim against Drexel. Yesterday's announcement suggested that, assuming such approvals are forthcoming, a reorganisation plan could be implemented by the end of 1991. Under the settlement scheme filed with the Manhattan courts yesterday, the bulk of Drexel's assets - which stood at Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.13bn) when it filed for bankruptcy protection - would be placed in a 'liquidating trust'. The owners of this would be Drexel's fixed creditors and the securities litigation claimants. Drexel's interests in investment and business partnerships would be held in separate entities, with the same beneficial ownership.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kresimir Zubak, official of the Croatian </F> community of Herceg-Bosna, by Dragan Marijanovic; place and date  not given: "The Agreement Is an Achievement of the HDZ, Rather  Than Komsic and the HNV!"]    [Text] Kresimir Zubak, chairman of the Presidential  Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, erstwhile  employee of a Doboj magistrate, recently appeared on the  political stage, having risen from an official of the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] in his native village of Usora, to a  presidential candidate for the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  As he himself puts it: "From the mud of Usora I ascended to  the White House," suggesting that he was a protagonist and  cosignatory of all the relevant talks and undoubtedly historic  documents, be it in Mostar, Sarajevo, Vienna, Geneva, and  finally -- in Washington.    This unobtrusive 47-year-old politician has returned with  his  aides from Sarajevo, where he took part in a new round of talks  with the Bosniak-Muslim side regarding the successful  implementation of the federal constitution, of which he is  himself a cosignatory.    [Zubak] We went to Sarajevo following my telephone  conversation and agreement with Silajdzic. That meeting was  necessary because we had to discuss the reconstruction of the  government, who will put whom forward as candidates for the  offices of president, vice president, prime minister, and deputy  prime minister of the federation. The highest officials of  Herceg-Bosna also accompanied me to Sarajevo: Jadranko Prlic,  prime minister; Ivan Bender, chairman of the chamber of  representatives; Mariofil Ljubic, vice-chairman of the Assembly  of Bosnia-Herzegovina; Mile Akmadzic, minister in the Government  of Bosnia-Herzegovina; and Zoran Buntic, chairman of our  Judicial Council. We prepared a series of questions for our  Muslim colleagues that should be answered.    The most important thing was to distinguish which  institutions are, actually, authorized representatives of both  peoples, which institutions are authorized to sign political  agreements on the highest level.    [Marijanovic] What is your stance in that respect?    [Zubak] Clearly, those are the Croatian Democratic Community  [HDZ] and the Party of Democratic Action [SDA], because the  Assembly had been constituted on the grounds of the 1990  election results, and these two parties, each among its own  people, had won an absolute majority. That fact makes the  authority of those parties' officials unconditional. I stress  this because certain individuals and newly founded political  institutions are pushing themselves as legal and legitimate  representatives of one or the other people, so people from those  and such organizations are being put forward as presidential  candidates. In Sarajevo it was determined that we, the Croats,  should ensure as great a degree of political unity as possible  within our national-political corps, and within our deputy's  club in the parliament. Which is to say, we shall include in  our talks not only HDZ deputies and political representatives of  the Croatian people, but also those from other Croatian parties  represented in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while  additionally, we shall involve also the Croats who are  independently politically organized.  <H5>  HDZ Sets the Rules of the Game </H5>   [Marijanovic] It seems that Croats have much more problems  with their political unity in Bosnia-Herzegovina than other  peoples, particularly Muslims. At the first session of the  Assembly, that fact could not be denied, and the most novel  thing is that the Croatian National Council [HNV] is putting  forward Dr. Ivo Komsic as its presidential candidate.    [Zubak] At that session we also held a meeting of all  Croatian deputies, we failed to constitute a compact club of  Croatian deputies, but we were quite unified regarding our  voting for the constitution. Our deputies voted for the  proposal anticipating me as the president of the federation.  According to the constitution of the federation, the Croatian  deputies' club is the only competent body to put forward  candidates, and no other body. If the HDZ has a majority, in  that case it is the HDZ that sets the rules of the game. So,  there is that much about the legality.    However, we have nothing, absolutely nothing against the  HNV. Our orientation is democratic, and any individual or party  should be allowed to express its political stance, to organize  itself, and call itself by whatever name it wants. There is  nothing we can deny the HNV in that respect. What we do deny is  the right assumed by the HVN to claim that it is the only  political body of the Croatian people that represents it  legitimately. And we think that the HVN does not have such an  authority. The platform on which the Washington agreement is  based is also the platform of the HDZ, and nobody can lay claim  to it. We simply shall not allow that. The content of the  frequently ignored issue of Livno, when the Croatian people  decided that it would support the independent and sovereign  Republlic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a complex state, is basically  founded on the political platform of the HDZ, and the results of  such an attitude cannot be denied now by individuals who held  quite opposite political views at the time and long afterwards.  If that is so, then we rightfully deny the right of the HNV to  politically influence the Croatian people in such a way, to  choose and appoint its own people to government posts. It is  not fair, and according to the new constitution the HVN is not  competent to propose its own candidates at all.    [Marijanovic] Did you definitely confirm the aforementioned  legitimacy at the latest meeting with Muslims?    [Zubak] That was one of the issues. We were present there  as the delegation of Herceg-Bosna, involving its most  responsible officials, and according to the HDZ Statute, all  those who perform highly official duties are at the same time  members of the party's council. The Bosniaks also had a highly  competent delegation, headed by [Prime Minister] Silajdzic, who  is, at the same time, the vice-chairman of the SDA. Also, all  of his aides who took part in the talks with us, his ministers,  are for the most part engaged in the leadership of the SDA.  Komsic was also present when we declared, so to say, the verbal  legitimacy of the two delegations, he also agreed with that, but  later on, he still opposed it. Now it is clear to me that his  candidacy was being prepared.  <H5>  New Times, New People </H5>   [Marijanovic] The choice of candidates for president and  prime minister of the federation is eliciting a great interest  in the public, however, most probably an agreement on that issue  also failed to come about this time, did it not?    [Zubak] We think that the president of the federation must  be a Croat. We acquainted our partners in the talks with legal  and political reasons for that. In that case, the Bosniaks  would designate the vice president and the prime minister, while  we would have a right to designate the deputy prime minister,  who would be defense minister at the same time. When I say  political reasons, I refer to the fact that, for four years  already now, the president of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been a  Muslim. On the other hand, in view of the fierce clashes raging  between Serbs and Bosniaks-Muslims, we think that the Serbs  might be more willing to accept the association with a Croat at  the head of the federation. As for legal reasons, we refer to  the existing constitution, that, in wider terms, may be applied  to this situation. The constitution stipulates that successive  presidents cannot be of the same nationality. Since Izetbegovic  has been the president so far, then everything is clear.... We  do not want, by any means, to complicate the implementation of  the constitution, we are even ready, if Silajdzic happens to be  put forward by the Bosniaks as a presidential candidate, to  accept and discuss that combination as well. Not because we are  against Izetbegovic, but rather because it is understandable  that new times, new circumstances suggest new people.    [Marijanovic] What did you agree upon regarding the  government? What will it eventually be like?    [Zubak] As for the government, we made an agreement  regardless of any other documents. It will be reconstructed on  the basis of the new constitution of the federation, and in that  case we shall avoid parallel, dual governments. At that stage,  our opinions slightly collided, because our views did not  automatically harmonize, so we turned for help to experts.  Their Minister of Justice Kasim Trnka is also an expert on the  constitutional law, so we agreed that he works out an expert  opinion in the form of a legal document. Because, we also  proposed that the government could involve nine departments,  while the existing government in Sarajevo involves more than 20  members at the moment. I think we shall reach an agreement on  that issue next week as well, and when we finish that, then we  shall discuss which ministerial office is to be performed by a  member of which people. One has to keep in mind that the  government will have to involve representatives of other ethnic  groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well.    [Marijanovic] Did you discuss military issues as well?    [Zubak] We have not yet completely tackled that question. I  have already said that in the new government the deputy prime  minister will also be the defense minister. We assessed that  the current heads and commanders of both armies have been quite  successful in their cooperation, so it is also they who should  state their views and opinions on the situation. True, we also  discussed the special purpose production in war conditions, and  some other things. Regarding those issues, we have not yet  reached the phase when conclusions are to be made.  <H5>  So Far, So Good </H5>   [Marijanovic] Is there a little truth in some unofficial  information according to which General Ante Roso of the HVO is a  candidate for the commander in chief of the federal army?    [Zubak] There will be no federal army. At least at this  transitory stage. There will be a joint army composed of the  two existing army structures. A joint staff will be  established, but we have not yet discussed who could possibly be  its commander. Like all other things, that will depend on a  solution of the issue of defense minister. You see, everything,  the entire national chain, is bound up with who will be elected  president of the federation. Which means, if the defense  minister happens to be Croat, then the commander-in-chief of  that joint staff cannot be Croat. But the chief of the staff  can be Croat. In any case, we have proposed General Roso for  all the highest military functions in the federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Marijanovic] What will happen with the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in view of these changes?    [Zubak] It will function as usual until the next elections,  just as Herceg-Bosna will, in political terms. New elections  should resolve that issue, they are expected to take place in  six months, but I personally doubt that the deadline will be  met, in view of everything that is happening in the field.    [Marijanovic] What are the most concrete results of the  latest talks?    [Zubak] There are many. The best results have been achieved  in terms of guarantees given that all kinds of communication  through the territories controlled by the HVO and the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be made possible. In addition, we shall  establish customs and monetary systems quite soon, the media war  is already abating, the refugees and displaced persons will  return to their homes, prisoners on both sides are already being  released. A lot of such things have been agreed upon, and  results can already be seen in the field. Some things are  developing unbelievably smoothly. Principles had already been  established at the ministers' meeting in Mostar, before the  Sarajevo meeting. So far, so good, but now it is impossible to  enumerate all the fields that we discussed.    [Marijanovic] What currency will be used in the federation?    [Zubak] For the time being, the valid currencies in  Herceg-Bosna are the Croatian dinar and German mark. The  government of Bosnia-Herzegovina has accepted the German mark as  their currency.    [Marijanovic] There is frequent speculation about the  possibility that, if the kuna becomes the official currency in  Croatia, and if the possible confederation between the Republic  of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina comes about, then the kuna may  also become the official currency in the federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Zubak] Financial affairs will be the most sensitive issue.  As for the official currency, that will depend on agreement  between the federation and the Republic of Croatia. Everything  is regulated and foreseen by the confederal agreement. Among  other things, it also foresees a common monetary policy, and  many other common things. We, Croats, would like the kuna to  become the official currency in the federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as well.    [Marijanovic] When will the constituent Assembly of  Bosnia-Herzegovina resume its work, and who will chair its  meetings in the future?    [Zubak] The Assembly will meet again on 28 April, and by  then we shall have settled all the questions we have discussed  so far. In the first place, those connected with the election of  president and prime minister. That will not be so difficult a  job if political harmony functions. At that meeting we expect a  formal confirmation of everything that we have politically  agreed upon so far.  <H5>  Tudjman's Historic Visit </H5>   [Marijanovic] Pressures that were put on the Croatian  representatives, and also some publicly stated insults,  particularly on the part of the representatives of the Bosnian  political opposition, have left a rather bad taste in the  Croatian public. Do you expect such things to happen further?  [Zubak] Well, some unpleasent things happened, that is true.  I guess it is the war that caused them to happen. We have  settled all that. Actually, it is only the bad examples that  the public has been familar with. There are Bosnian  representatives who were very happy to see us in Sarajevo, even  though we carried the flag of Herceg-Bosna. Safet Isovic, the  famous singer and SDA deputy, publicly acknowledged that.    [Marijanovic] By your activities, you and your aides are  expected to ensure the equal status for, as people put it, both  the Croatian lieutenants and the Croatian dead [as published].  Are you aware of that?    [Zubak] All those who will perform duties in the  federation's administration on behalf of the Croatian people,  must ensure the equality of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, of  course, in compliance with law. Particularly in the field, in  practice. We shall struggle for that with every breath. We  shall struggle for the prosperity of the federation, and our  people in it. The struggle of our living and dead in this war  is and will remain morally, and in any other way justly valued.    [Marijanovic] The historic visit by President Tudjman to the  federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to take place quite soon.  How do you feel about that visit, and how do you assess its  eventual effect on and significance for the Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Zubak] A general assessment is that the upcoming visit by  President Tudjman to Sarajevo, and perhaps to some other regions  of the federation, will be yet another step by which the  determination of the Republic of Croatia and the Croatian people  to implement what was signed in Washington, is shown. By that  visit Tudjman confirms that in a symbolic way. The readiness of  the Republic of Croatia, the greatest symbol of which is  President Tudjman, to earnestly and thoroughly implement  everything that was agreed upon in Washington, is very important  for the future of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  What will that mean for the suffering Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be seen in the way in which they will  welcome President Tudjman. The Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina  have never concealed their national feelings. That will be an  extraordinary occasion for them to show their feelings again.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Football widens market: FT Satellite Monitor THE PROSPECT of Premier League football on satellite television has extended the potential market for satellite dishes, according to the latest FT Satellite Monitor. Since the publicity over the Pounds 304m joint BSkyB-BBC deal with the Premier League last month, the number of people saying they will probably get a dish has risen by more than 300,000, from 1.814m to 2.195m. The numbers saying they will definitely get a dish, however, fell from 224,000 in April to 67,000 in May. Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research, which produces the monitor, believes potential purchasers may now be waiting for the live football to begin in August. The announcement of the deal has particularly stimulated interest among unskilled workers and people aged between 45 and 64. Overall, the present market potential for satellite television in the UK is 4.773m homes, including those which have already installed satellite dishes. Last month, about 68,000 dishes were installed, bringing the number of UK households receiving satellite television on their own dishes or through communal systems to 2.511m, or 11.2 per cent of households. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake in BSkyB. The 68,000 figure represents a fall from 71,000 installations in April and 94,000 in March.</p>

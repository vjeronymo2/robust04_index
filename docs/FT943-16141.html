			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Profits up at Nuclear Electric Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear power generator, yesterday said that some of its stations could, for the first time, produce electricity for less than its selling price. It said its five advanced gas-cooled reactors had cut generation costs to 2.6p per unit compared with the 2.7p which the company received, on average, for its output. The company hailed this as 'a major breakthrough' which reinforced the case for privatisation. Mr John Collier, the company's chairman, said: 'The time has come for a rethink of our status as a public-sector company.' Yesterday's announcement, made as Mr Collier announced the company's results for the year ending March 31, came only a month after the government launched its review of the nuclear industry, one aim of which is to determine whether Nuclear Electric should be privatised. The results showed that the company made further strides in the direction of cutting costs and raising its share of the electricity market in England and Wales. Its profits amounted to Pounds 361m, up from Pounds 109m last year. This included income of Pounds 1.2bn from the nuclear levy, which adds about 10 per cent to electricity bills. Without the levy Nuclear Electric would have made an operating loss of Pounds 434m, although this was an improvement on the previous year's loss of Pounds 616m. Nuclear Electric has set next year as the target date for making a profit without the levy, which is due to be phased out by 1998. The company presented its accounts in a way which distinguishes its present operations from those inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board. The first made a profit of Pounds 702m and the second a loss of Pounds 341m, mainly because the older stations have large clean-up liabilities which are not fully funded. Nuclear Electric's income from electricity sales was up by 21 per cent to Pounds 1.7bn, with most of the increase coming from advanced gas-cooled reactors. Productivity measured by electricity produced per employee rose 27 per cent. The older Magnox stations are still holding back the company. Their production costs were 3.8p per unit, nearly 50 per cent higher than the AGRs. Nuclear Electric's share of the electricity market in England and Wales rose from 21.6 per cent to 23.2 per cent. It expects this share to rise further next year as the new Sizewell B station comes into operation. Nuclear Electric is now the second-largest generator in England and Wales after National Power. Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said it was 'a year in which we clearly demonstrated that we are fit to enter the private sector'. He said that apart from keeping open the nuclear option, development of the nuclear power industry would bring substantial environmental benefits because it produced no atmospheric emissions.</p>

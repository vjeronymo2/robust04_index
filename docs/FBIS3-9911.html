			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luis Hernandez Navarro] </F>   [Text] On 2 January, just hours after the EZLN [Zapatist  National Liberation Army] declared war on the Mexican Army, the  ARIC [expansion unknown]-Ocosingo Federation of Unions  [ARIC-Union de Uniones de Ocosingo] stated in an advertisement  published in the national press: "Over the years, we have made  demands and managed to establish a direct and fruitful dialogue  with government institutions to expand the support necessary for  advancing regional development. This is supported by the  actions we have carried out with the government of President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari...."    ARIC called the EZLN's armed revolt an event that would  threaten security, increase anguish, and impede the attainment  of justice. It also called on peasants in the region to reject  violence. The advertisement, which was also signed by two  regional peasant groups, was, in essence, a declaration of war  on the EZLN. Strangely, however, the published advertisement  did not include the names of all of the directors of the  relevant organizations -- obviously, they were not in the union  offices at the time -- although all of these organizations have  a long tradition of consulting one another before making  important decisions.    Actually, the advertisement was planned and written in a  government office, and its objective was to "isolate" the Indian  rebellion and present it to the public as an initiative that  lacked regional consensus. Although, the federal government  ultimately had enough insight not to continue publishing similar  ads, the damage had already been done. The long-standing  problem between the two political forces that work in the same  territory -- those sympathetic to the EZLN and part of ARIC's  directors and advisers -- was made public.    Very quickly, however, the EZLN was able to prove to the  nation that its decision to go to war had ample support in the  communities where it operated and that it was a  political-military force formed by Indians from various tribes.  As if this were not enough, the vast majority of the  organizations in the State Council of Indian and Peasant  Organizations (CEOIC) of Chiapas [Consejo Estatal de  Organizaciones Indigenas y Campesinas (CEOIC) de Chiapas]  decided to support the Zapatist struggle. In turn, positions  like the one initially adopted by the ARIC directorate are now  viewed as being virtually isolated.    In the same geographic and social arenas in which the ARIC  directorate and the EZLN currently operate, other forces with  less conspicuous political profiles exist -- for example, the  UGOCP [General Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico], the CNC  [National Peasant Confederation], the CIOAC [Independent  Federation of Agricultural Workers and Peasants], and so on.  Actually, whether with or without intending to do so, the EZLN  current penetrated the rank-and-file of these organizations and  won them over to its cause.    The history of the Federation of Unions, as that of any  peasant organization subjected to the harassment of its natural  enemies and the state government, is far from idyllic. After  growing and becoming the most important autonomous organization  in terms of numbers in Chiapas State, it has suffered from a  painful split by those who have built credit unions and decided  to postpone the struggle for land. It suffered from an  inefficient and corrupt board of directors, which was finally  dismissed. It had to face the departure of a series of leaders  and ejido [a form of land tenure] unions, who without completely  giving up their organization have decided to operate outside the  organization. After suffering from the separation of the ejido  unions, it faced the worst experiences in coffee marketing amid  a somewhat severe criticism of bureaucratism. It finally saw  how in its ranks the young and old became increasingly tired of  getting scant practical results via peaceful means and decided  to resort to the use of weapons. In sum, it saw how its initial  project crumbled while totally different political positions  were being adopted inside the organization.    Even though it cannot be said all the communities and all  the  individuals of the region are behind the EZLN (has there ever  been a social movement in which this has occurred?), it is  evident the call for an armed struggle succeeded, which does not  mean all the ARIC rank and file supported the EZLN. The number  of troops mobilized by the Zapatists during the occupation of  municipal capitals and the nearby towns on 1 January is evidence  of that.    After the unfortunate initial deployment of troops, the ARIC  Board of Directors called for a political solution to the  conflict, a respect for the people and belongings of those who  do not believe in the armed solution, a return home, freedom of  movement, and peace with justice. Meanwhile, the EZLN thought  certain ARIC leaders and advisers had betrayed them and had  become instruments of the government. A significant number of  organizations of the CEOIC believes ARIC seeks an isolation of  the Zapatists.    Some 500 people, under ARIC's influence, participated in a  pilgrimage on 20 February for "peace, reconciliation, and  respect for human rights." Organization leaders did not attend.  According to news reports, calls of vivas for the EZLN were  heard during the event. The demands made during the pilgrimage  were published in at least two national newspapers a day later.  Even though the event was given a religious tone locally, at a  national level it appeared as part of a broader campaign aimed  at showing there are other means of struggle in the conflict  area. In fact, the initiative seems to be the result of a  broader proposal: to make ARIC appear as a third force in the  conflict and to include it in the negotiations.    The accusations the EZLN has made against certain ARIC  leaders, which it called traitors, seem unjustified. To accuse  someone of treason in a situation of war is very serious.  Certainly, among ARIC leaders there are probably former EZLN  members who did not want to join the armed struggle. That does  not make them informers, however. The purge of political forces  is a natural process in every institution, and it can hardly be  resolved by settling scores. Certain ARIC advisers have  explicitly declared, even if they do not share the armed  struggle, they are far from accusing those who have taken that  path. The EZLN's accusation can work against it. A provocation  by any person affected by the current rebellion against an ARIC  member will be presented to public scrutiny as a Zapatist  aggression.    The ARIC leadership must state, however, its initiative to  present itself as a third party in disagreement; first, because  there are more people in its situation; second, because ARIC has  the doors of negotiation open to its demands equally or more  than the rest of the state's peasant organizations, individually  or through the CEOIC; third, because the other negotiation, that  of war or peace, is held between the EZLN and the peace  commissioner, and ARIC is not a party in this phase of the  process. Just as a strike is negotiated between those who  declare it and the boss--and not between those who oppose  it--peace is discussed with those who have declared war. There  is no third force in disagreement here, rather, a mediator who  has been named and accepted by the parties. If given the EZLN  postulate of "everything for all..." the ARIC leadership sets  first its presence in the territory of conflict; it will see its  prestige before public opinion deteriorate more than it already  has.    The Union of Ejidos of the Jungle and the EZLN have named  their corresponding "commissioners for peace" and have begun to  negotiate the path to reconciliation from below. Other segments  within ARIC seem to have undertaken a similar path. The fact is  significant and encouraging, but it is not enough. In a context  in which a national agenda much broader than that of four  municipalities is being negotiated, the ARIC leadership is faced  with the dilemma of endorsing this process or appearing at best,  despite its statements, as victim of a narrow vision of its past  and interests and, at worst, as an instrument of the  counterinsurgency.</p>

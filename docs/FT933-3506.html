			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Jordan finalises talks agenda JORDAN will today announce an 'agenda' or framework for discussions with Israel. Jordanian officials have stressed that the document is not a peace agreement but a list of agreed subjects to be tackled in negotiations. Mr Marwan Muashar, spokesman for the Jordanian delegation at the peace talks in Washington, said last night: 'It is now final and we will announce (it) tomorrow.' Jordan's government acknowledges that the agenda has been ready for endorsement for nearly a year but its unveiling was delayed until the Palestinians achieved a breakthrough. The framework is based on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and includes water rights, Palestinian refugees and displaced persons, disputed land borders, and security issues. Water has become a pressing issue in Jordan which faces difficulties with its rapidly expanding population. Accusations that Israel is 'stealing' water have become customary and the kingdom will be pressing to regain its share from the Jordan river basin. Although optimistic of progress, Jordanian officials say they do not expect negotiations to lead rapidly to a full peace treaty.</p>

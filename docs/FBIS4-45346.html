			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Baja California Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel </F> by Felipe Cobian and Antonio Jaquez, in Mexicali; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Ruffo admits that the drug  trafficking problem is "very serious," noting that the greatest  obstacle to surmounting it is the collusion between criminal  organizations and the state and federal judicial system. This is  compounded by the lack of cooperation among the three levels of  government.    In the interview with PROCESO, Ruffo also expresses his  doubts regarding the Colosio case, and his concern over the  murder of the Tijuana municipal police chief, Jose Federico  Benitez Lopez, as well as the arrest of Sergio Ortiz Lara, the  state's deputy attorney general.    As for the drug trafficking problem, the governor claims:  "It  is a very serious problem. It is dreadful from the standpoint  that the criminals' interests should be implicated in police  organizations. Where the drug traffic is concerned, enormous  sums of money are being transacted. It has been proven on many  occasions (because there have been remands, many of them made by  Dr. Carpizo) that officials or members of the attorney generals'  offices were implicated. I believe this to be the main reason  that it has been impossible to put an end to the drug traffic:  because this collusion has existed."    He adds that, in Baja California, there have been situations  wherein doubts existed regarding various officials, as in the  specific case of Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara. [passage  omitted]    "After so much comment and speculation, I decided to replace  the attorney general (Juan Francisco Franco, who has been cited  as a protector of `narcos'). I said to myself, there is no need  for me to put up with doubts, when there has been no complicity  by my government or, specifically, by me personally. I place no  limit on clearing up any doubts concerning my organization; that  is my intention. I wish this also held true in the case of the  federal organization." [passage omitted]    He proposes the formation of joint police forces, consisting  of municipal, state, and federal agents, under a common command  ("in this case it might be federal, but it does not matter"),  with two subcommands, one municipal and another state, that  would report to the governor and the mayor. "In this way, all of  us would know what was going on everywhere."    PROCESO: The current lack of cooperation  ultimately benefits the criminal organizations, doesn't it?    Ruffo: Yes, because they are organized with just  one purpose; in that sense, they are united. We have three  levels, and there are some huge gaps between one level and  another. [passage omitted]    PROCESO: The PGR [Attorney General's Office] has  accused state officials and agents of being involved in the drug  traffic. What information do you have about federal personnel in  the same situation?    Ruffo: I have received much information to that  effect. The fact is that, for judicial reasons, such information  does not constitute evidence. But we all know the story; you  reporters know it. However, the problem is to prove it in court.  And we have no testimony, because those who would give it die.    PROCESO: The finance minister, Pedro Aspe,  commented in Washington recently that the drug traffic has  permeated all levels of the Mexican security forces. He claimed  that, in Tijuana, "the judicial system is so corrupt that, every  time a drug trafficker is arrested there, an attempt is made to  remand for federal crimes, so as to take the subject to Mexico  City, because all the judges in Tijuana have been bought." Is  that the way it is?    Ruffo: What I am saying isn't much different from  Aspe's statement. So, I am particularly concerned, because a  town in my state is involved, but....    PROCESO: Is Aspe correct?    Ruffo: He is correct to a great extent. And I feel  helpless with this responsibility, because organized crime is  one thing, and natural crime is something else. It is up to me  to investigate the latter, because it belongs to the common  jurisdiction; whereas the former comes under the federal  jurisdiction. But, if there is no cooperation, it is like  climbing stairs with one foot: you go along balanced on one  side, and cannot even move, because you will fall. That is why I  harbor very great expectations (based on reason, however,  because I have often had futile enthusiasm) for the Public  Security Coordinating Board that President Salinas has just  announced, headed by Farell. I have heard negative comments  about Farell, but you must admit that he is a precise, tough,  thorough fellow. And this is not a matter of political parties;  it is a national public security issue. So, I hope that the  bases underlying that cooperation can solve some of what I have  described. [passage omitted]</p>

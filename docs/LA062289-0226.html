			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ERA OF THE 'BAD BOYS' IS OVER, SAYS MVP DUMARS  </P> <P> Joe Dumars today said the Detroit Pistons are going to turn all the "Bad Boys"  T-shirts into collectors' items.  </P> <P> "We want to get away from being the Bad Boys," Dumars said after accepting the  NBA Finals' most valuable player trophy from Sport Magazine. "Now that Rick  Mahorn is gone, the Bad Boys are gone. When you lose a member of a team, you  are never that team any more. We decided on the way to the White House that  without Rick, we can't be the Bad Boys."  </P> <P> Mahorn was lost to the team in the NBA expansion draft.  </P> <P> "It won't be easy without Rick," Dumars said. "He gave us things that were  intangible. He got other teams frustrated and ready to fight instead of ready  to play."  </P> <P> Dumars, the most soft-spoken of the Pistons, said he wasn't uncomfortable with  the Pistons' outlaw image. "I was never really a part of the Bad Boys image,  but it never bothered me," he said. "Not all of the Oakland Raiders were bad  guys and not all of the Los Angeles Lakers were Showtime."  </P></p>

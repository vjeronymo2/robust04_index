It's called a variety of names: brown nosing, not making waves, company  politics, networking -- anything to get that promotion. You know and I know the  old adage: "It's not what you know, it's who you know."  </P> <P> I wonder if it even happens at The Times.  </P> <P> HAL OFFENBERG  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P></p>

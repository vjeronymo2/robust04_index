			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Court backs consumer rights A Moscow municipal court yesterday delivered the first legal blow in post-communist Russia for consumer rights. In a sign that Russia is gradually adopting the 'customer is always right' philosophy of capitalism, the court awarded Mr P Gusev 2.318m roubles (Pounds 574) for a faulty video camera. The store involved, Kvikk, had suggested he have it repaired at his own expense, arguing that the warranty had run out. They also challenged his claim that he had purchased the machine at their shop. However, the court found in Mr Gusev's favour and ordered Kvikk to pay Mr Gusev the current price for the video camera (Russian inflation means it has increased by 220,000 roubles since January), legal fees and moral damages.</p>

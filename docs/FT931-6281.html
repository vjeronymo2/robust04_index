			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: PWA plans rights issue to creditors and lessors PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines, has sent a revised restructuring plan to senior creditors and aircraft lessors which reduces the total prepayment of claims through the issue of rights to buy PWA common stock. The prepayment would be reduced from CDollars 506m (USDollars 400m) to CDollars 423m. Partly-secured creditors could also take prepayment in non-interest-bearing 10-year notes. Holders of PWA subordinated debt, preferred and common stock, would also receive warrants to buy additional PWA stock. As part of the restructuring, employees would invest the equivalent of CDollars 207m via pay concessions and AMR of the US would invest CDollars 246m in Canadian Airlines for a 25 per cent voting interest. PWA said that if the revised plan were approved by the senior creditors, then it could resume paying interest and amounts due to lessors on April 30. Payments were halted on all non-operating debt last November while the restructuring plan was worked out.</p>

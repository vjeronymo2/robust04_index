			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECKLESS SKIING  </P> <P> There is one important issue that was not addressed in "Reckless Skiing Is  Pursued as a Felony" (Part I, March 23). Being a four-year resident of Mammoth  Lakes and a four-year resident of Wrightwood (Mt. High) I have seen a lot of  smoking (marijuana), drinking of alcohol, and on occasion have seen cocaine  used on chair lifts and gondolas.  </P> <P> Licensing skiers may be a good idea, but skiing under the influence could well  be the main culprit of skiing accidents and should, therefore, be addressed in  the studies and discussions regarding skier safety on the slopes.  </P> <P> MONICA MELKONIAN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, April 18 (AFP) -- A leading  anti-Israeli fighter in south Lebanon was killed as his  booby-trapped car exploded on Monday, a spokesman for his Shiite  Muslim group Amal said.    Ni'mah Ahmad Haydar, 32, was killed as he started up the car  in his home village of Qa'qa'iyat al-Jisr.    The spokesman blamed Israeli agents for the murder of  Haydar,  who had led several raids against Israel's self-declared  "security zone" in southern Lebanon.</p>

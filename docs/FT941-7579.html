			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / People: Hayter connects to Unipalm George Hayter, who has turned his hand to a broad range of information technology-related consultancy work since he left the London Stock Exchange in 1990, has become a non-exec-utive director and deputy chairman of Unipalm, the connective software and service suppliers that is seeking a listing in about a month's time. 'This company is the leading UK operator of Internet (a global computer network) and Internet development is on the verge of lift-off,' is how Hayter, 55, explains his interest. He says he was introduced to Unipalm by 3i, who in turn knew him from cable access-ories manufacturer Critchley where he is also on the board. Critchley was floated at the end of 1992. Hayter is doing some additional advisory work for the company, keeping him busy seven or eight days a month. He says he wanted to go on the board, rather than merely act as a consultant, because he was interested in a longer term relationship with the company. His last job at the stock exchange had been as managing director of the trading markets division, and he describes his leaving as 'the best thing that ever happened to me', adding that his last year working under the then chief executive Peter Rawlins was 'quite difficult'. Since then, Hayter (above right) has advised Shell on its international data network, explored with Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, aspects of networked multi-media services, and been engaged in projects for stock exchanges in France, Hungary Switzerland and Germany. His other non-executive posts include Cognotec, the foreign exchange information and trading house, and Synergo, a supplier of software to stockbrokers and fund managers. He is also an advisory board member of Bankinter in Madrid.</p>

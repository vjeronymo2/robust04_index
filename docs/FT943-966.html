			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / Blow for Labour in economy poll Labour has still not convinced voters that it can make a better job of running the economy than the Conservatives, a poll indicates. Only one in four voters think the economy would be stronger under Labour, says an NOP survey for The Independent newspaper and BBC2's Newsnight. The economy would be weaker under Labour according to 29 per cent while 38 per cent thought it would be about the same as under the Tories.</p>

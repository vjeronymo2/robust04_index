Many commenters felt that baseline adjustments should be allowed for the proposed situations as well as for others. One commenter stated that every site is unique, thus baseline adjustments should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Still others suggested that EPA allow adjustments only for small refiners, or for several other specific circumstances. Several commenters, however, felt that no extenuating circumstance baseline adjustment should be allowed. Among the reasons cited for not allowing adjustments were: competitive inequities; Congressional intent to account for 1990 only; difficulty in defining extenuating circumstances; use of this provision as a method of voiding work-in-progress requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA's policy objective is not to establish a broad adjustment program, EPA is allowing adjustments for specific extenuating circumstances. Allowable circumstances include unforeseen, unplanned downtime of at least 30 days of one or more gasoline blendstock producing units due to equipment failure or natural cause beyond the control of the refiner, or for nonannual maintenance (turnaround) downtime which occurred in 1990. These types of adjustments reflect instances where the 1990 baseline truly deviated from the otherwise expected baseline (historic and future), had the incident not occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also permitting baseline adjustments for certain refiners which produced JP&hyph;4 jet fuel in 1990. As discussed in the RIA, EPA believes that it has authority to allow such adjustments due to the discretion afforded EPA by Congress.

While the anti-dumping requirements, in general, apply to all conventional gasoline whether or not reformulated gasoline is also produced, under the criteria mentioned above, no ``dumping'' will occur since no reformulated gasoline will be produced by such refiners. Congressional intent with regard to the anti-dumping program will be met while not unduly burdening those that meet the specified criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Alabama Power Company <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Costle <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 636 F.2d 323.357 (D.C.

In some cases, if no relief were granted in this area, the viability of a refinery could be at stake. EPA is also allowing baseline adjustments for multi-refinery refiners as long as each of the refineries meets all of the specified criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in paragraph 6.d, a refiner with more than one refinery may determine an aggregate baseline, i.e., a conventional gasoline compliance baseline, which consists of the volume-weighted emissions or fuel parameters, as applicable, of two or more refineries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

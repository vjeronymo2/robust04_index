			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The subject of the usual weekly press briefing by  the Hungarian Foreign Ministry was the summit of the Visegrad  Group of countries. Geza Jeszenszky's ideas, which he outlined  before leaving [for the Prague meeting], have been summed up by  Jozsef Barath.    [Barath] The series of meetings in Prague and the  negotiations of leaders of the Visegrad states with President  Clinton and with each other will strengthen the cooperation of  the Visegrad Group members -- cooperation which derives from the  shared fate of the Central European countries. This was said by  [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky at his news briefing, which  is still in progress.    In the foreign minister's view, the Partnership for Peace is  one of the important stages on the road to NATO. The current  NATO summit is similar in significance to the decisions in  Copenhagen last summer on the long-term possibility of joining  the European Union. Geza Jeszenszky emphasized that the current  summit dispelled anxieties about the possibility that NATO's  function might cease. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has  fulfilled the security vacuum which has developed in our region,  he said.    The foreign minister welcomed President Clinton's  confirmation that the United States has important interests  linked to Central Europe. The 16 NATO states pledged their  support for NATO's expansion.</p>

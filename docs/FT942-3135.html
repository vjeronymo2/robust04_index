			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Piper loss 'impossible' Gooda chief said The loss of the Piper Alpha oil platform had been considered by a senior Gooda Walker underwriter to be completely impossible, the High Court heard yesterday. Mr Stanley Andrews, underwriter for Syndicate 298, which lost heavily following the disaster, said he had thought only an earthquake could result in the platform's loss. 'We never honestly thought that the loss of Piper Alpha could actually ever occur,' he said. Mr Andrews, who resigned from Lloyd's after the massive losses sustained by his syndicate, was given evidence in the case brought by 3,095 Names who are suing the Gooda Walker agency for negligence. He said others in the market, not Gooda Walker underwriters, had been responsible for the enormous losses suffered by syndicate 298. Questioned what had gone wrong with the arrangements made by the syndicate, he said its overall classifications had been wrong. 'It was false information passed to us by the direct market,' he said. 'The direct market did not know their own exposures.' Mr Andrews agreed he had never calculated the actual total exposure to risk that Syndicate 298 faced. Instead, he reached a 'reasonable' assessment of this exposure by considering the syndicate's premium income. He was challenged by Mr Jonathan Gaisman, for the Names, that this was a totally unsatisfactory method.</p>

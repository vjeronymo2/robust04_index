During an interview on 10 February, the  day after President Bill Clinton announced his National Drug  Control Strategy, Robert Gelbard, assistant secretary for  international narcotics matters, said that despite "the dramatic  increase" of drug trafficking activities in Brazil in the past  five years he "is not sure there is full consciousness in the  country about the dangerous levels the problem has reached."    According to the diplomat, who was the U.S. ambassador to  Bolivia in the 1980's, Brazil today is -- together with Germany,  Switzerland, and China -- one of the biggest suppliers of the  chemicals used for manufacturing cocaine. The country also has  become "one of the main routes for the transit of drugs,  particularly on its way to Africa and Europe."    Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de  Lima  was informed during a recent conversation with another  top-ranking U.S. official that the next annual report on drug  trafficking the State Department will publish in a couple of  months will say that during 1993 there was "a relaxation of  controls" on drug trafficking in the country. Last week the  ambassador asked the Foreign Ministry to supply him with  information to reply to these allegations as well as Gelbard's  public declarations.    In Brasilia, official sources recognized that the seizure of  an increasing volume of cocaine confirms the increase in drug  trafficking activities in Brazil. "The state's incapacity and  corruption and the judicial system's inefficiency also have  limited government actions," an official explained.    In any case, Gelbard's remarks were not well-received.  "These remarks fail to recognize the country's continuous  efforts to fight drug trafficking in very adverse  circumstances," said one of the ministers' advisers interested  in the problem. The official recalled, for instance, that the  federal government recently created a Special Narcotics  Secretariat to coordinate the fight on drug trafficking.    The Americans should know of the difficulties we are going  through, another top-ranking official said. He added: "Today  our Federal Police drug trafficking control programs are almost  entirely financed by the U.S. Government, which is shameful for  the country." During the past three years, Washington assigned  Brazil a yearly amount of nearly $1 million (out of a total of  $80 million allocated for international cooperation to fight  drug trafficking).    Strictly speaking, Gelbard's remarks do not add anything new  to what we already know. For the past few years Washington has  been expressing concern about the expansion of drug-trafficking  activities in the Brazilian and Venezuelan Amazon regions. As  Gelbard said last week: "Just as in other aspects of its  economy, Brazil has the capacity to produce a large-scale drug  trafficking economy." Besides, "it is the only Latin American  country that manufactures all the products necessary to become  self-sufficient in narcotics production, from precursors to  epadu [Brazilian coca plant]."    The fight on drug trafficking is one of the issues  Washington  wants to discuss during the hemispheric heads of state summit  the Clinton administration is preparing for September.</p>

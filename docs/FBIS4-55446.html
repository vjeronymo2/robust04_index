			<p>BFN     [Text] By 281 votes for to three against, Jaroslaw  Kaczynski was elected chairman of the Center Alliance during the  Third Congress of the party, which began in Warsaw today.  Kaczynski has been party leader since 1990. I expected to be  elected, but I cannot hide my surprise and emotion. I consider  the election to be something extraordinary, he said. It puts me  under the obligation to carry on with the difficult task of  uniting the center-right, Kaczynski told the delegates, who sang  to him "May You Live a Hundred Years."    Jaroslaw Kaczynski and guests invited to the congress talked  about the future of the center-right, which aims at building a  new Poland, efficient and law-abiding and with an economy that  will open up opportunities for millions of Poles.    The congress is attended by the leaders of the parties  making  up the Alliance for Poland confederation: Wieslaw Chrzanowski,  National Christian Union; Romuald Szeremietiev, Movement for the  Republic; and Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski, Conservative  Coalition.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] A specter is stalking Europe. It is the specter of  fascism, and it is not from the opposition but from the  executive, said leaders of the National Salvation Front said at  a news conference today.    As confirmation of the fact that the country is moving  toward  dictatorship, (Viktor Ryukhin) primarily cited the president's  dissolution of the Ministry of Security, in his words, the only  organization capable to standing up to political and physical  terror. So what was the KGB doing then, if not engaging in  terror?    [Begin (Ryukhin) recording] The present situation in Russia  is reminiscent of that of 1933 and 1934 in Germany. The  constitution has been thrown right out just as in Germany at  that time. It would seem that Russia does have a law, but it is  utterly inoperative. [end recording]    [Reporter] It was said several times that the authorities  have set up some kind of death squads which were allegedly tried  out during the October tragedy. True, the opposition went on to  the attack, thank God not with weapons, but with statements from  the committee in defense of the victims of political terror and  the Lefortovo committee. The statement says the shooting at the  defenders of the White House was violence against democracy,  just like the shooting of Barkashov and the subsequent detention  of a wounded man with no legal grounds of any kind.    However, when journalists asked if they have any documentary  confirmation of a Zionist [word indistinct] squad taking part in  the storming of the White House and of the authorities' forming  death squads, the patriots were unable to give an intelligible  answer.</p>

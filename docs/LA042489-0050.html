			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAD OF MEXICO TEACHERS UNION FORCED TO QUIT  </P> <P> The self-described "moral guide" and leader-for-life of the National Education  Workers Union resigned Sunday under pressure from tens of thousands of  dissident teachers who have been on a wildcat strike for the last week.  </P> <P> Carlos Jonguitud Barrios, head of the teachers union for more than 15 years, is  the most important head of an official union to depart since the government  jailed powerful Oil Workers Union boss Joaquin Hernandez Galicia in January.  </P> <P> But while President Carlos Salinas de Gortari gladly took the initiative that  removed the troublesome oil union leader, he was forced by the striking  teachers to get rid of Jonguitud. The resignation is a concession from the  government, which refuses to meet the teachers' demand of a 100% pay increase.  </P> <P> Jonguitud's departure, announced by Salinas' spokesman, appeared timed to stave  off a national teachers' march scheduled in the capital today. The Mexico City  bus drivers union has announced it will support the teachers with a daylong  work stoppage that is likely to make chaos of the already traffic-snarled  capital.  </P> <P> Luis Hernandez, a spokesman for the dissident teachers, said that the march  would go on as planned and that striking teachers would not obey an order by  the Federal Arbitration and Conciliation Board to return to work today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Great Union Triumph'  </P> <P> "The removal of Jonguitud is a great union triumph, but it does not solve the  fundamental problems of a salary increase and union democracy, particularly in  (Mexico City) where we (the dissidents) are a majority and have no  representation," Hernandez said.  </P> <P> Teachers earn an average of $150 per month. In addition to the pay raise, the  dissident faction, called the National Coordinator of Education Workers, is  demanding authentically free union elections to replace the rest of the union  leadership controlled by Jonguitud.  </P> <P> Jonguitud was head of the official Revolutionary Vanguard faction of the union  and a permanent adviser to the full union's executive committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negotiations Broke Down  </P> <P> Negotiations among the two factions and the government broke down Friday night.  The striking teachers have rejected a government offer of a 10% pay boost.  </P> <P> The strike and Jonguitud's resignation present a difficult situation for the  Salinas government, which is trying to hold inflation under 25% this year and  to rebuild the battered Institutional Revolutionary Party. The union belongs to  the PRI, as the ruling party is popularly known.  </P> <P> "Salinas has played a negotiating card (with Jonguitud) because he cannot  afford to concede any more on salaries," said Carlos Ramirez, a labor and  economics analyst with the newspaper El Financiero. "If he does, it will throw  his whole salary policy out of whack along with his agreement with the  International Monetary Fund."  </P> <P> The government must renegotiate a national wage-and-price-control pact with  business and labor by the end of July. The latest accord kept wage increases to  10% for the first seven months of the year, and the government reached a loan  agreement with the IMF based on these pacts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Try to Keep Control  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the government will try to keep control of the teachers union  without Jonguitud. As leader of the union, Jonguitud served as a pillar of the  PRI. For decades, the union has kept strikes from happening and functioned as a  machine at election time, turning out votes for the PRI and allegedly assisting  in electoral fraud where necessary to deliver an edge for the party.  </P> <P> In the Oil Workers Union, the government installed its chosen leader after  jailing Hernandez Galicia and several of his allies on charges of illegal  weapons possession, tax evasion and murder.  </P> <P> Unlike the Oil Workers Union, which also belongs to the PRI, the estimated  850,000-member teachers union apparently turned out for Salinas in last July's  presidential election, in which a leftist opposition candidate won an  unprecedented 30% of the ballots and Salinas polled the lowest vote ever cast  for a PRI presidential candidate. Jonguitud won a seat in the Senate.  </P> <P> Dissident teachers charge that Jonguitud is corrupt and has run his union with  gangster tactics, ordering the killing of scores of teachers who opposed his  rule. They accuse him of stealing millions of dollars of union money, selling  union jobs and assigning his cronies to school administration and inspection  positions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denied Charges  </P> <P> Jonguitud has repeatedly denied such charges publicly. At a press conference  last week that may have sealed his fate, the union boss sported a gold Rolex  watch and a silk necktie and announced that any teacher "can aspire to what I  have if he is involved in national life as I have been."  </P> <P> Dissident union leaders and some labor analysts believe that Jonguitud can  continue to exercise power over the union through his handpicked section chiefs  and that his resignation was, as one observer said, "a mere formality."  </P> <P> But labor specialist Raul Trejo noted: "In Mexican politics, form counts for a  lot and appearances are part of daily political life. Such a high-profile  resignation, such an important resignation, because it was demanded by the  teachers, cannot be only cosmetic."  </P> <P> The government has not said what it will do if the teachers ignore its order to  return to work, but the law says they may be fired after four days of  unauthorized absence from the job.  </P> <P> So far, the teachers seemed determined to hold out for their other demands.  Many teachers interviewed last week said they used to be able to live  reasonably well on the salaries they earned from one job. Now many say they  hold two teaching posts and still cannot support their families.  </P></p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise weakens Enterprise Oil was the worst hit in a weak oil sector as dealers reacted to the re-emergence of rumours that a large block of shares in the company could soon be sold. 'It is an early start to the silly season in Enterprise,' said one oil specialist, referring to long-running stories that a 6.3m block of shares in Enterprise held by Lehman Brothers might be sold off shortly. Lehman acquired the Enterprise shares via its participation in the listing of Enterprise ADRs in the US last year. Speculation started with news that Enterprise is updating the prospectus it prepared for the ADR listing. However, it was pointed out that Lehman had been free to sell its Enterprise stock since the second half of last year. The shares closed 16 lower at 459p. The much-vaunted bond issue from Allied-Lyons knocked the shares in a drinks sector weakened by the Bass performance. Allied lost 12 to 531p. Results, an aquisition and a rights issue left Compass Group a penny better at 528p. The fallout from the bearish statement by BSN, the French food manufacturer, on Tuesday continued to impact on its UK counterparts. Unilever bore the brunt yesterday, crumbling 22 to 1014p. Pharmaceuticals group Medeva added 4 at 221p after announcing a strategic alliance with Matrix, of the US, to sell skin products in the US and Europe. Portals gained 8 at 474p, with some analysts signalling the relative value in the shares. Williams de Broe was pointing out the specialist paper maker's modest price/earnings ratio in the sector. A Pounds 73m rights issue from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was well received and after the initial knock-back the shares recovered to close only 2 off at 170p, after hitting a low of 161p. Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries dropped again under the pressure of a fall on Wall Street and cautious statements at BAT's annual meeting on Tuesday. A decline in Philip Morris shares in New York also affected BAT shares in London. The stock failed to respond to positive advice from several UK analysts, including a buy note from Nikko Securities and research from NatWest Securities. The latter pointed out the 'good value on yield, dividend growth and discount-to-asset grounds' but the stock closed a net 21 1/2 lower at 822 1/2 p. Hanson was another blue chip international trader failing to respond to buy recommendations, which were based on the conglomerate's solid yield. The shares receded 4 1/2 to 233 1/4 p. Healthcare group Reckitt &amp; Colman advanced 5 to 549p after announcing a performance in line with current growth targets. Wellcome reacted belatedly to news that it has received UK approval to sell the cream version of its anti-herpes product Zovirax over the counter in chemist shops for treating cold sores. The approval, announced on Tuesday, was expected but the shares rose 15 to 764p yesterday. International conglomerate BTR moved against the market trend, adding 4 at 585p in trade of 2.2m after SG Warburg reiterated its positive stance, ahead of today's agm. English China Clays fell 15 to 433p after NatWest Securities downgraded profits expectations. The house reduced its current year estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 85m and the following year's figure by Pounds 18m to Pounds 114m. Renewed weakness in crude oil prices as the market continued to fret about next month's Opec meeting upset the whole of the oil sector. Lasmo, whose place in the FT-SE 100 Index is in jeopardy, fell in sympathy with Enterprise Oil and was additionally unsettled by some heavy selling in the traded options market, ending 8 weaker at 146p. This left the stock firmly at the bottom of the FT-SE 100 table. BP was heavily sold, especially by US investors after talk that one of the leading Wall Street broking houses had taken the stock off its 'buy' list. It finished 7 1/2 cheaper at 307 1/2 p. Poor sentiment at GKN's annual meeting led to another round of profits downgradings, causing further weakness in the stock. The chairman said the company's trading results during the first four months of the year were 'marginally' behind those of last year, with European markets weaker than anticipated. Analysts who had reduced estimates only two weeks ago moved to make further cuts, and the range of current year forecasts is now between Pounds 125m and Pounds 145m. The stock fell 7 to 436p after higher than average trade of 5.6m shares. The negative sentiment in GKN, coupled with worries about a dividend cut, depressed Lucas Industries, which dipped 3 to 134p. British Aerospace reversed an initial decline to end a net 7 higher at 331p after Kleinwort Benson upgraded its 1994 profits forecast. Leaving its current year estimate at Pounds 125m, the securities house increased the following year's forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds 200m, citing improvements in the defence sector and at Rover, BAe's car manufacturing subsidiary.</p>

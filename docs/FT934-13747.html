			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BM Group agrees to amend accounts BM GROUP, the construction equipment combine which over-stretched itself through acquisition, yesterday agreed to amend its accounts under pressure from the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog. The company incorrectly classified several items in its cash flow statement, and incorrectly described elements within exceptional profits shown for the year to June 30 1992. It will not be required to re-issue last year's accounts, but will show amended figures in its 1993 accounts. In exchange, the panel has agreed to take no further action. Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, said: 'There was a very fine dividing line between what we did and what the panel wanted. Everything was basically disclosed.' He admitted that the company had made an 'error' in interpreting FRS 1, the financial reporting standard on the cash flow statement. It showed bank loans - including those repayable in more than five years' time - as 'cash and cash equivalents', when FRS 1 says 'cash' must be liquid assets realisable within three months. BM also showed as an exceptional item profits less goodwill on the sale of companies to BB &amp; EA, which was acquired during the year, and some of the shares in which were then placed on the market. The panel said these proceeds were misdescribed. The accounts received an unqualified opinion from Kingston Smith, the auditor. Total audit fees - including those paid to subsidiary auditors - were Pounds 725,000, plus Pounds 540,000 in non-audit work by the auditors. Kingston Smith has since been replaced as auditor to the group by Price Waterhouse, which Mr Sutton said was considered by the board to be 'in the best interests of shareholders' in view of the international growth of the company.</p>

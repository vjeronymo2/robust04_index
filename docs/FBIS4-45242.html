			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.J. Mcllroy: "Cocaine Haul Worth &pound;250m </F> Discovered in Tar Drums"]    [Text] The biggest seizure of hard drugs in Britain with a  street value of &pound;250 million has been found in 47 drums of  bitumen being shipped from South America to Poland.    The 1,300 kilos of particularly high purity cocaine were  discovered by customs officers who searched a tramp steamer  calling at Birkenhead, Merseyside, three months ago.    Customs in Britain and Poland did not announce the find  until  yesterday so that an undercover operation could track the drugs  to their destination.    Officers acting on intelligence reports boarded the  Polish-American ship the MV Jurata, which had berthed  at Liverpool on Jan 24 en route from Venezuela to Poland to  unload some legitimate cargo.    They examined 48 barrels carrying bitumen, calling on  Merseyside fire brigade to send crews with special cutting  equipment to open the drums.    Mr Douglas Tweedle, Customs chief investigator, said: "The  first one was genuine, but that did not put us off. The other 47  had inner containers each packed with up to 30 kilos of cocaine,  all insulated to protect the cocaine from the heat of the  bitumen.    "The cocaine was removed and identical drums were loaded on  board Jurata which then sailed on schedule for the  Polish port of Gdynia."    Mr Tweedle said there had been no reason to suspect the  captain and crew knew about the illegal cargo.    The vessel was tracked to Gdynia in the hope of identifying  the smugglers, who he said were believed to be members of the  Polish Mafia. One man was being interviewed by Polish police  after the drums were delivered to a warehouse on the outskirts  of Warsaw on Feb 3.    But so far customs officers have not been able to identify  the Western European figures behind the deal and there had been  no arrests.    Merseyside customs officers were acting on intelligence  provided by the service's strategic branch in London, which said  it was engaged in a constant war against "narco baron"  traffickers.    These traffickers were taking advantage of the collapse of  the former Soviet Union to smuggle drugs from South America into  Western Europe through the back door--through places like Poland  and Russia "whose customs services are not particularly well  developed."</p>

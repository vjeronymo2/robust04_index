			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Acil expects to repulse NZ bid Australian Consolidated Investments (Acil) yesterday said holders of 60 per cent of its shares would reject an ADollars 127m (Dollars 96m) takeover offer from Rossington Holdings, a bid vehicle jointly owned by two companies associated with Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur. The board did not identify the shareholders who have undertaken to reject the offer. However, about 60 per cent of the company is effectively controlled by Australian banks. About 40 per cent of Acil is owned by companies formerly controlled by Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur. A further 19.9 per cent is owned by the Adelaide Steamship group, which is being restructured by its banks. Acil said shareholders who accepted the offer would be giving a 'substantial amount of money away to Rossington.' Shareholders who accept the offer will also lose their rights to participate in the forthcoming float of Weeks Royalties. Acil said the Rossington offer was highly conditional and could not succeed in its present form. The offer is conditional on AustCon not selling its 50 per cent of National Brewing Holdings, formerly Bond Brewing. The board says Acil is contractually bound to complete the sale of the breweries to Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewing group. The directors say it has taken more than two years to achieve the 'complex and difficult goal' of re-establishing the company after the collapse of the Bond group. Rossington is jointly owned by Brierley Investments of New Zealand, of which Sir Ron is a director, and GPG, the UK company which he controls.</p>

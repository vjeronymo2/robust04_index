			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Algerian subsidy removal cuts import bill with the exception of bread, semolina and milk, for which subsidies have been halved - is expected to save the country Dollars 500m (Pounds 270m) worth of imports or a quarter of its total foreign food bill in a full year as consumption patterns are changed. Food imports have accounted for a quarter of all Algerian imports. This year's savings are expected to amount to around Dollars 150m. The decision by the government of Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali removes a big hurdle in discussions with the International Monetary Fund, with which Algeria is negotiating its third standby credit since 1989. It will also comfort western creditors, in particular Italy and Japan, which have encouraged lenders to refinance Algerian state or commercial bank debt as a gesture of support for reforms aimed at liberalising the country's economy. The move will halve the cost of food subsidies, which would have amounted to AD52bn (Pounds 1.3bn) this year. The 7.4m poorest Algerians, out of a population of 25m, will be spared the worst, as a safety net, which by all accounts is working reasonably well, introduced welfare payments to them three months ago. The liberalisation will end the large black market in commodities such as sugar, coffee and dairy products conducted with Morocco and Tunisia, where prices on such products have been much higher than in Algeria for years.</p>

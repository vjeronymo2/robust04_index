			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Capital &amp; Counties shares drop as assets fall SHARES IN Capital &amp; Counties, the property subsidiary of TransAtlantic Holdings of South Africa, yesterday fell from 180p to 166p when it announced a 29 per cent fall in net assets during 1991. Increased interest costs dragged down pre-tax profits from Pounds 53m to Pounds 29m. Its net assets per share of 283p (400p) at the end of December fell well short of the 312p forecast with its Pounds 102m rights issue last summer. The steep decline stemmed from a lower-than-expected valuation of the Thurrock Lakeside shopping centre, which accounts for 34 per cent of the total portfolio. Lakeside was valued for the first time at Pounds 325m, some Pounds 40m less than expected. Mr Brian Jolly, the newly-appointed managing director, said he was 'a little surprised' at the valuation, which he ascribed to the weakness of the economy in the second half of last year and a lengthening of property yields. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said the Thurrock valuation was not 'a fair reflection of the real worth of this exceptional asset.' He criticised the 'open market' method of valuation. The fall in pre-tax profits was the result of a swing in interest from an Pounds 8.2m credit to a Pounds 21.1m charge. This largely followed the company's 'conservative' decision to stop capitalising interest on Lakeside four months early, adding an extra Pounds 15m to the interest bill. CapCo struck a cautious note about this year's prospects, warning that the completion of its development programme and the termination of interest capitalisation was 'inevitably and normally bound to cause a diminution of profit in the short term'. Operating profits increased by 12 per cent from Pounds 44.8m to Pounds 50.2m. The injection of Pounds 102m equity capital, together with Pounds 64m from property sales, kept gearing at 75 per cent at the year-end. Earnings per share fell from 24.4p to 10.6p. The final dividend is 5p, making a total of 10p (13.2p), as foreshadowed with the rights issue. Mr Jolly, formerly deputy managing director, took over as managing director a week ago from Mr Ray Moorman, who wished to take early retirement. See Lex</p>

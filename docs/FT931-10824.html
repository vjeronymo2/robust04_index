			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Assorted jets for sale in Ukraine's arms bazaar MR EVGENI BLINKOV sits at his desk crowded with western-made computers, fax machines and telephones, negotiating with three buyers. He is offering for sale what brokers believe is the most extensive array of Soviet-made military hardware to be sold by private dealers. Mr Blinkov is director of the Ukrainian-Siberian Commodities Exchange which used to sell commodities such as oil and grain. These days, the exchange has fallen on hard times, which is why it has had to turn to less conventional merchandise. One buyer is from the Americas, another from Europe and there is a mystery purchaser from within the former Soviet Union (but ostensibly representing foreign interests). Yesterday Mr Blinkov's list of wares included new Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets (one careful owner) offered for a mere Dollars 31m (Pounds 20.5m) each or, for the budget-conscious, the more modest Su-25 model at Dollars 11.9m. Twenty-seven older Mig-27s are also available for Dollars 16m apiece. For naval powers, there are two new diesel-powered submarines, going for between Dollars 130m and Dollars 150m each. Buyers interested in shooting down aircraft can purchase a Zenith anti-aircraft system for Dollars 65m. 'If this sale is successful, then I think we can expect to receive further offers,' Mr Blinkov said. 'There are 15 former Soviet republics and all of them have weapons.' He said that an agent from the Baltic republics had already contacted the exchange with a request to arrange another arms sale. 'For us, the more buyers, the better,' Mr Blinkov said. 'I think we will be able to sell all of the weapons.' The only conditions of sale are that the weapons should be sold outside the Commonwealth of Independent States, that the buyer be licensed within his own country to deal in arms and that the buyer present proof of his ability to pay. However, Mr Blinkov admits: 'I, of course, do not care who the buyers actually represent.' 'This is enough to arm an entire nation,' a promotional leaflet cheerfully proclaims about the hardware on offer. Officials at the exchange say more than Dollars 2bn worth of weapons are up for sale. The arms sale in Kharkov, which will accept bids until the end of the month and has already conducted two smaller arms trades, is just one sign of the growing availability of sophisticated Soviet military hardware to private buyers. A few smaller-scale arms sales have been held in the past few months in Moscow. Western diplomats say they are even more concerned about murky arms deals in the central Asian republics, which are suspected of providing weapons to Iran. But who supplies the weapons to the Ukrainian-Siberian Exchange? Mr Blinkov says the weapons are being supplied by a private Russian source, which claims to have the ability to manufacture arms to order as well as providing older weapons. According to specifications supplied by the seller, the weapons can be delivered at various ports in Russia and the Baltics and at an airport in the European region of the former Soviet Union. The sole role of the exchange is to act as intermediary between buyers and the seller, who will sign the final arms contract. Why, then, choose the Ukrainian-Siberian exchange as a middleman which will take a commission of up to 2 per cent? 'I think that they wanted the transaction to occur at some distance from Moscow,' Mr Blinkov said. Because the seller claims the capacity to produce weapons, he is convinced that 'this is the state acting under cover of private business'.</p>

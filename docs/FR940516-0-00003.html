			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this final rule, all areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties are released from their classification as quarantined areas, and the area in Hillsborough County is released from its classification as a survey area. Citrus plants, plant parts, citrus fruit, and other regulated articles from formerly quarantined areas are allowed to be moved interstate to other areas in the United States, including commercial citrus-producing areas, and regulated articles are allowed to be moved interstate through quarantined areas. Requirements which apply to survey areas are also removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have determined that 237 individuals and businesses will be economically affected by the changes. These individuals and businesses include: lawn care companies (82), grove owners (74 persons who own 2,177 acres), retail nursery outlets (21), fruit processors (15), fruit harvesting contractors (12), fruit shippers (12), fresh fruit packing houses (11), nurseries (9), and seed extractors (1). APHIS believes that virtually all of these individuals and businesses are small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that the costs of compliance were, in many cases, minimal, and that the individuals and businesses affected by the regulations represent less than one percent of all similar individuals and businesses in Florida.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the largest groups of affected individuals and business is grove owners. We estimate that this rule change will save each affected grove owner approximately $25 per acre, per year, by removing requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning and disinfecting vehicles, equipment, and personnel leaving their groves. These costs represent a small percentage of the owners' overall production costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, this final rule will allow grove owners to expand the areas into which their fruit could be moved interstate, in that they will be allowed to move fruit interstate to commercial citrus-producing areas. We anticipate that any impact from this rule change will be negligible, as approximately 90 percent of all of Florida's citrus production is for the juice market, and only about 10 percent is for the fresh fruit market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to grove owners in the quarantined areas, truckers, packing and processing plants, and lawn services within the currently quarantined areas will no longer be subject to inspection and will no longer need to carry out activities now required by the regulations. This should result in financial savings to these entities. This also means that groves producing regulated fruit for interstate movement, regulated trees, and regulated plants in the current survey area will no longer be subject to regular inspections for citrus canker. This change will reduce the burden on APHIS and Florida State agencies, which currently provide inspectors to perform inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

Under this final rule: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule are preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly 7 CFR part 301 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

However, the debate did not happen. More from our  colleague, editor of the weekly PRACE Renata Havranova.    [Havranova] Today was a tense, chaotic, and at times very  undignified day for the deputies of the Slovak parliament.  After a three-hour long delay, the session started with an  argument about who was entitled to chair it. The deputies voted  to take away the right of chairing the session from Ivan  Gasparovic [chairman of the National Council of the Slovak  Republic] for failing to keep time and authorized Ludovit Cernak  [chairman of the Slovak National Party and deputy chairman of  parliament] to do so. Gasparovic protested that only he, as  chairman of parliament, had the right to call and chair the  session. He therefore announced a recess.    Prime Minister Meciar, who wanted to withdraw the bill on  large-scale privatization but failed, demonstratively left the  chamber [declaring] that he did not accept the chairmanship of  Ludovit Cernak.    Since morning, the game in parliament was all about nerves  and time. The coalition, in an attempt to equalize the voting  score of opposition, is alleged to have brought by police  helicopter Deputy [Peter] Brnak [Slovak National Party (SNS)]  from medical treatment and Augustin Marian Huska [Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)], who is in serious medical  condition, straight from the hospital. Even so, they did not  match the opposition votes.    In the meantime, the cross-party parliamentary standing  committee decided to continue the debate. Soon after the  opening, deputy [Tibor] Cabaj from the HZDS announced that the  coalition clubs of deputies considered the withdrawal of Ivan  Gasparovic's right to chair the debate to be anticonstitutional  and therefore proposed that the matter be decided by the  Constitutional Court. Until its decision, the HZDS deputies and  some of SNS deputies would not be taking part in parliamentary  meetings. Deputies of both parliamentary clubs then left the  chamber.    The remaining deputies took strong exception to such  procedure. They said that it was an intentional attempt to avoid  a debate on such a very important law as was the law on  large-scale privatization.    For Slovakia, it was tragic behavior. According to the  opposition deputies, the principle of parliamentarism was put in  doubt, and that was particularly dangerous for Slovakia in the  present political situation. The majority of the cross-party  standing committee that met after this situation had arisen,  agreed to adjourn the meeting until tomorrow morning.</p>

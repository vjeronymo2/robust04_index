			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ondrej Dostal: "A Well-Balanced Sheet"] </F>   [Text] The results of the public opinion survey that the  FOCUS agency carried out in May register, among other things,  the population's views on selected problems that are  illustrative of attitudes on the right-center-left scale.    A total of 7.1 percent of respondents identified themselves  clearly as being on the left, 14.9 percent as leaning toward the  left, 44.1 percent as leaning toward the center, 13.1 percent as  leaning toward the right, and 6.7 percent as being clearly on  the right. What is evident, apart from the numerical equality  between "right-wingers" and "left-wingers," is the clear  dominance of those who profess allegiance to the political  center. However, this position in the center does not have the  character of consistent and unambiguous centrist positions but,  rather, is a combination of right-wing and left-wing attitudes.    In relation to the general economic transformation,  proreform  attitudes and approaches that can be considered right-wing have  a surprisingly strong representation. As many as 45.9 percent  of respondents are of the opinion that the pace of the economic  reform should be faster, and 25.3 percent consider its pace  adequate. On the other hand, 13.7 percent advocate the slowing  down of the reform, and only 2.3 percent want the reform to be  halted. More than one-half of respondents (52.8 percent) agree  with the privatization of the largest possible number of  companies, while 35.3 percent are of the opposite opinion.    Those polled in the FOCUS survey expressed a relatively  favorable attitude toward private entrepreneurs--41.3 percent  advocate a reduction of the entrepreneurs' tax burden, compared  with 17.7 percent who would like to see their tax burden rise.  The opinion that companies and firms should be given the  opportunity to give a part of their taxes directly in support of  health care, education, culture, sports, and the like is  supported by 60.6 percent of those polled, while only 21.1  percent want taxes to be surrendered exclusively directly into  the state budget. Views on the terms of the payment of  unemployment benefits reveal a similar pattern--59.9 percent  want them to be tightened, while 14.8 percent want them to be  less stringent.    On some other questions (and it needs to be said that these  questions have a more immediate impact on the respondents'  lives), views gravitate more toward the center. For example,  41.2 percent advocate the existence of a single type of health  and social insurance for everyone, while approximately the same  number (41.4 percent) prefer the possibility to choose from  various types of health and social insurance according to one's  own choice and level of income. The view that the state should  provide child allowances regardless of the level of parents'  income is supported by 40.3 percent; 26.7 percent believe that  they should be paid only to families living at the subsistence  level, while 30.5 percent are somewhere in between these two  options.    However, all of the previous seemingly protransformation  figures are called in question somewhat by the fact that as many  as 47.2 percent disagree with the view that the changes in the  economy must be made as quickly as possible, even at the cost of  temporarily lowering living standards. On the other hand, 45  percent agree with this view. Given the erstwhile massive shock  over "belt-tightening," this division into two almost equally  strong halves is not all that tragic, however.    The most extreme antireform attitudes appear at the most  general level. As many as 67.8 percent believe that income  differentials should be reduced, with which only 27.9 percent  disagree. As many as 82.8 percent agree with the view that  people in our country are growing rich predominantly by  dishonest means, as against 14.6 percent who disagree with this  view.    On the other hand, also positive tendencies are to be  observed at the rather general plane, which cannot be quite  unequivocally assessed in terms of right-wing or left-wing  attitudes. The view that Slovakia should follow as much as  possible the example of the advanced countries of the West is  supported by 66.6 percent, while only 25.9 percent voiced  disagreement with this view.    On the whole, the sheet is thus well-balanced.</p>

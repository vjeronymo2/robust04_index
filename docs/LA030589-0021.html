			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPEYE  </P> <P> QUOTE OF THE WEEK: We've seen some pretty odd couples -- but rap icons Ice T,  Slick Rick and Fab Five Freddy with . . . Malcolm Forbes? It all happened at  MTV's noisy post-Grammy's Rap Party, where the world's hippest 69-year-old  Capitalist Kingpin (and frequent Liz Taylor date) mixed with rap royalty like  DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Kool Moe Dee, JJ Fad and Salt 'n Pepa.  (Dennis Hopper was there too, but who noticed?) As he posed for pictures,  Forbes eyed the rap posse's shiny assortment of rings and monster cables,  quipping: "Liz's jewelry has nothing on you guys!"  </P></p>

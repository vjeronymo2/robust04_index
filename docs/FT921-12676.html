			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Japan plans Soviet food loans: Republics would get Dollars 500m to buy goods from east Europe JAPAN is considering a plan to offer Dollars 500m (Pounds 276m) of no-interest loans to former Soviet republics to buy food and other goods from eastern Europe, according to western officials in Washington. The idea of promoting 'triangular trade' between the emerging democracies in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States using third-party finance was discussed during the two-day international aid conference in Washington this week. The aim is not to recreate wholesale the old trading patterns between a communist Soviet Union and its Soviet bloc satellites, but rather to single out specific goods such as grain and feedstuff which could be sold to help hard-pressed republics and bolster economies of eastern Europe. Despite some apparent Russian disquiet at getting aid from eastern Europe rather than directly from the west, the European Commission yesterday reiterated its intention of pursuing triangular operations. The Commission said it hoped to use up to Ecu750m (Pounds 535m) in EC food credit in this way. The Commission stressed yesterday the need for speedy action to give substance to the aid plans agreed by the Washington conference. It emphasised the importance of next week's Minsk meeting with CIS republics in tailoring the Washington plans to what the republics perceived as their most urgent needs. In contrast to this week's opening conference, the CIS republics will be invited to the follow-up conference to be hosted in Lisbon in May by the EC's Portuguese presidency, Commission officials said. A senior US official said yesterday the Washington conference had proven successful in 'breaking the inertia' which threatened to take hold of western aid efforts at the end of 1991. Officials in Moscow yesterday welcomed the western aid effort but voiced doubts about whether the right goods were being sent in the right way to tackle the crisis. Mr Alexander Zhitnikov, deputy head of Russia's Commission for Co-ordinating Humanitarian Aid, questioned plans for a Dollars 61m US airlift of food and medicines. 'Of course we need aid urgently and of course we are very thankful,' he said. 'But the main thing is to begin the process straight away and to use other means of transportation as much as possible.' The Japanese offer of Dollars 500m in concessionary loans stems from a Dollars 2.6bn credit package put forward last October after the failed putsch in Moscow. One technical problem is that untied Japanese loans to one country must be made available to the rest of the world. 'We have not made a final decision on how to use this money, but we are trying to find ways round this provision,' a Japanese official said. During the conference, several countries pledged fresh financial support for the former Soviet Union. Oman announced it would commit Dollars 200m for energy exploration. Thailand offered Dollars 450m in loans for republics to buy rice and other commodities, with Korea putting up Dollars 800m to do the same. Argentina said it was willing to absorb 100,000 Russian immigrants. Saudi Arab and other Gulf states agreed to unfreeze more than Dollars 1bn in aid held up after the August coup. President George Bush also said he would seek congressional approval for Dollars 645m in new humanitarian aid to the republics. The US administration is drawing up plans to recruit up to 2,000 Soviet nuclear scientists to thwart efforts by Libya and Iran to hire their expertise. The funds would be drawn from Dollars 400m which Congress approved last year for dismantling the Soviet nuclear arsenal, a senior US official said. The plan could be announced in Mr Bush's State of the Union address next week.</p>

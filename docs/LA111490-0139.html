			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITAN POINT GUARD MIGHT NEED SURGERY  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton point guard Wayne Williams, the Titans' only returning  full-time starter, might have to have surgery to remove a bone chip in his  ankle, Coach John Sneed said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Williams, who averaged 9.8 points and 7.2 assists per game last season, will  undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test on the ankle today to determine the  severity of the problem.  </P> <P> Titan trainer Jerry Lloyd said the size and location of the bone chip would  determine whether surgery was required. There's also a chance that Williams,  who has experienced nagging pain in the ankle for several weeks and missed  practice Monday and Tuesday, suffered a stress fracture.  </P> <P> Lloyd said that if surgery isn't necessary, Williams would receive cortisone  shots and could play when the pain subsides. That would put the junior on a  day-to-day status.  </P> <P> Dwayne Bradbury, a 6-foot-4 guard from Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles,  has made an oral commitment to play basketball at Fullerton. Bradbury, who  plays point guard and shooting guard, said he will sign a national letter of  intent today or Thursday. MIKE DiGIOVANNA  </P></p>

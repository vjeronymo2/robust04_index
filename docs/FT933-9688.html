			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Lib Dem targeting wins 19 seats THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS have made a net gain of 19 seats in the 183 local authority by-elections that have been held since the county council elections in May. According to the Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre at the University of Plymouth this is the result of successful targeting of resources at promising seats, and could be translated into future gains of parliamentary seats. Mr Collin Rallings and Mr Michael Thrasher, of the university, said the Liberal Democrats had gained four seats in the south-west in last year's general election, even though their share of the national vote fell by 4.5 per cent. They said: 'Landslide local election victories in 1991 in north Devon and Taunton Deane district councils, and Torbay Borough Council, paved the way for a swing against the trend in April 1992.' Writing in Local Government Chronicle, they concluded: 'Unless the Tories manage to increase their vote at the next election, they are likely to lose at least a handful of seats to the Liberal Democrats in southern England.' Thirteen of the gains were from the Conservatives, with four from Labour and two from others. Several gains were made in the south-west, but seats were also gained in Conservative strongholds such as Basildon, Essex. In the Labour-controlled London borough of Lambeth, recently the subject of a fiercely critical report by the district auditor, the Liberal Democrats last month won a seat in the Oval ward from Labour. Labour and the Conservatives both suggested that the figures may not indicate a national trend. Labour said: 'This sounds very much like a protest vote against this disaster of a government. After the last round of local elections we had the largest presence in local government, so Labour starts with a high base while the Liberal Democrats start with a low one.' The Conservatives said: 'We are always disappointed to lose seats, and we are not complacent about this. This is mid-term, so the votes could be due to a protest.'</p>

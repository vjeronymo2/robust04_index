In an interview published in Harare, Dr.  Nathan Shamuyarira said the International Republican Institute  was funded by security agents of big powers. The Zimbabwean  Government strongly regretted the plan to help the opposition.  He said it was tantamount to interference in the internal  affairs of Zimbabwe. Dr. Shamuyarira said there was a danger  that the American funding could lead to subversion. Zimbabwean  opposition parties should fund themselves locally. He said the  money they received from the international organizations was  dirty money.</p>

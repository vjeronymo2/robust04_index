			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Renouf Properties is placed in liquidation DIRECTORS of Renouf Properties have placed it in liquidation after efforts to restructure its debts failed. The company is a subsidiary of Renouf Corporation, the merchant bank. Mr Andrew Strange, Renouf Properties' chairman, said no agreement could be reached with bankers on a scheme of agreement to allow the company to meet ongoing obligations. He said Coopers &amp; Lybrand had been appointed provisional liquidator. In February, the company reported a NZDollars 4.9m (USDollars 2.9m) loss for the six months to December, and said its future was dependent on the outcome of negotiations with the banks. It had been unable to pay mortgage obligations since late in 1990 and had failed to find a buyer for a portfolio of properties. Mr Strange said a provisional liquidator had been appointed since the company had no debenture holders who could initiate a receivership. The banks held mortgages secured against individual properties and sales of these were now a matter for the banks and the liquidator. At December 31, Renouf Properties had borrowings of NZDollars 67m, equal to 59.7 per cent of total assets. The last published balance sheet valued the company's 16 properties at NZDollars 112m. Mr Strange said the liquidation should be seen in the context of the serious problems which had beset the property sector since the 1987 share market crash.</p>

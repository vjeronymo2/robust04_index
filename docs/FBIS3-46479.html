"Our troops are getting closer and closer, the military  pressure is working," Ieng Muli said, adding that he hoped the  government troops would control the base within the next few  days. The attack was a follow up to the offensive launched in  central Kompong Thom province December 16 where government  forces recaptured a number of Khmer Rouge bases.    The troops advanced from Kompong Thom towards Anlong Veng  and  now control almost half the area around the Khmer Rouge base  which is the guerrilla faction's headquarters for all operations  in north and central Cambodia.    The base was commanded by one-legged Khmer Rouge general Ta  Mok, nicknamed "the butcher" because of his reputed cruelty when  the Khmer Rouge was in power. He is now said to have fled  Anlong Veng and set up a command base in Preah Vihear province  where the Thai, Laotian and Cambodian borders meet.    Leng Sochea, an Information Ministry official, said the  guerrillas had orders to break up into small groups to harass  government forces and "to deploy as many landmines as possible."    A diplomat in the capital said the Khmer Rouge base would  probably be empty when the government troops eventually took it.  He said the government already faced major logistics problems  in maintaining large numbers of troops in remote areas where  access is difficult because of poor roads and landmines.    Meanwhile up to 100 Khmer Rouge attacked villages in the  Choam Khsan district of Preah Vihear -- near Ta Mok's fall-back  base -- on December 22, killing one villager and burning 30  homes, a military report said. The guerrillas struck again in  the same area the following day destroying a further 16 homes  before being repelled by government troops.    The assault on Anlong Veng comes as Prince Norodom Ranariddh  said he had agreed with Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan  to form a working committee to discuss implementing peace  proposals put forward by King Norodom Sihanouk. Asked why the  government attack was going on when the two sides had agreed to  talk, a senior government official said "it's normal. When you  start to negotiate you have to put your weight in the military  side also."    He said the Khmer Rouge had refused to observe a ceasefire  before the talks. "So it's up to them now. If they agree a  ceasefire there will be no fighting," he added.</p>

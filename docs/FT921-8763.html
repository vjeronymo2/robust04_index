The fund aims to take advantage of the high economic growth rates, and relatively undeveloped stock markets, in areas such as Latin America, Asia and parts of Europe. These markets are individually risky, but the hope is that the spread will reduce volatility; however, a prolonged world recession would adversely affect most of these markets. Although the fund is open-ended, it is not an authorised unit trust and investors can only apply for a holding through an authorised adviser. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000; the initial charge is 5 per cent and the annual charge is 1 per cent. * * * The Aegis IPS Paragon Trust is a unit trust aiming for steady capital growth by investing internationally. The initial charge is 6 per cent and the management charge is 1.75 per cent; the expected yield on the fund is 1 per cent and the minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. * * * Skandia Life is launching a new 'Ethical Selection' fund, for use with its range of life and pensions products. Jupiter Tyndall will manage it. The fund will keep a minimum of 25 per cent in appropriate 'ethical' or 'environmental' unit trusts. Between 5 and 10 per cent will be in cash, and the remainder will be invested in equities which meet the managers' criteria. These will be devised in accordance to investors' answers to a questionnaire  -depending on the answers, the fund could avoid companies involved with armaments and nuclear weapons, animal experimentation, South Africa, alcohol, tobacco, environmentally damaging practices, poor employment practices, gambling, pornography and factory farming or meat processing. There is a fixed offer price of 100p, available from now until the end of the offer period on Friday March 13.</p>

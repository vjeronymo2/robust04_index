			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK accused over environment issues BRITAIN was yesterday accused of trying to undermine EC environment policy by pressing for the withdrawal of certain sensitive proposals from Brussels. According to a document obtained by Mr Ken Collins, the British Labour MEP who chairs the European parliament's environment committee, the UK would also like to abort or amend more than 20 proposals in the fields of social affairs, company law, transport and telecommunications. Mr Collins asked Mr Michael Howard, the UK environment secretary, to comment on suggestions that environmental proposals might be withdrawn in the interests of subsidiarity - the principle that EC decisions should be taken at the most appropriate level. Mr Howard told the parliament's environment committee he could not comment because member states had not yet discussed the issue of subsidiarity, which will be one of the central points on the agenda at next week's Edinburgh summit. Mr Howard said last month that the summit would not consider the abandonment of environment proposals. After yesterday's meeting he said he could neither confirm nor deny that the UK would ask EC leaders to examine a hit-list of unwanted measures. Mr Collins said he believed the UK had singled out measures which would set minimum standards for keeping animals in zoos, require national authorities to assess the environmental impact of long-range policy plans, harmonise standards on waste landfill sites, and set requirements for the control of water quality. On the zoos directive, Mr Howard said yesterday that this was 'something which member states should be perfectly capable of dealing with themselves'. The document cited by Mr Collins is undated and unattributed. It lays out from a UK point of view a range of directives which would be undesirable, including proposals on working time, workers' councils and data protection, and suggests amendments to other measures, such as the controversial proposals on management of packaging waste.</p>

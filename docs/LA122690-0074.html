			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. CITIES HARVEST HISTORY BY SAVING GROVES, FARMS;  </P> <P> LIFESTYLE: A ONCE-AGRARIAN SOCIETY WANTS ITS CHILDREN TO KNOW THE SCENT OF  ORANGE BLOSSOMS IN THE AIR.  </P> <P> When Bob Hoyt was mayor, he spent a lot of time explaining to schoolchildren  why their city was called Orange when not a single orange grove was growing  within its borders.  </P> <P> "That got me to thinking," said Hoyt, a councilman from 1966 to 1980. "So I  went to the parks department and said I wanted an orange grove. They laughed,  but I said, no, I'm serious. Everyone thought planting an orange grove was sort  of a silly thing, and I had to get real insistent about it."  </P> <P> To satisfy the mayor, the city searched for a good spot and, in 1975, planted  about an acre of Valencia orange trees in W.O. Hart Park on Glassell Street. It  is the only orange grove in the city, and one of only a few thousand acres of  citrus left in the entire county.  </P> <P> The city of Orange was the county's first municipal farmer. But now, other  cities that are rapidly losing their agricultural heritage are creating similar  living museums by purchasing orange groves and farms.  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano is in the process of buying the 56-acre Kinoshita farm,  located in the heart of the city, for $9.5 million. And the city of Irvine has  begun appraising a 16-acre orange grove owned by the Irvine Co. in an effort to  save it from development.  </P> <P> The local leaders said they are going into the farming business to ensure that  the fruit that gave Orange County its name isn't relegated solely to grocery  store shelves.  </P> <P> "This was an agrarian economy, and I think it's vitally important to remember  the history here," said San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer. "On the  West Coast and especially Southern California, we have lost some of the  character and qualities that drew people here in the first place."  </P> <P> Most of Orange County's cropland disappeared in the 1960s, when the heart of  the county was developed. In 1959, about 123,000 acres were harvested,  including 37,000 acres of citrus groves. By 1969, more than half of those had  been converted to housing tracts, highways and shopping centers. Now, only  about 18,000 acres of crops remain, including only about 4,200 acres of citrus.  </P> <P> Orange County's $250 million-a-year agricultural industry includes nursery  stock, strawberries, avocados and row-crop vegetables such as asparagus, bell  peppers, cauliflower and cabbage, as well as the citrus groves for which the  county was once famous.  </P> <P> Hoyt, whose grandparents were orange growers, missed the sweet aroma of orange  blossoms that filled his hometown before the groves were cut down to make room  for subdivisions and shopping malls.  </P> <P> Like other children growing up in Orange, Hoyt, 67, used to pick oranges for  pennies per crate. The city also had the world's largest packinghouse, but all  the groves disappeared by the 1960s.  </P> <P> "The whole city used to live off the crop," Hoyt said. "It was a glorious place  to live in those days. Now when I'm gone, it's still going to be sitting there  as a reminder of what we had here once."  </P> <P> John Ellis, a deputy agricultural commissioner for Orange County, likes the  idea of government buying groves and farms not only for its aesthetic and  nostalgic appeal, but for its educational value.  </P> <P> "I talk to my own kids about growing and farming, but they don't relate a jar  of pickles to a cucumber. To them, milk comes from a store," Ellis said. "So if  they can get a firsthand impression of an orange and how it is grown, they'll  have an appreciation of where their orange juice came from."  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano decided in October to buy the Kinoshita farm, which is  surrounded by residential areas and schools, so the family wouldn't sell the  area's last farm field to developers. The deal between the city and the farming  family is expected to close by the end of January.  </P> <P> "It wasn't fair to keep telling him he couldn't sell his land. We had to let  him sell or buy it from him," Hausdorfer said.  </P> <P> Most of the money will come from a $21-million open space bond issue approved  by voters in April.  </P> <P> Preserving a vegetable field or orange grove isn't just a matter of shelling  out the money to plant it or buy it. It takes a real farmer to harvest those  crops or orchards, irrigate and fertilize them properly, prune them and ward  off pests, diseases and freezing temperatures.  </P> <P> "Farming is hard work," Ellis said. "It's expensive to cultivate and irrigate  orange groves. Some years you show profit, some you don't. It's a hard  business. And they may lose money if they don't know what they're doing.  </P> <P> "If you just want the aesthetic appeal of orange trees, that's a different  goal, and more easily obtainable. But if you want production, it takes a  knowledgeable management program."  </P> <P> Orange Mayor Gene Beyer said the Orange grove, which was dedicated to Hoyt,  isn't as well-tended and healthy as it should be. Many of the trees look  scraggly and sick, as if they weren't being tended properly.  </P> <P> "We need to work on that," Beyer said. "We've had some problems with trees  there. I know how hard it is to maintain orange trees just in my own back  yard."  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano officials won't even try to manage the Kinoshita Farm  crops, which are mostly corn, lettuce and strawberries. Instead, the city plans  to lease the land back to the Kinoshita family.  </P> <P> "We can't afford to run a full-scale farm," he said. "The city will be the  farmer, and we would pay wages to the people actually farming. But any profits  would go back to the city."  </P> <P> Also, as part of its new plan to preserve 140 acres of open space, San Juan  Capistrano expects to buy and preserve some orange groves too. Many of the  orange groves are dying from lack of attention, but the city hopes to save at  least a few acres.  </P> <P> "We would be doing it to preserve history and an overall quality of life rather  than make it economically viable," Hausdorfer said. "But you have to be willing  to spend the time and the money to manage it right. If you just let nature take  its course, the trees will be dead. So there has to be a community feeling and  support."  </P> <P> Irvine officials don't want to lose money on their proposal, so they are  studying the viability of managing a grove, including the cost of irrigation,  pest control and security fencing. They also plan to explore the various  options for operating it, such as leasing it back to Treasure Farms, which  manages the Irvine Co.'s agricultural fields, or maintaining it as a historic  park.  </P> <P> The grove in question, on Jeffrey Road south of the Santa Ana Freeway, has been  slated for development. The Irvine Co. has said it is open to negotiations, and  the city and developer have jointly hired an appraiser.  </P> <P> The money for the grove would come from $4 million the city is getting from  Proposition 70, a state bond measure that set aside money for open space.  </P> <P> Hoyt said he is happy to see other cities finally appreciating his idea. In  Orange 15 years ago, "it was a very inexpensive thing. The lands were already  there, and all we had to do was plant them."  </P> <P> Now, because of the county's high land costs, preservation has become a much  more costly and difficult venture involving millions of dollars and complex  real estate negotiations. But some city officials say the nostalgia and quality  of life the purchases bring are priceless.  </P> <P> "People love the fact that we can still do some farming locally," Hausdorfer  said. "Our city's philosophy is to preserve part of our past, and if you lose  (farmland), then you have generations of young people who have simply no idea  what happened here years before."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vanishing Farmland  </P> <P> Agricultural acreage has declined dramatically in Orange County since the surge  of development began in the 1950's. The dwindling acreage is prompting several  cities to preserve groves or farms to retain their agricultural heritage.  </P> <P> TOTAL CROPS*  </P> <P>  In thousands of acres  </P> <P> 1949: 146  </P> <P> 1959: 123  </P> <P> 1969: 51  </P> <P> 1979: 26  </P> <P> 1989: 19  </P> <P> CITRUS GROVES  </P> <P>  In thousands of acres  </P> <P> 1949: 67  </P> <P> 1959: 37  </P> <P> 1969: 17  </P> <P> 1979: 7  </P> <P> 1989: 4  </P> <P> * does not include nurseries and cattle ranches, which is not reported in  areas.  </P> <P> Source: O.C.

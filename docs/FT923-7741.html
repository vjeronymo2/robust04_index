			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Travel: Brought down to size in a forest of giants - Julia Berney marvels at the soaring treescape of west Australia I FELT like the incredible shrinking woman when I entered the karri forest near Manjimup in the south-west corner of Western Australia. These eucalypts are colossal. When entire forests assume twice usual size you get the unsettling impression that that is the norm, and that it is you that has dwindled. The South Western Highway becomes the aisle of a cathedral landscape, with vast columnar trunks zooming up to a fan vaulting of branches that admit great shafts of sunlight. Quality hardwoods such as karri and jarrah are the staple of this region's timber trade. 'Those,' said one resident bitterly, showing me mountains of woodchips on the dock at Bunbury, 'are our forests.' To visitors' eyes, however, there seems to be plenty of forest left. At one end of the industry is Bunnings, the timber and hardware store giant whose name above the sawmill seems to proclaim dominion over Pemberton town. At the other end is a man I met happy and dusty in a pile of shavings, who empathises with his craft and his environment and does not seem hell-bent on making a fast buck. With a studio home on the forest doorstep overlooking Pemberton and a garden full of chickens and vegetables, the life of Peter Kovacsy, a woodcarver and turner, seems to epitomise the Perth city-dweller's rural dream. But Kovacsy understands hard work and professionalism. He is a perfectionist. He also respects the source that supplies him. He uses mostly waste wood salvaged from the forest floor to produce the highest quality bowls, boxes and furniture. Jarrah is an especially beautiful native wood, being rich red. Kovacsy transforms burls - basically, huge clotted deformities of the tree - sculpting them into abstract 'forest free-forms,' or slicing them into table-tops revealing chaotic whorls and chinks of daylight. His woodcraft is visual, tactile and fragrant, from the workshop tang of green timber to the perfume of a finished sandalwood bracelet. Reaching the Karri Valley Resort too late to appreciate anything but frogs yodelling somewhere beneath the floor, I discovered next morning that my room was perched on stilts above a trout lake (trout farming began around Pemberton in the 1930s). Across the water, huge trees cast ribcage reflections. Through Beedelup National Park spangled blue fairy wrens crossed my path and scarves of gum bark floated down. I decided I could not improve upon the serenity by joining the resort's games, organised for Australia Day, which included the 'pie and sauce throw' and 'pin the thong on the yobbo.' Thongs here are not g-strings but sandals of the type the Brits call flip-flops - regulation footwear for that archetypal Aussie yobbo, the ocker. I did not scale Pemberton's Gloucester Tree, either, due to cowardice. At 60 metres this spiral-runged karri is the world's tallest fire lookout tree. Spotter planes have made most watchtowers redundant. Winter rainfall here is substantial - many towns' names end in 'up,' the Aboriginal word for water - yet summer desiccates the forest dangerously. I passed minor bushfires near Nannup; a week later serious blazes occurred throughout the south-west. Yet the native flora has evolved with fire a part of its natural cycle; as a result, eucalypts regenerate from charred wood with defiant speed. In Walpole's Valley of Giants, one tingle tree has a gutted trunk so big that people used to park cars inside it until soil erosion necessitated fencing it. Healthy leaves still crown the empty hulk. Even a lighthouse can cause bushfire. Rather as you focus sun through a magnifying glass to burn the back of somebody's neck, so Cape Leeuwin's lighthouse lens could ignite coastal scrub by reflection - if it was not curtained by day. Cape Leeuwin, near Augusta, is where the Southern and Indian Oceans collide across reefs. On the beach stands a petrified water-wheel. From Nannup to Augusta the forest gradually resumes normal proportions, with yellow bull banksia and she-oak that sighs in the wind like a waterfall. From Augusta towards Margaret River you re-enter karri country with an under-storey of peppermint trees. Parallel with the coast and Bussell Highway, the much quieter Caves Road gives access to subterranean stalactite extravaganzas like Jewel Cave and small bright white beaches, some deserted even on the year's busiest weekend. Margaret River's Prevelly Park is popular, however, particularly with surfers. Surfer Jack, 18, gave me a crash introduction to his sub-culture. Second to surfing he listed his pleasures as: doing sadistic things with fish-hooks to marauding gulls; abusing fluoro-clad novice surfers; peeing in his wet-suit in the cold Margaret surf; smoking dope and 'generally getting wasted.' Illegal marijuana plantations flourish in the green south-west. The curative properties of salt water, Jack reckoned, combat the results of excessive hooch. Margaret River is where excess, or at least indulgence, beckons everywhere; you need lots of pocket-money and no self-discipline. Good restaurants, coffee-houses and galleries hide in the middle of the bush with only a discreet signpost inviting you down gravel tracks. Discovering Boranup Gallery, a rammed-earth construction full of ceramics, furniture and paintings, deep in the forest off Caves Road, is literally a treasure-hunt. There are berry farms, stonefruit orchards, cheese factories and hatcheries for indigenous freshwater crayfish. But it is the wineries that really dominate the area. Viticulture was established in the 1960s purely on theoretical advice, after an agronomist found that the total annual sunshine compared favourably with Bordeaux. Soon, Margaret River was producing award-winning premium wines. I began tasting at 10am. Seven wineries later, I wished I had had the constraint to spit in the bucket from the outset. The sun became soporific and dead kangaroos by the roadside began to look snuggly and cuddlesome, like furry animal pyjama-cases. Every winery has its own atmosphere. Many are small, family concerns crushing less than 100 tonnes of grapes a year. Some, such as Ribbon Vale, are basic and unadorned, using nothing but the fine quality of the wine to lure visitors. Others enhance their individuality with additional attractions. Happ's Misty Ridge houses a pottery in its mud-brick buildings; Brookland Valley vineyard has a gallery devoted to wine arts and limited edition prints celebrating everything from the grape itself to Bacchus. Leeuwin Estate takes its association with the arts even further. A 1985 open-air performance by the London Philharmonic Orchestra was the first annual Leeuwin Concert on the lawns above Boodjidup Brook. Leeuwin Estate also has an impressive collection of contemporary art, comprising many leading Australian painters; all the paintings have featured on Leeuwin's 'Art Series' bottles. The art of the wine label seems a microcosm of the whole south-west - a fat, fertile, creative region which satisfies both the gastronome and the aesthete. The south-west tip's Mediterranean climate is ideal for those who find summer elsewhere in Western Australia too hot. Karri Valley Resort is central for exploring Pemberton and much of the south coast. Its log cabins have wood stoves - axes are provided, you chop your own wood - but no radio or TV, so you can forget the world. In Pemberton, Peter Kovacsy runs workshops for beginners or professionals wishing to improve their woodcraft. About 30 Margaret River wineries are open to the public.

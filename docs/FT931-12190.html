			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Technology: Striking the right note - Worth Watching Colour photocopiers have worried the police for years because of their potential for copying bank notes. So the Japanese manufacturer Omron has developed a bank note recognition system that can be incorporated into photocopiers. The device can detect attempts to copy notes from 23 countries. It uses fuzzy logic, a computing technique which enables the input data to be compared with that stored in memory 10 times more quickly than with conventional technology.

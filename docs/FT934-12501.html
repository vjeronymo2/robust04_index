			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian miners have second thoughts on land legislation THE AUSTRALIAN mining industry, which last week expressed qualified backing for the federal government's 'Mabo' Aboriginal land rights legislation, yesterday sounded a less optimistic note, saying that the package could discourage investment and might fail to validate all previous land titles as the commonwealth had promised. Mr Geoff Ewing, the Australian Mining Industry Council's assistant director, said yesterday it was 'not apparent from the details so far available that all past titles will be fully secured, and therefore not affected by native title as the prime minister stated'. 'The proposals for the approval of future grants still leave open the possibility of both the commonwealth and states each being involved in the process, and the time limits for completion of the process have been significantly extended,' he added. 'It also appears at this stage that consideration of native title, which could take as long as 20 months, will have to precede other approval processes which themselves take a considerable time.' The draft legislation has yet to be unveiled and all commentators are at present basing opinions on the public statements made by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, and other government officials. Last week, it appeared that Mr Keating had scored a political triumph by hammering out a land rights package that had at least qualified support from most interested parties. The need for legislation has been pressing in the wake of a high court decision last year that did away with the notion that Australia was uninhabited before European settlement. It said that native title claims could succeed where there had been close and continuing association with the land in question.</p>

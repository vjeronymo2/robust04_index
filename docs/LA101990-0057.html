			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ARRESTED AT COUNCIL MEETING ON PARTY  FRACAS  </P> <P> A debate at a South Pasadena City Council meeting over police conduct turned  ugly when an elderly resident was arrested for allegedly threatening the police  association's attorney and kicking another woman he apparently mistook for the  attorney, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> James H. Hulse, 68, was placed under citizen's arrest on suspicion of assault,  battery and disturbing a public meeting shortly after the fracas at 11:30 p.m.  Wednesday, Lt. Richard Kowaltschuk said.  </P> <P> He was released Thursday.  </P> <P> The hubbub occurred as Sylvia E. Kellison, attorney for the South Pasadena  Police Officers Assn., was criticizing the council for hiring a private  investigator to look into allegations of police misconduct while officers were  breaking up a drinking party last month. Hulse apparently objected to the  remarks and allegedly cocked his arm as if to punch Kellison. He later kicked  the leg of an unidentified woman who apparently resembled Kellison, authorities  said.  </P></p>

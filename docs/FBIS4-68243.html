			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pyotr Karapetryan: "Trip to America </F> Unnecessary--Georgian-Abkhazian Agreements Signed in Moscow on  April 4"]    [Text] An agreement on a cease-fire and the creation of  conditions for the unimpeded return of refugees to Abkhazia was  reached in the presence of UN Secretary-General Boutros  Boutros-Ghali and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.  Experts agree that the development lays a good foundation for a  settlement of the protracted conflict.    However, all this has happened in the past, and more than  once. Where haven't agreements been signed--in Moscow, Geneva,  Sochi. Eduard Shevardnadze and Vladislav Ardzinba have gone to  not only the Russian capital but also New York in search of  truth. (Needless to say, each for his own version). Until they  realized that they need not necessary look for the road to  domestic peace in some distant land. But this was pointed out  even earlier at the CIS countries' interparliamentary assembly  by Georgian parliamentary speaker Vakhtang Goguadze. He was one  of the first to say that a solution to the Abkhaz problem hardly  required a trip to America, that it should be solved within the  CIS framework.    And so an understanding has been reached. There remains to  hope that the parties to the conflict will move from  declarations of accord to its implementation--against the  backdrop, needless to say, of active mediation efforts by Russia  and other CIS countries and United Nations assistance in the  search for a peaceful solution.</p>

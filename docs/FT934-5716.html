			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / More than a conduit, insists Adams: Adams calls Mayhew a liar Sinn Fein yesterday rejected the British government's contention that secret contacts with Sinn Fein had been made through intermediaries in response to an IRA wish to end the conflict. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said at a news conference in West Belfast yesterday that the contact amounted to 'more than a mere conduit'. He said that meetings had been approved by Mr Major, were known about at cabinet level, and involved several senior civil servants. Mr Adams disputed Sir Patrick Mayhew's explanation that the IRA had considered the conflict over. He said: 'At no point was there any communication from the IRA that the conflict was over.' Mr Adams accused Sir Patrick of lying about the contacts between the government and Sinn Fein. He said outlines of policy had been exchanged and discussed. He indicated that he was preparing to publish material exchanged between the two sides, saying that it was of the utmost importance to point out that the issue of talking to Sinn Fein was a distraction. Talks at this time were not necessary to move towards a lasting peace. 'This required the British government to fulfil its responsibilities. John Major knows what he needs to do.

'The record shows quite clearly all of these things are lies and are proved to be lies.' Mr Adams added: 'They have lied to their own parliament, to James Molyneaux (Ulster Unionist party leader), and to the Irish and British people about the existence and nature of their contact with Sinn Fein.' He said the government had for some time set its face against a real peace process. It had refused to make the change of policy required to 'move all of us forward into a negotiated settlement. In the course of our contact with their representatives they rejected and walked away from a peace process'. A Sinn Fein spokeswoman said yesterday, however: 'The main point is not about who said what and when. This is a distraction from the main goal of laying a basis for getting this war over and done with.'</p>

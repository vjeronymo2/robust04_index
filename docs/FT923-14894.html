			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Indian bank chief replaced: Bombay stock market scandal STANDARD Chartered Bank of the UK yesterday replaced Mr Parvesh Nat, chief executive of its Indian operation, as the first step in what are expected to be wider management changes at the offshoot following the bank's involvement in the Bombay stock market and securities scandal. Mr Nat, who stepped down last week after the bank's Bombay office had been defrauded of Rs8.9bn (Pounds 164m), will be succeeded by Mr John Docherty, now chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank Kenya. At a press conference yesterday to announce the change Mr David Gardiner, the bank's acting chief executive for India, exonerated Mr Nat, whose wife, Mrs GK Nat, was charged last week in a special investigative court. The charge related to her acceptance of a cheque for Rs1m from Mr Hiten Dalal, Standard Chartered's securities broker, who is one of those arrested in the scandal. The bank has accepted Mr Nat's explanation that the cheque 'was in settlement of a genuine sale of securities', and regards the allegations as 'without foundation'. Mr Nat will continue in the employment of the bank although he will remain on leave. The bank hopes to complete its internal inquiry into the involvement of some of its employees next week, when more heads are expected to roll in connection with the country's largest financial scandal. Indian government agencies are examining a connection between Mr R. Kannan, director of the investment banking division, and Fair Growth Financial Services, which became a part of the scandal when the Reserve Bank, India's central bank, prohibited three companies of the Fair Growth group from transacting any fresh business 'in view of certain serious irregularities' observed in the company's operations. Mr Kannan - previously with the state-owned Canara Bank, one of the institutions financially exposed in the scandal - joined Standard Chartered in early 1990, and was responsible for recruiting a number of officers from Canara, where he had worked under Mr B. Ratnakar as chairman. Mr Ratnakar founded the Fair Growth group of companies before he died last year. Meanwhile, Mr VP Singh, former Indian prime minister and leader of the opposition National Front, signalled on a visit to Bombay that the opposition would ensure the financial scandal figures prominently when parliament reopens on July 8. Mr Singh accused the government of not doing enough to expose those involved, and demanded a joint parliamentary committee be set up to investigate the scandal. Only then, he said, would the inquiry be free of political interference.</p>

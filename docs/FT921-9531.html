			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: FNB plans R550m rights issue to fund growth FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third largest bank, plans to raise R550m through a rights issue to capitalise on domestic and foreign growth opportunities. Mr Viv Bartlett, senior general manager, said yesterday the timing of the issue, details of which will be announced next week, was closely related to FNB's share price. He said the stock market would not necessarily stay at current levels, while FNB felt the market was now rating its shares more fairly than in the past. They stand on a price/earnings ratio of 11, and are currently trading at R58 having been as low as R28 last year. On the domestic front Mr Bartlett said the bank wanted to become more aggressive, to regain some of the market share it had deliberately shed in 1989-1991. He said this was particularly true in the home loans field. FNB was unsuccessful last year in its attempt to take over Allied, one of the country's largest building societies, and is now pursuing organic growth. In terms of international ambitions, Mr Bartlett said one option would be to set up a London subsidiary whose main function would be the financing of trade flows and foreign exchange trading. He said FNB was not that sure how receptive the UK market was to new entrants. FNB also needed capital for its Swiss finance company and to finance its recent entry into the Botswana market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Havel by correspondent </F> Eva Hulkova at Hradecek; date not given; from the "Conversations  at Lany" program --recorded]    [Excerpts] [Hulkova] Dear friends, we are recording these  "Conversations" at Hradecek, where the president is ill. I must  also say that he smokes a little and, as it appears, is  overdoing it a little. How are you, Mr. President? Are you a  good patient?    [Havel] I have a feeling that I am a perfect patient because  I take all of the medication prescribed, I am in bed as I am  supposed to be, and I am even smoking less. But I really do not  like talking about my health or physical problems, and, if I  remember correctly, I talked about my viruses extensively in  "Conversations at Lany" three weeks ago, so I would very much  not like to talk about it now. I should only like to add that  the viruses are very unremitting. Simply, we have not been  successful in destroying them. That is why I am undergoing a  cure again, and I hope I will finish my cure once and for all  soon.    [Hulkova] How do you feel mentally? It is known that it very  much influences the curative process.    [Havel] I have been completely alone here for a few days.  Admittedly, I am being guarded by my bodyguards, but they keep a  fair distance from our house, and I like the loneliness very  much because, when I am in Prague, naturally, I am surrounded by  people from morning until night and have little time for this  kind of concentration and contemplation, for reading. It is  from this viewpoint that the treatment suits me.    [Hulkova] Let us return to when you were still healthy. You  met at one of your regular quarterly meetings representatives of  the parliamentary clubs. On such occasions, topical issues are  usually discussed. It seems to me that one of the most topical  is the method of elections to the senate. Was this issue  discussed?    [Havel] Yes, you are right. It is a subject discussed a lot  in our media, and, at the moment, it is very topical so we could  not avoid it, either. However, it was not the main point of our  talks.    [Hulkova] You are often accused of changing your mind on  this  issue. How do you look at it?    [Havel] I noticed that I was being suspected of  this...[pauses] I am a bit surprised because I have always had  the same opinion on this matter. Perhaps it will not do any  harm if I repeat it. First, I have never been particularly  partial to a two-chamber system. However, the opposite view  won--namely, that we should have the senate. This issue was  organically incorporated into the Constitution and is an  integral part of it. I think we should honor the Constitution,  and, therefore, the senate should be elected this year. In my  opinion, we would be making a strong attack on the common legal  consciousness if we treated the Constitution according to our  whims, if we incorporated into it an institution with a firm  standing, and, then, because of negligence or failure to agree  on the election procedures, if we did not establish this  institution. [passage omitted]    I welcomed the constitutional undertaking that the senate  would have to be elected on the basis of a majority voting  system. I am a champion of the majority voting system or at  least, of a combined voting system. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] According to my information, you talked about  non-profit-making organizations with the deputies. Why is this  such a problematic subject all the time?    [Havel] Much to my pleasure, I learned that all, but really  all, of the parliamentary clubs agreed with me on the enormous  importance of this whole sphere of non-profit-making  organizations, about which I already talked in these  conversations some time ago and intend to go on talking about.  They consider it to be extremely important that the law  regulates this sphere and agree that there is a need for more  laws on this to be passed by the end of this year so that they  could start being enforced by 1 January [1995].    The present situation is very bad. It was inherited from the  communist era, which has divided organizations into so-called  budgetary and contributory organizations. These are, in effect,  bodies controlled by the state by means incompatible with  democratic conditions. All democratic countries have different  structures [in this field]. The whole sphere of educational,  health, cultural, and many other undertakings are regulated by  special laws. [passage omitted]    You asked why there was such resistance against [regulating]  this area. I am not quite sure who is resisting, but I was  pleased to acknowledge that it was not parliament.  Transformation of this whole non-profit-making area will  require, at the same time, the restructuring of this area, and  it is a process comparable, for example, to the whole process of  privatization. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] Is the idea of power part of this problem?    [Havel] Of course, it is connected with power because the  issue here is related to decentralization of power. [passage  omitted] Imagine, for example, that, in a highly charged, very  dramatic situation, the citizens would be entranced, lulled by a  political tempter who gains a lot of votes and wins, and then it  transpires that he is a madman. The point is that the state  must be able to continue, to flourish, to function, even if it  is temporarily headed by this madman, until he is replaced by  somebody else. This is one of the reasons I have undertaken to  draw attention to this sphere of non-profit-making organizations  because they are a joint part of decentralized, structured,  civic society, in which everybody takes a share of  responsibility for public affairs.    [Hulkova] Because we have come to this point, can I ask, as  editor of Czech radio. which is a public body, about an issue of  direct concern. You may know that the guardian of our  treasures, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, does not agree to  radio license fees being increased. However, because we do not  have laws that would punish those who do not pay, Czech Radio  finds itself in a sad situation. What is your opinion?    [Havel] It is narrowly connected to what we discussed before  with the non-profit-making organizations. After all, radio is  such a non-profit-making organization. This is very difficult.  On the one hand, it is obvious how important it is for this  type of public body to exist. Look at radio or television. If  they are going to be purely profit-making, they would not be  able to fulfill to such an extent their aim of reflecting  independently the world as it is. The same applies if they are  exclusively state-controlled because then they are dependent on  the state. [passage omitted]</p>

The visitors -- generals and colonels -- will  instruct their Lithuanian colleagues in the rational use of  resources for the country's defense. In any event, as the  guests and their hosts stressed, all spending will pursue one  aim -- the intensive rapprochement of Lithuania's military,  economic, and other structures with the corresponding structures  of the NATO countries. The NATO "landing party" in Vilnius is  part of the program of synchronized visits by other delegations  from the military bloc to countries in central and Eastern  Europe. The left-wing opposition is asking this question:  Shouldn't a decision as portentous as entry into NATO have been  taken only after a referendum of the people on this question?</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> MEMORIAL FUND ESTABLISHED FOR STUDENT KILLED IN CRASH  </P> <P> A memorial fund has been established at Whittier College for a 22-year-old  student who was killed when the car she was driving collided early Sunday with  an airport shuttle bus in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Delphi L. Murphy, a junior majoring in art, was killed after the car apparently  ran a stop light at 96th Street and Sepulveda Boulevard and was broadsided by  the bus, college spokeswoman Sandy Sarr said.  </P> <P> Two other students in the car, Carol Hooper and Linda Bennett, were treated at  nearby hospitals and released.  </P> <P> Sarr said Murphy and her twin sister, Desma, were "very popular and visible on  campus. You would always see them together. It is very unusual that they were  apart the night of the accident."  </P> <P> Sarr said a funeral service will be held at 7:30 p.m. today at Westminster  Presbyterian Church of Pasadena, 1757 N. Lake Ave., Pasadena.  </P></p>

"I do not think that one country should monopolize"  this process and sideline all others, Karadzic said.    Karadzic sounded apprehensive about the confederation pact  between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems agreed in Washington, and  said he feared it could be used against Serbs in the former  yugoslav republic. "We can welcome this agreement only if it is  not aimed against Serbs, only if it lead us to peace and not to  war".</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Europe's steel deal The fury of private steelmakers over Friday's deal by European Union industry ministers on state aid is understandable. Unsubsidised steel businesses, mostly private-owned, will be damaged by the agreement to approve Ecu7bn in hand-outs to inefficient state-owned companies in Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Closures of more efficient, unsubsidised plant are now likely. The acceptance of blatantly unfair competition in the steel industry also sets a worrying precedent. In coming weeks, the European Commission will consider whether to approve state aid to several national airlines and Bull, the French computer group. It must be hoped that its negotiating position has not been weakened by the steel deal. Yet it is also clear that it was never going to be politically possible to enforce a no-subsidies regime for steel. The German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese governments would not have agreed to a course of action that brought about large and highly visible job losses in regions which already suffer from high unemployment. The question is therefore not whether aid should have been approved, but whether a sufficient price was extracted in return. The main quid pro quo was an agreement by the offending governments to close 5m tonnes of capacity, and not to give their companies any more subsidies. But there were also fudges: new capacity is being built in Germany, while some of the Italian plant being 'closed' has not been producing steel since 1991. Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner who managed the deal, argues that it was not possible to take a tougher line because the Treaty of Paris, which covers steel and coal, requires subsidies to be approved unanimously, so giving every country a veto. But it is not clear why the requirement for unanimity could not have been turned into a strength rather than a weakness. After all, without agreement, aid is illegal under the Treaty. Of course, such a move would have sharply raised the stakes and would only have been possible with the full support of other commissioners. In particular, Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, would have had to become publicly involved. A tougher line would have produced a fairer deal. Even if governments had refused to make further capacity cuts, it should have been possible to extract other concessions. For example, the Commission could have insisted that member states which subsidised their steel companies compensated unsubsidised competitors for the damage. It may now be too late for a compensation scheme in the steel industry. But such an arrangement should be part of any future deal which involves the European Union approving state aid. Not only would this ensure redress for those harmed by unfair competition. It would also make governments think twice before handing out subsidies.</p>

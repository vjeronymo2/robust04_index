			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: What Now For Docklands - Family's Pounds 1.6bn hole in the ground CANARY WHARF has been a huge drain over the past four years both on Olympia &amp; York Developments and on its owners, the Reichmann family. O&amp;Y was so strong when it became involved in Docklands that the Reichmanns decided to finance the project without partners and without prearranged bank finance. Since 1988, O&amp;Y has ploughed USDollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of its own money into the project. It leveraged many of its properties in the US and Canada to provide the funds for development of Canary Wharf, thereby heightening the risk to the entire company if the Docklands gamble failed to pay off. A growing chunk of income from the north American properties had to be funnelled across the Atlantic as revenue continued to fall short. Mr Paul Reichmann, the family's master strategist, has always had a special affection for Canary Wharf. He has taken a close personal interest in even the smallest details of its construction, and remained unshakably confident in its eventual success. Even as O&amp;Y's difficulties surfaced two months ago, it appeared that Mr Reichmann would spend more of his time in London, seeking badly needed tenants for the project and overseeing construction work. Yet the cash demands of Canary Wharf, together with O&amp;Y's inability to repay holders of short-term securities issued to refinance one of the Toronto buildings, precipitated the liquidity shortfall that has now led the Canadian parent and Canary Wharf to seek court protection from their creditors. The Reichmanns have never disclosed details of their own financial position, but it appears that the bulk of their vast wealth is tied up in O&amp;Y. Among the few exceptions are Olympia Tile, the business that spawned O&amp;Y in the early 1960s and which is now one of north America's biggest floor-covering distributors. The family also owns a few smallish buildings separately from O&amp;Y. Mr Paul Reichmann is working hard behind the scenes to try to dig the family firm out of the deep hole it now finds itself in. His older brother, Albert, as well as other members of the family and their close-knit circle of confidants have been largely sidelined by the fast-moving events of recent weeks.</p>

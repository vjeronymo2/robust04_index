			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China takes over from Japan as top wool buyer China emerged in 1993 as the world's top customer for raw wool for the first time, overtaking Japan, according to an International Wool Secretariat study. China's wool use last year accounted for about 20 per cent of world production, and this is set to reach 25 per cent by the year 2000 at the present rate of growth. 'Total wool use has increased a remarkable 2.75 times since 1980 when it accounted for only 7 per cent of global wool production,' the study said. About two-thirds of wool used in China is imported, with Australian supplies accounting for half of total imports. New Zealand weighs in with about 25 per cent and Uruguay 10 per cent. South Africa, the other IWS member, supplies a relatively small amount. In 1992, imports of raw wool and tops reached a value of USDollars 764m and 65 to 70 per cent was consumed within the domestic market. Semi-processed and finished wool textile products earned China about UDollars 1.3bn in 1992. 'Raw wool and top imports into China could well increase by nearly 60 per cent from 1992 to 2000, accounting for up to one-third of Australian and New Zealand wool production by 2000,' the study said. The study found that 'Greater China' - including China, Hong Kong and Macau  -had become the fastest growing market for IWS members over the past decade. Australian exports as a percentage of total wool exports had almost trebled in that period. But the study, prepared by the UK-based Wool Development International, warned that China's market was liable to sharp fluctuations caused by sudden changes in economic policy. In 1989-90, China's withdrawal from the market had contributed to the rapid rise in raw wool stocks in producing countries. 'With further promised economic liberalisation, rising foreign investment, increased consumer affluence and possible Gatt membership, China has the potential to continue as the fastest growing market for wool textiles and clothing in the world,' the study concluded. 'At the same time given its recent history of stop-go economic cycles, wool price sensitivity, and political uncertainty, it could be the most volatile and unpredictable market.' The IWS is sponsored by Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. The organisation became active in the Chinese wool market in the early 1980s and is involved in assisting China to upgrade its wool processing.</p>

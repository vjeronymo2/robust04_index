			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Arts: Home sweet home - Off the wall FORGET GALAS at the Garden, or exclusive parties at Glyndebourne: the latest buzz in arts sponsorship is decidedly populist. BT and Mobil have just launched on to the market tours of two of the oldest warhorses in the theatrical repertoire, Agatha Christie's Witness for the Prosecution and Brandon Thomas's Charley's Aunt. The companies are not Angels; they are not so silly as to invest in either play. Instead they are giving Pounds 100,000 (plus in Mobil's case another Pounds 100,000 to spread the promotional word) to independent producers for the joy of being associated with the projects  - and to ensure that they succeed. Touring is a very expensive and risky business these days with the result that theatregoers outside London rarely get to see a play with more than one set and a handful of actors. Witness, which boasts a cast of 22 (including prominent TV names like John Barron and Prunella Gee) and two sets, has not been on the road for almost two decades, while Charley's Aunt travels with ten players, including Frank Windsor and Gabriella Drake, and three sets. They are penetrating to places which have not seen such extravagance for years. Witness in particular is an heroic venture, on the road for over 40 weeks rather than the usual 12, and playing theatres in Inverness, Lincoln, and the like. Some are so small that producer Charles Vance reckons he would lose Pounds 9,000 even with every seat sold: the BT money makes it feasible. Both companies will use the plays for some gentle local hospitality, but the main thrust is to prove to employees, who will receive discounted tickets, and shareholders, that sponsoring the arts is not an elitist indulgence for the directors but a joy for all. For BT the switch is particularly pointed. Until this year the plays it progressed throughout the land were by Shakespeare and were performed by the RSC. The RSC is still looking for an alternative sponsor with Pounds 185,000 to finance its threatened small venue regional tour of Richard III. Stoll-Moss seemed happy this week with the Pounds 12.8m it got from selling its freehold of the Coliseum to its tenants, English National Opera. It reckoned that its chances of getting a worthwhile increase in the Pounds 350,000 annual rent after the expiry of the ENO lease in 1996 were low, and that the outcry that would have followed the eviction of the company, and the challenge of finding another tenant for a huge, listed, national treasure, were frightening. Anyway, Janet Holmes a Court, the Australian who owns Stoll-Moss since the death of her husband, is a theatrical groupie, sympathetic to the future of the ENO. At the moment her artistic and financial interests go nicely hand in hand. The West End is riding the recession fairly well and January was the best ever month financially for Stoll-Moss. There is no intention of selling off any of the eleven theatres left in the group. Indeed the hunt is on for new purchases. This is proving a pleasantly traumatic month for the ENO. Last week it announced 'Visions and Voices', its attempt to get pop composers to develop along operatic lines. Last Tuesday it received its freehold. And on Thursday it announced Almeida Opera, a co-venture with the Almeida Theatre. This is a July festival of two contemporary operas, one with music by Nigel Osborne and words by Howard Barker, based on the life of Goya, and another, Mario and the Magician by Stephen Oliver, which has been waiting some time for a British premiere. This is a happy event for both companies. The Almeida received some rare criticism last year when it axed its contemporary music festival - it can now satisfy this select audience - while the Contemporary Opera Studio at the ENO has largely been confined to weekend workshops in rural retreats; it now gets a London showcase. If the response is good these small scale operas will tour the country and enter the international arts festival circuit. It will be nice if they have some future since the 19-day event is costing over Pounds 300,000. The fact that contemporary composers are prepared to labour long to create works with such a limited guaranteed life span underlines their poor job opportunities. As things are the festival is still not fully funded. It is looking for a donor with Pounds 50,000 to make possible the planned production of Mary of Egypt, with music by John Tavener and words by Mother Thelka. Mother Thelka is the abbess of a Yorkshire monastery and has become the favoured lyricist for Tavener, who now concentrates on religious music. With such a flood of announcements ENO has cancelled the big annual event scheduled for next week - the disclosure of its financial statement and artistic plans. Nothing sinister in that. Director Peter Jonas expects to show a profit on a difficult year. There is also a good chance that he will make life even harder for Covent Garden by using the money the ENO saves on paying rent to reduce ticket prices.</p>

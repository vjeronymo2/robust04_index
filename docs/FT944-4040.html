			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Major presses for drive against fraud Mr John Major yesterday pressed his partners to agree a new drive against fraud, arguing that mismanagement, waste and criminal activities were undermining popular faith in the European Union. Speaking in the wake of the recent political rows in Britain about the level of fraud, the UK prime minister called for an increased role for the Brussels Commission in scrutinising expenditure. In a presentation to the summit which drew approval from a number of other EU governments, including the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the new Nordic entrants, Mr Major called for the summit to give political impetus also to a draft regulation to protect the Union's financial interests. The council of ministers meanwhile should conclude rapidly a legally binding instrument against criminal fraud. Mr Jacques Santer, the incoming president of the European Commission, is expected to make tight financial management a priority when he takes over from Mr Jacques Delors in January. The precise extent of fraud is an unknown proportion of the annual Ecu65bn (Pounds 51bn) budget but the bulk is concentrated in the common agricultural policy. Calling for the summit to endorse further work by finance ministers to reduce both waste and fraud, Mr Major said that member states should be required to report individually to the finance council on the action they were taking to protect EU funds. In proposals likely to be endorsed in the summit's final communique, he called also for more vigorous use of its powers by the Court of Auditors and more intense scrutiny of financial arrangements by the European Parliament. Mr Major's hopes of a concerted drive to reduce the level of fraud have been strengthened by signs that France intends also to make it a central issue during its presidency of the EU. The Paris government, which takes over the presidency next month, intends to ask the commission to draw up an inventory of all breaches of existing EU laws and to attach to all future draft EU legislation clauses specifying the sanctions to be used for breaking it. The intention is to ensure the even and proper enforcement of EU laws. Mr Alain Lamassoure, French EU affairs minister, said that investigations into the same fraud covering several states had shown that some countries were very strict while others showed complicity towards fraudsters. Companies operating in stricter states were placed at a competitive disadvantage. Despite his broad welcome for the French initiative, however, Mr Major is likely to be cautious about the possibility that the union-wide action proposed by Mr Lamassoure might reduce national powers to decide punishments.</p>

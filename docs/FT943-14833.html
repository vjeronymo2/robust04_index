			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Fewer out of work in Spain Unemployment in Spain fell by 2.3 per cent over the first six months of this year, compared to a 6.8 per cent rise in the same period of 1993, said the employment ministry. The number out of work shrank 1.2 per cent in June from May, with the service sector showing the biggest fall  - 1.5 per cent or 18,039. Industrial unemployment fell 1.9 per cent; construction by 3 per cent. The number of those obtaining jobs in the first six months was up by 17 per cent on the same period last year, and up by 1.5 per cent in June from May. Pan-German retail sales rose at an annual, nominal rate of 4 per cent in May, according to provisional figures yesterday from the federal statistics office in Wiesbaden. The real annual rate of increase after inflation was 3 per cent. The figures were better than expected after a sharp 10 per cent (nominal) fall in April, providing evidence of a steady but unspectacular recovery in the economy. But economists warned that the rise reflected the fact that there was one extra shopping day in May this year. Portugal's consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent in June from May, but the year-on-year rate dropped to 5.6 per cent from 5.7 per cent, the national statistics institute said.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Milan to trade 41 more shares on computer system SCREEN-based share trading on the Milan stock exchange will receive its biggest boost tomorrow when 41 more shares move to the computer-based system. The switch, which will include some of Italy's most heavily-traded equities such as Generali and Stet, takes to 80 the number of shares traded since screen-based trading made its cautious debut with just five stocks in November 1991. Since then, the system has been gradually expanded, with the biggest boost coming with the addition of 25 new shares in May 1992. Despite the cautious growth, the system has suffered from severe technical setbacks, although trading has been smooth in recent months. Increasing the number of shares to 80 means the screen-based system will account for about 70 per cent of the total capitalisation of the Milan bourse and 80 per cent of average daily trading volumes. The expansion is being accompanied by the introduction of a new index, the Mibtel, which could in time form the basis for futures and options trading on Italian equities. The Mibtel, which will be calculated every 15 minutes at the outset but will be calculated every minute eventually, marks the stock exchange's first real-time equity index. Its introduction is a further step in the long-overdue efforts to put Italy's financial markets on a par with developments now commonplace elsewhere in Europe. This year the bourse appointed a new ruling council, chaired by Mr Attilio Ventura, to improve transparency. No timetable has been set for futures contracts or options on futures. However, having a real-time index covering a large portion of the market is an essential pre-condition for their introduction. Broad legislation for futures and options on equities was approved along with a packet of other bourse reforms in January 1992. The new index comes just a few days after Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), which calculates the popular Comit index, widely followed by foreign investors, launched a new 30-share product based on stocks traded on-screen. Consob, Italy's stock market and companies watchdog, which has been supervising the introduction of screen-based trading, has plans to shift the bulk of share dealing to the screen-based system by the end of this year. However, there is no fixed timetable, and regulators will be monitoring carefully the latest expansion of the system before moving further. The growing interest in Italian equities has prompted Morgan Stanley International and Banca Commerciale Italiana to launch an issue of put and call warrants on the Italian BCI-30 index. The index, recently constructed by BCI, is composed of the 30 largest and most liquid Italian shares. It is designed to have a high correlation to the Italian stock market, although with slightly higher volatility. BCI will calculate the index on a real-time basis. The warrant issue consists of three tranches each of puts and calls, with American-style expiration. All will have a two-year maturity, to August 16, 1995. Issue prices will be fixed on the basis of market prices on July 16. Application has been made to list the warrants for trading in Luxembourg.</p>

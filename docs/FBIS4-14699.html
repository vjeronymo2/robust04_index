			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Tbilisiby correspondent Ugza Keresilidze, </F> including recording of comments by Georgian Head of State Eduard  Shevardnadze and Boris Kakubava, leader of the Organization for  the Liberation of Abkhazia]    [Text] [Announcer] The Georgian parliament has already  expressed its opinion about the documents signed in Moscow  between Georgia and Abkhazia.    [Keresilidze] At an unscheduled session today behind closed  doors, the Georgian parliament discussed the Abkhazian issue and  determined its position on the agreements reached in Moscow with  the Abkhazian side, with Russian participation. It was easy to  judge the level of passion generated by the issue under  examination by looking at the faces of the deputies coming out  into the foyer. The parliament has evidently split into two  camps -- the supporters and opponents of the agreements. During  the interval Eduard Shevardnadze appraised the agreement reached  in Moscow like this:    [Shevardnadze] I believe that they achieved the maximum  which  it was necessary to agree at the present stage, and the minimum  which is needed for a decision to be taken in the Security  Council on the introduction of peacekeeping forces into  Abkhazia. Without the introduction of peacekeeping forces there  will be no return of refugees. Personally, at the present  stage, the agreement suits me. Parliament's opinion is  unimportant.    [Keresilidze] The parliamentary opposition has called these  agreements -- the text of which, incidentally, was not given to  the deputies -- treason. It demanded that the Georgian  delegation be recalled from Moscow and the agreements denounced.  Boris Kakubava, leader of the Organization for the Liberation  of Abkhazia, the most radically minded as regards the head of  state's policy, stated:    [Kakubava] As long as Shevardnadze is the leader at the helm  in Georgia, this policy will continue. But this will probably  not be for long, because the Georgian people will understand  that Shevardnadze is a leader who works only for Russia.    [Keresilidze] Shevardnadze in his turn highly appraised  Russia's role in achieving the agreement, and noted the positive  influence of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who was  present at the talks.    [Shevardnadze] With his presence the secretary general  stressed the significance of this stage. I think that we should  value the true worth of this. I personally am grateful that he  will agree to participate in this process once again.</p>

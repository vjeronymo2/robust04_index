			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Asean Delivers a Slap in the Face of </F> Democracy"]    [Text] Asean officials meeting in Phatthaya over the  weekend to discuss details of the 27th Asean meeting to be held  in Bangkok in July, reached a decision over Thailand's  invitation to Burma.    The senior officials agreed that Burma should come as a  guest  of Thailand and not of the Asean Standing Committee (ASC) as  proposed by Thailand. Their rationale was that the country was  still administered by a military junta and had yet to show  enough "positive gestures" to justify an invitation from the ASC.    But if Burma has yet to show enough "positive gestures" to  deserve an invitation from the ASC, why is it being allowed to  attend as a guest of Thailand? Why the double standard?    Disappointingly, the Asean governments best positioned to  persuade the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council  (Slorc) to return democracy to the people have been far from  helpful. Only constructive engagement, these nations say, will  slowly persuade the Slorc to soften its harsh rule and join the  ranks of civilized nations.    The latest Asean leader to visit Burma was Singapore Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong who was accompanied by 24 businessmen,  all eyeing contracts with the despised junta.    If trading with the Slorc through Asean's constructive  engagement policy has made the Rangoon military junta less of a  monster, then why is it that international human rights  organizations still maintain there is a climate of fear and  repression in Burma?    If constructive engagement is working, then why does the  military regime continue to refuse to hold talks with its  democratic opponents?    Last month, the Slorc chief, Lt Gen [Lieutenant General]  Khin  Nyunt told THE NEW YORK TIMES that he would not meet or grant  any political standing to Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy leader  and Nobel Peace laureate who has been under house arrest in  Rangoon since 1989. That flat statement dashed the hopes of  many who thought the Slorc might be easing its iron grip.    For the first time since her arrest, Suu Kyi had recently  been allowed to see a non-family visitor, US Congressman Bill  Richardson of the House Intelligence Committee.    It seems that Khin Nyunt, also head of Burmese military  intelligence, seems determined to keep her under arrest. "There  are 42 million people here," he told THE NEW YORK TIMES' Philip  Shenon, "and they are not bothered by Aung San Suu Kyi."    As far as Suu Kyi is concerned, Asean leaders consider her  an  "internal matter" of Burma and not a major issue related to the  return of democracy. This is indeed sad and unfortunate as it  clearly shows the regional grouping is adhering to a blinkered  Burma policy when world leaders are standing up for the Nobel  laureate.    The administration of US President Bill Clinton for instance  has reviewed American policy towards Burma and reportedly  decided to increase pressure on the Slorc.    Washington is also pressuring other nations to stop sending  arms to the brutal military regime.    Under a system of representative democracy only those who  are  elected by the people have a right to represent them. Only they  have the right to write a constitution and make the rules by  which the people will be governed.    The charade of a national convention going on in Rangoon to  draft a constitution is a shadow play with Slorc moving its  handpicked puppets.    Economists within the junta boast they have created an  economic miracle in a few years, adding that a certain amount of  authoritarian rule is beneficial to development.    And Asean leaders too have been parroting this Slorc phrase.    If this is true, why then are Burmese factories operating at  less than 40 per cent capacity? And why has Slorc decided to  print new money in larger denominations and appealed to the  World Bank to draw on its gold reserves?    The ruling Burmese military junta has no regard for the will  of the people, is answerable to no authority and has no  responsibility to explain its behaviour.    For Asean to reward the Slorc generals with better trade and  diplomatic relations and allow Burma to be present at the  regional grouping's July meeting as a guest of Thailand, is  indeed a slap in the face of democracy.</p>

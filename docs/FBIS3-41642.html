			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pauli Andersen: ``EC Environmental Headquarters </F> Ready in Spring''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE  introduction]    [Text] Property next to Denmark's Environmental Researches  in Roskilde has been designated as the site of the EC's  environment agency. Project building plans are ready and the  agency's management team has been selected.    After many years' tug-of-war between the EC nations, the  Council of Ministers has now decided that Denmark is to play  host to the EC's environmental agency.    Denmark has prepared itself thoroughly to be the host of the  new EC institution. Therefore, it is expected that the office  can open as early as next spring. The environmental agency and  the city of Roskilde have prepared the way for locating the  office beside Denmark's Environmental Researches in Roskilde.  <H5>  Building Plans Are Ready </H5>   The plans for the building are already worked out and the  director of Denmark's Environmental Researches, Henrik Sandbech,  is prepared to help get the agency on its feet. Sandbech has  been appointed the Danish member of the agency's management team.    The new EC office will gather information on the quality of  the environment in various EC countries. This will provide  politicians background with which to evaluate which regions  should receive priority in getting environmental help.    ``The agency will be an institution independent of the  political system. Regulations regarding the agency's functions  have been approved, so now we are simply waiting to begin  operations,'' said Sandbech.  <H5>  Influx to Roskilde </H5>   In Roskilde, the district is engaged in an all-out  cooperative effort together with the local trade development  council to find housing for the incoming employees.    ``We expect that the environmental agency will attract many  new businesses to Roskilde. This includes EDP [electronic data  processing] businesses and naturally businesses that deal with  environmental issues,'' said Kim Valbum, director of the  Roskilde Area Trade Development Council.    On the national level, the placement of the agency in  Denmark  is seen as a sign that Denmark is on the leading edge when it  comes to protection of the environment.</p>

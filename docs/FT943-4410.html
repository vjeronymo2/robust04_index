			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Sri Lanka offers food for rebels Sri Lanka's new government yesterday made fresh moves towards a peace deal with Tamil separatist guerrillas in the island's north and east, by offering to restore supplies of food and power, Reuter reports from Colombo. 'We are prepared to give power to the north,' deputy defence minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told a news conference. He said the government needed only six weeks to set up power generators in the northern Jaffna peninsula, stronghold of the rebel Tamil Tigers, if the Tigers were prepared to co-operate in their installation. The government was also prepared to extend the national electricity grid to the north, which has been without power since rebels blew up power lines in the mid-1980s. Mr Ratwatte said the government wanted to send food convoys, under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, by road to Jaffna, as monsoon rains due in three weeks would make transportation by sea difficult. Normal land routes to Jaffna cannot be used because of the fighting. The deputy minister said the government had appointed a task force, headed by prime minister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, to rehabilitate the island's east, where security forces have gained the upper hand against guerrillas. The premier had earlier partially lifted a four-year economic blockade on the north, saying her People's Alliance government, elected last month, wanted to ease the suffering of Tamils there and hold peace talks with the rebels. More than 30,000 people have died since the Tigers launched their crusade for independence in 1983.</p>

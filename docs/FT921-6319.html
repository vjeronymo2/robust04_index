			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): DIY computer architecture MANY large corporate computer users have decided the time is right to determine the architecture of their systems themselves, rather than allow computer vendors to decide it for them. But how do you go about defining the architecture that best suits the business? In its recent report Managing Technical Architecture the Butler Cox Foundation, a service provided by the CSC Index Group, says that defining an architecture requires a staged approach. To begin with the company should establish the corporate-level policies that govern the organisation's IT, then it should identify categories of users and support, and specify the IT platform requirements for each class of support. Once the most appropriate scenario is tested, a migration plan should be developed and the architecture continually reviewed in the light of business and technology changes. The most difficult task, according to Butler Cox, is to work out the right relationship between the architecture and the business's needs. CSC Index: UK, 071 405 4295.</p>

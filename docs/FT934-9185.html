			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper mine finds buyer CYPRUS MINERALS, the US mining group, yesterday became the owner of the Peruvian copper mine Cerro Verde. In the only bid at the public auction held in Lima, Cyprus offered Dollars 37m cash and an investment commitment totalling Dollars 480m over five years. The offer was well in excess of the base price, set by Minero Peru's privatisation committee at Dollars 30m cash with a Dollars 160m investment commitment. Cyprus will develop the mine in association with Buena Ventura, one Peru's leading mining groups. Cerro Verde is one of Peru's most attractive copper deposits both for its location - 30km from the southern city of Arequipa - and its rich reserves, enough for nearly 50 years. The mine has been state-owned since its inauguration in 1977. The bulk of Cerro Verde's copper is produced by pad leaching and solvent-extraction-electro-winning. Until 1984, the plant produced 33,000 tonnes a year copper cathodes but when the oxide ore ran out there was no money for a concentrator plant to treat the sulphide ore. Output last year was only 18,000 tonnes of cathodes plus 9,000 tonnes of concentrate. Minero Peru will now stage auctions - for its copper refinery at Ilo and the zinc refinery of Cajamarquilla.</p>

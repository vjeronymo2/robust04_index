			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Prowting loses Pounds 4.87m after land provisions THE NEED for further provisions against its land holdings pushed Prowting, the housebuilder, into pre-tax losses for the second consecutive year. After a Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 22.4m) exceptional provision the group reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.87m in the year to February 28, compared to Pounds 17.7m, on turnover down by 4 per cent from Pounds 36.4m to Pounds 35m. Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive, expressed confidence that this would be the last write-down and said 'as 1993 progresses it is clear that the long, debilitating recession in our industry is coming to an end'. Losses per share were 7.9p (18.8p). As foreshadowed in November, the group is cutting the total dividend to 3.4p (5p) with a second interim dividend of 1.7p, which was paid in April before the Budget tax changes came into effect. Before the exceptionals profits were Pounds 68,000, against Pounds 4.71m, reflecting higher interest charges of Pounds 4.03m (Pounds 3.82m) and lower-priced house sales. Mid-year net borrowings peaked at Pounds 42.4m before a debt reduction programme resulted in year-end net borrowings falling to Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 36.5m), for gearing of 48 per cent. The number of units sold increased slightly from 273 to 290, but the average price fell from Pounds 103,000 to Pounds 88,000. House prices generally fell by about 8 per cent and there was a move towards first time buyers who made up 30 per cent of sales against 23 per cent in the previous year. As a result gross profits fell to Pounds 6.78m (Pounds 12m). Administrative expenses were cut to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 3.84m) leaving operating profits at Pounds 3.87m (Pounds 8.37m). The land bank includes 5,056 plots with planning permission or zoned for residential use, equivalent to more than 15 years supply at current building rates. After taking account of the necessary write-downs the average book cost per plot was Pounds 11,600, down from Pounds 17,200 before the provisions of the last two years. Commenting upon the outlook Mr Roydon said the recovery in house sales was patchy and confidence remained fragile. However, he added: 'Barring any new economic setbacks I am confident that sales volumes should show a significant upturn for the year as a whole compared with the depressed levels of the last few years.'</p>

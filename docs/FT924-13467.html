			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (10): Hoping for a golden future - Mobile communications AFTER a rather hesitant debut, the bandwagon is rolling for Europe's digital cellular radio system, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications). Originally planned for pan-European lift-off on July 1, 1991, GSM was plagued by early difficulties. The highly complex, perhaps overly-complicated system specification, led to delays in developing the necessary software and hardware testing equipment to ensure that GSM phones would operate equally well across the whole of Europe. These difficulties have now been resolved and GSM systems are coming on stream throughout Europe. Both UK operators are hard at work installing their networks and, in the case of Vodafone will be offering coverage of larger cities and linking roads by early 1993. Cellnet are publicly planning a full national service in 1994, with local and regional offerings in 1993. In Germany, thought by many to be Europe's biggest potential GSM market, both networks are open for business. Two of the three Swedish networks commenced operations on September 1 and the remaining European operators who have signed the GSM agreement are likely to be up and running within the next 12 months. On the international scene, the prospects for GSM look bright. Many administrations, looking to introduce deregulation into their telecommunications, have chosen to do so in the mobile sector. Many have licensed second operators to provide mobile services and in the majority of cases have specified GSM as the standard to be adopted. Despite its early problems, GSM is a 'here and now' technology and neither of its international rivals is able to provide a viable alternative. The US cellular industry has become locked into a spiral argument concerning the technology to be used and the Japanese are thought to have selected a non-exportable frequency band for their digital cellular standard. So far this has left the international field clear for GSM, to the benefit of European manufacturers who have invested very substantial sums in the technology. Two Australian networks will open in April 1993, with a third planned for 1994. New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong,the Philippines, Indonesia, China and Taiwan have all agreed to adopt GSM and both Russia and India are keen to switch on GSM networks. This development gives GSM the status of a de facto world standard. However, adopting the standard and building the network is relatively straightforward, the problems arise when the search begins for customers. The concern of many involved in cellular is whether there are sufficient new customers to justify the expensive move to digital. An important issue with some potential users is the security and privacy. As recent highly publicised events concerning the British Royal family have suggested, analogue cellular can be highly insecure. A strong selling point of GSM will be that speech is coded and therefore cannot be overheard. GSM will also offer users the possibility of international roaming, where they will be able to use their pocket terminal anywhere in Europe and have the bills sent to their home or office. However, the size and value of the international roaming capability is uncertain. The Scandinavian experience, where users of the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system are able to roam throughout Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark, suggests very little. In addition, operators of existing analogue networks who are now beginning to see significant returns of their investment may be reluctant to push GSM to their current subscriber base for fear of losing revenue. If the prospects for GSM are cloudy, what are the chances of success for Personal Communications Networks (PCN)? The brainchild of Lord Young and the UK Department of Trade and Industry, PCN was originally envisaged as the mobile communications system for the mass market. Using low-cost, lightweight pocket transceivers, PCN would bring mobility to the population at large. Three operators were given licences and services were planned to start in 1993. Since its inception however PCN has suffered from an identity crisis and a failure to differentiate itself from other mobile technologies such as cellular radio. The costs of building a PCN network are massive, around half a billion pounds, and already two of the operators, Mercury PCN and Unitel, have joined forces to try and contain these costs. Many are questioning whether a true mass market f or mobile communications of sufficient size to justify this scale of investment actually exists. In any event, a mass market for personal mobile communications can be addressed by other technologies without the massive investment requirements of PCN. UK cellular operators Vodafone and Cellnet are working to ensure that PCN is stillborn. Vodafone is planning to develop its GSM network to provide a PCN like service which it calls Micro Cellular Networks, (MCN). Like PCN, MCN will be targeted at urban users and will be implemented using small cells and lightweight handsets. According to Vodafone chairman Gerry Whent: 'MCN will launch the day before or the day after PCN.' Both operators have recently made a pre-emptive bid for the popular market by launching low cost tariff options on the existing analogue networks. Richard Goswell, managing director of PCN licensee Mercury Personal Communications is dismissive of these attempts to stifle the new technology in its cradle arguing that both the low-cost tariff approach and MCN are too complicated. 'Simplicity is the key to mass-market success,' says Mr Goswell. 'A customer wants one handset to provide him with communication whenever - and wherever  -he needs it.' Mercury are planning to launch their service in south-east England mid-1993 and is confident that it can find the mass-market PCN needs to succeed. On the European front, only Germany is proceeding with PCN and will be issuing a singly licence later this year. The German government sees PCN as a possible solution for the chronic telecommunications problems of the new eastern federal states and has already installed a small test system to assess its suitability. The French administration has stated that it sees no necessity for PCN type servi ces until the 21st Century and no other European country has any publicly announced plans for PCN. In the US, where PCN is known as Personal Communication Services (PCS), the picture is equally cloudy. Although there is considerable enthusiasm for the concept, the means of implementation is uncertain. The Federal Communications Commission has issued over 150 licences for experimental PCS systems-virtually all using different technologies. At the heart of this dilemma is a simple question: are mobile communications a useful tool to increase business efficiency or does the man on the Clapham omnibus want a phone in his pocket? Many in the mobile field are betting large sums of money that they have the right answer to that question. In the FT's Mobile Communications Survey, published on September 8, 1992, it was suggested that the German wireless local loop programme, known as DAL, utilised a variant of the NMT 450 analogue cellular telephone system, writes John Williamson. LM Ericsson has asked us to point out that the technology in question is the newer, higher capacity NMT 900 system.</p>

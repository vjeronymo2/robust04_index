			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Too late to shop, but not to give - Some gifts need only a little thought It is too late now to have a portrait painted, commission the necklace you always knew she wanted, plant a garden, order a customised yacht . . . But it is not too late for a little thought. Thinking back through the years to the presents I have loved the best, they are nearly always the ones with the most personal meaning, the ones that have involved thought, organisation or perfect timing. Tickets for the opera/theatre/concert one has been longing to go to, membership of a club one has wanted to join, a rare plant for a corner in the garden, a painting, a book by a favourite author or on a specialised interest, a subscription to a magazine, a lithograph of a much-visited place . . . all these are presents that will be appreciated and can still be organised. Here are just some suggestions. Theatre Tokens, which can be used at more than 150 theatres throughout Britain, including all those in the West End, can be bought in almost any denomination, either from branches of W. H. Smith and James Thin Bookseller (Scotland), or by credit card through the 24-hour line Tokenline: 071-240 8800. Sadly, Interbook, the service which had the bright idea of sending books in much the same way that Interflora sends flowers, has folded. However, Dillons Direct (0345-125704) will send any book in print, and for an extra Pounds 1 will gift-wrap it, too. Waterstone's mail-order service (0225-448595) will do likewise, and postage is free for books costing more than Pounds 35. Usual turnround time is seven days. Waterstone's also offers to track down out-of-print books (071-434 1195). After finding the book, it tells the customer what condition it is in and what it will cost, and the customer is then free to buy or not. For anybody living in a Georgian house, a good present could be membership of The Georgian Group at 37 Spital Square, London E1, (071-373 1722). Single annual membership costs Pounds 20, or Pounds 32 for a family. It publishes three newsletters a year, organises activities such as holidays, evening visits and lectures, but possibly most important of all, it offers advice on architectural matters such as where to track down appropriate materials, how to convert sympathetically etc. Membership of the Friends of the Royal Academy is well worth having - particularly for those who live out of London. For Pounds 37 a year (with a range of discounts for OAPS and students), the member and a guest, plus up to four children, get free entry to all Royal Academy Exhibitions (at least six a year) with 'privileged entry' - which means you do not have to queue. The Friends' room, where members can rest in peace and quiet, is a great boon. For bookworms, consider giving membership of the most distinguished and useful library in London: The London Library, 14 St James's Square, London SW1 (071-930 7705). Personal membership is Pounds 120 a year, which allows the member to borrow 10 books for as long as two months. Out-of-London members can order by post (postage extra) up to 15 books at a time. The library can also be used as a reference library for Pounds 12.50 a month. For the fit and adventurous, a day of action could be fun. Acorne Air Sports sells vouchers promising a session's flying, gliding, helicoptering, tandem skydiving, parachuting, ballooning or karting. Prices start at Pounds 51 (for gliding) and go up to Pounds 361 (for tandem skydiving). The nervous or the wise will include insurance - which is extra - in the package. For a brochure, write to Acorne Air Sports, Wycombe Air Centre, Booker, Marlow, Bucks SL7 3DR. Credit card telephone line: 0494-451703. For drivers who spend hours in their cars or people whose eyesight is not all it might be, The Talking Book Shop, 11 Wigmore Street, London W1 has more than 600 different titles. The best are the unabridged versions of the classics, but there are lots of others to choose from. Credit card line: 071-491 4117. 'For Lovers of the Morbid, the Macabre, &amp; the Darkly Romantic' The Gothic Society hopes this description of itself will entice new members. For a Pounds 20 annual membership fee, you get four magazines covering such subjects as the old legend of the Wandering Jew and the new legend of the Highgate Vampire, as well as a chance to buy other books and essays. Send cheques to: The Gothic Society, Chatham House, Gosshill Road, Chislehurst, Kent. (081-467 8475). The overworked, stressed, or overfed will appreciate a pampering day at a spa. The Dorchester in London's Park Lane has a spa that is new, grand and as yet not overcrowded. Vouchers can be bought by ringing the Spa direct line (tel; 071-495 7335). A detoxifying day (for those who have indulged not wisely but well) offers a heat treatment, an exfoliation (to remove skin impurities), a hydrotherapy bath, massage and facial and costs Pounds 100, including a light lunch.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Japanese quit Malacca oil refinery project PETRONAS, Malaysia's state-owned oil company, has confirmed the Idemitsu Kosan company of Japan has pulled out of a venture to build an oil refinery near Malacca on Malaysia's west coast. Idemitsu Kosan had a 40 per cent stake in the 100,000-barrel-a-day project, Petronas holding 45 per cent and Samsung of Korea 15 per cent. Idemitsu said the parties involved had failed to reach a project implementation schedule. The refinery is a key element in Malaysia's plan to become a big exporter of refined petroleum products over the next few years. At present, it has four refineries with combined capacity of 220,000 b/d. Most of its refined oil goes to the domestic market. The Malacca project will refine imported crude for re-export. Its estimated cost, with another facility at the same site, is Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.05bn-Pounds 1.26bn). Mr Azizan Zainal Abidin, Petronas president, said the Malacca project would be subject to some delay due to the Idemitsu pull-out. Petronas was holding talks with a US group and several Middle East companies, with a view to forming a new partnership for the project.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (5): Mere survival is not enough - The International Youth Foundation Battle Creek, Michigan, is a small town in the heartland of the US. It would go largely ignored by the world but for the fact that it crops up on the back of Kellogg's breakfast cereal packets. The dozy town, sometimes smelling of toasting corn, is dominated by the Kellogg company and its sister philanthropic foundation which, according to the fortunes of its investments, vies with the Ford Foundation to be the world's biggest such charitable body. Four years ago, a Dollars 65m donation over three years from the WK Kellogg Foundation (WKKF) - one of the biggest grants ever made by a philanthropic foundation - gave life to the International Youth Foundation, now also based in Battle Creek. The inspiration came from Rick Little, secretary general of the foundation, who persuaded the WKKF to award a grant, allowing him time to research and develop a new strategy for helping the world's youth. Impressed by the fact that as much as 80 per cent of private sector giving is devoted to the creation of new programmes and pilot projects, the consensus which emerged from the two year consultation period (involving experts from 30 countries) was that more support should be given to projects which have already proved their effectiveness. Thus a distinguishing feature of the IYF is that it steers clear of setting up new charitable programmes, concentrating instead on identifying and supporting exceptional local programmes that it believes are already making a difference, and helping them to expand. Its philosophy, that people at grass roots level are best able to understand the problems facing young people in different countries, together with a creative approach to fund-raising and the backing of the WKKF, has proved immensely appealing to other corporate donors. Equally compelling has been the IYF's message that world prosperity depends on the well-being of its youth, a message that appeals to the business interests of many corporations. The small staff of the IYF constantly points out that although great progress has been made in keeping more children alive, an ever greater proportion are growing up with little education, job training, productive employment - or hope. 'The basic issues of starvation, health, nutrition and survival have made significant progress,' says Rick Little. 'But we also need to concentrate on the issues that matter after you survive - education, training and parenting, for example. Unless we do that well, then survival doesn't really matter.' To try to ensure sustainable programmes, the IYF encourages the creation of indigenous, grant-making country foundations which are independent of government and less influenced by donor pressures. These foundations - there are currently seven, with another two in the planning phase - are financially endowed, with the help of the IYF, to make grants for youth programmes and to provide a channel for direct local action. The idea is that they eventually become self-supporting through local and international philanthropy. Such a system is more likely to ensure sustainable funding for the projects. Furthermore, it avoids leaving small, economically dependent communities at the whim of donors, who may abandon projects after a few years if their priorities change. Another IYF concern is that many donors prefer to give money for projects which address problems by categories such as literacy, drug abuse or teenage pregnancy. 'This approach may overlook the fact that many problems are interrelated and require comprehensive approaches,' says the IYF. The selection of countries for partnerships aims for a regional balance; 80 per cent of the foundation's activities directed to developing countries and 20 per cent to industrialised nations. Once a country has been identified, the formal establishment and staffing of national foundations is exhaustive, usually taking about 3 years. In Poland, for example, there was no history of independent charitable foundations nor of corporate involvement. Yet in May 1992, the Polish Children and Youth Foundation was legally established and is today the only grantmaking foundation in Poland focused solely on the needs of children and youth. In other countries, the IYF has had to be more cautious. For example, it decided to delay establishing a foundation in Laos, where there was no legal, indigenous non-governmental organisation (NGO) structure. Beyond the partnerships (through which most IYF funds are channeled), IYF supports programmes in other countries - part of its YouthNet programme. Any programmes that the IYF does choose to support - whether through a local foundation, or YouthNet - are put through a rigorous screening process. Nominations are solicited from NGOs, the church, business leaders, universities and international foundations, among other sources. The IYF then 'interviews' a programme to establish what its objectives are, how youth participates, and what its expected social and economic outcomes are. The programme's budget is also closely scrutinised, and tested for economic viability. The foundation further checks that a programme is independent of partisan politics. The IYF takes a creative approach to fund raising, and is particularly keen on leveraged donations. For example, Dollars 6.5m of the initial Dollars 15.3m grant that the Kellogg Foundation gave to IYF was conditional on IYF raising Dollars 13m from other sources - a Dollars 1 to Dollars 2 match. IYF in turn asks its sister foundations to match donations, but varies the matches according to the circumstances of a particular country. For example, in Ecuador, the IYF gives Dollars 3 for every Dollars 1 that the local foundation can raise, recognising the difficulties faced by local staff in attracting corporate donations. Of course there will always be sceptics who doubt the impact of an organisation like the IYF. In view of the scale of the problems facing the world's youth, a degree of cynicism is hardly surprising. But after only four years in existence the IYF is already having an impact, not only by helping successful programmes to expand, but by lifting the problems facing the world's youth on to the agendas of governments and business all over the world.

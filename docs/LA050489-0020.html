			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A MATTER OF VALUES, POLITICAL SEMANTICS  </P> <P> When a citizen group decided last year to call itself the Irvine Values  Coalition, member Christina Shea had some misgivings.  </P> <P> Shea had no qualms about the group's goal, which is to force Irvine to remove a  reference to gays from an anti-discrimination ordinance. But she found the  group's name troubling.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I'm comfortable with our name, because it has the connotation  of being a right-wing, odd-duck group," said Shea, mother of three and member  of the steering committee.  </P> <P> "I think it's sad that because you may be more conservative and have values  that are more conservative," she said, "that people look at you and think  there's something odd about you. I'm not that kind of person -- at least, I  don't think I am. So I wish we had named ourselves something else; I don't know  what."  </P> <P> In a decade when religion and politics have increasingly commingled, the Irvine  group is the latest county organization trying to ward off what is seen as  assaults on "traditional values."  </P> <P> Scott Peotter, leader of the Irvine coalition, said he knows that the  designation traditional values upsets some people. "It'll stir up some people  who say, 'Gee, exactly whose values are they using? They certainly don't  represent my values.'  </P> <P> "When we say traditional values," he said, "what we're referring to are  traditional values that come from the Founding Fathers, that are repeated and  shown throughout the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution --  God-given, inalienable rights. So it refers to the Judeo-Christian set of  values, and that's the background that we're coming from."  </P> <P> The rights ordinance adopted by the Irvine City Council on July 12 bars  discrimination based on a person's race, color, religion, national origin,  gender, age, marital status, physical handicap or sexual orientation. In March,  leaders of the Irvine Values Coalition delivered 5,433 validated petition  signatures to City Hall, forcing the City Council either to eliminate the  sexual orientation designation or place the issue before voters.  </P> <P> The City Council is expected to act on that choice Tuesday. The issue could be  placed on the ballot as early as November or be delayed until June, 1990.  </P> <P> The Irvine Values Coalition was formed last summer and had about 75 original  members, but six to 10 people have met somewhat regularly and done most of the  planning since then, the group's leaders said.  </P> <P> Peotter said his group does not want to discriminate against gays but is  opposed to the ordinance because members believe that it gives gays special  protection.  </P> <P> "We're against special rights for any group, and particularly homosexuals,  because it's a group based on behavior," Peotter said.  </P> <P> The ordinance "more or less gives legislative approval of their life style,  which I don't think is acceptable," he said. "What people do in their own  bedroom is their own business, but when it comes out of the bedroom and is  legislated over the rest of the citizens, that's where I have problems with  it."  </P> <P> The petition backers are concerned that Irvine has endorsed homosexuality at  the expense of the "traditional family," Peotter said. The gay life style, he  said, "doesn't lend itself to the traditional family. I don't think Irvine  should be in business to promote the alternative family. . . .  </P> <P> "Obviously, the city's interest and promotion of day care shows Irvine really  wants to be a pro-family type of community. That's not to say homosexuals  aren't welcome, but the promotion of their life style is not in the same line  as being pro-family."  </P> <P> Peotter said the group is not concerned with allegations that it is imposing  its values on others: "It's not a matter of if there are going to be values;  it's a matter of whose values they're going to be. We think the traditional  family and their values haven't been represented. In the case of the human  rights ordinance, the homosexual group imposed its values on the rest of the  community, and we're reacting to that."  </P> <P> The group is forcing the issue, Peotter said, because "the thing that got most  of us is: If we don't take a stand now, where do we take a stand? There's got  to be a point where there is no compromise.  </P> <P> "As we've gotten into this, we really see that Irvine is just one of the  building blocks in a move to do it (pass similar ordinances) throughout Orange  County. If we can make a stand now in Irvine, it will do a lot to stop similar  ordinances from passing in other cities."  </P></p>

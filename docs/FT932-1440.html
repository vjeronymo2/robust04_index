			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (10): A century of athletic achievement - The background to the north-west's depth of feeling and passion for endeavour and glory on the playing fields of England / Sporting Tradition SPORT has always been an important ingredient of professional, social and cultural life in north-west England, but just how far it has developed from a pastime for hard-pressed workers on Saturday afternoons more than 100 years ago is nowhere better typified than at Manchester United. Sport in the north may still, for some, conjure up an image of the baggy shorts of the railway workers' kickabout, which is what Manchester United was in 1878 when it was founded as the Newton Heath Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Football Club. The reality now is a quoted company turning over more than Pounds 20m annually, with distributed profits for its last financial year of Pounds 5m. When alterations are complete, its home ground of Old Trafford will be a 45,000 all-seater superstadium, of which 3,000 will be high-priced executive seating in boxes or attached to lounges. The team, which once included world-class players such as Bobby Charlton and George Best, has just won the English premier league championship and is one of Europe's best. Its fame gives it big foreign support, with a 6,000-strong Scandinavian fan club and 1,000 registered followers in Malta. Mr Martin Edwards, the chairman, is not sure whether the Olympics will enhance the club's reputation directly, but the stadium would certainly play an important part. It would be involved directly in the football tournament, while the judo competition would be in a specially-built indoor arena adjoining it. The important point, however, is that Manchester United typifies a north-western tradition not only in athletic achievement, but in managing and administering sport too. The stadium is now the most important 'neutral' ground for big rugby league matches outside Wembley. Important rugby union matches are also played there and there are plans for more matches. On Merseyside, Liverpool Football Club has achieved even more in recent years than Manchester United, winning the European Cup four times and winning the English league championship a record number of times. Though apparently in Liverpool's shadow, Everton - Merseyside's other big team - has also excelled. Old Trafford and Goodison Park - home of Everton and the larger of the two big Liverpool football stadiums - would be used in the soccer tournament, with the final at the Manchester United ground. Sport is played and watched seriously at all levels. The big spectator sports are football, rugby league and cricket - Lancashire county cricket is played at another Old Trafford ground near the football stadium. They do not all figure in the Olympic lists, but, again, they are well organised, with big events well managed. Out of this sporting tradition have come many heroes, such as Bobby Charlton and George Best. Charlton, now a Manchester United director, is also an active figure in the Olympic Bid. So is Chris Boardman, cycling pursuit champion at Barcelona, who comes from Merseyside and will be an enthusiastic user of the new velodrome and national cycling centre, already under construction on the Olympic site. The region - and Merseyside, in particular - has produced many boxers, including Alan Rudkin, but the most famous is John Conteh, who rose through the amateur ranks to become world light-heavyweight champion. Fittingly, if Manchester's bid succeeds on behalf of the north-west, the boxing tournament would be in Liverpool in a new arena near the Albert Dock. More important than high profile sporting heroes and venues, however, is the strength in depth of numbers of ordinary, amateur players in nearly all Olympic sports. Athletics, basketball, badminton, cycling, canoeing, equestrianism, fencing, football and the rest all have strong club structures. Wigan, the venue for swimming, has one of the strongest amateur swimming clubs in Britain and the Merseyside suburbs are home to several of the country's top field hockey clubs. In addition, most of those involved in non-Olympic sports such as rugby union, cricket or rugby league - both as players or administrators - have an interest and commitment to sport in general. The importance of this body of thousands of amateur sports players and supporters is the corps of volunteers who would almost certainly answer any call made upon them by the Olympic Games' organisers. They already toil unpaid to make their own sports work and have proved themselves many times in helping to ensure big events - in their own sports or others - have worked well.</p>

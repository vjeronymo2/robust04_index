			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Former BR chairman testifies in bribes trial THE SCALE of the alleged bribery of British Rail staff by Plasser Railway Machinery GB, the track maintenance supplier, came as a 'considerable surprise' to Sir Peter Parker, former BR chairman, he told the Old Bailey yesterday. He was giving evidence at the trial of Plasser and two of its executives - Mr Norbert Jurasek, managing director, and Mr Michael Brooks, company secretary - and Mr David Currie, BR's former head of civil engineering. All deny giving or receiving bribes in the form of air tickets and hospitality. Sir Peter said that in 1983 BR had received complaints from NEI, a competitor of Plasser, after NEI had lost a tender bid. NEI complained that the relationship between Plasser and some BR staff was extremely close and possibly improper. BR investigated the claims, but found nothing improper had taken place, he said. Sir Peter, chairman of BR from 1976 to 1983, agreed that corporate hospitality - including paying for entertainment and travel - was accepted commercial practice. However, there was a world of difference between providing hospitality and trying to fix a contract, he said. BR's guidelines on accepting gifts were well known by staff, as were the difficult and sensitive areas when gifts might be made when contracts were being fought for. He had never had any incident over excessive entertaining drawn to his attention. The trial continues.</p>

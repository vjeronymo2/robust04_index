			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Moorgate Smaller Cos raising Pounds 25m Moorgate Smaller Companies Investment Trust is raising Pounds 25m via a placing of 25m offer units at 100p each. The units will be exchanged for shares at the trust's undiluted net asset value on the latest date prior to the close of the offer. About 10m of the units will be available for existing shareholders. The trust believes that the outlook for smaller companies has changed favourably in recent months as interest rates have fallen; the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index has risen 11.4 per cent in the first two months of the year, while the FT-A All-Share index rose only 2.4 per cent. Moorgate Smaller Companies was launched in May 1991, with shares priced at 100p. Yesterday the shares closed at 123 1/2 p.</p>

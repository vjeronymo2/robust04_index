			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Management: Hit for six by a demanding Swedish mistress - How a British factory tried to scramble out from the bottom of the heap That day in October 1990 was one of the worst in Roddy MacLeod's life. He learnt that his British factory was hopelessly inefficient and unproductive compared with its continental European counterparts. MacLeod runs the British arm of Esab, the Swedish welding products manufacturer, which two years ago decided to rank all its European plants in terms of productivity. The British factory, based in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, came last of six on all counts - including costs per hour and output per hour - and was getting worse. With overcapacity in the industry, it was not certain that Esab needed six factories, putting the very existance of the plant in doubt. The way to recovery has involved some painful decisions, but the experience shows how a factory, when threatened, can be mobilised to come to terms with a problem. The Waltham Cross plant is Esab's main UK factory, accounting for about half its Pounds 50m UK sales. It has been making electrodes since the 1930s and as factories go, it is not a pretty site. These days it is a high-speed operation where traditional methods can occasionally be glimpsed amid the serried ranks of wire drawing machines. For some products, cakes of paste used as the outer coating of electrodes are thrown together by hand. The plant was bought from BOC in 1983 when Esab was snapping up welding businesses from multinationals as diverse as Philips and GKN. After rationalisation in the mid-1980s, it had three good years from 1987 to 1989 before coming a cropper over new technology. A new Japanese machine was installed to automate the manufacture of slugs of paste which coat the electrode. Unfortunately, the executive behind the decision failed to pass on his vision to colleagues. To maintain production, Esab was forced to use the machine before anyone on the shopfloor understood it. It ended up continually going wrong, and increasing, rather than saving costs. Although it contributed to the relatively poor financial performance, the episode was a blessing in disguise. The lesson it taught management about communication would prepare it for a wider battle ahead for the future of the factory. The first thing to be done was to improve communication with the workforce of nearly 300. This began very much as a one-way process, when the facts about the factory's performance were laid bare at large meetings with employees. The aim was to ensure, as current management jargon puts it, that everyone at the plant 'owned' the problem. But the meetings also coincided with the UK's entry into the ERM, and MacLeod was keen to offset media euphoria about lower interest rates with a few home thoughts on the discipline imposed by stable exchange rates. In November 1990, two-way communication began through a series of 35 small meetings with eight to 10 employees each. Their were four key questions on the agenda: How can individuals improve their performance? How can my department perform better? How can our department help others? What can other departments do to help us? The deluge of suggestions on the last point indicated how little thought had hitherto been given to such questions. Helped by a favourable wage settlement and more flexible working arrangements, such as staggered tea and lunch breaks, the factory began to show vague signs of improved performance in early 1991. A longer-term plan was developed based on reducing costs while maintaining employees' commitment. MacLeod, perhaps fortunately, was not to know until March that head office in Gothenburg was looking closely at capacity issues, with initial calculations pointing to the closure of Waltham Cross. But the plant was reprieved by virtue of the changes already made and the confidence that improvements would continue. A succession of measures throughout 1991 maintained this momentum. The need for more efficiency and the impact of the recession produced two rounds of early retirements and redundancies, reducing the workforce by 50. In June, head office approval for a second new production line sealed the future, but this time proper training was given, and a less automated, more flexible technique used to allow small-batch production and thus increase responsiveness to customer's needs. By October, a second meeting of the six factories' production managers revealed that Waltham Cross was now fourth best. Last month, the 180 remaining employees at Waltham Cross learnt that the plant had swung from a Pounds 500,000 loss in 1990 to a Pounds 1.01m profit last year, despite lower volumes which dented profits by Pounds 800,000. MacLeod's target now is to be second in the Esab league this year and to challenge the German plant for the top spot next year.</p>

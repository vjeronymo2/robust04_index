			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (6): Poised for expansion - Food processing ON June 18, the day of Ireland's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, the Irish Farmers' Association published a large front-page advert in the Irish Farmers' Journal saying: 'Your most important task today - vote YES for your families' future.' Most farmers did not need persuading. In many rural areas over 70 per cent of voters gave their approval to the treaty. Common Agricultural Policy reforms notwithstanding, Irish farmers obviously concluded that an EC with EMU is infinitely preferable to an EC without Ireland. Ireland's dairy and beef industries continue to be mainstays of the economy. It is estimated that food production accounts for 10 per cent of GNP and 20 per cent of total exports. One in seven people are involved in farming. As one market analyst says: 'It is hardly surprising that the main home-produced soap opera on TV in Ireland is set on a farm.' Beef production has grown tenfold in Ireland as a result of EC membership. Dairy output has been similarly stimulated. But what of its food processing industries? According to a recent industrial policy review study, known as the Culliton report, 'since Ireland joined the EC, Irish food manufacturing has declined significantly in the face of more liberal market conditions. Consequently imports of manufactured foods have risen steeply . . . a priority for Irish manufacturers must be to increase domestic market share and reduce imports'. Mr Liam Connellan, the director-general of the Confederation of Irish Industries, said: 'The value-added at the manufacturing stage in the food industries is an average of only 3 per cent, whereas it should be possible to achieve 15 per cent as it is in the UK and other parts of Europe'. MUCH has been blamed on the complacency produced by dependence on EC intervention buying of Irish produce. In 1990, 40 per cent of beef production and 50 per cent of skimmed milk power and butter was sold into intervention, making Ireland one of the biggest users of intervention-buying mechanisms in the Community. However, significant changes are taking place in the industry. The emergence of the dairy co-operative-plc hybrids in the late 1980s, with their access to stockmarket funds, has created a powerful and rapidly-expanding new sector of Irish-owned industry which is international in outlook with ambitions to match. The transformation began in 1986 with the flotation of Kerry Group, the country's first dairy co-operative-plc hybrid, and has since been followed by Avonmore, Waterford, and Golden Vale. Greencore, the state sugar company, was floated last year. Virtually insignificant ten years ago, food companies now account for more than 10 per cent of the Dublin Stock Exchange's market capitalisation. All have turned in respectable results for the past year, despite the recession, and all are engaged in ambitious acquisition programmes in an effort to diversify, achieve economies of scale and increase market share abroad. Kerry Group has been the trailblazer. Starting out as a small farmers' co-operative in 1974, with an annual turnover of IPounds 23m in dairy products, it reported IPounds 24.1m pre-tax profits in 1991 on a turnover of IPounds 755m. Dairy products now comprise only 25 per cent of turnover, while meat processing accounts for 50 per cent and food ingredients the other 25 per cent. It is the latter which has generated the most excitement. In 1988 the group purchased Beatreme Food Ingredients in the US, which Mr Hugh Friel, the company's deputy managing director, said 'produced a major change in the organisation'. KERRY is now a leading producer of specialised food ingredients in the US, and sources one of those ingredients, casein (a by-product from butter production), from its dairy processing plants in Ireland. It has also become a large supplier of branded consumer food products to UK multiple retail outlets. Mr Friel says that further expansion in the US, UK and Europe is envisaged. However, further growth at Kerry, as well as the other co-operative-plc hybrids, will eventually require a change in their shareholding structure. At present, all stipulate that the co-operative shares must not fall below 51 per cent without a majority decision of the shareholders. Kerry has come closest to that threshold and is likely to be the first to break it. Five thousand farmers currently hold a 58 per cent stake in Kerry through the Kerry cooperative, a stake which has been diluted through successive rights issues made to finance the acquisition programme. Will the dairy farmer-shareholders be willing to cede control of their company? Mr Friel says: 'There's a lot of money tied up in that 58 per cent and the growth we have achieved has never been at the expense of the milk price paid to our producers.' He predicts that the change will occur 'within two years'. If Kerry leads, it is probable that the farmer-shareholders at the other co-operative-hybrids will follow. The government is meanwhile preparing to change tack on its industrial support programme, to give greater incentives to investment in the food industry, which the Culliton report identified as requiring special attention. Shortly after Mr Albert Reynolds became prime minister earlier this year, he placed special emphasis on the importance of the food industries for Ireland's economic development and said it would be one of his priorities to encourage growth and investment in the sector. Civil servants in conjunction with industry representatives are currently drawing up a national food industry development plan, on the basis of recommendations made in the Culliton report, and this should be ready later this year. The shake-up, when it comes, will produce one of the biggest overhauls of Irish industrial policy for decades, and position its food industries for a prolonged and sustained period of growth. The farmers will doubtless feel justified in having demonstrated their faith by voting for Maastricht last month.</p>

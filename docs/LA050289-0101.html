			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MWD SHELVES ITS EXPANSION SURCHARGE BILL  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California Monday temporarily  withdrew a controversial bill that would have cleared the way for the giant  water agency to levy a surcharge on property in its six-county service area.  </P> <P> The surcharge is one of several revenue sources the district had considered  using to finance a $3-billion expansion program primarily in San Diego and  Riverside counties.  </P> <P> Although the Legislature gave the district the authority in 1984 to levy up to  a $10-per-parcel surcharge, it never provided a mechanism for collecting the  money. The legislation by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) would have allowed  county tax collectors to collect the charge for the district.  </P> <P> "It (the bill) had simply become more controversial than we thought it  warranted," said Jay Malinowski, a spokesman for the district. "In our minds  the contents of the bill are not significant enough to cause that kind of  controversy. It really doesn't do anything new except set up a mechanism to  collect a charge we're already authorized to collect."  </P> <P> Malinowski said that inasmuch as the district had not planned to levy the  charge for several years, the shelving of the bill would only delay its  financial planning for the massive expansion program.  </P> <P> He said officials will renew their efforts to pass it next year after its  critics have had more time to review it.  </P> <P> "It's obviously not going to come up this year in the Legislature," he said.  </P> <P> The bill became controversial when some members of the district's Board of  Directors complained that the board's decision to push its passage in the  Legislature had been made hurriedly without adequate public hearings.  </P> <P> And even Monday they complained that the decision to withdraw it was being made  without public notice by General Manager Carl Boronkay in consultation with the  board's executive committee.  </P> <P> "I'm glad it has been made a two-year bill but I think the system stinks," said  Tom Brick, who represents Pasadena on the board.  </P> <P> Brick said he had hoped that by opposing the bill he could force the district  to re-examine its proposals for financing the expansion program.  </P> <P> By levying a surcharge, he said the district would be able to force all of its  14 million customers to pay for expansion that would only benefit about 4  million water users.  </P> <P> "It's a tremendous subsidy really to the outlying areas," he said. "I don't  think the already developed areas of Southern California should be forced to  pay for this very expensive expansion."  </P> <P> Brick said the district's decision to charge every user the same rate -- often  called the postage stamp philosophy -- conflicts with recent trends in local  government financing.  </P> <P> "The whole direction in municipal government has been to make the user pay. The  new user should have to pay the price of conveying the facilities to his area,"  he said.  </P></p>

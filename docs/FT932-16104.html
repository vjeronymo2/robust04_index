			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Improved margins at Norish A cost reduction programme and lower net interest charges helped Norish, the Co Monaghan-based food storage and services group, improve margins and record a modest increase in annual profits. On turnover down from IPounds 13.6m to IPounds 10.6m, reflecting the disposal of certain distribution interests, pre-tax profits for the 1992 year totalled IPounds 2.32m (IPounds 2.2m). Net interest was IPounds 577,000 (IPounds 651,000). Earnings per share emerged at 20.7p (17.1p) and a same-again final dividend of 7p maintains the total at 11.47p.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AFFAIR RILES MOM OF NEW ZEALAND EX-PREMIER  </P> <P> The mother of former Prime Minister David Lange today said she hates her son  after weekend revelations that he left his wife for his speech writer.  </P> <P> "My heart is full of hatred, and I don't want to speak to him," Lange's  80-year-old mother, Phoebe, told reporters. "We will all pray that he comes to  his senses."  </P> <P> Lange, 47, announced he and his wife, Naomi, had separated after 21 years of  marriage. He gave no reason.  </P> <P> But Wellington's Dominion Sunday Times newspaper quoted his wife as saying in  an interview that her husband was stolen by his longtime speech writer,  Margaret Pope. She complained that the couple's three children needed a father.  </P> <P> Lange resigned after five years as prime minister in August, citing health  reasons. His romance fueled speculation that he would quit politics, but Lange  said today that he intends to contest his seat at Mangere in next year's  general election.  </P> <P> As prime minister, Lange clashed sharply with the United States over New  Zealand's policy of banning nuclear weapons from its territory.  </P> <P> Lange's mother told reporters that her son contacted her last Tuesday to tell  her he was leaving his wife.  </P> <P> "I was furious. I didn't swear, but I told him in no uncertain terms what I  thought of him," she said.  </P></p>

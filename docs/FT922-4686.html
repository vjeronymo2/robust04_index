			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Control Data aims for more than mere survival - US computer group sees radical surgery as a solution to its difficulties AFTER years of divestitures and closures to tackle mounting problems, Control Data, the US computer group, has decided to undergo radical surgery aimed at ensuring growth rather than mere survival. The company, which was already a shadow of its former self, split into two independent companies in a determined move to become a more sharply-focused information services company. A proud pioneer of the computer industry, Control Data, under the new name of Ceridian, will be transformed into a provider of computer services. The spin-off company, Computer Data Systems, will comprise the remnants of a computer manufacturer that in its heyday was seen as a challenger to International Business Machines. Control Data made its mark in the 1960s with high-speed computers for scientists and engineers designed by its star engineer, Mr Seymour Cray. Then, in the early 1970s, Mr Cray left to form his own company, Cray Research, which went on to dominate the supercomputer market. Control Data's founder, Mr William Norris, began an ill-fated round of acquisitions, taking the company into dozens of fields that were unrelated to its computer technology roots. The company payroll expanded from 13 employees in 1957 to more than 60,000 worldwide by the early 1980s, while sales peaked at Dollars 5bn in 1984. Since then, Control Data has been on a downward spiral. Revenues slid to Dollars 1.5bn last year, when the company recorded losses of Dollars 9.8m. 'This company has faced enormous difficulties since 1984,' Mr Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive, ac-knowledged. Over the past few years, Control Data has sold several businesses, including its supercomputer business, commercial credit operations and computer disk drive manufacturing in efforts to cut costs. 'Most of what we've done up to now has been aimed at survival,' said Mr Perlman. 'Now we are able to take actions that have the potential to enable the businesses to grow.' Under the plans announced last week, Control Data Systems will be formed from Control Data Corporation's computer products group. The computer company will start life with annual revenues of about Dollars 600m and a base of more than 1,000 customers. The remaining services and defence businesses, which last year accounted for about two-thirds of Control Data's total revenues, will be renamed Ceridian. This company's operations will include computer services, such as payroll processing. It will also own Arbitron, which provides audience ratings for television shows; a service that authorises cheques and credit cards for retailers; and a group that designs computer systems for government agencies. The split frees Ceridian to pursue its service businesses without the cloud of losses from Control Data's computer products operations. It will also enable the restructured company to present a clearer message to potential investors and partners, Mr Perlman believes. As the president and chief executive of Ceridian, Mr Perlman aims to put the company on a growth path. He sees opportunities to expand the company's payroll and employee services business. 'We are the second largest payroll processor, but we only have about 4 per cent of the market. We can make some modest acquisitions to expand our presence in that market. There is a lot of potential for growth.' Ceridian also aims to expand its government systems business, which has traditionally focused upon large-scale defence contracts, into civilian government agency contracts. Overall, Ceridian should be able to increase its revenues at a rate of about 10 per cent a year, Mr Perlman estimated. After a transition period, the computer spin-off, Control Data Systems, may also be able to achieve profitable growth, he predicted. Currently, however, the computer products group is operating at a loss, but when it becomes an independent company Control Data Systems will be profitable, said Mr James Ousley, who will become president and chief executive of the newly-formed company. He has run Control Data's computer products group for the past three years. Since 1989, the computer products group has been focusing upon 'open systems' products that adhere to industry standards. Although sales of these new products are growing, they have yet to compensate for a decline in revenues from proprietary systems. The new company will be able to 'pick and chose' the best technologies available and form relationships with companies that provide them, Mr Ousley said, suggesting this will give Control Data Systems an edge over competitors who are aligned to one technology source. Forming strategic partnerships and finding equity investors proved impossible for the Control Data computer group until the plan to spin off the business as an independent company became known, said Mr Ousley. Silicon Graphics, whose workstation products are resold by Control Data, has now agreed to take a 10 per cent equity stake in the new company and strengthen ties with marketing and technology sharing agreements. NEC of Japan has also tentatively agreed to take a 5 per cent stake in Control Data Systems and expand its existing supercomputer marketing agreement to include joint marketing and development activities in RISC microprocessors and UNIX software. Whether the sum of the parts of Control Data will be more successful than the whole remains to be seen. It is clear, however, the company had little choice but to submit itself to radical surgery if it was to have any chance of recovery.</p>

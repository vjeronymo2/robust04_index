			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Supporter of Russian PM urges western aid Mr Arkady Volsky, chief of a Russian industrialists' and entrepreneurs' union, called at the weekend for western capital to support what he called the new government's attempts to restore 'basic organisation' to the economy in order to continue reforms. Mr Volsky, a close associate of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, who has called for 'non-monetary' means to fight inflation and more state intervention in the economy, denied Russia lacked the right political and economic conditions to receive large-scale financial assistance. He also called for 'international compensation' to Russia for 'billions of dollars' it had lost because of its adherence to sanctions against the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya. Mr Chernomyrdin has continued to issue conflicting signals about the intentions of his new economic team of former industrial managers. 'They are scared of being blamed for fuelling inflation. They do not know what to do. They have made promises but no decisions,' said one reformer still in the government. On Friday, Mr Chernomyrdin signed a document bringing closer a controversial monetary union with neighbouring Belarus. Although the terms of the proposed union have yet to be made public, this project will inevitably mean increased pressure on Russia's finances. In an attempt to lessen the burden of neighbouring republics, Russia last year cut energy supplies to the Commonwealth of Independent States by 40 per cent for oil and 25 per cent for gas, according to official figures published yesterday. Mr Chernomyrdin also reassured Ukraine that Russia had no desire to take back the Crimean peninsula after Crimea's new president, who has promised a referendum on reunification with Russia, asked a former Russian deputy premier to head his government. Pending a speech next Thursday, when President Boris Yeltsin is expected to clarify whether he endorses Mr Chernomyrdin's economic policy shift, the Russian prime minister has also issued instructions to make it more difficult for ailing companies to be declared bankrupt. As well as trying to attract western investment to ailing enterprises, Mr Chernomyrdin is desperately trying to persuade the International Monetary Fund to unlock a new Dollars 1.5bn loan to help him support new budget expenditure. Mr Volsky's open letter is clearly designed to aid those efforts. In a sign of some continuing western efforts to support Russian reforms, Russia's privatisation ministry, headed by the only senior radical left in the government, unveiled a service providing free capitalist expertise to help managers of privatised enterprises. Advisers provided by leading western companies will assist with business plans, rationalisation and cost cutting programmes, as well as staff training, and searching for foreign investors.</p>

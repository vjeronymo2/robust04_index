According to them, many ministries will be  abolished, re-organized on the basis of merging with others.  This project aims at radical changes in the government  structure, reduction of expenses on maintaining bureaucratic  apparatus, and the saved means will be directed to the increase  of wages and pays of state servicemen.    According to these sources, this project is actually solved  it remains only to wait for a decision of the parliament, which  will consider this project. P. Jasray has presented his project  at the government sitting, and also to the steering council of  the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.    Running across resistance in both cases, the prime minister  gave to understand that he is going to realize his project  within the framework of his powers granted by the Constitution.    An issue about expediency of re-organization of the  government, reduction of the number of ministries is raised in  Mongolia not for the first time. This issue has been raised not  once by the Mongolian president, the oppositional forces, and  also by independent economists.</p>

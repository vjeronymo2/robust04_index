BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL STATES' POPULATION GROWS  </P> <P> The industrial states of the Midwest and Northeast are pulling out of the  population doldrums and adding people once again, the Census Bureau reported  today.  </P> <P> "The industrial-based states of Indiana, Michigan and Ohio continue to recover  from the early 1980s population losses," the bureau said. "These three states  added more population between 1986 and 1988 than in the previous five years  combined."  </P> <P> In addition, the Northeast's population growth between 1985 and 1988 was the  highest since the late 1960s, the bureau said.  </P> <P> The report came just one day after the bureau and the Department of Agriculture  reported that the nation's rural population had halted its long-term decline.  </P></p>

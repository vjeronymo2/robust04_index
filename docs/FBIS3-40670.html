The domestic demand in the current year is likely to touch  15.4 million tonnes--slightly higher than last year's 15.25  million tonnes (much below the projected demand) as against the  projected demand of 17.3 million tonnes.    In the coming year, while the projected demand has been put  at 18.5 million tonnes, the planning commission and sail have  estimated it to be around 16 million tonnes.    In fact, the planned production for next year is likely to  be  around 16 million tonnes against the domestic capacity of about  22 million tonnes leaving about 6 million tonnes of idle  capacity.    According to industry sources, the stagnation in demand is  mainly due to the recession in the steel consuming sectors like  heavy industry, engineering and processing industry as very few  new projects require substantial quantities of steel.    There has also been a heavy drop in expenditure by the  government departments including railways which reduced its  steel procurement during the year by 20 percent. PTI</p>

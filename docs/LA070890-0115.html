			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG FUNDS TO BE USED TO PAY FOR OFFICERS  </P> <P> This financially strapped city will use hundreds of thousands of dollars in  drug forfeiture money during 1990-91 to pay for seven new sworn officers and  six other police employees to fight rising crime.  </P> <P> The thirteen employees, as well as equipment for them, represent the only  significant new expense authorized by the City Council during a series of  recent budget meetings. Those meetings concluded last Monday, when the council  approved a $30-million austerity budget.  </P> <P> The council decided to use the forfeiture money, which was seized during drug  busts involving Huntington Park police, when it became apparent that there was  not enough money in the city's general fund to pay for the additional officers.  </P> <P> Cities usually avoid using uncertain funding sources to pay for ongoing  expenses such as police officers or other personnel, according to city  officials. If the Huntington Park Police Department, for example, is not  involved in any large drug busts in the next year, the flow of forfeiture funds  could slow to a trickle.  </P> <P> Huntington Park has $1.4 million in forfeiture money, about $1.25 million of  which came from a record cocaine bust at a Sylmar warehouse last year, Police  Chief Patrick M. Connolly said.  </P> <P> The additional seven officers, plus five jailers, a records clerk and the new  guns, radios and other equipment for them, will cost the city about $1.2  million a year, Connolly said. Once the forfeiture money runs out, the city  will have to find additional funding or lay off the officers.  </P> <P> City officials are hoping that sales tax and other revenue will increase enough  to keep the officers, but they are not counting on it.  </P> <P> "It's a terrible problem," Mayor Thomas E. Jackson said. "We're going to go  into a program that we have no visible means of continuing. We're hoping that  the effect of this program will be so overwhelming that we might run most of  the bad guys out of town."  </P> <P> Hiring more police officers has been a priority of city officials. Crime has  been rising in Huntington Park, which has plenty of gang activity and one of  the highest auto theft rates in the nation.  </P> <P> Its Police Department will have 67 sworn officers with the new positions. The  city's population is about 52,000, and it has fewer officers per 1,000  residents than the average city in California, according to a recent study by  UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> In late 1987, financial problems forced the city to eliminate three police  positions, along with positions in other departments.  </P> <P> The council tried to obtain funding for 15 more officers last year when it put  a measure on the ballot that would have imposed a 7% utility tax to raise $2.7  million. But the measure was defeated at the polls. All four major candidates  in last April's election called for more police during their campaigns.  </P> <P> It will be about six months before the new officers are on the streets,  Connolly said.  </P> <P> The city will spend about $10 million from its general fund, which is closely  watched because it pays most city salaries. The city should finish the year  with a general fund reserve of $590,000, Chief Administrative Officer Donald L.  Jeffers said.  </P> <P> The rest of the money in the $30-million budget is earmarked to pay for the  cost of operating the municipal water system and the city's dial-a-ride  program, and to maintain city streets, among other things.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, this will give the city the opportunity to begin building an  appropriate reserve," Jeffers told the council in a report.  </P></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Leak reveals government fears on traffic pollution Fumes and noise from the ever-increasing volume of traffic on British roads pose one of the biggest threats to the environment, according to a leaked section of a government strategy document due to be published next week. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, yesterday released the excerpt from UK Strategy for Sustainable Development which Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, is due to issue on Tuesday. The document - part of Britain's commitments to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro - will set out government plans to put the UK on to a more environmental footing in the long term. It aims to curb pollution and waste, and to enable the UK to meet its international treaty obligations to clean up the atmosphere. There will also be plans to preserve animal and plant life and forests. The leak, which contains some proposed final amendments, shows that while the government is worried by the growth of traffic, it also wants to avoid painting the threat in too controversial terms. In an accompanying letter, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, asks Mr Gummer to delete a comment that 'some road construction proposals threaten protected nature sites and other sensitive areas'. He is also unhappy with the statement that traffic growth in some parts of the country 'would produce unacceptable economic and environmental consequences'. The draft says the government will have to produce measures to influence traffic growth. Friends of the Earth said the document showed the government was far from agreed on a sustainable transport policy.</p>

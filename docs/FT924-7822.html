			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Revenue to shed more than 600 staff THE INLAND Revenue is to shed more than 600 staff and close 19 offices in its repayment department because of unexpectedly low demand, Andrew Jack writes. The action has been caused by far lower demand for repayments than it estimated would be needed when the facilities were planned by the Revenue in response to new taxation measures introduced in the past two years. It also follows the 'Next Steps' restructuring programme for the Inland Revenue announced by the chancellor in March this year.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Finance costs behind 53% fall at Polly Peck arm INCREASED financing costs after the collapse of Polly Peck International in late 1990 were responsible for the sharp fall in year-end profits reported by Vestel Electronik, PPI's Turkish consumer electronics subsidiary. Profits after tax for the year to December 31 1991 fell 53 per cent to TL57.5bn (Pounds 6.32m) in spite of a 53 per cent jump in sales to TL1,304bn (Pounds 147m). The results are even worse when set against Turkey's 71 per cent inflation rate in 1991, and reflect the company's continuing cash crisis since the PPI collapse. Vestel is the second largest producer of colour televisions, with a 14 per cent share of the local market. The company floated 18 per cent of its equity in 1990. However, the shares are currently languishing at about TL2,500 compared with their issue price of TL13,250. The company exports about 20 per cent of production. It is also heavily dependent on imported components and was badly hit by the steady depreciation of the Turkish lira during 1991. Before its parent went into administration in October 1991, Vestel relied entirely on PPI for short-term credit, financing its imports through letters of credit. The company negotiated a line of credit with Goldstar, its Korean joint venture partner. In January Vestel raised Dollars 24m (Pounds 13.7m) selling an Istanbul property which was to have been the headquarters of all the PPI Turkish companies. Mr Tahsin Karan, president of Vestel, said that the proceeds would be used as working capital. According to the latest accounts, Vestel still has outstanding trade debts to its parent company of Dollars 11m.</p>

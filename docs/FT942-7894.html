			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Nato's Moscow stance criticised Nato defence ministers will today hear out the co-operation ideas of General Pavel Grachev, their Russian opposite number, amid charges from a prestigious think-tank that the alliance is mistakenly appearing to pander to Moscow. The International Institute for Strategic Studies alleged yesterday that Nato had already made mistakes in its treatment of its erstwhile adversaries. In its annual strategic survey, the think-tank said Nato had clumsily given the impression that its refusal to grant early entry to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic had been motivated by reluctance to upset Russia. 'It was one thing to agree that Russia should have its views considered. It was another to make it appear that the west feared the strong objections expected from Moscow on this question,' the survey said. 'To let it appear that the Russians exercised a veto over Nato's non-existent desire to take these (central European) countries into the fold was a mistake that should not be made again,' it added. Gen Grachev will today lay out Russia's military doctrine, which has been published only in part, and explain Moscow's terms for a more elaborate form of co-operation than the Nato-designed Partnership for Peace programme. Nato has made clear that whatever other arrangements it makes with Moscow, Russia must sign the same basic documents as the 18 countries which already adhere to the PFP.</p>

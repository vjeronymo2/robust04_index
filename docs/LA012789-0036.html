			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A Vietnamese couple was robbed in their home in the 2600 block of Gerald Street  Thursday afternoon, apparently by a team of Vietnamese robbers who were  involved in a similar robbery last week, San Diego police said.  </P> <P> The victims told police they were robbed by four Vietnamese gunmen, who tied  them up and blindfolded them. The robbers, demanding gold, ransacked the house,  destroyed furniture and took $400 to $500 in cash, police spokesman Bill  Robinson said.  </P> <P> The woman, about 45 years old, told police that one robber held a knife to her  throat, cutting her slightly. Her husband, about 55, was kicked. Both were  treated at the scene.  </P> <P> Police believe the robbers are the same ones who barged into a house on Thorn  Street last week, during which one of the robbers held up a baby and threatened  to drop him, then kicked an elderly woman who tried to protect the baby. The  people in that home were from Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> "They are brutal, brutal suspects," Robinson said.  </P></p>

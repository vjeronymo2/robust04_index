			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Center Parcs to build holiday village in France Center Parcs, a subsidiary of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewery and leisure group, is building a holiday village in France at a cost of Pounds 75m. Set in 300 acres of parkland near Sologne in the Loire Valley, the village will comprise villas, a leisure complex, shops and restaurants. It is expected to open in 1993, create 450 full and part-time jobs, and cater for a potential 300,000 visitors a year. Mr James Merrington, corporate affairs director, said approval was expected shortly on a new UK site and negotiations had started with Belgian authorities on another possible development. The Sologne Center Parc will bring to 13 the number of complexes in Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Scottish &amp; Newcastle's leisure division  -which includes the Pontins holiday group - last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 65.5m on turnover of Pounds 300m.</p>

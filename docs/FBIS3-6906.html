The assurance by a senior Daihatsu Motor Co. official  followed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed's complaint Monday that  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. has been slow in transferring its engine  and transmission technology to its Malaysian partners in Proton.    Daihatsu is scheduled to begin producing 660cc minicars  modeled on the Mira in July, initially procuring about 50  percent of parts locally for the "Perodua Kancil" model.    Perodua derives from the second national car maker's Malay  name while kancil (mouse deer) is the car's pet name.    "We hope to achieve the 75 percent local content target in  the Perodua Kancil earlier than the 1997 schedule," Daihatsu  general manager Kentaro Shimizu was quoted as saying by the  national BERNAMA NEWS AGENCY.    "We will increase the transfer of technology from the  production of engines, machinery, parts and transmission systems  gradually to plant construction and the sales area," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  called Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata Thursday morning to  consult on the North Korean nuclear situation and explain the  results of his Russian visit.    Kim called Hata at 9 AM and emphasized that UN sanctions  against North Korea are inevitable if it chooses to go ahead  with its nuclear weapons program, aides said. Reiterating that  Pyongyang's nuclear program must be stopped, the president  sought Japanese cooperation, they said.    Kim briefed the Japanese leader on his telephone  conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton in which they  emphasized tripartite efforts by Seoul, Tokyo and Washington on  sanctions.    Hata responded that Japan acknowledges U.N. sanctions are  unavoidable due to North Korea's attitude and the current  international situation, although it is Tokyo's basic stance to  try and solve the nuclear problem through dialogue.    The prime minister promised the closest cooperation allowed  under the Japanese Constitution on the sanctions in  consultations among Japan, South Korea and the United States,  Kim's spokesman Chu Ton- sik said.    Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa is due in Seoul this  Saturday, and Kim said he will have his Foreign Minister Han  Sung- chu explain to Kakizawa China's stance on the North Korean  nuclear issue.    Han returns later Thursday from Beijing, where he held talks  with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.    Hata said he will have Kakizawa call on President Kim to  discuss many issues.    Kim is expected to call President Clinton soon to brief him  on his Russian visit and to consult again on the North Korean  nuclear situation.</p>

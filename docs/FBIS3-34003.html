'Arafat sent the message through Russia's ambassador to  Tunis  Boris Shchiborin after a meeting Wednesday at PLO headquarters  here.    'Arafat is to meet Israel's chief negotiator Foreign  Minister  Shim'on Peres in Cairo next Monday in a bid to nail down a long  overdue accord on withdrawing Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip  and Jericho, territories earmarked for Palestinian autonomy  under an historic accord signed on September 13.    The troops were supposed to have started pulling out on  December 13, and their withdrawal is scheduled to be complete by  April 13.</p>

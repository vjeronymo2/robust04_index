			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Cooperation" rubric: </F> "Speaker Flies Back From Germany. He Approves Struggle Against  Gangsters"]    [Text] Ivan Rybkin, who has just returned from Germany,  has reproached Boris Yeltsin for his failure to submit a bill on  additions and amendments to the Criminal Procedural Code to the  State Duma before issuing the edict on the struggle against  gangsters was issued. The lower chamber could have "adopted  such a law within one day," the speaker emphasized, calling the  presidential edict "necessary." In so doing, he cited the  experience of other countries and politicians in setting similar  precedents, including that of the United States and Franklin  Roosevelt, who would probably have turned in his grave from  surprise, had he heard Mr. Rybkin's arguments.    It has become clear from the speaker's account of the State  Duma mission's trip to Germany that it worked on matters of  cooperation at three levels: European, interstate, and  interparliamentary. At the meeting with Bundestag President  Rita Suessmuth the two sides discussed cooperation within the  Council of Europe and the CSCE. In particular, Mr. Rybkin  pointed to the possibility that a conflict could have  irreparable consequences because of the UN peacekeeping  mechanism's unwieldiness, and spoke in favor of using the CSCE  mandate in Europe's "hot spots."    As for interstate relations, the main event of the year will  be the withdrawal of Russian troops in August. Mr. Rybkin  pointed out that this matter is very sensitive for Russian  public opinion, adding, however, that when he met with German  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe they managed to reach agreement on  releasing the second part of the credit, sufficient to build  28,000 apartments for Russian servicemen returning to their home  country. The State Duma speaker believes that the pullout of  the Russian troops will be followed by an upswing in  Russian-German cooperation, because both sides are going through  similar processes of renewal.    Strange as it might seem, Vladimir Lukin, chief of the  Committee on International Affairs, was just as optimistic: In  his view, a chill would not serve German interests. Thus both  State Duma leaders echoed the opinion expressed by Helmut Kohl  and Boris Yeltsin last May. Let us hope they are right....    Communication between the parliaments will from now on also  be maintained at the level of their internal structures: An  operational plan of cooperation has been drawn up and direct  contacts between State Duma committees on defense, international  affairs, and organizational matters with their Bundestag  counterparts are envisioned.</p>

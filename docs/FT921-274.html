			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Broadcasts set to open new fronts THE broadcasting war will shift to education and defence this week as Labour attempts to push its plans for schools and training up the agenda and the Conservatives play the leadership card. In a party election broadcast tonight, Labour's film will aim to press the claim that education is as much the party's natural 'winning territory' as the National Health Service. But Tory strategists have heard reports that staff at Walworth Road have again based their arguments on real-life cases, possibly leaving them vulnerable to charges of inaccuracy and distortion. For the Conservatives, a broadcast scheduled for tomorrow will open the new campaign front of defence, to be followed later in the week by a switch to law and order. But the subliminal message will be all about Mr Neil Kinnock. Conscious that 'negative campaigning' is alienating voters - not least Conservative supporters' themselves - the public relations team at Central Office believe they can promote Mr John Major's leadership qualities by highlighting his achievements in the Gulf war and foreign affairs. By pushing Mr Major's record the implicit comparison is with Mr Kinnock and Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary. According to the polls they are less trusted than their counterparts. Reports that Labour has shelved another NHS broadcast were denied yesterday by Mr Bryan Gould, the environment spokesman. But he insisted that health would continue to be a central theme in Labour's campaign. None the less, one senior Labour strategist said that final decisions on the shape of party broadcasts were not being taken until the day they are due to be shown.</p>

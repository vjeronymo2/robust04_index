[President] Mario Soares said this evening that he was saddened  but not at all surprised by the brutality of the Indonesians.  The president of the republic said that he hopes the matter  will now receive greater attention from all those who were  beginning to forget Timor:    [Begin Soares recording] I was very shocked, once again,  although from Indonesia I expect anything. Indonesia is ruled  by a brutal dictatorship and anything they may do in the way of  violence, oppression, and crimes against the individual  surprises me not at all. So I was saddened by what happened  there and was shown in those pictures, but on the other hand I  found it an extraordinary service rendered to the cause of East  Timor by those fearless reporters who managed to capture a  reality that will jolt the conscience of the entire world. And  I hope that today many people who were indifferent to the cause  of East Timor will feel the duty to protest and commit  themselves to the patriots who in East Timor are fighting for  the independence of their country.

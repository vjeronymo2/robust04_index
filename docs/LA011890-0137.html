			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL ACTIVISTS FACE A HARDER FIGHT;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: ACTIVISTS WON AN ASSAULT WEAPON BAN LAST YEAR. BUT THEY ARE NOT  FINDING THE SAME SUPPORT FOR A WAITING PERIOD ON RIFLE AND SHOTGUN SALES.  </P> <P> Activists who last year overcame the fierce opposition of gun-owner  organizations to outlaw assault weapons in the wake of the Stockton schoolyard  murders are finding the political fires harder to relight for a separate  control bill.  </P> <P> The bill for the first time would extend to sporting rifles and shotguns the  15-day waiting period already required for the purchase of a handgun.  </P> <P> In addition, the proposal by Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-Sacramento) seeks to  keep all firearms out of the hands of people who have been involuntarily  committed for mental evaluations and those who have committed gun-related  misdemeanor crimes.  </P> <P> Last summer, the Connelly bill passed the Assembly but failed by seven votes in  the Senate in the final days of the session. At the time, Connelly blamed the  National Rifle Assn. for exerting what he called immense pressure on the  Senate.  </P> <P> Now, Connelly and Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), co-author of  the assault gun legislation, are preparing for a second run at winning in the  Senate. This is an especially difficult task because 1990 is an election year  and legislators are especially chary about gun control issues.  </P> <P> Meantime, the NRA, which boasts that its 280,000 California members "remember  and vote," is lobbying hard to defeat the 15-day waiting-period bill. NRA  lobbyist Brian Judy said members are being urged to contact legislators and  demand a "no" vote.  </P> <P> Judy and other gun-owner representatives assert that the waiting period would  be an unnecessary burden on the law-abiding citizens. They favor a computerized  "instant" background check, a proposal that state officials maintain is not now  feasible.  </P> <P> Roberti indicated on Wednesday that he now counts 19 of the 21 votes needed for  Senate approval of the bill. He said he expects to bring the bill to a vote by  mid-February and secure the other two votes needed by "sort of putting feet to  the fire."  </P> <P> Although legislators for years had tried to ban assault weapons, it was the  murders one year ago of five Stockton schoolchildren by a deranged drifter with  an assault rifle that galvanized public support for a ban on such weapons.  Twenty-nine other students and a teacher were wounded before gunman Patrick  Purdy killed himself with a legally purchased pistol.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian was among those who came out in support of both the  assault gun legislation and the 15-day wait for rifles and shotguns.  </P> <P> But the highly successful coalition of police, teachers, physicians, Los  Angeles neighborhood associations, gun control activists and others who fought  for the assault gun legislation has largely dissolved and moved on to other  priorities.  </P> <P> Officials of the California Medical Assn. and the California Teachers Assn.,  for example, said Wednesday that their groups have not yet taken a position on  the Connelly bill.  </P> <P> Luis Tolley, California director of Handgun Control Inc., said his organization  is "trying to rekindle" the political fires that helped to pave the way for  passage of the assault gun legislation last year and has zeroed in on five key  senators. They are Democrats Wadie Deddeh of Bonita, Dan McCorquodale of San  Jose, Rose Ann Vuich of Dinuba and Republicans Marion Bergeson of Newport Beach  and William Craven of Oceanside.  </P></p>

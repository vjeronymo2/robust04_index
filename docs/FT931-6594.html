			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Birt expected to keep freelance deal at BBC MR JOHN BIRT, who became BBC director-general in January, is likely to continue to be paid as a freelance consultant rather than as an employee, just as he has since joining the corporation in 1987, it emerged yesterday. A senior BBC governor said he did not expect there to be any pressure from the board of governors on Mr Birt to change his status. Financial details of John Birt Productions, a private company owned by Mr Birt and his wife Jane, were disclosed yesterday. Mr Birt's salary from the BBC, believed to be between Pounds 135,000 and Pounds 140,000 in the year to August 1991, was paid gross to his private company. This meant the director-general was able to deduct more than Pounds 30,000 in administrative expenses and pay income tax only on the Pounds 59,000 he was paid by John Birt Productions. Mr Birt has not yet signed a contract with the BBC as director-general but a committee of the board of governors, including Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the chairman, has already agreed that Mr Birt can be paid in his normal way through John Birt Productions. The arrangement is legal and has apparently been accepted by the Inland Revenue. The revelation that Mr Birt is not being paid as a full-time employee of the BBC is, however, likely to be controversial. It is not unusual in the television industry for entertainers, presenters, senior reporters, producers and directors to be paid as freelancers. With the increase in independent production and the growing move to short-term contracts, this is becoming more common. But it is extremely unusual for senior executives of the BBC to be paid in such a way. The BBC said yesterday that no other member of the corporation's board of management was paid as a freelance consultant. That includes Mr Bob Phillis, who arrives soon as deputy director-general. Although there are examples of such practices in ITV - Mr Brian Tesler, the former chief executive of London Weekend Television, is believed to have had such a contract - they are still considered unusual at senior executive level. In the past 10 years, for example, no directors of Thames Television were paid on such a basis. At director level, the trend has been the other way. Share options, which have turned, or are about to turn, many ITV executives into millionaires are difficult to arrange for those not employed directly. Redundancy money is also available only to employees. The BBC said in a statement: 'John Birt has either been a freelance or has contracted his services through his own company on fixed-term contracts for over 20 years. The same contractual arrangements that operated when he was director of programmes at LWT applied when he joined the BBC as deputy director-general.' The arrangement means that Mr Birt will almost certainly be paying less income tax than many of his subordinates. The Inland Revenue said it would not comment on any individual's tax affairs, Andrew Jack writes. But it said there was an official in every tax office charged with determining whether individuals should be permitted to be registered to pay tax as self-employed. It is far easier to gain tax deductions under Schedule D, the tax system for the self-employed, than it is using the pay-as-you-earn system. Many allowances against tax - such as entertainment - are permitted if they are a legitimate part of the business. Under PAYE, by contrast, only items which are 'wholly, necessarily and exclusively' work-related can be claimed against tax.</p>

He said the Russian Constitution requires two thirds of  votes  to adopt a law. According to the Fundamental Law, regular laws  should be adopted by the majority of State Duma deputies, which  is 223 Duma members in its current composition.    A law can be returned for improvement if the upper  parliament  chamber does not approve it or the law is vetoed by the  president. The veto can be annulled by only two thirds of votes.  Thus, the deputies should learn to overcome faction differences.    "The State Duma may be turned by the opponents into a  useless  body, and the constitution carries a mechanism of its  dissolution," said the vice-premier.    He is sure the lower parliament chamber should turn into a  "normal efficient body and abandon extremism". Cold War  elements evident in the very second day of Duma functioning  should be stopped. "If the Duma manages to overcome faction  ambitions and learns to predict behavior of the upper chamber,  it will be able to influence the legislative power," he stressed.    Shokhin stated with regret some factions did not manage to  protect interests of the Duma minority. A proposal to organize  20- deputy factions was voted down. The vice-premier expressed  the assurance the more independent territorial deputy groups are  formed they would be considered potentially conciliatory  mechanisms.    In the opinion of the vice-premier, some small factions have  agreed with large ones on certain distribution of posts in the  lower chamber. "This cannot be viewed as a mere expression of  will, it is rather a normal parliamentary agreement between  factions. It is a good lesson to other parties in the ability  to reach an agreement," said Shokhin.</p>

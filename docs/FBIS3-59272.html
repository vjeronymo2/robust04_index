			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article with overall responsibility by Wu Jinglian (0702 </F> 2417 6969): "Suggestions for Accelerating Financial Reform"]    [Text] The 14th CPC National Congress unequivocally made  the establishment of a socialist market economy China's  paramount goal. To achieve this goal, it is imperative that we  urgently speed up economic structural reform to resolve the  deep-seated underlying contradictions in economic development in  China. As a key link in the economic system, the financial  system is enormously significant for the development and  stability of the national economy. Since the beginning of the  year, runaway economic growth has been accompanied by  over-investment, soaring prices, a money supply that has been  expanding excessively, and disorder in the financial sector. All  of that shows that problems in the financial system have become  the bottleneck impeding the sustained and stable development of  the entire national economy. The only fundamental solution is to  accelerate and intensify the reform of the financial system.  <H3>  I. Underlying Structural Root Causes of Current Financial  Plight and Its Effects on the Macroeconomy </H3>   The problems in the financial system are wide-ranging. Here  we will limit ourselves to an analysis of the more important  ones that impact macroeconomic regulation and control.    A. The People's Bank of China does not have clearly defined  objectives and functions. Its tools of regulation and control  are obsolete and its organization and financial system are  irrational.    1) For years the People's Bank of China has consistently  pursued a dual-objective -- economic growth and a stable  currency -- monetary policy, with emphasis on the former. This  has resulted in constant conflicts with the fight against  inflation. With the People's Bank putting fast economic growth  first, not only do policymakers have trouble knowing how far  they can properly go in using the monetary policy to stimulate  economic growth while avoiding inflation and economic  boom-and-bust, but the optimal allocation of resources is also  out of the question.    2) Generally speaking, the primary function of the People's  Bank is to regulate and control the money supply and ensure the  safety of the banking system. Nowadays, however, the People's  Bank has taken up the responsibility of adjusting the economic  structure while failing to set quantitative management standards  for the assets risk and mobility requirements of specialized  banks or to carry out stringent inspection. Instead it has  limited itself to using administrative orders to put forward  general policy demands. The result is a steady decline in the  quality of the assets of China's banking industry even as the  industry is becoming a more and more risky business.    3) Although the central bank has adopted a number of  indirect  regulatory and control tools since reform began, they have not  been used to good effect because of the constraints of external  conditions and the push of internal interests. Many loopholes  still exist. The old reliance on quota management continues.  Moreover, the lending management is lax and interest rates are  not used flexibly enough for leverage.    4) At present branches of the People's Bank are set up at  each level of the hierarchy of administrative divisions. On the  one hand, this puts the central bank under enormous pressure  from the local governments. Power tends to be fragmented and  localism is a major problem, which militates against the effort  by the central bank to assert its authority and independence. On  the other hand, the People's Bank meddles in the operations of  the branches of specialized banks level after level, breaking up  the integrity of specialized banks. This does nothing to help  the big banks discharge their responsibilities. Nor does it  facilitate macroeconomic regulation and control.    5) The central bank these days is an unwieldy massive  organization plagued by financial problems. Branches of the  People's Bank are forced to pay the workers' wages and benefits  out of retained net income, a situation out of step with the  general practice in the world, where the central bank of a  nation is independent and removed from profits. As a result,  government administration and enterprise management are  inseparable in the People's Bank, which has lost its  impartiality and there is a built-in credit expansion mechanism.    B. In specialized banks government administration and  enterprise management are merged. There is no autonomy for  credit activities within the prescribed limits while credit  activities outside these limits lack effective discipline.    1) Right now specialized banks discharge both policy-making  and commercial responsibilities. There is confusion over their  goals. Responsibilities are ill-defined. On the one hand, the  policy-making function is not assured. On the other hand, the  commercial risk they take and losses they incur as commercial  entities are masked by their policy-making function. This works  against both their operations as commercial ventures and the  realization of their policy-making goal.    2) Specialized banks have interest motivation and a credit  expansion mechanism without, however, a corresponding risk  restraint mechanism. On the one hand, there are no funds to make  loans in the plan, On the other hand, they continue to extend  more and more loans in the form of through inter-bank lending.  On the ne hand, the state strictly controls the level of  interest rates and the difference in interest rates between one  trade and the next. On the other hand, because of the acute  demand for funds on the money market, grassroots branches of  specialized banks and credit managerial personnel have in effect  been extending loans at higher interest rates. The difference in  interest rates translates into a huge loss. The covertness of  the real interest rates has caused the unhealthy tendency to run  rampant.    3) There is a rising demand for specialized banks to become  comprehensive multi-function entities, yet the state does not  have a coherent management system for each industry or trade. As  a result, credit funds are being transferred in large  quantities, sometimes causing destructive competition.    C. The financial market has gotten more mature but there is  disorder in the market and its development has been irregular.    1) What is lacking is a clear set of rules defining who  should be the principal players in the financial market. Even  when regulations exist, they are not strictly enforced.  Investors which should not enter a certain type of market do so  anyway. Case in point: enterprises entering the market for  inter-bank lending.    2) The market has lost its original meaning and is becoming  a  credit market outside the banks characterized by excessively  long maturing periods and overly high interest rates.    3) The enterprise bonds market is not standardized and does  not operate in the open. All sorts of internal fund-raising  takes place in a chaotic manner and on an inflated scale.  Supervision by the market is ineffectual.    4) With no support from the banking system, the national  debt  market has yet to put together a national debt market operating  mechanism that integrates the banks closely with public finance.  Some actions by the treasury on the market have affected the  reputation of national debt. Today the national debt market is  in a bind.    5) Fund prices on the entire financial market are distorted  and the market is disorderly. Official interest rates are too  low, undermining the stability of the macroeconomy. Nominally  all interest rates are planned interest rates. In fact what is  in effect are market interest rates.    It is clear from the above analysis that China's current  financial system amounts to a formidable barrier to any effort  to ensure sustained and stable economic growth while maintaining  the total size of the economy on an even keel by fully utilizing  all the tools of macroeconomic regulation and control. A  particularly striking problem in recent years is this. Against  the general backdrop of local economic management, the entire  banking system shows signs of returning to the traditional  system of the People's Bank controlling everything. What is  happening is that with their control over funds, branches of the  People's Bank set up level after level to coincide with the  hierarchy of administrative divisions have been engaging in  commercial activities on their own. Moreover, they have been  giving orders to local branches of specialized banks when it  comes to funds, thus severing the integrity of specialized  banks. In addition, most of them having adopted the retained net  income system, local branches of the People's Bank have a strong  profit-driven incentive to expand re-lending and special lending  by the central bank. An inevitable product of this system is a  mechanism for expanding credit, forcing the central government  to keep pumping money into the money supply at the grassroots  level, which, in turn, results in the excessive growth of the  money supply and spawns new inflation. This tendency to lose  control locally on the financial front leads to organizational  over-staffing and widespread inefficiency. We can see that if we  do not end this system, the pernicious boom-and-bust cycle will  keep on repeating itself and the stabilization of the  macroeconomy will become just empty talk.  <H3>  II. Objectives for Financial System Reform During the Ninth  Five-Year Plan </H3>   To create a favorable environment for the rapid and stable  development of the national economy, we must speed up the pace  of financial reform starting today and go all out to complete  the reform of the financial system before the end of the Ninth  Five-Year Plan, creating the rudiments of a modern financial  system that is structurally sound and operates efficiently.    The goals of reforming the financial system during the Ninth  Five-Year Plan are:    A. The complete unification of the goals of the monetary  policy of the People's Bank. The central bank should keep a  tight lid on the money supply mainly by effecting macroeconomic  financial regulation and control through the regulation and  control of basic money and base interest rates. Replace  mandatory quota management with window guidance. Reorganize the  People's Bank structurally. Ultimately, it shall be streamlined  into a system consisting of the headquarters, regional branches,  and local currency control and supervisory bureaus.    B. Complete the transformation of the operating mechanism of  specialized banks now under way, turning those banks into  genuine commercial banks. The distribution of the branches of  specialized banks should coincide with that of economic regions.  Be consistent with international practices in the financial and  accounting systems and methods of operations. The main  commercial banking groups should go after internationalization.    C. Complete the establishment of a bank with policy-making  responsibilities and run it properly. At the same time, the  People's Bank should give up its function of regional economic  regulation and that of regulating the industrial structure.  Lower the mandatory deposit reserve rate as appropriate.    D. Establish a standardized nationally unified financial  structure and extend the reach of the existing stock exchange.  Launch the financial futures business across the board and  provide good financial services for the development of  commodities futures trading. Speed up financial law-making.  Regularize the currency market, stock market, bond market,  credit market, and insurance market in accordance with the law,  forming an orderly financial market.    E. Complete the reform of the foreign exchange system. Put  together a standardized foreign exchange market. Make the  renminbi essentially convertible in international payments and  trade.  <H5>  III. Procedures for Reforming the Financial System </H5>   Looking at the underlying structural causes of the financial  predicament that China is in today, we can see that the People's  Bank controlling everything and losing control at the local  level are the main forces working against macroeconomic  stability. The key to successful financial reform, therefore, is  to steadfastly focus on the People's Bank and stick to a  dual-level banking system. To achieve the goal of reforming the  financial system before the Ninth Five-Year Plan ends, our  philosophy of reform and actual reform measures now and in the  near future must help prevent organizationally the localities  from interfering in the economy, thus hurting the macroeconomy,  as is happening today:    A. Emergency measures    To dampen runaway investment fever, check inflation, and  ensure sustained and steady economic growth, we must now take a  string of emergency measures. The crux of our emergency response  is to redirect the flow of funds back into the banks and tighten  credit and the basic money supply, thereby easing payment  difficulties.    1) The People's Bank should immediately reassert control  over  funds while decentralizing organizational, operational, and  managerial responsibilities. Specifically, its head office  should take back from its branches at all levels the control  over funds. In the future the People's Bank should limit the  objects of its re-lending to the head offices of specialized  banks. There should be no more re-lending from the People's Bank  to nonbank financial institutions. Loans already issued must be  paid off within a set period. In view of transitional  requirements, procurement funds for agricultural byproducts this  year should be handled in a special way. At the same time, the  responsibilities of specialized banks and other financial  institutions should be decentralized to the People's Bank at the  provincial and municipal levels.    2) The People's Bank should gradually end its present de  facto function of regulating funds between different specialized  banks and different regions. No longer will branches of the  People's Bank at all levels manage the deposit reserve fund of  the branches of specialized banks. Nor will they continue to  help out branches of the specialized banks at the grassroots  level by shifting money around to solve their payments  difficulties. The headquarters of a specialized bank should  tighten its management of the provision fund of the entire bank  along with its responsibility for fund regulation within the  bank. All specialized banks must maintain their provision fund  above 5 percent. Should a situation occur where payment is not  ensured, we must firmly investigate the culpability of the bank  president in order to protect the reputation of the bank and  social stability. Hold the specialized bank accountable for  payment.    3) By strictly controlling the scale of lending and sorting  out funds, the People's Bank should immediately regulate and  control the operating system of basic money in accordance with  the increase in the money supply. All financial institutions  must purchase a specified amount of treasury bonds depending on  the total volume of deposits they have received. Instead of  using credit as the only way to regulate the size of the basic  money supply, we should gradually switch to a variety of  instruments, including treasury bonds, the mortgaged trading of  the financial bonds issued by the policy-making bank, bills  rediscounted, and unsecured discounted loans.    4) Further raise the interest rates on loans and deposits.  Such a move will boost savings, speed up the withdrawal of money  from circulation, and slow down the expansion of the M1.  Moreover, it will cut down on the amount of idle social funds  and will successfully lower the level of market interest rates.  For the short haul, it is proposed that the interest rate on  one-year bank savings deposits be raised to 10 to 12 percent,  and that the interest rate on one-year loans be raised to 12 to  15 percent.    5) Speed up the development of a policy-making bank and a  system for making policy-based investment and short-term loans.  Everything must be done to complete the creation of a national  long-term development credit bank and import/export specialized  bank within the year and the establishment of an agricultural  policy bank next year. In the period before the policy-making  bank opens for business, we must introduce special account  management to the policy-based lines of business of specialized  banks. The policy-making bank must adhere to the principles of  paying back principal with interest and not making a profit.  Guided by the national industrial policy and planning, the  policy-making bank must exercise decision-making authority in  its operations and assume risk on its own. By inviting bids on  the market, it should contract out certain functions to be  performed by commercial financial institutions.    6) The People's Bank, including the head office and its  branches at all levels, should immediately sever ties with the  for-profit financial institutions, investment companies, and  other businesses that it had set up. For the time being, at  least, it should sever all personnel and financial links with  those institutions as soon as possible.    7) Improve the lending quota management system within the  People's Bank. Announce this year that in the future the amount  of lending a specialized bank can make in any given year will be  determined by its share of the liabilities of the entire banking  system for the preceding year. The idea is to make the  distribution of lending quotas less arbitrary.    8) At a time when the relations between public finance and  banks have not been straightened out, give the central bank  special permission this year to issue bonds to finance  short-term loans in order to regulate cash flow between banks.  In the future, we should develop the central bank's open market  business through established procedures. In view of the fact  that this year the treasury has stopped making overdrafts on the  People's Bank or asking for advances from it, the treasury bonds  purchased by the various financial institutions should be  counted as part of the lending for this year. In the future,  adjust the scale of lending as necessary.    9) Handle the host of major and serious illegal fund-raising  cases promptly. Educate the public about the risk of different  financial instruments. Announce to the public through government  orders that fund-raising schemes, bonds, and stocks unauthorized  by the financial agencies in charge will not be protected under  the law. Also, liberalize the conditions for the proper issue of  shares. Simplify examination and approval procedures. Speed up  the examination and approval process.    10) The state should put some of the publicly held shares on  the market in the coming months. At the same time it should  speed up the examination and approval of new shares for which  conditions are ripe so that they could be traded on the market  soon. Increase the supply of shares on the market. Curb share  over-pricing and dampen stock fever as appropriate.    B. Financial Reform in the Near Future, Last Two Years of  Eighth Five-Year Plan    1) Reorganize the People's Bank. In the near term, we may  consider setting up a branch in each economic region. Next, we  may phase out the bank branches at the county, prefectural,  municipal, and provincial levels in stages. Meanwhile we should  set up banking supervisory and control bureaus in the various  localities if necessary, all under the leadership of the  People's Bank. The branches of the People's Bank in the major  regions are to be responsible for monitoring the monetary policy  and the buying and selling of national debt. The function of the  banking supervisory and control bureau is to supervise and  monitor the financial institutions registered in the local  jurisdiction and conduct economic studies and research. As part  of the reorganization of the People's Bank, we should hive off  the bank's existing financial services, forming independent  yunchao companies and clearing centers. In addition, we should  set up a nation-wide commercial bank to accommodate the  personnel made redundant by the reorganization of the People's  Bank. In general, offices and departments within the People's  Bank should be set up to discharge macroeconomic regulatory and  control responsibilities.    2) After the existing nation-wide banks -- the Bank of  China,  Industrial and Commercial Bank, and the Agricultural Bank --  have turned over their policy-making function to the newly  created policy-making bank, they should be downsized as  appropriate. By centralizing managerial powers, these banks  should live up to the role of major banks. The various  specialized banks may be organized into a number of  comprehensive banking groups under the industry-specific  management of the state. The methods of operations of these  groups as well as their management system must be consistent  with international practices. Both the Construction Bank and  China Investment Bank should also transfer their policy-making  function to the newly created policy-making bank and then be  reorganized as a pair of long-term credit commercial banks.    Set up an urban cooperative bank and a rural cooperative  bank, both as local commercial banks, and put the currency  supervisory and management bureau in charge of their  registration and supervision. All branches of the urban  cooperative bank and rural cooperative bank at all levels shall  be independent legal persons. Below the head office , branches  of the urban cooperative bank should be set up at just two  levels -- grass roots and municipal -- down to the prefectural  municipal levels. Branches of the rural cooperative bank would  go up to the municipal level only, at three levels -- municipal,  county, and township -- altogether. The rural cooperative fund  should be transformed into a genuine community fund and mutual  aid organization.    Develop regional commercial banks as appropriate. Besides  the  several already in existence along the southeastern coast, a few  more may be set up in the northeast and in central and western  China. Income taxes to be paid by these banks shall be  considered central taxes. The People's Bank shall not make  short-term loans to them.    3) Abolish the retained net income system for the branches  of  the People's Bank at all levels. The financial system of the  People's Bank should be modelled on the "Financial System for  Financial and Insurance Enterprises" and its profits should be  turned over to the Ministry of Finance. The wages and benefits  standards of the People's Bank must be reformed based on the  level in financial enterprises. The necessary wage and benefits  expenses should come out of the Ministry of Finance.    4) Set up a board of supervisors for state banks to monitor  the utilization of state capital and preserve and increase its  value. In the future, banks should be allowed to go bankrupt  under the law, with mergers and acquisitions being the best  option so as to ensure the orderly transfer of the assets and  liabilities of the bank going under. While the People's Bank  will no longer interfere in the personnel arrangements of the  branches of specialized banks and commercial banks, it must  strictly supervise and evaluate their business activities, being  authorized to take disciplinary actions against the violators of  banking laws and regulations, which specialized banks and  commercial banks must comply with as a rule.    5) Establish a mechanism whereby the central bank can  flexibly utilize the base interest rates to regulate the  supply-demand of funds. The central bank must be swift in  adjusting the interest rates paid by specialized banks on  deposits and the range within which they are allowed to  fluctuate in light of the objectives of macroeconomic regulation  and control and the supply-demand of funds.    6) We should waste no time in giving specialized banks the  power to set the interest rates they charge borrowers within a  set range. Gradually translate the decision-making authority of  specialized banks and commercial banks into a reality, enabling  them to exercise autonomy in their operations within legally  prescribed limits, including the power over personnel, financial  resources, materials, deposits, lending, and foreign exchange,  as well as the power to pursue new lines of business. Commercial  banks should introduce management by the assets:liabilities  ratio and establish assets risk management and a bad debt  reserve system. Commercial banks must adopt international  practices when it comes to the financial and accounting systems,  methods of operations, and management system. They should create  a practical and feasible self-restraint mechanism and risk  responsibility mechanism.    7) The People's Bank should intensify the risk management of  the assets of specialized banks. Formulate effective methods  with binding force to evaluate the quality of bank loans. Modify  the mix of assets and liabilities of specialized banks.    8) Adhere to the principle of industry-based management. A  strict separation system should be applied to the personnel,  finance, funds, and information of the stock, securities, trust,  and insurance companies set up by banks and various agencies.  They must be registered separately, operate independently, be  responsible for their own profits and losses, and assume the  risk themselves.    9) Speed up the creation of a People's Bank satellite  clearing network. Establish a clearing center with a membership  system to take up such tasks as bank clearing and mail  remittances clearing.</p>

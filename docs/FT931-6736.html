			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Investment Trusts Buyers of investment trust shares have often worried about the industry's unhealthy cosiness. Although, in theory, there are clear divisions of responsibility between directors and managers, such distinctions have often become blurred. Conflicts of interest result. Directors should act solely in the best interests of shareholders and replace poorly-performing managers. But this is difficult when directors and managers are the same. Trickier still when the trust is named after the management group which happens to be a big shareholder. To its credit, the industry is trying to address the problem. In the wake of the Cadbury Committee report on corporate governance, the Association of Investment Trust Companies has published guidelines on best practice. These suggest a trust's board should have a majority of independent directors. It is also desirable for the chairman to be independent. Many older investment trusts already have well-developed checks and balances. The main worry concerns the host of new investment trusts which have sprung up in recent years. In its annual study of the sector, NatWest Securities worryingly finds that almost half the directors on the boards of the 117 investment trusts launched since 1986 are closely linked with management groups. It argues that the AITC's recommendations do not go far enough, suggesting there should be no managers on the board at all - apart, perhaps, from the managing director. However, the ultimate sanction will always remain with shareholders. Either they shun those trusts failing to comply with best practice, or they replace the directors.</p>

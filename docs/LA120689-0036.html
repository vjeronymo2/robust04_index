			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECH REGION FORMS COALITION CABINET;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: NINE OF THE 17 MEMBERS NAMED IN THE INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND ARE NOT  COMMUNISTS.  </P> <P> The biggest of Czechoslovakia's two administrative regions Tuesday announced  the country's first non-Communist governing body in more than 40 years as  negotiations intensified to form a new Cabinet at the national level.  </P> <P> The opposition group Civic Forum welcomed the regional Czech Lands government's  new Cabinet, nine of whose 17 members are non-Communists.  </P> <P> The Czech Lands, which include Bohemia, Moravia and the capital, Prague,  constitute roughly two-thirds of the country's population and its industrial  heartland.  </P> <P> "We consider it a step in the right direction," Civic Forum spokesman Jiri  Diestbier said.  </P> <P> He said Civic Forum had specifically endorsed eight members of the new  government, including the Communist minister of culture, Milan Lucas, who is  head of drama at the National Theater.  </P> <P> However, Diestbier added that the makeup still did not "accurately reflect the  balance of political sentiments in society" and echoed calls for adding still  more non-Communists and taking the sensitive Interior Ministry out of Communist  hands. The police come under that ministry.  </P> <P> The country's other region, Slovakia, remains under Communist control.  </P> <P> Both regional and national-level Cabinets are seen as interim governments  responsible mainly for preparing Czechoslovakia's first free elections since  the 1940s. The opposition demanded that the elections be held before next July.  </P> <P> While diplomats cautioned against viewing the Czech formula as a direct model  for a national Cabinet, they said the new balance represents a significant  change by the Communists since they announced their first attempt at a national  government last Sunday.  </P> <P> News last Sunday that only five of 21 national Cabinet jobs went to  non-Communists in the new government brought renewed mass demonstrations, a  deadline of next Sunday for a new government and the threat of a general strike  Monday if the deadline is not met.  </P> <P> Talks on a new Cabinet resumed almost immediately.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, a government team headed by Communist Prime Minister Ladislav  Adamec met for several hours in Prague with a Civic Forum delegation that  included its most prominent figure, playwright Vaclav Havel.  </P> <P> The recently appointed head of Czechoslovak television, Miroslav Pavel, who  participated in the negotiations, described them as "very complicated."  </P> <P> Students maintained a vigil Tuesday outside the main government office block in  Prague. They held signs and called for the resignation of the  Communist-dominated Cabinet.  </P> <P> Civic Forum has asked for a caretaker government made up mainly of  professionals and technocrats, while the Communists are attempting to retain  control despite the groundswell of opposition to their continued rule.  </P> <P> However, those involved in the talks said that simply finding qualified  non-Communists has become a major problem. As in other Communist countries,  party membership has been a virtual prerequisite for advancement.  </P> <P> The opposition has also been handicapped in nominating people for key jobs  because its leaders have been isolated from the mainstream of society for two  decades.  </P> <P> An opposition negotiator said that during talks Monday, Deputy Prime Minister  Bohumil Urban complained about the difficulties of finding people outside the  party.  </P> <P> "They simply don't know the names," the negotiator said.  </P> <P> When asked about competent people in the small Peoples and Socialist parties,  which were allowed to survive as minor parties during the period of  unchallenged Communist rule, Urban reportedly said, "You know what we did to  them in the last 40 years."  </P> <P> After initially refusing to provide names for possible government positions,  Civic Forum has proposed some individuals.  </P> <P> The predicament in part reflects the sheer speed of political change in  Czechoslovakia, which in less than three weeks has moved from communism to the  present search for a coalition government.  </P> <P> Previously, few in the party hierarchy saw either the need or the interest in  contacts outside their privileged circle, while opposition leaders were  isolated at the other end of the political spectrum.  </P> <P> The hard-line Communist regime was swept from office by mass protests last  month.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, a special parliamentary commission officially blamed the disgraced  former party secretary, Milos Jakes, and former Prague party boss Miroslav  Stepan for the incident that triggered those protests -- vicious police  violence against a peaceful student protest in the capital on Nov. 17.  </P> <P> The Czechoslovak news agency CTK quoted the commission as declaring that the  two "carry direct political responsibility for the events of Nov. 17. . . ."  </P> <P> Both men were dropped from the Communist Party's ruling Politburo under intense  pressure from protesters. Now the commission has recommended that they be  stripped of their Parliament seats.  </P> <P> Six senior police officers have also been dismissed, CTK said.  </P> <P> The ramifications of recent events have begun to take their toll on the party  itself.  </P> <P> Since Nov. 17, more than 20,000 of the party's 1.7 million members have  resigned their membership, including 10% of the Prague party, according to  party Central Committee spokesman Jozef Hora.  </P> <P> Last week, the National Assembly voted to abolish the party's leading role in  society. The impact of that action is already visible.  </P> <P> Party leader Karel Urbanek's meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  in Moscow was displayed only in the party newspaper Rude Pravo.  </P></p>

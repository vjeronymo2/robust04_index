			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Wine: Drinking by numbers - How a grasp of figures can help you choose wine BRITISH connoisseurs tend to be wary of mixing numbers and wine. Unlike so many of our slavish American counterparts, we rather disapprove of buying something as subjective as wine on the basis of scores out of 100 allotted by other palates, however glorified. There is one way however that a keen grasp of numbers can steer consumers towards wine quality. It has nothing to do with maths but quite a lot to do with geography, the geography of France in particular. With characteristic logic, the French number their equivalent of counties, departements, alphabetically. Thus, the first two digits of a French postcode or the last two digits of a car numberplate, exactly pinpoint a specific area of the blessed hexagone. A keen student of licence plates such as myself delights in spotting a driver from Ain by his 01, or one from Aisne by his 02. Perhaps more usefully, knowledge of a few key departement numbers can greatly help the interpretation of wine labels - particularly those on the legion of increasingly impressive bottlings from France's less famous wine regions - Vin de Pays des Coteaux des Collines Inconnues and the like. This struck me forcibly as I was trying a line-up of new Chardonnays the other day. I began with a sad, feeble little thing called Domaine de Collin Rozier (about Pounds 3.50 in Tesco). Like so many cheap wines carrying the name of today's most fashionable grape variety, it was a Chardonnay in name only and bore no tasteable relationship to the cool steeliness of Chablis, the concentration of great white burgundy or the lush Chardonnays of California, Australia and New Zealand. It was simply a neutral, dry white wine with more or less the same characteristics as an ordinary white vin de table. It was labelled as a Vin de Pays d'Oc, a country wine from the Languedoc in southern France, and according to the back label came from 'the largest mature Chardonnay vineyard in the south of France.' Maybe they planted a less-than-brilliant clone, maybe the vines were encouraged to be too productive to be capable of producing a wine of much character, but it was a number on the label that gave me the major clue to the wine's mass-produced character. 'Bottled by G Badriou,' it said (so far, so good), followed by '69220'. Aha] The telltale 69 is the call sign of the Rhone departement which includes Lyons and much of Beaujolais with its many near-industrial wine bottlers. G Badriou may sound like a charming one-man band, but I bet it is one of many names used by a pretty big bottling plant that ships in wine by tanker from all over France. In my experience, the further from the vineyard a wine is bottled, the more character and integrity is sacrificed. The numbers of the departements that are actually in the Languedoc, as opposed to hundreds of miles up the motorway, are from east to west 30 for Gard, 34 for the sprawling Herault, 11 for Aude and Roussillon, south towards the Spanish border, is 66 for Pyrenees Orientales (where Oddbins have found a really characterful peachy, lightly oaked Cotes du Roussillon Blanc 1988 from the Rivesaltes co-operative, at 66600, for just Pounds 4.49, a good price for so much culinary useful power and balance). The next Chardonnay I tried was at the very opposite end of the character spectrum and proudly bore the code 34530 showing it was indeed raised and bottled in the Herault departement of the Languedoc, at the Domaine St Martin de la Garrigue, a Vin de Pays des Coteaux de Bessilles, if that leaves you any wiser. I tasted the 1989 vintage which is now sold out and is being replaced by a 1990 that is presumably even more powerful and which Adnams of Southwold should be selling at Pounds 5.95 from next month or so. Adnams' wine buyer Simon Loftus is famously keen on wines with character and this one oozed it. At 13.2 per cent alcohol it was about as potent as a Montrachet and almost as ambitious. With aromas of butterscotch restrained by hints of green fruit, this wild wine left me impressed but wondering rigid quality control parameters of, say, Marks &amp; Spencer. It is probably their loss although I suspect that St Martin's owner Monsieur Henry, who describes himself on the label as a 'vigneron-eleveur', was better at the first, outdoor half of the job in 1989. The property is certainly one to watch. The third Chardonnay was my favourite of the line-up and came from an even more obscure departement in wine terms. Domaine de Ribonnet 1989 (Pounds 5.99 Oddbins) is from 31 which makes it a Vin de Pays de la Haute Garonne produced south of Toulouse in what is almost terra incognita of the vine. Made by the ambitious winemaker of nearby Chateau Montauriol, one of Fronton's beefier representatives, this Chardonnay seems well worth its premium over the mass production Tesco model. It is made on a lavishly maintained Swiss-owned property from 12-year-old vines with yields well below Burgundian levels. It too notches up 13' of alcohol and has lovely ripe Chardonnay flavours, a little cooler and cleaner than St Martin's, and with a fair old whack of new but fairly restrained oak. It reminded me of nothing so much as one of the best cuvees of oak-matured Chardonnay from Limoux (code number 11 for Aude)  -which is perhaps not surprising since the Domaine de Ribonnet, like Limoux, is on the south-western cusp of Atlantic and Mediterranean climates. My line-up ended with two further examples of Chardonnay as she is typically wrought at the moment, a lush Australian and a wildly overpriced Burgundian. Oases of real quality and value are undoubtedly to be found in the French regions at the moment, but you may need a map, a good memory and the list below to identify them from the label. Be wary of wines whose bottlers' codes begin with 76 for Rouen or 75, 78 or 91 for Greater Paris. These will have been shipped north in bulk and may well have shed some of their character and guts en route.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            MAJOR FRENCH WINE PRODUCING DEPARTEMENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wine region                   Departement           Code  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Champagne                     Marne                   51 Alsace                        Haut-Rhin               68                               Bas-Rhin                67 Burgundy Chablis                       Yonne                   89 Heartland                     Cote d'Or               21 Cote Chalonnaise              Saone-et-Loire          71 Maconnais Beaujolais                    Rhone                   69 Rhone/Provence North                         Drome                   26 South and W Provence          Bouches-du-Rhone        13 E Provence                    Var                     83 Languedoc-Roussillon Languedoc                     Gard                    30                               Herault                 34                               Aude                    11 Roussillon                    Pyrenees-Orientales     66 Bordeaux                      Gironde                 33 Loire Muscadet                      Loire-Atlantique        44 Anjou-Saumur                  Maine-et-Loire          49 Touraine                      Indres-et-Loire         37                               Loir-et-Cher            41 Sancerre                      Cher                    18 Pouilly-Fume                  Nievre                  58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

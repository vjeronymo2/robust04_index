			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Bringing the mutineers aboard THE Danish white paper on Maastricht is an exercise in imprecision aimed at reassuring domestic public opinion. Now comes the hard part: how to find a solution acceptable to the Danes and their 11 EC partners which will bring the mutineers back on board. In Brussels yesterday, senior officials and diplomats were scouring the white paper for hints on what precisely the Danes are demanding before they submit the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum early next year. Few underestimate the hurdles ahead. 'The outcome is by no means a foregone conclusion,' an EC ambassador said. Items on the Danish list are easily identified: an assurance that Danes will not be required to join a putative European army; an opt-out clause, similar to the UK's, on a future European monetary union; assurances that Denmark's high standards on the environment and social policy will not suffer in a future European Union; and a general desire for more openness and less centralisation in Community affairs. The pessimistic view in Brussels is that the Danes will reach a political consensus at home and falsely assume that this fact alone will be enough to press their European partners into line - underestimating the huge task of reaching unanimity among the 11. Another fear is that the Danes will frame their demands in language which amounts to a renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty - a position which all 11 agree is not possible (not least because no-one wants to endure a second round of ratification battles on a modified Maastricht). 'It all comes down to the words,' said a senior European diplomat. A more optimistic view is that the Danes will opt for self-restraint. This would allow their partners to come up with a political declaration which would seek to remove unfounded Danish fears. Such a declaration could, for example, state clearly that 'there is no obligation - in legal terms - on defence matters.' Similar references to existing EC treaty law would probably suffice on citizenship, the environment, and social policy, said a senior EC official. However, an opt-out on monetary union, if pursued by the Danes and agreed by the 11, would almost certainly need a treaty-amending protocol, says a senior EC official. In the end, it comes down to a political calculation: how much a moody 11 are prepared to forgive the upstart Danes in the interests of EC unity. Next week's EC summit in Birmingham will offer the first clues.</p>

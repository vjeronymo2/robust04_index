			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Gift aid donations rise - At a Glance Gift Aid donations by individuals rose in December 1993 to Pounds 31.9m compared with Pounds 25.5m the preceeding December. The total amount raised in the three years to December 1993 is Pounds 588.6m, of which Pounds 334.4m was provided by individuals. Gift Aid is designed for one-off donations to charity, which are treated as net of basic rate income tax. This means a gift of Pounds 250 becomes Pounds 333 in the hands of the charity. The reduction of the minimum qualifying gift to Pounds 250, since last year, has encouraged greater use of the scheme.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH LERE'S SCULPTURES  </P> <P> Transforming the gallery into a suggestive, but always enigmatic narrative,  Mark Lere's latest sculptures at Margo Leavin Gallery make a game of reading  visual language. Instead of cyclone stacks these are abstract objects haunted  by vaguely familiar secrets. Some hint at figurative form, others at  utilitarian objects like dumbbells, umbrellas or saddles. Still others recall  Lere's familiar mobius strip tea cups. They recycle their own emptiness.  Hovering close to recognition, they all breed a certain cozy familiarity, but  taken together they build toward an organic, vaguely ominous game of  strangeness and manipulation.  </P> <P> Lere's objects are refined, purist abstractions with possible philosophic or  psychological underpinnings. They are also playful. Nearly all of the 19 pieces  in this exhibit are made of a different material: cork, felt, bronze, aluminum,  copper or cast rubber. Shifts in color, surface and weight coupled with wildly  changing scale and construction techniques give each piece its own identity.  It's a fluid identity, however, as moving among the works seems to alter their  meaning with each new perspective.  </P> <P> Lere has the ability to make an encounter with sculpture into a physical  reality rife with intellectual ramifications. Although he strongly suggests the  work of Barry Le Va, Lere has a more narrative agenda. Yet it is a narrative  written in the observer as Lere crosses geometry's pure reason with the  unsettling openness of the unconscious.  </P> <P>  Margo Leavin Gallery, 812 N. Robertson Blvd., to Saturday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Megan Williams taps into a personal unconscious; something tantalizingly comic,  enigmatic, even sexy. There is something genuinely appealing about the  absurdity she pumps out in drawings, sculpture and installations even if the  ideas do feel like they were inspired by Disney's "Silly Symphony." But as her  drawings at the Santa Monica Museum of Art make clear, the cartoon quality is  part of Williams' underlying premise that art has a ticklish edge that borders  on pure, sensual pleasure.  </P> <P> Most installations have a simple, good-time directness that is easy to absorb  but lacks real depth. Whether that's a result of editing for the exhibit or a  reflection of the way the artist normally works is unclear. Books fluttering  around a lectern like pigeons waiting for a handout or crisp white doors  unfurling like snappy accordion pleated banners need more than surreal enigma  and cursory nods to mystic number systems to give them unity or staying power.  More interesting are the standardized female figures carved into a strip of  rubber and the faceless Dutch bankers with floating hats that hint at issues of  lost identity.  </P> <P> Thankfully, Williams' sensuality comes through loud and clear in her spiraling  "Systems to Measure / Three Dimensional Drawing." This drawing in real space  uses almost invisible monofilament to float silky white and jittery black lines  into mysteriously unwinding linear cyclones. Tucked into the back of this  all-white nook is a faint hail of broken lines that makes the entire sight even  more a fantasy.  </P> <P> Santa Monica Museum of Art, 2437 Main St., to Nov. 25.  </P></p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: DeCrane to be new Texaco head TEXACO, the big US energy group, yesterday said that Mr Alfred DeCrane, chairman for the past five years, would take over as chief executive next April, following the retirement of Mr James Kinnear, who has been president and chief executive since 1987. The 61-year-old Mr DeCrane joined Texaco in 1959 and served in a number of senior positions at the energy group before joining the board's executive committee in 1978. He became president in 1983 and chairman four years later. Mr Kinnear, who will be 65 next March, joined Texaco in 1954 and was appointed to the group's board in 1977. In its third quarter of 1992 Texaco disclosed a 5.9 per cent decline in net earnings. The company attributed the fall to costs associated with property damage caused by Hurricane Andrew and debt-related expenses. The drop - from Dollars 286m to Dollars 269m - translated into earnings per share of 94 cents, down from Dollars 1.01 a year ago. However, Texaco argued that without special charges its third-quarter 1992 net would have been Dollars 1.10 a share, or Dollars 309m. Revenues in the quarter were 6.9 per cent higher at Dollars 10bn. For the first nine months of 1992, Texaco's net income dropped by 26.4 per cent to Dollars 714m on revenues that were 2 per cent lower at Dollars 27.97bn.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The Jewish Film Festival gave first prize to the first Israeli movie on the  Palestinian uprising, and its best short film award went to one directed by a  Palestinian refugee, a jury member at the Jerusalem festival said Sunday. An  international jury awarded the $35,000 first prize to Isaac Zepel Yeshuron's  "Green Fields," produced by David Tur, jury member and film critic Yehuda Stav  said. The movie portrays three generations of an Israeli family caught in the  violence of the 19-month-old uprising. Yeshuron, a leading Israeli director,  condemns his characters who accept violence as the only means of dealing with  the revolt. "The Shelter," by Palestinian director Rashid Mashrawi, which  describes a day in the life of two Palestinian laborers in Tel Aviv, was  awarded the $10,000 prize for best short film. Mashrawi is from the Shati  refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

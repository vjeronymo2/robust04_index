			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / ITV agrees new commissioning procedure THE ITV companies have agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to commission programmes for the first seven months of next year under the old network rules. The commercial television companies' present way of commissioning programmes has been registered as a restrictive practice but has not been sent to the Restrictive Practices Court for investigation under competition law. The agreement on the transitional programme commissioning arrangements removes uncertainty facing both ITV and independent producers. Details of the agreement and the structure of ITV for the 10 years from January will be outlined early next week. Agreement has been reached on everything from the rights of access of independent production companies to the shape of the new central commissioning system, which will spend about Pounds 550m a year. Independent producers will be able to take ideas directly to the central commissioning unit, but independently produced programmes will be contracted for through ITV companies, which are the legal broadcasters under the 1990 act. The ITV companies will get a handling charge. The move towards a central commissioning system represents an unprecedented degree of centralisation in ITV. A senior figure is being sought to take on responsibility for that function. The top job will be that of chief executive, working with a director of programmes.</p>

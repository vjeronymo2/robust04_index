			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, April 3 (XINHUA) -- China has turned over  110 water pumps in assistance to the Philippines, the Chinese  embassy in the Philippines announced today.    The donation of the 110 six-horse power water pumps to the  Philippines was committed by the National People's Congress  (NPC) of China last August when NPC Chairman Qiao Shi visited  the country.    On behalf of China's NPC, Chinese Ambassador to Manila Huang  Guifang last week formally transferred the pumps to the  recipients -- Philippine Congress and the government of Cebu  Province.    The pumps will benefit not only water conservancy in the  rural areas, but also the promotion of the afforestation in the  national parks.</p>

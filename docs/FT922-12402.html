			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Books: Beauty and the beasts of war - Fiction A SOLDIER OF THE GREAT WAR by Mark Helprin Hutchinson Pounds 15.99, 792 pages SOMEONE forgot to tell Mark Helprin that American novelists aren't supposed to write books like this any more. Big, brainy and bodacious, A Soldier of the Great War manages to possess both historical sweep and philosophical depth without resorting to either the mentality of the mini-series or obscure cant. It tracks the adventures of Alessandro Giuliani, a young student of aesthetics from a wealthy Roman family. After a comfortable youth spent mountain-climbing, studying art and falling in love with the girl in the villa next door, Alessandro finds himself thrust into the First World War. He is posted to the Austrian border, where his indoctrination in carnage comes from the vantage point of a forward observation post. Despite his ringside seat to daily slaughter, he manages to keep his faith in the primacy of beauty, even going AWOL during a lull in the fighting to view Giorgione's La Tempesta in Venice. Eventually, Alessandro and his unit are sent to Sicily to chase deserters up Mt Etna. Unwilling to bring back his quarry to face the firing squad, Alessandro himself deserts and is soon captured and sentenced to die. He is reprieved at the last moment by the malevolent Orfeo, a powerful bureaucrat at the Ministry or War, who toys with Alessandro throughout the book to satisfy an ancient grudge he bears towards the Giuliani family. Our hero is sent off to cut marble for graves and then is re-assigned to an alpine unit where he is stuck on a mountaintop, the northernmost man in the Italian army. Wounded, he falls in love with his nurse, Ariane, only to be separated from her, perhaps forever, in a bombing raid. He is then captured by an elite unit of Austrian cavalry (who turn out to be pacifists), and survives by helping them compose fictional accounts of battle. The war ends and he returns to Rome, a nearly broken man, sustained only by his love of beauty, plans of gaining revenge on Orfeo, and a barely-rational belief that Ariane is still alive. Despite the epic grandeur of its plot, A Soldier of the Great War is no mere historical romp. Rather, Helprin has written a considered, digestible, often moving novel of ideas, a book with a scope and tone more reminiscent of the 19th century than of our times. The controlling idea here is that Alessandro's refined sensibility - which has him risking execution to look at a painting, or noting how birds sing during a fierce battle - is the very thing that allows him to endure witnessing so much carnage, as well as enabling him to maintain spiritual communion with those who fall victim to it. Helprin carries forward this rather tricky notion with deft style and narrative grit. Countless times in the narrative, our attention is drawn away gently from a gruesome reality to a thing of beauty, permanence and regeneration. It is, largely, a convincing argument although Helprin overplays his hand at times, especially when it comes to the weather - this might be the most cloudswept novel ever written. But Alessandro himself, equal parts stoic and romantic, is such a seductive figure that many readers will be tempted to put aside their scepticism at Helprin's potentially quaint philosophy. Personally, I preferred watching our hero as he wiped out enemy commandos or seduced nurses to listening to his disquisitions on the spiritual aspects of beauty. But then, that is the advantage of being able to apply so much skill over so many pages - you end up writing a novel that is sure to have something for everybody.</p>

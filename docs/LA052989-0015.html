			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KITCHEN-TABLE TEACHING;  </P> <P> PRINCIPAL TO TAKE MESSAGE OF PRAISE TO INNER-CITY  </P> <P> Last week, with the smell of nearby agriculture heavy in the air, the principal  of Valley Center Middle School was perched on the banister outside a school  bungalow, cajoling the kids to hurry into the classroom to begin working with  him.  </P> <P> In September, Paul White hopes instead to be roaming the dingy hallways of an  inner-city school, applying his enthusiasm and sense of mission to a whole  school full of low-achieving students rather than to one or two classes.  </P> <P> Not that the Messianic White hasn't enjoyed his special sixth-period sessions,  where he liberally mixes praise with criticism while moving among the 16  seventh-and eighth-graders, checking their progress in other classes, offering  help on a writing or math assignment, and scolding those who have not yet  organized their schedule to finish longer-term projects on time.  </P> <P> His efforts -- in addition to the normal routine of a principal -- have turned  around the academic world of these students, many of them minority and all of  whom previously achieved at low levels. Every one of the youngsters volunteered  for the daily class that White created to employ more of his many ideas about  helping at-risk students.  </P> <P> But White no longer is satisfied with his accomplishments in Valley Center, a  North County citrus and avocado center which, despite pressures of population  growth in recent years, has far fewer of the big-city problems such as  dropouts, drugs and child abuse that bedevil urban schools.  </P> <P> The 37-year-old White wants to be administering at an inner-city school next  fall, leaving behind the 600-student middle school where teachers and  administrators from urban districts fiercely compete for occasional openings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Applications Are Out  </P> <P> In February, White resigned his Valley Center post effective June 30, despite  entreaties from district administrators urging him to stay. White has applied  for positions with several urban school districts around the country and while  he has no firm offers yet, his confidence in landing a desired job stems from  the same philosophy he drums into his students.  </P> <P> "I tell myself what I tell every kid I've ever counseled," said White, whose  devotion to education has touched every staff member in Valley Center, whether  they agree or disagree with his tenure. "I don't believe that God would give me  or anyone else the capabilities that we have and not allow us to apply them to  our lives."  </P> <P> Assistant Superintendent Jeff Mulford, who as the previous principal hired  White as his assistant, said, "I've never met anyone quite like Paul . . . he  has no personal time constraints, he takes kids on trips, he's practically  adopted a few."  </P> <P> Continued Mulford: "Most of us spend our lives trying to get to a place like  Valley Center," pointing to the school's high test scores, few discipline  problems, as well as attractive physical plant of large playgrounds, a pool,  and an experimental farm. The school district, with the middle school and two  elementary schools, is about 65% white and 35% minority, consisting of Latinos  and Native Americans.  </P> <P> "But Paul sincerely believes that he can do more for mankind by going to the  inner-city."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Run for His Money'  </P> <P> Patty Christopher taught several years in urban schools, including Baker  Elementary in Southeast San Diego, before coming to Valley Center. Now the  assistant principal, she said that White "is going to have a real run for his  money in handling an urban school."  </P> <P> "Those schools can really use someone like Paul . . . and I think it's great  that people like him are willing to try."  </P> <P> But White recoils from being labeled as idealistic.  </P> <P> "I think that is the lowest blow you can give me," he said. "Calling me  idealistic is to write off people like myself. Realism is believing that all  schools can offer productive education and that all students can be  productively educated."  </P> <P> In addition, White did not make his decision unaware of the pitfalls in urban  areas. Before coming to Valley Center as an administrator, he spent eight years  in Vallejo, a blue-collar city north of San Francisco, motivating so-called  "problem" elementary students.  </P> <P> In Vallejo he honed the approach that has won him plaudits from students and,  albeit grudgingly at times, from colleagues.  </P> <P> White calls his style "surrogate kitchen-table parenting."  </P> <P> When he first started teaching, White found himself intrigued that while  parents are able to talk to and discipline their children and still receive  affection, teachers and administrators have always found it hard to correct  kids and still command respect.  </P> <P> "But it dawned on me that parents achieve because when things go well for a  kid, the child gets limitless congratulations," White said. "So as a teacher I  can give out hard-rock discipline when necessary, but also there is no limit to  my praise if they do well, either."  </P> <P> The turning point came on a Friday two weeks into his first class, a  hard-to-discipline group about to be dismissed for the weekend. White was  explaining that he never leaves the house without telling his wife that he  loves her, because he never knows if that might be the last time he sees her.  </P> <P> "So I told the class I wanted them all to have a good weekend and that I loved  all of them," White recalled. "At first, I thought they might think I was the  biggest idiot in the world, but instead, you could have heard a pin drop in  that class.  </P> <P> "And after that, I never had problems. But the first commitment was mine, that  I was willing to let the kids know that they are loved, but also that I was  there to peer over their shoulder, as a parent should, and keep them in line as  well."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Walks a Fine Line  </P> <P> Mulford said that White walks "the fine line between discipline and caring  about as well as anyone I have seen. He plays the parent role beautifully and  the kids know that he is sincere."  </P> <P> Veteran Valley Center teacher Donna Sowers praised White for helping students  understand how to organize their study and how to take responsibility for their  work. Colleague Taide Pereyra said White has devoted more of his own time and  money to working with students than anyone she has seen.  </P> <P> "He'll shake them up wherever he goes because he is always giving 150%,"  teacher Val Taylor said. "They'll either love him or hate him."  </P> <P> If White has shortcomings, Sowers and others said any faults come from  impatience.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I think that he might have been better off to stay here another  year, to learn more about building relationships with the staff similar to  those easily exemplified in those he has with the kids," Sowers said.  </P> <P> "I understand he has a strong mission to succeed, but I think that every person  on a staff has a similar mission, but may go about it in a quieter way."  </P> <P> Mulford said that the transition from assistant principal to principal is  difficult because the top position presents a much broader spectrum of ideas  and requirements in working with people.  </P> <P> "But Paul has no personal ego involved and I think he has grown tremendously,"  Mulford said.  </P> <P> White himself said that administration "is an ongoing lesson" and that he has  learned that more can be accomplished when credit is spread liberally. But at  the same time, he said that "nothing will change (at a school) unless I and  everyone else will change and give our best efforts. . . . in too many cases,  we haven't given our best efforts.  </P> <P> "My strongest calling is to be with the most difficult kids and I, along with  everyone else, must be willing to pay the cost and personal sacrifice involved  in education."  </P> <P> Mulford has applied to school districts in Santa Ana, Los Angeles, Whittier,  San Francisco, Oakland, Memphis and Detroit. His three letters to Oakland were  never answered and his three to Detroit resulted only in a mimeographed flier  giving details on substitute teaching.  </P> <P> "I guess those experiences are indicative of the problems that education has,"  White said.  </P> <P> But both San Francisco and Whittier have responded with interest, he said.  White had an interview in the Bay Area this past week and will be part of a  second round of interviews in Whittier for an opening as principal of a  continuation high school.  </P> <P> "No matter where I go, there will be no magic to what I do -- just hard work,  sacrifice, going toe-to-toe with students, rewarding students, in essence  breaking down goals into workable parts and getting everyone involved," White  said.  </P></p>

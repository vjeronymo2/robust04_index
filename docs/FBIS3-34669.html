			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif, secretary general </F> of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, by 'Ali  al-Ruzz in London; date not given]    [Text] [Al-Ruzz] There is much talk about the possibility  of a split within the National Front for the Salvation of Libya  [NFSL]. Is that true?    [Al-Muqaryif] All organizations and parties, especially the  big ones, sometimes have differences of opinion and even  differences of positions. This is one of the facts which apply  to any political action. No organization has been able to avoid  it or brag about it. An organization such as the NFSL, entering  its 13th year in the face of a regime which has many resources  and capabilities at its disposal, and carrying out its task  against a background of serious and continuously changing  regional and international circumstances, cannot be expected not  to encounter situations and changes over which there would be  some differences of opinion ... That is what has occurred  within the NFLS over the past months.    I would like to draw the attention of those interested in  Libyan affairs and Libyan opposition affairs to the fact that  what is important is not the occurrence of differences but the  extent of the organization's ability to face and discuss them in  a democratic and civilized way. The developments you have  mentioned proved that the NFSL is capable of finding appropriate  solutions through its democratic institutions represented by the  field offices, the leadership body, the Permanent Bureau, and  the National Council, which will be meeting soon to complete its  resolution of pending issues.    [Al-Ruzz] Is there a split?    [Al-Muqaryif] There is no split. There are differences,  sometimes sharp differences, over organizational and struggle  issues. Some of them were discussed during the meeting of the  Permanent Bureau, and discussion of the remaining issues will be  completed at the meeting of the National Council.    [Al-Ruzz] Could the differences lead to a split?    [Al-Muqaryif] We believe that is unlikely and we hope it  would not happen. Even if it did happen, it would be a familiar  phenomenon in the world of the organizations with circumstances  similar to our own.    [Al-Ruzz] In the event of a split, how -- candidly speaking  -- would that reflect on the NFSL's performance?    [Al-Muqaryif] I will not make the mistake of saying that it  would not affect the NFSL. It would be painful and regrettable  for any front or organization to lose any of its sons, but what  I do know and am certain of is that the NFSL has enough manpower  and struggle mettle to healthily overcome any negative  phenomenon, God forbid. Do not forget that the NFSL has,  throughout its march, undergone some fierce crises which could  have blown away its entire existence, such as the times of its  exit from Morocco in 1983, from Sudan in 1985, and from Chad in  1990.    [Al-Ruzz] Have the attempts to mend the rift been fully  exhausted?    [Al-Muqaryif] I have already said that the Permanent Bureau  tackled many issues during its meeting of last December and left  it to the National Council, which is the highest authority, to  deal with the other issues. The council members have been  summoned to an extraordinary meeting to complete that task.    [Al-Ruzz] There are those who criticize you for having  hastily announced that the NFSL claimed responsibility for the  Bani-Walid military incidents last October, as a result of which  dozens of the NFSL's supporters inside Libya were arrested.    [Al-Muqaryif] What I would like to emphasize -- and hope  would put an end to the controversy over that matter -- is that  the October events were in fact a real and strong uprising in  which a large number of men from the Libyan Armed Forces in  Bani-Walid, Misratah, and Tarhunah participated. The regime was  violently shaken by these events and it faced them with violence.    This fact cannot be changed by the regime's attempts to  trick  some sectors of the media, which have put forward certain claims  of the regime's own making, nor can it be changed by the  differences of opinion that have emerged regarding the NFSL's  responsibility.    The other point I want to stress here is that a number of  officers who participated in the operation or were linked to it  have managed to leave Libya and will shortly meet with the media  and present all the facts they know about what happened, and  will reveal the extent of the NFSL's connection with that  serious operation.    [Al-Ruzz] May we know the names of these officers?    [Al-Muqaryif] Of course not, for the time being.    [Al-Ruzz] When will they meet with the media?    [Al-Muqaryif] In the near future. We are sure that official  circles in a number of states are aware of and know what really  happened, its magnitude, and the degree of the NFSL's  responsibility for that.    [Al-Ruzz] What about those who were detained as a result of  the NFSL claiming responsibility?    [Al-Muqaryif] Do you think that the regime waits for the  NFSL's announcement before taking savage and severe action  against the members of the military and the civilians it  suspects of having moved against it? The regime does not need  any announcement from anyone. Its record over the past years  confirms that fact. Actually, the NFSL acted out of a sense of  responsibility about that internal act of heroism which the  regime tried to play down and demean, and for which it tried to  give other reasons -- such as claiming that a number of officers  rebelled because of a delay in the payment of their salaries, or  that they moved militarily for tribal reasons. Our knowledge of  the truth of that action and the men who were behind it made us  move to tell the world that it was part of the Libyan people's  opposition movement seeking to overthrow the regime in favor of  a democratic alternative.    [Al-Ruzz] Why do you give so much importance to the October  military movement, which was over in two days?    [Al-Muqaryif] I believe that the October movement was one of  the largest and most serious movements against the regime, be it  in reference to the nature of the movement, preparation for and  participation in it, or its timing. Prior to that movement the  regime had believed that the tribes were loyal to it, and it  relied considerably on their men. But the occurrence of that  movement and the participation of tribal people in it faced the  regime with a new situation. For one thing, it could no  longer depend on the loyalty of these tribes and, second, it  could not fill the great vacuum created after the expulsion and  arrest of members of these tribes in the various army units,  security organs, and other civilian sectors.    [Al-Ruzz] Those opposed to the NFSL criticize its close  links with the United States and maintain that these links  confuse matters and rob it of its independence?    [Al-Muqaryif] The NFSL has, since its foundation, been  anxious to understand the regional and international realities  related to the Libyan issue, and it has addressed these  realities most evenly, wisely, and responsibly. That in no way  means that the NFSL has at any time forfeited its independence,  will, or national aspirations. The Bab-al-'Aziziyah operation  was the best evidence of that. Furthermore, the fact that the  NFSL had initiated and maintained its military program in Chad  as represented by the Libyan National Army and its struggle in  the most difficult circumstances was another example of that  fact. There can be no doubt that the October events were another  manifestation of that at a time when many thought that the NFSL  had forfeited its will to struggle against the regime in the  face of international developments and changes.    [Al-Ruzz] It has been claimed that Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif  is the obstacle standing in the way of unification of the  opposition factions, and that his way of addressing that issue  has frequently impeded the unification process....    [Al-Muqaryif] It would be better not to address this  question to me. I wish you had addressed it to the NFSL's  institutions. I wish you had asked them: Did Muhammad  al-Muqaryif really try to impose his views on this matter? I  believe that accepting such a claim would mean that all the  NFSL's institutions, including men and fighters, are just a  front manipulated by the secretary general. Nobody would  believe or accept such a claim.    I am proud to belong to a democratic organization based on  men who have chosen its objectives, methods, and policies. All  I and my brothers in the leadership do is implement and carry  out the resolutions passed by the National Council in its past  sessions. Furthermore, I have no personal opinion on that issue  that is any different from the views of my brothers; and even if  I did, I believe that the brothers would have prevented me from  imposing that opinion on them.    [Al-Ruzz] As we are talking about unity of the opposition,  what did happen at the Algeria meeting?    [Al-Muqaryif] First of all, I am not saying that the meeting  of the opposition took place in Algeria. I will not say where  it was held. A meeting did take place between the NFSL, the  National Alliance, and the Coordination Committee. It did in  fact crown the efforts of many elements of the Libyan  opposition, not necessarily from the highest ranks of the  leadership. The meeting took place in the middle of last  October and it was attended by    We agreed that, after the signing of the statement, a  committee would be formed to prepare for a general conference of  the Libyan opposition, and we had hoped that the conference,  which was supposed to take place 21 November, would lead to the  signing of a dcoument stating the constant principles of the  struggle. We in the NFSL were prepared to go all the way in the  field of coordination among the factions even if that meant the  formation of a unified command and joint bodies, and so on.  But, regrettably, the circumstances of one of the organizations  prevented the signing of the draft statement. Its leadership  asked for more time to think about the matter. There can be no  doubt that the sudden disappearance of Mansur al-Kikhya was a  great loss for these efforts, as well as for the national  struggle in general, because of his tolerant nature and  willingess for dialogue and the bridging of views. He played a  major part in promoting the right circumstances for the present  plan. His absence has greatly affected many aspects including  this particular issue.    [Al-Ruzz] What do you have to say about al-Kikhya's  continued disappearance?    [Al-Muqaryif] On the human level, it was a real tragedy for  him, his family, his friends, and his fellow strugglers. We  will undoubtedly miss him, particularly in these circumstances.    What did happen? Nobody can know for sure, but I do not  hesitate to point an accusing finger at the regime as being the  party behind the disappearance. There are many examples in the  regime's old and recent record. The resolutions of the  so-called Revolutionary Committees and al-Qadhdhafi's recent  speeches confirm the new trend in the regime's way of dealing  with the opposition. The Libyan regime has a major vested  interest in al-Kikhya's disappearance at this stage.    We have information that the regime will not restrict its  operations to just kidnapping al-Kikhya. It intends to carry  out more operations. Al-Qadhdhafi's invitation to Ahmad Jibril  and Abu-Nidal to Libya was for that purpose. We also have  information that the regime did not halt its efforts after  Jibril and Abu-Nidal refused to settle in Libya and that he sent  Colonel 'Abdallah Hijazi to them and Hijazi met with them and  offered coordination of operations against the opposition.    [Al-Ruzz] How do you assess the recent government changes  in Libya?    [Al-Muqaryif] Before talking about the changes, it suffices,  in order to discern the tragic conditions of the Libyan people  under that regime, to examine what went on at the General  People's Congress and what was said by Abu-Zayd 'Umar Durdah,  secretary of the General People's Committee, and the ministers.  Salaries are not being paid and there is no education and no  medical or other services.    The new government bears no particular hallmarks, except  that  'Umar al-Muntasir was retained at the Foreign Ministry as  someone who could help contacts with the West. It also includes  a number of Revolutionary Committees members with vast  experience in terrorism such as 'Izz-al-Din al-Hanshiri,  Muhammad Hijazi, and Ahmad Ibrahim.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] (DYN-NA) -- Amid continuing government anxiety that  members of the Peruvian guerrilla organization Sendero Luminoso  are infiltrating the country attracted by recent social unrest  in the northern provinces, the government has strenuously denied  that this fear was the cause for yesterday's deportation of 30  Peruvian illegal immigrants.    The Foreign Ministry revealed that the workers, 17 men and  13  women, were deported on Friday [14 January] for not having  obtained work permits and for squatting in a flat in the Federal  Capital.    However, suspicion has since arisen that there may have been  other motives in the decision to repatriate them since the  government has given all illegal citizens until the end of this  month to obtain the correct paperwork.    Denying that the action was tantamount to state xenophobia,  Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf told reporters that it was  simply a legal matter and quashed speculation that the  government, who announced earlier in the week that security  services were being put on alert to monitor possible cases of  social unrest, was participating in a "witch-hunt."    Furthermore, deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said  on Radio Mitre yesterday that the Peruvian Embassy was fully  aware of the situation and that nothing untoward had occurred.  He added that the policy was part of a bilateral agreement  between the two countries which could lead to visas being  required to enter the country in order to stem the tide of  illegal workers from the Andean country.    While the government has been attempting to play down its  initial concern about the possibility of foreign and  professional activists stirring up already latent frustration  into violent protests, Buenos Aires Security Secretary Eduardo  Pettigiani yesterday revealed that, despite assurances, the  government is in a "constant state of concern."    He added that the national intelligence agencies were  "working overtime" in order to clamp down on any suspicious  activities.    In other related news yesterday ATE [Association of State  Workers] State Workers' Union secretary-general Alba Luna del  Castillo accused local government officials in Santiago del  Estero of "sowing seeds of fear" into local residents who were  contemplating taking part in Friday's protest march to  commemorate last month's bloody riots.    She claimed that there were almost 3000 workers in the march  through the province's capital, although police estimate that  there were only a third of that figure. However, she lamented  what she felt was a state campaign to strike fear into local  residents by raising the spectre of Sendero Luminoso involvement.    In triumphant fashion Del Castillo told reporters that the  march has again warned the national government of the intensity  of the province's problems and that the people were demanding  concrete action.    One positive development yesterday was the announcement that  the Santiago del Estero Provincial Bank will re-open tomorrow  for the first time since December's riots. Its first task will  be to distribute unpaid salaries dating back to October to many  of the region's disgruntled workers.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUNCHEON OR DINNER;  </P> <P> CORRECT ETIQUETTE FOR SERVING SOUP  </P> <P> When soup is served for a luncheon or dinner, Emily Post's "Etiquette" offers  the following advice:  </P> <P>  -- Soup should be the first of six courses. It should be followed by fish, the  entree, salad, dessert and coffee. Six is the maximum number of courses for  even the most elaborate dinner; and for an informal luncheon, two or three  courses are sufficient -- soup, entree and dessert.  </P> <P>  -- Soup at a luncheon is served in two-handled cups. The soup is eaten with a  teaspoon, or the cup may be picked up and the soup may be sipped, if it has  sufficiently cooled. A clear soup is usually served.  </P> <P>  -- Sherry is the first wine offered at dinner, and then usually with a soup  that contains Sherry in the preparation. Sherry should never be offered with  cream of chicken soup or vichyssoise, but with turtle or black-bean soup, for  instance.  </P> <P>  -- Clear soups are often served in a shallow bowl rather than a cup. When the  level of soup is so low that you must lift the bowl to avoid scraping the  bottom, lift the near edge with your left hand and tip the bowl away from you.  Then spoon the soup away from you.  </P> <P>  -- Both soup cups and soup bowls should be served with a saucer or plate  beneath them. The spoon, when not in use or when the soup is finished, is laid  on the saucer underneath.  </P> <P> Amy Vanderbilt, in the "Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette," says soup  should always be kept flowing in the opposite direction from one's lap. The  soup spoon should be filled from its far side, and soup then poured gently into  the mouth with its near side.  </P> <P> Vanderbilt says that if dumplings, vegetables, mushrooms or other garnishes are  floating on top, eat these first by using the spoon, before the liquid part of  the soup is drunk. If noodles are at the bottom of the bowl, spoon them up  before consuming the liquid.  </P> <P> If you take a large spoonful of extremely hot soup, don't spit it out,  concludes Vanderbilt. Instead, take a quick drink of water to cool your mouth.  If you have burned your mouth, an exception may be made to the rule against  drinking with food already in your mouth.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance], Mr. Afonso Dhlakama has denied allegations that  some members of the Malawi Young Pioneers [MYP] movement who  fled the country during the disarmament process are in some  Renamo camps in Mozambique.    Mr. Dhlakama was speaking in Lilongwe today at the start of  a  three-day official visit to Malawi. He explained that all along  it has not been his movement's intention to interfere in the  internal affairs of Malawi with the aim of bringing about  destabilization. Mr. Dhlakama said it was Renamo's wish that the  transitional process in Malawi should be orderly and peaceful.  He said while in Malawi he will be holding talks with officials  of the government and various political parties on topical  issues, including the current political situation in Mozambique.</p>

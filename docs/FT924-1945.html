			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / IBM to cut 25,000 more jobs: Global capacity to be reduced - Dollars 6bn charge / Dividend threatened INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, reeling from a global economic slowdown and a rapidly changing computer market, yesterday announced plans to cut its worldwide workforce by 25,000, or 8 per cent, next year and sharply reduce its manufacturing capacity. It will take a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) fourth-quarter charge to cover the costs. The news sent the company's shares plunging nearly 11 per cent to close at Dollars 56 1/8 , down Dollars 6 3/4 . This is their lowest level for a decade and compares with the 1992 high of Dollars 100 3/8 . In a sign of the severity of the crisis it faces, IBM made clear that two of its treasured traditions - maintenance of annual dividend and a policy of no forced redundancies - were no longer safe. Wall Street analysts estimated that the company, the world's largest computer manufacturer, was heading for a 1992 loss after charges of about Dollars 4.75bn and sentiment towards the company remained extremely negative. Mr Stephen Smith of Paine-Webber said: 'These actions don't go far enough and the outlook for mainframe computers is very bleak.' With the dividend at risk, he felt that the stock could fall below Dollars 50. Mr John Akers, IBM chairman, said that while cash flow remained strong, 'current earnings expectations make the company unsure of its ability to maintain the dividend at current levels'. He added that while IBM would try to achieve job cuts voluntarily, if business conditions did not improve significantly 'it is likely that some business units will be unable to maintain full employment in 1993'. Since 1986 the company has cut its workforce by about 100,000 to some 300,000. Nearly half the job cuts announced yesterday will be in Europe but full details were unclear last night. IBM Germany, however, said that next year it would cut rather more than the 2,000 jobs it shed in 1993. It would not rule out further redundancies as a way of reducing the workforce. IBM UK said it expected to cut up to 1,000 jobs in 1993, the same as this year. By the end of 1993, the workforce could be down to 13,000 in the UK, about 5,000 less than in 1990. Worldwide, the company is to cut its development spending by about Dollars 1bn, or roughly one sixth, in 1993, reduce capital spending and cut sales, general and administrative expenses by Dollars 1bn. IBM added that its fourth-quarter operating results were only likely to be around break-even - well below Wall Street forecasts - because of the unexpected depth of the business downturn, particularly in Europe, prolonged worldwide economic weakness and market pressures to cut hardware prices. It warned that it expected the unfavourable conditions to continue into 1993. This is the latest in a series of restructurings by IBM since the late 1980s as it has struggled with the global economic slowdown, which began in the US, and the extremely rapid pace of change in the computer industry. IBM, which has dominated the market for large, mainframe computers, has suffered from the shift of demand to smaller, desk-top models because its bureaucratic structure has not responded sufficiently quickly. The latest round of cuts comes on top of Dollars 5.4bn of special pre-tax charges so far this year to cover plant closures and 40,000 job cuts. The total charge this year comes to Dollars 11.4bn. Mr Akers said trading conditions had deteriorated more precipitously than expected. The company said its personal computer business, which introduced an inexpensive new line in the autumn, was seeing strong sales growth and was moving towards profitability in 1993, but the mainframe business had suffered a 10 per cent fall in revenues during 1992. Asked by journalists whether he had considered stepping down, Mr Akers, who has been chairman for six years, said he had given no thought to the matter because IBM was on the right track and the board supported him.

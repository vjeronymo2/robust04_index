			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: Battle for Dunnes ends with brother Ben selling stake A two-year battle for control of the Republic of Ireland's largest retailer, Dunnes Stores, has ended. Mr Ben Dunne, the former executive chairman and a 19 per cent shareholder in the company is to be bought out by his brother and two sisters for a reported IPounds 100m (Pounds 98.3m). In return Mr Dunne is to drop his legal action to have the family trust, through which the company is owned, broken up. The case was expected to be heard by the Irish High Court last week but was repeatedly adjourned while a settlement was hammered out. If he had been successful in breaking up the trust Mr Dunne planned to bring a second action to force his family to buy him out or sell their shares to him. Mr Dunne brought his action after being removed from the position of executive chairman in March 1993. He was voted out by a board made up of his brother Frank and three sisters, Mrs Margaret Hefferman, Miss Therese Dunne and the now-deceased Mrs Elizabeth McMahon, who supported him. Mr Dunne was claiming that the trustees' decision to extend the trust after it was due to expire in 1985, was improper and had no legal effect. A break-up of the trust would have allowed the shares in the company to be sold, but could also have exposed the beneficiaries of the trust, including Mr Dunne, to capital gains tax liabilities. The details of the settlement have not been released but it is understood that Mr Dunne could receive up to IPounds 100m in phased payments over a number of years. He is expected to agree not to set up in competition with Dunnes Stores for at least 12 months. Despite this, shares in Dunloe, Mr Dunne's property concern, jumped by 5p to 35p last week prompting it to issue a statement denying it was in any commercial negotiations that might explain the rise. Dunloe has been suggested as the possible vehicle by which Mr Dunne could set up in competition with Dunnes Stores.</p>

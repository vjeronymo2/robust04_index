			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THERE IS A LAW; IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED  </P> <P> Linda Blandford's May 14 column documenting the behavior of the young Dana  Point surfers was a disgusting example of what goes on every day beneath all of  our noses. Not surprising, unfortunately, or even unusual.  </P> <P> All of Orange County seems to be up in arms about the wearing of Bart Simpson  T-shirts, afraid of impressing bad things on children. Let's talk about sending  dangerous signals: The wearing of a T-shirt bearing the image of a cartoon  character is pure poison, but full-on racism is an afternoon's recreation.  </P> <P> Why do these young and expert fascists feel free to express their most fondly  held beliefs right out loud and have no compunction against physically invading  the privacy of families on the beach? The disinterest of bystanders observed by  Blandford is perhaps part of the answer.  </P> <P> Far more revealing, however, is the picture of the Orange County sheriff's  deputy, unable to bring himself to action even in his institutional role. Do  you think a couple of non-Caucasian boys could have gotten away with defacing a  place of business on that sunny day in Dana Point? Would the gun-toting  Sheriff's Department representative have had trepidation in handling that  situation?  </P> <P> When one of the intended victims takes action and defends his family, the boy  squeals what must be his standard response: My daddy will sue you. Blandford is  so right in pointing out that these suntanned pipsqueaks wouldn't last a minute  in a situation where they might have to stand up and account for strong  feelings. Real men in training, right?  </P> <P> These hoodlums are confident that parents generally support their actions, and  they (and we) see here that at least one sheriff's deputy does too. They have  been given tacit permission to revel in their ignorance and hatred -- the sum  total of what they find when plumbing the shallow depths of what might loosely  be called their humanity.  </P> <P> PRISCILLA MAYFIELD  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

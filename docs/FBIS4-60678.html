			<p>BFN     [Text] Likud chairman Binyamin Netanyahu has harshly  reacted to Ari'el Sharon's announcement that he intends to run  for the premiership in the next elections and called on him to  leave the Likud. Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Netanyahu said  that Sharon sows conflict and dispute. He conspired against  Menahem Begin and Yitzhaq Shamir and is now trying to conspire  against me. The time has come for this intriguer to leave the  Likud. All Sharon does is undermine, sabotage, and split,  Netanyahu said. With him, this is a chronic disease. He is a  man who does not recognize any democratic norms and sets out to  destroy every framework, the Likud chairman asserted.    Sharon told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that he has been  holding contacts to set up a united front of the right-wing camp  which would hold primaries before the next elections and decide  on its candidate.    Knesset Member Binyamin Begin told Qol Yisra'el that  Sharon's  chances of winning are similar to his chances of becoming the  world's tennis champion. This is a wrong move which will lead  to a split in the national camp, Begin said.    Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan said he would run against  Sharon.  In his opinion, it could be an advantage if a few candidates of  the national camp ran in the first round of elections.</p>

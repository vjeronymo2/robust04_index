			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Gas, Oil and Carbon Dioxide Storage Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Twelve commenters recommended that the rule except gas transmission lines which are part of injection/withdrawal systems at gas storage facilities. Commenters said these gas storage facilities have small diameter piping configured in a grid-like pattern that would not permit the passage of smart pigs. The TPSSC likewise recommended that storage facilities be excepted. Similarly, one commenter urged an exception of delivery/withdrawal piping associated with hazardous liquid storage in breakout tanks, due to the short lengths, short radius bends and other tank farm piping configurations which are unable to accommodate the passage of smart pigs. The THLPSSC also recommended that tank farm piping be excepted from compliance with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA agrees that because of piping configuration constraints associated with the storage facilities for gas, hazardous liquids and carbon dioxide it is generally impracticable for design and construction to accommodate passage of smart pigs. Therefore, &sect;192.150(b)(3) of the rule excepts piping associated with gas storage facilities, other than a continuous run of transmission line between a compression station and storage facilities, and &sect;195.120(b)(2) excepts piping associated with liquid storage facilities. Nonetheless, RSPA will be studying underground storage issues and, based on that work, may initiate rulemaking to address new safety measures that may be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Emergencies and Unforeseen Construction Problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The NPRM proposed to exclude from the rule piping that the Administrator finds, upon petition by an operator, to be impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of smart pigs. Eighteen commenters stated that many construction situations are under tight contractual or other time constraints that do not allow sufficient time to obtain a finding by the Administrator. For example, an operator may have to make immediate adjustments in the field because of the discovery of obstructions or other unforeseen problems. Thus, some commenters reasoned that while the Administrator would have at least 90 days to decide whether to grant a petition, most pipeline construction projects would not allow delays of a few days. A few commenters suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators should be permitted to accept the ``burden of proof'' when encountering an impracticability during construction and so inform RSPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the TPSSC recommended that the test for impracticability be left up to the operator instead of petitioning the Administrator for a finding. The Committee suggested the wording ``and any other piping that the operator determines and documents would be impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device'' be substituted for ``the Administrator finds'' in the exception of &sect;192.150(b) from the NPRM. Also, the TPSSC recommended that ``emergency repairs'' be added to the list of exceptions contained in &sect;192.150(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA acknowledges that emergencies, construction time constraints, and unforeseen pipeline construction problems would not allow operators the time to petition for a finding of impracticability and wait for RSPA's response. Therefore, RSPA has added &sect;&sect;192.150(c) and 195.120(c) which permit an operator discovering an emergency, construction time constraint or other unforeseeable construction problem to make a provisional determination of impracticability. In such instances the operator must document the circumstances resulting in its impracticability determination. Within 30 days after discovering an emergency or a construction problem, the operator must petition under the new &sect;190.9, ``Petitions for finding or approval'' for a finding by the Administrator that design and construction to accommodate passage of internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, the operator must modify the line section to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices, within 1 year after the date of the notice of denial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Petitions for Finding or Approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The NPRM proposed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;190.9, ``Petitions for finding or approval'' be added to part 190 of this Chapter. Except as discussed above, commenters did not oppose the establishment of a procedure to allow an operator to petition the Administrator for an administrative ruling on any rule under parts 192, 193, and 195 in which the Administrator is authorized to make a finding or approval. Heretofore, a similar procedure in part 193 (&sect;193.2015) applied only to petitions relating to LNG facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this rule, the &sect;190.9 has been revised to require operators of intrastate pipelines located in states, participating under section 5 of the NGPSA or section 205 of the HLPSA to direct their petitions to the state pipeline safety agency. The participating state agency will then make a recommendation to the Administrator as to the disposition of the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

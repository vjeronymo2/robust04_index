			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Japan helps to foster global recovery PUBLIC HOLIDAYS left volume subdued last week, but share prices moved higher after their losses of the week before. The FT-Actuaries World Index recovered 1.2 per cent in local currency terms, with most of its lift coming from Tokyo, where the Golden Week holidays coincided with a surprise cut in the US Federal Reserve discount rate from 6 to 5.5 per cent. The market has recently seen particular strength in over-the-counter and other smaller companies. In the US, equities were relatively depressed. The week started with encouraging economic data, but share prices failed to sustain their response to that, or to Tuesday's interest rate reduction; the US market ended flat on mixed unemployment figures and weak car sales. Europe saw the best of its recovery in France and most of that last Thursday, with a 2.5 per cent climb in the CAC 40 index after the interest rate cuts in the US and a rise in the bond market in Paris. Writing at the end of the week, Morgan Stanley made France its preferred market among the European majors. New Zealand was the best performing market of the week. Like Paris it had one big day, in its case last Friday when it advanced 2.7 per cent; once again, this was partly founded on a continuing rally in the domestic bond market, in New Zealand's case after news that the country's current account deficit would be revised sharply downwards. Mr Mike Gilmour of brokers Ord Minnett said yesterday that New Zealand, long depressed, had seen the first indications of domestic equity buying for some time. There had been heavy overseas buying for the past week or two, attributed mostly to the US. The other strong performer in the Asia Pacific region was Hong Kong, up 2.6 per cent. Apart from the US interest rate news, says Hoare Govett, the market rallied on an announcement that airport talks would recommence, and on signs that the US would renew China's most favoured nation status.</p>

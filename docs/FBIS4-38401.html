			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unscheduled interview with A.A. Moroz, chairman of the </F> Ukrainian Supreme Council, by unidentified correspondent; date  and place not given -- recorded]    [Text) [Unidentified correspondent] Oleksandr  Oleksandrovich, perhaps the only serious result -- from the  public viewpoint -- achieved in the three weeks that the new  Supreme Council has been working is that it has managed to  extinguish the fire of conflict with the Crimea which nearly  flared up. You are going there on a visit. What is the purpose  of your visit, and what are the Supreme Council's and your own  future plans as regards this matter?    [Moroz] Talking about the Crimean issue, this situation has  brought people, including the deputies, into a state of  agitation. When considering this question they have shown their  maturity, an ability to make compromises and tolerance; they  have taken into account the interests of the other side, or  rather of different sides.    I have recently spoken to many leaders in the Crimea,  Ukraine, and Russia, and it seems to me that the conflict can be  brought to a less intense level. We can find a solution to  which all would agree. I hope to be able to fly to the Crimea  next week. I know many residents of the Crimea and will have  meetings with many representatives of the power structures, with  the military, and with officials in charge of economic matters,  and I hope that we will be able to find a reasonable way of  resolving the issue, which would take into account both the  interests of the Crimean people and of Ukraine. I think the  interests of the peoples of Russia will not be ignored, either.  It seems to me that this is the only way -- to settle all  disagreements through talks.    [Correspondent] How important at the present stage are the  talks on the future of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol?    [Moroz] We do not regard this as a separate issue. Here a  very important condition is necessary -- that both sides should  be willing to resolve the problem and not to drive it into an  impasse. It appears to me that some solutions to this already  exist. There are many issues here which should be settled in a  principled and determined way, keeping the main purpose in mind  -- that we should remain good neighbors forever. I think if we  continue our work in this mood -- the Crimeans, Ukrainians, and  Russians, and the world community as well...[pauses] Playing the  Crimean card at the time when certain interested forces are  standing behind each player is risky and this ought not to be  done. Therefore, I see my task in using all means available to  the Supreme Council as a legislative body and to its commissions  in order to relax and remove the tension. Everyone will profit  by this.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tortoise plods out of hibernation - Ivo Dawnay tracks John Smith's first steps on a long election race solid and reliable if maddeningly plodding. Last Sunday in Bournemouth, the Labour leader's speech to the party's local government conference marked the end of a long winter's contemplative hibernation and his first steps in the race for Downing Street. What seemed equally clear at Westminster yesterday was that the great majority of Labour MPs of both left and right were breathing a collective sigh of relief. But had Mr Smith's advocacy of an end to dogma been a clandestine announcement of the end of socialism? So long had the wait been for news, any news, from the leader's bunker, that no one appeared to care. All this says much about Mr Smith's leadership technique - a style about as far from the Kinnock 'bang the table first, ask questions afterwards' approach as it is possible to be. Yet if Mr Smith's agenda is to continue down the Kinnock path of reform, it is still wholly impossible to gauge how far he is ready to go. One theory - that of some opponents - has it that Mr Smith's highly conservative Scottish Labourism sees nothing essentially wrong with the party's positions but a good deal to criticise in the greedy, self-interested electorate. His aim is to broaden Labour's appeal to their baser interests while keeping the party's core objectives unchanged. The second view - largely that of his admirers - is that what has appeared to many to be indolence or complacency is in fact a grand, long-term and radical strategy. By keeping his counsel, Mr Smith has waited until the chorus of 'Something must be done' has neared a crescendo before authoritatively dictating that something will be. A painstaking textual analysis of the Bournemouth speech leaves the reader equally uncertain about the conclusions to be drawn. Mr Smith's call for 'a new politics that puts people first, that rejects dogma and embraces practical, common-sense solutions' is a case in point. It can either be interpreted as a lightly coded epitaph for socialism - a final burial of ideology in favour of a new individualism lightly sprinkled with social democratic altruism; or, alternatively, merely banal platform rhetoric. Most Labour MPs appear ready to embrace the broad sentiments. They liked the definition of the Labour task as 'to stand again and again for the frustrated ambitions of the majority of our people'. But there was also concern that the sandwich lacked a beefy filing of policy prescriptions. Today, the government's advocacy of further privatisation for such as British Rail and the Post Office appears to be, in Mr Smith's words, 'well beyond the limits of public approval and comprehension'. Yet that is a far from secure guarantee that by 1996-97 Labour will be able to sail to victory as the party of moderation and sound management and a popular hedge against Tory extremism. Nor is it by any means certain that Mr Smith's crusade against vested interests, whether in the privatised utilities, the City or among other elite groups, has any real resonance among the electorate. What seems more certain is that the scramble for the centre-ground of British politics is under way. Furthermore, in spite of the wailing in the wilderness stage from figures such as Mr Bryan Gould, most of the left are still aboard Mr Smith's creaky bandwagon - if sceptically so. Mr Alan Meale, the leftwing MP for Mansfield, commented: 'With Kinnock you could bargain; when Smith takes a decision you either play or you don't. The left must fight its corner from inside.' Nothing in Mr Smith's speech was wildly new. But by declaring the death of dogma, he has nonetheless pushed the party closer to the anti-ideological voters outside its ranks. 'It is,' said one prominent Labour moderniser, 'proof that things are moving in the right direction, but, Lord, why does it have to take so long.'</p>

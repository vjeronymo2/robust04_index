			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. BROWN TO SEEK REELECTION TO ASSURE CONTROL OF DISTRICT  </P> <P> Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton) pledged to seek reelection in 1990 to help  retain the 36th Congressional District seat for his party in the 1991 revision  of district boundaries.  </P> <P> "I've decided to run again for another two-year term," the 68-year-old  legislator said.  </P> <P> Brown previously had committed himself only to completing the term he won in  November, his ninth. The district includes parts of western Riverside and San  Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> "A major consideration in deciding to run again is to assure it (the district)  will not be made into a safe Republican one in the next reapportionment," Brown  said. "In addition, my health is very good, and I am close to a committee  chairmanship."  </P></p>

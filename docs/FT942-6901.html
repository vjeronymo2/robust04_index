			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Daimler chief sees bank stake cut Deutsche Bank, Germany's leading bank, is likely to reduce its stake in Daimler-Benz to between 15 and 20 per cent during the next 10 years, Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of the German motor and engineering company, said yesterday. 'My prediction for 10 years from today is that (the stake) will be 15 to 20 per cent - in that direction,' Mr Reuter said in London. In an industrial-financial partnership established in 1926, Deutsche currently holds 25 per cent of Daimler's equity. The stake was cut from 28 per cent after a share placement earlier this year. At a lunch for US correspondents, Mr Reuter said: 'They (Deutsche Bank) are really trying to withdraw from too heavy industrial engagements, especially in the field of supervisory boards. I think this a very good and very positive development.' Questioned about Daimler's 10 per cent stake in Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and mining group, Mr Reuter gave the clearest indication to date that it might eventually be sold. The stake, taken in 1991 when Daimler saw possibilities of links between the two groups in environmental technology, was no longer regarded as a 'strategic investment', Mr Reuter said. However, Daimler participated fully in a rights issue for Metallgesellschaft earlier this year as a 'comradely' gesture, he said. Mr Reuter, who has been tipped to take over as the next supervisory board chairman of Daimler when he steps down from the management board at the end of next year, elaborated on his strategy of widening the group's equity base. This was part of his drive to give the company 'a truly international culture', he said. The proportion of Daimler shares held in the US could rise to 15 per cent over the longer term, from between 3 and 5 per cent at present, Mr Reuter said. Daimler last October became the first German company to have its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Its one-for-10 rights issue later this summer would have a strong international element to the share-placing, Mr Reuter said. He gave a blunt assessment of the reasons for a record DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.1bn) loss last year. Daimler's business performance, which last year had been 'dramatically rotten', was now reaching 'turnround', he said. 'No-one denies mistakes were made by management. We made evaluations which didn't prove viable,' he said. He cited delays in realising the seriousness of its problems in the business communications field, and in introducing shorter vehicle model cycles. As part of a general move towards restructuring throughout German industry, Mr Reuter said 'nearly a miracle' had taken place since the beginning of last year. Trade union mentalities were changing fast, he said. Dramatic productivity improvements had, however, been bought at the price of high unemployment. 'There was no way we could continue with the old German tradition of 'take it easy'. We're starting again to fight. But the result is high unemployment, not just in Germany but all over Europe.'</p>

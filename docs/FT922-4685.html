			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Foster's shares rise as investors back BHP decision FOSTER'S Brewing Group shares rose 8 cents to a 19-month high of ADollars 2.08 yesterday as Australian investors showed their support for a decision by Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) to put Mr John Elliott's International Brewing Investments (IBI) into receivership. Analysts said BHP's action had laid the groundwork for a significant recovery in the value of Foster's shares, which have been depressed by the financial instability of IBI and International Brewing Holdings (IBH), its privately-owned parent. BHP shares closed unchanged at ADollars 14.40, indicating that investors believe BHP has the financial strength to carry out its pledge to stabilise Foster's by doubling its exposure to the group to more than ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.53bn). BHP appointed receivers to IBI on Tuesday after Mr Elliott failed to produce a plan to repay its preference investment, which amounts to more than ADollars 1bn including accumulated interest. Mr Elliott controlled 32 per cent of Foster's through IBI, and a further 6 per cent was directly owned by IBH, a private company established by Foster's managers in 1989. IBH acquired loans of about ADollars 2.6bn to finance the acquisition of its Foster's shareholding, which was worth about ADollars 1.6bn when the receivers moved in. The company was unable to meet interest payments because of a lack of dividends on the Foster's shares, its only asset. Mr Elliott is expected to return to Australia from New York shortly to discuss the receivership with Mr David Crawford, the KPMG Peat Marwick accountant who has been appointed joint receiver of IBI. BHP is believed to be keen to develop proposals for a merger with Foster's put forward last month by SA Brewing, the South Australian drinks and industrial group. Meanwhile, BHP said talks were continuing with a syndicate of banks led by Hongkong Bank Australia, which is owed ADollars 1.2bn by IBI. BHP has offered to buy the debt to prevent a dispute over security which could destabilise Foster's. BHP has revealed no details of the buy-out deal, but it is believed to have offered to repay the principal, plus interest and costs. Two Australian wine concerns have agreed to merge and list on the Australian Stock Exchange, AP-DJ reports from Adelaide. Berri Renmano, an unlisted public wine concern, proposed last month to merge with Thomas Hardy. The merger will form Australia's second biggest wine company. The merged company, to be known as BRL Hardy, will have sales of over ADollars 200m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia (CTK) -- Deputy Premier Roman  Kovac and leaders of the Associative Council of Romanies of the  Slovak Republic today met to discuss ways of integrating  Romanies into society and their specific suggestions for dealing  with Romany issues.    The main subjects of discussion were Romany education, the  development of Romany culture and social issues. Kovac said the  Romany leaders' suggestions would be worked into a new  government Romany policy program, which will be discussed by the  Slovak Government this March.    Kovac praised the shift in the approach of the Romanies, who  had managed to unite in the Associative Council and to defend  their interests together. This allowed government policy to be  formulated in the spirit of Romany needs, he said.    He also expressed "certain fears" of the possible  immigration  of Romanies from the Czech to the Slovak Republic connected with  a tougher policy on Romanies in the Czech Republic. The latest  report on human rights in the world by the U.S. State Department  had drawn attention to this, Kovac said, adding that the Slovak  Republic would never manage to deal with such immigration  without foreign aid.</p>

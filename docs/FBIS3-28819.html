			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Clinton reportedly said on 11 February  that foreign exchange rates will be included in the "objective  criteria," designed to measure Japan's progress in liberalizing  its market. In this regard, the Japanese Government and the  Bank of Japan [BOJ] are strongly denying the possibility of  introducing the objective criteria, saying: "The exchange rate  should be determined according to the fundamentals (basic  economic conditions) and the U.S. monetary authorities share the  same idea." Saying that "we will fulfill our role as the  monetary authorities if the exchange rate significantly responds  to political factors," the BOJ is prepared to intervene in the  market by selling yen and buying dollars should the value of the  yen increase further at the Tokyo Foreign Exchange market.    Regarding the President's remark, the BOJ points out that  the  President "merely explained a general view that the exchange  rate has an impact on the trade imbalance." In this way, the BOJ  is saying that it is impossible to introduce the objective  criteria.    The President's remark implicitly indicates his intention to  induce Japan's concession by hinting at the possibility of using  the card called "inducing sharp appreciation of the yen" once  again because the Japan-U.S. summit talks failed to produce any  progress. Officially, the government and the BOJ are faking  calm, saying that it is also undesirable for the United States  to incite further increase in the yen's value against the dollar  because it will eventually lead to "a rise in long-term interest  rates in the United States." However, a further increase in  yen's value will also decrease business confidence and might  negate the effect of the economic stimulus package.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today  said he was concerned that certain embassies were showing open  support for subversive elements operating in the country in the  name of democracy. The president said it was saddening that  some opposition groups had issued threats of terrorism in the  run-up to the Lugari by-election, but no embassy had protested  over it.    The president said the failure by the embassies to condemn  the threats showed that they supported subversion and were  putting democracy in the country at risk. President Moi was  speaking at State Lodge, Eldoret, this afternoon when he  received a goodwill delegation of elders from Uasin Gishu  District, who paid him a courtesy call.    He said true democracy was only possible in an atmosphere  where wananchi [citizens] are free to elect their leaders  without any intimidation. President Moi termed the demand by  certain embassies to observe the Lugari by-election as an  interference in the internal affairs of the country. Such  demand said the president was tantamount to supervision and  neocolonialism. [passage omitted]</p>

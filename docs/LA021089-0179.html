			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOSHIBA DEVELOPS CHIP TO REPLACE FLOPPY, HARD DISCS  </P> <P> Toshiba Corp. said today that it has developed a new thumbnail-size memory chip  that may replace floppy and hard discs within three years and drastically  reduce the size of computer systems.  </P> <P> Toshiba officials said the breakthrough device is the "world's first 4-megabit  electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) chip -- the  highest level of integration ever attained in this kind of memory device."  </P> <P> They said the large-capacity chip provides an ultra-fast readout time of 1.6  microseconds, more than 1,000 times faster than floppy discs. It takes one  microsecond to erase or program data, equivalent to or faster than conventional  chips of that type, they said.  </P> <P> Toshiba said the new chip may replace much larger computer memory storage  mediums like floppy or hard discs in three years.  </P> <P> It also has the advantage of not requiring any rotary-drive mechanism. This may  lead to sharp reductions in the size of computer systems, the company said.  </P></p>

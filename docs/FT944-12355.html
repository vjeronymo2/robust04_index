			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / India PC industry growth soars India's personal computer (PC) industry grew at an average of 50 per cent in the first half of the current 1994-95 financial year over the same period of 1993-94, a senior industry official said yesterday. The growth rate ranged between 30 and 70 per cent in various sections, Mr K R Palta, president of the Manufacturers' Association of Information Technology, told a seminar on the industry. India's PC industry had a turnover of Rs43bn (Pounds 844m) in 1993-94, Mr Palta said. 'If we sustain this (50 per cent) growth rate, doubling this figure would not be difficult.' The industry was chasing an annual sales target of 1m PCs, he said. 'It has to hit the target to survive.' Mr Richard Watts, a senior executive of Hewelett-Packard, said. Indian PC-makers must try to tap opportunities emerging from the linkage of digital computing with communication and consumer electronics.</p>

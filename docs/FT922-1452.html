			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Brussels rules in baby nappies row THE European Commission has stopped Finaf of Italy and Procter &amp; Gamble of the US from taking a dominant position in the lucrative EC market in baby nappies, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The two companies will be allowed to create joint ventures in Portugal, Italy and Spain to exploit the market in sanitary protection products. But at the insistence of the Commission, Finaf has said it will withdraw its baby nappy activities from the deal and sell them. The bargain struck between Brussels and the two companies should finally end the Commission's long-running investigation, which began in November 1990. Brussels cleared the deal last October on condition that minor changes were made.

Two months ago, the Commission announced it had changed its mind.</p>

The  guests were allowed to return to their rooms after the winds quieted Friday  afternoon and a National Park Service crew cut down two trees that were  considered potential dangers. There was no damage to any units, said Dan Jensen  of Yosemite Park and Curry Co., which manages the lodge.  </P></p>

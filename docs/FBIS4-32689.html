			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Defense Minister Piotr </F> Kolodziejczyk by Marek Henzler and Marek Ostrowski; place and  date not given: "We Can Afford To Have 10 `Hussars'"]    [Excerpts] [POLITYKA] Mr. Minister, there is an  expression stating that there is always some army stationed  somewhere. If it is not our own, it is a foreign one. What kind  of an army should the Polish Army be, to avoid having foreign  troops stationed in the country? After all, we border three  powerful neighbors.    [Kolodziejczyk] I think I should state first of all that we  are past the Warsaw Pact stage, where we were ascribed the role  of a second-order force. Compared with contemporary needs, the  logistics department, supplies systems, engineering troops, and  everything that was supposed to secure high maneuverability in  the operational space up to and including the Pyrenees has been  developed excessively in our Army. The situation changed when  the Warsaw Pact was dissolved and the Soviet Union collapsed.    Overnight, the countries of the former Warsaw Pact found  themselves without any concept of their own security policies.  Many options were debated, including three fundamental ones:  One was neutrality; a second was what President Walesa called  "Eastern NATO," meaning some alliances without the Soviet Union;  and the third was a very clear pro-NATO one that, in the  beginning, we did not know how to deal with because it  envisioned that, all of a sudden, we are to leave one alliance  in order to join another.    [POLITYKA] So what kind of an army should we really have?  Who should it defend us against?    [Kolodziejczyk] It will be an army of a defensive nature,  but, at the same time, it will be characterized by mobility and  flexibility in terms of the command process, and it will have  three fundamental types of armed forces: Land Forces, with  their own command structure, which we did not have before in a  formal sense. What has been known as military districts up to  now, will, as time goes by, take over the role of military  administration, and they will deal with preparing a defense  system and with training regional troops. A second component of  the Army will consist of the command structure of the Air Force,  and, finally, the command structure of the Navy, which,  generally speaking, will maintain the form it has had  heretofore. At this stage, we have about 248,000 soldiers, even  though, according to treaties, we are allowed to have as many as  288,000, plus we are planning further reductions. These will be  necessary because of our financial situation. We also share the  view of the Germans, who are also cutting the size of their  Army, that, in this day and age, the number of troops is not as  important as the weapons these troops have at their disposal.  This would reduce the expense of maintaining the troops--which  currently reach as much as 65 percent of the National Defense  Ministry's [MON] budget--and instead, allow us to spend more on  modern and incredibly costly equipment. It is true that a  contemporary aircraft is capable of replacing a few or even a  dozen or so aircraft of the previous generation, but the price  of such a new aircraft is shocking: Take for instance the  French Mirage 2000, which costs about $60 million, or a  modernized version of the U.S.-made F-15, which has a price tag  of about $100 million. If we are thinking seriously about our  membership in the Euro-Atlantic security structures, we cannot  just boast about the level of training provided to the troops  but must also catch up with NATO's technical standards.  [passage omitted]    [POLITYKA] Do the Sejm and the government not understand the  needs associated with the country's security? Or is it perhaps  a game of interests that the Army is simply losing?    [Kolodziejczyk] In this situation of shortages in the  budget, strong pressure groups and interest groups have emerged  that have even lead to a breach of the Budget Act by ordering  MON to purchase 300 billion zlotys' worth of Iryda aircraft. It  is a dangerous precedent, and it is good that the president  decided to file a lawsuit over Article 36 of the Budget Act with  the Constitutional Tribunal.    [POLITYKA] So why do you not have your own lobbying group in  parliament, Mr. Minister?    [Kolodziejczyk] The answer is simple. As a man who was  designated by the president to serve in the prime minister's  Cabinet, I am not loved by the coalition, whereas, when it comes  to the opposition, they do not apply such distinctions, and, by  acting against the interests of the coalition, they also act  against me.    [POLITYKA] Would you receive better treatment in the  process of budget designing if MON were not a presidential  ministry?    [Kolodziejczyk] It is not all that bad with my cooperation  with parliament. There are reasonable people there who, even if  they do not know much about Army issues and are guided by  logical thinking only, have a favorable opinion about us. On  the other hand, people who used to work in MON before, currently  have views that amaze me.    [POLITYKA] So the coalition regards you as a president's  man, the parliamentary opposition regards you as a coalition  minister, and extraparliamentary opposition regards you as a  representative of the old, postcommunist military cadre.    [Kolodziejczyk] Unfortunately, this kind of labeling does  exist, but it is a question of approaching defense issues  through political games and personal ambitions. We are still  not successful in overcoming those phenomena. The blame for  such labeling is to be attributed to all political orientations,  and even the Army itself is not free of it.    [POLITYKA] Does the opposition currently have a competitive  concept of the development of the Armed Forces? Are these ideas  worth debating, or is it just a case of teasing the minister?    [Kolodziejczyk] I have not come across any coherent concept  like that. The extraparliamentary opposition is almost  completely absent from the debate--apart from Romuald  Szeremietiew's writing, which appears from time to time, and  which is nothing new, anyway. When it comes to the parliamentary  opposition, they exploit some decisions that are made, for the  purpose of political games and making excessive complaints. Let  us take the first example that comes to mind: the issue of  subordinating the military special services to the chief of the  General Staff, who is responsible for designing operational  plans and who therefore must have the necessary instruments for  that purpose. And that does not mean abandoning supervision  over these services--on the contrary. I have set up an office  for special services, which, on the minister's behalf,  formulates general tasks stemming from the country's defense  policies and controls the implementation of these tasks and the  necessary expenditures associated with them.    [POLITYKA] So, if you have your own concept, should you not  be defending it publicly?    [Kolodziejczyk] But I do defend it in cases in which I am  attacked. I think that an overwhelming majority of the Sejm  National Defense Committee has taken a positive stand on my  concept. Sejm Deputies Janusz Onyszkiewicz and Bronislaw  Komorowski are surprising exceptions in that regard; they should  know better than the rest how the mechanism functions. But they  are the ones making a great fuss that the current minister is  abandoning his power by relinquishing everything for the sake of  the chief of the General Staff of the Polish Army. They also say  that the old ways are coming back. Well, the opposition is  often guided by immediate political interests, and it postpones  real arguments until "better times." It is a tactical maneuver  that is applied not just in this country. There have been  similar accusations concerning changes in the educational  services, but it is precisely Sejm Deputy Komorowski who has  built this huge apparatus of people, many of whom are  incompetent, ignoring the fact that a majority of forces should  be directed to the troops, which is where the educational work  is taking place. The role of MON's educational department  should be limited to programming educational work, cooperating  with other ministries, establishing good rapport with the mass  media, maintaining contact with veterans and youth  organizations, and, finally, supervising the implementation of  fundamental principles of educational policies among the troops.    In other words, the cap should fit the head. Unfortunately,  what we are dealing with here is a scout burdened by a huge  rucksack--a bureaucracy that is excessive compared with common  sense.    Our philosophy boils down to melding the Army and General  Staff structures that are being modernized with  programming/supervision structures that are not too elaborate  and that constitute an efficient element of a system of  democratic supervision over the Armed Forces. We are widely  using the experience of Western countries that have been  applying mechanisms that have stood the test of practice. To  question such a concept and to make the accusation that the  minister, a former military man, is trying to reverse the wheel  of history by trying to reconstruct the old arrangement must be  regarded as a flagrant abuse, which results also in a conviction  among the cadre that the "war at the top" is an obstacle to  solving the enormous problems the Army is facing.    [POLITYKA] You have been criticized for your unwillingness  to place orders with the domestic arms industry. There is even  talk that you are the industry's gravedigger.    [Kolodziejczyk] These accusations only demonstrate the  power of the industrial/trade union lobbying groups in the arms  industry. For us to be able to start cooperating with the  industry in a normal way, these lobbying groups must simply be  brought down.... To go back to the ill-fated Iryda, the point  of view of the Mielec plant is this: to maintain what we already  have, based on the MON budget, without any initiative or  creativity on the part of the plant itself, and to continue, the  philosophy is, in case of problems in drafting a budget, to  force MON to find funds for the purchase of Mielec products,  including by strikes, even in cases where the equipment offered  by the plant does not meet the quality standards expected by the  Army.    [POLITYKA] Still, there must be some objective criteria that  would indicate whether an aircraft is of good or bad quality?    [Kolodziejczyk] The manufacturers are well aware of these  criteria because they have already negotiated for a lowering of  the criteria. This does not facilitate the competitiveness of  Iryda on international markets. I am still hoping that the  Mielec plant will deliver to us the product we have ordered  before the end of this year, while the plant's management will  come to understand that we are not just an ordinary customer--as  it used to be in the past--but a demanding partner. That is  exactly the position taken by the Swidnik plant, with which our  cooperation continues to improve.    [POLITYKA] Maybe they lack not so much goodwill or skills as  they do money?    [Kolodziejczyk] I would not like to analyze this that  deeply. That is the business of the trade and industry minister,  as well as of the plant's management. Still, I do know that the  Mielec plant could have saved itself by accepting an order for a  series of large transport planes for delivery to the United  States. So far, they have decided not to use the opportunity  for reasons that are completely beyond me and that--I hope--a  special institution established for that purpose will soon clear  up. To recap, people working in our arms industry must get it  into their heads that the times when the Army purchased  equipment and arms "just to follow an order" are long gone,  never to return. Currently, the very limited state funds  designated for defense purposes must be spent with great  caution, and I mean purchasing equipment approximating world  standards.    [POLITYKA] The Polish Army is equipped with arms produced  primarily according to Soviet technology. How does one go about  solving problems with overhauls, spare parts, lubricating oils,  engine oils, and specialized ammunition? Does this not further  contribute to our dependence on others, as well as to our  helplessness?    [Kolodziejczyk] There are indeed problems, and they are one  of the main reasons justifying the Visegrad Group's continued  existence. Recently, this was responsible for extending the  scope of cooperation to cover Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania.  All of these countries and ourselves are in the same type of  situation. Currently, we cooperate with anyone who could be of  help in maintaining our military equipment at the highest  possible state of readiness. It is a kind of military  cooperative of self-assistance among colleagues that, with some  amount of goodwill, could, through the coordination of research  and implementation work, minimize the cost and reduce the time  needed for technical modernization of the Armed Forces of the  countries concerned. We are trying very hard to convince our  partners about this concept, but, unfortunately, so far we have  not scored much success. So, for the moment, we must manage on  our own.    [POLITYKA] In which types of arms could we specialize?    [Kolodziejczyk] Take, for instance, radiolocating equipment,  short-range rockets, or helicopters. We also do not hide the  fact that our rifles are good and much cheaper than similar  weapons.    [POLITYKA] Does "Partnership for Peace" open the door for us  in terms of Western technology?    [Kolodziejczyk] If the program is indeed a direct path into  NATO, then it must be associated with access to Western  standards and technology. Unfortunately, Western thinking is  very much dominated by inertia, especially in the context of our  sense of a shortage of time.    A game is in progress in which Russia is the first on the  list to push the break pedal. In that country, changes in  mentality are occurring at an incredibly slow pace, and there  continues to be deep frustration and a yearning for imperialism.    We approach "Partnership for Peace" very seriously, but, if  it turns out that it is a dead-end street, we will withdraw  immediately.    [POLITYKA] How will you be able to tell if it is a dead-end  street?    [Kolodziejczyk] If the initiative is limited to only joint  measures within peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, while  the remaining measures, which would render us closer to NATO  structures, get mired in fruitless debates, this will be a clear  warning signal that we are taking part in a game without stakes.  We will only be able to tell at the end of this year--that is  to say, after an analysis of the legacy of this year's joint  military maneuvers--what the real intentions of our partners  from Brussels are. I hope the net result will be beneficial to  us.    [POLITYKA] Is there a conflict between you as minister and  the chief of the General Staff regarding who is in charge of the  Army? Such views are indeed expressed in the press...    [Kolodziejczyk] I deny such accusations. In the ministry I  am in charge of, subordinates do not argue with their bosses.  But, what is happening is that General Wilecki and I, as well  as others, have been conducting a debate based on a partnership  concept, but I must confess it is heated at times and concerns  the issue of making the management of the country's defense  system rational. Because of Poland's aspirations, the system  should take into account mechanisms in operation in NATO  countries.    [POLITYKA] Is General Wilecki's concept different from  yours?    [Kolodziejczyk] I think it is, even though he never clearly  articulated that. The point is that the military, without its  own will or guilt, was maneuvered into a dispute about the  country's political system. The debate on the structure of  managing the country's defense system must lead to a preliminary  solution, and it must happen before the constitutional debate:  What type of a state system is there supposed to be in the  country? Will it be a presidential system or a  parliamentary/cabinet one? All that makes the solution to  problems that are significant to the Army more remote. It also  delays the parliamentary debate of defense issues and slows down  work on laws that are of crucial importance to the Army. This  game into which the Army unfortunately has been drawn does not  serve the state's interests.    [POLITYKA] Personnel policies are also part of the  democratic supervision over the Armed Forces. What is the story  with the process of building a civilian sector within MON? A  graduate of the National School of Public Administration has  complained to us that the Army showed no interest in him because  the vacancies in the civilian sector must be kept for officers  who are leaving basic service and are being transferred to the  reserve.    [Kolodziejczyk] Meanwhile, I am just now looking for a  candidate for chief of the Personnel Division, and, God, I hope  it will be a civilian! As of today, we can absorb 30 graduates  of the school you mentioned into MON, but nobody wants the jobs  because of the low salaries. That is also a factor slowing down  the "civilianization" of the Army.    [POLITYKA] Recently, Colonel Rozbicki, your press spokesman,  wrote a piece for GAZETA WYBORCZA on the topic of the Army. The  way the case ended up was that a scandal erupted, and he was  dismissed...    [Kolodziejczyk] That is because he presented himself as  writing on behalf of the minister, but he had not discussed this  with me. In the article, he questioned the disarmament treaties  concluded by Poland. It was a case of arbitrary behavior and  abuse on his part.    [POLITYKA] But he also wrote that his views reflect the  opinions of a large portion of the officer cadre...    [Kolodziejczyk] Nobody has done any research on this.    [POLITYKA] At a recent meeting in Brussels, the issue of  Kaliningrad and the troops stationed there was discussed again.  Is it your feeling that Russia is trying to evade a neighborly  discussion on defense issues?    [Kolodziejczyk] Absolutely yes. What is happening is that a  superpower whose position was once significant but that is  currently going through major problems is demonstrating  sulkiness. Poland is the most active country in its efforts to  join NATO. For that reason, among others, Russia has a sick  obsession about us because it thinks we are the ones who are  leading others down the road to NATO, and Russia thinks we are  doing this against the interests of those countries. Our  Russian neighbors do not want or cannot understand that NATO is  going through a deep transformation--from a military bloc to the  foundations of a common security system that is emerging on our  continent. I also regret the fact that bilateral relations,  despite our openness, are not as good as those with our  remaining neighbors. Minister Grachev has been saying for some  time now that his agenda is filled with events and that is the  reason he cannot come to Warsaw. And I say to that: That is  your mistake because we must sit down and explain to each other  some arguments, exchange reasons and opinions, and jointly look  for mutually beneficial solutions. But I hope that now that  Russia has joined "Partnership for Peace" there will be a better  climate for our mutual relations to develop better.    [POLITYKA] We thank you for the conversation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Opening remarks by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at </F> joint news conference with U.S. President Bill Clinton from the  Borispol airport near Kiev--live]    [Text] [Kravchuk] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen: I am glad  to welcome the President of the United States of America, Bill  Clinton, and the persons accompanying him in Ukraine. Of  course, I am sorry that this visit is brief, however, I hope  that the U.S. President will visit Ukraine on a full-scale  basis, appropriately, and we shall be able to show him Ukraine  as it is. I invite you, Mr. President, to visit Ukraine  whenever this is most convenient for you. This was a short  visit which had lasted only several hours but, in my opinion, it  was worth several-day long negotiations because those problems  which we discussed and what has just been mentioned by Mr.  President are really worth the world's interest in what we  agreed on and in the documents which we are to sign in Moscow.    I believe that the most important issue for Ukraine, for  Europe, and for the entire world is the nuclear issue. We have  approached its solution in concrete terms. I am convinced that  this day and the coming days open the way before the world for  disarmament and nuclear armaments elimination. Ukraine will  fulfill its obligations, Ukraine will not be in the way of  nuclear disarmament.    Naturally, the major part of our consultations was devoted  to  discussing various aspects of Ukrainian-American relations. I  am pleased to note that the American side, the U.S. President,  support our state's sovereignty and independence in the  difficult time of our formation as a nation. I believe that  such assistance is a specific form of partnership for the sake  of developing democracy in Ukraine, for the sake of democratic  processes on the territory of the former Soviet Union. I am  convinced that the charter of partnership, friendship, and  cooperation whose text is being worked up by our experts and is  near completion, will become a very important stage in the  development of our mutual relations. Very important for us is  the understanding on the part of U.S. President of the problems  facing the economy and the problems of the economic reform and  support of the economic reform in Ukraine. I am satisfied with  the fact that the U.S. President will support our state at the  international financial structures, such as the International  Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development.    We are aware of the fact that resoluteness and  responsibility  for the implementation of the economic reform are required, and  we are ready for this. We are also satisfied with the fact that  trade relations between our countries are developing today and  that new prospects for their development will open up.    We support the U.S. initiative concerning its formula called  Partnership for Peace. We believe that this is a universal  formula involving all states and providing them with an  opportunity to participate. We understand that this program  cannot solve all the security problems, but it provides an  opportunity for all the states to take an active part in the  program.    I would like to welcome, once again, the President of the  United States of America to Ukraine and express satisfaction  with the fact that we reached relevant understanding and common  points of view on all the issues which we discussed. Although  brief, today's meeting was very important and productive. It  opened up a qualitatively new page in Ukrainian-American  relations which from now on, I am sure, will have a stable and  reliable future.    I thank everybody for their attention.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Thomas Klaus: "Flogging for `Germany Haters'"] </F>   [Text] Sometimes big is not big enough. This seems to be  the opinion of the Alliance for Overall Germany -- Voters  Association of East Germans, Central, and West Germans (BGD)  [Bund fuer Gesamtdeutschland -- Ostdeutsche, Mittel, und  Westdeutsche Waehlergemeinschaft], which has its seat in  Duisburg. Thus, it considers unification with the former GDR  just one step on the path toward the creation of "Overall  Germany," which would include, among other areas, Memelland,  Eastern Prussia, Gdansk, Pommerania, Western Prussia, Eastern  Brandenburg, Silesia, and the Sudeten region.  <H5>  "German Reich Continues To Exist" </H5>   The BGD basic program says it clearly: "The German Reich did  not cease to exist as a subject of international law in 1945.  It simply lost its ability to to act as a result of military  occupation." At the federal party congress in Miltenberg in  April 1993, the strictly rightist splinter party hungered for  retaliation: "The annexation of foreign territory and the  driving of people away from their homes" must be "made good  again" because it is a "most serious strain on any community of  peoples," a "crime."    However, things have not yet gone that far. Therefore, the  BGD is smelling betrayal of the people and hostile lobbyists at  the levers of power in our country. The basic program whines  about the destruction of the "cultural and ethnic identity of  the German people" by "multicultural changes." In the party  newsletter (the new title: UNSERE DEUTSCHE HEIMAT [OUR GERMAN  HOMELAND]), BGD Chairman Horst Zaborowski throws another piece  of wood on the fire: "Not once in our 2,000-year-old history,"  he complains, "has the simultaneous foreign rule over the German  people in its material and intellectual substance been achieved  as perfectly as in our days."    At the end of 1993, in the same newsletter, the 67-year-old  ex-businessman added to his views. In his article "Freedom for  Germany," he emphatically called for "getting rid of the  restrictions that have been imposed on the German people since  1945." In Zaborowski's view, the fact that "for the last 45  years," German history "has been limited to the period from 1933  to 1945 and, in the process, has been distorted" is due to the  "biggest manipulation in human history."  <H5>  "Sheep on the EC Pasture" </H5>   The process leading toward the European Union (EU) is a  thorn  in the side of Zaborowski and his followers. Even though the  BGD is running in this year's elections to the European  Parliament, it categorically demands Germany's departure from  the European Union (Zaborowski: "conceived as a prison for our  German people").    It fits into the picture when, in a memorandum to the  members, retired priest Walter Fischer from Sangershausen smells  a "new conspiracy against Germany": "From the inside by the  controlled media, from the outside by constantly reminding us  Germans of the brown [fascist] period and degrading us to humble  sheep on the EC pasture." However, the theologian seems to like  being reminded of his eight years in the "Hitler Youth." These  years "gave me, who was permitted to become a soldier because of  a cardiac defect, much of what I wish with all my heart for our  poor, misguided rock and pop youth -- namely, love for my  homeland, discipline, comradeliness, courage, and idealism."    It also fits the picture when the BGD organ UNSERE DEUTSCHE  HEIMAT makes propaganda for maps produced by Publishing House  for Folklore and Research Into Contemporary History [Verlag fuer  Volkstum und Zeitgeschichtsforschung] in Vlotho. Its owner, Udo  Walendy, is a former Bundestag candidate of the NPD [National  Democratic Party] and already belonged to the NPD Presidium at a  time when this right-wing extremist party had just been  established in 1964. In his publishing company, Walendy has  published, among others, the book The Auschwitz Lie  by Nazi propagandist Thies Christophersen.  <H5>  Rhyming Racial Teachings </H5>   The BDG organ has also printed poems by Renate Schuette, who  has repeatedly published her effusions in papers of the  terrorist FAP [Liberal Workers Party]. In her collection of  verse, entitled Racial Teachings, it says: "Tempting  someone to mix races/is large-scale genocide/Many proud empires  have died early/when they succumbed to this mania."  [German-language original rhymes]    There are also links with the monthly DER SCHEINWERFER. In a  1990 study conducted by the Protestant Students' Community in  Bonn, the paper is accused of containing "anti-Semitic, racist,  revisionist, and antidemocratic articles." Among the permanent  employees of the editorial office, one finds Siegfried  Neubacher, BGD district chairman of Upper Franken and candidate  in the elections to the European Parliament.    Neubacher's Bavarian land association is headed by Mathias  Weifert, 33 and a representative of the younger generation, who  is studying sociology with Professor Lothar Bossle in Wuerzburg.  Bossle, a former confidant of Franz Josef Strauss [late  Bavarian minister-president], moves in BGD circles and is a very  controversial man because of his dubious connections with the  military dictatorship in Chile and the Mun Sect. However,  Bossle is still suitable as a conservative pretense for the BGD,  which is rolling about in brownish waters.</p>

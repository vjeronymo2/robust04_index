			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 2 ARRESTED IN HIT-AND-RUN DEATH OF N. HOLLYWOOD FLOWER VENDOR  </P> <P> A teen-ager selling flowers at a North Hollywood intersection died after he was  struck by a car driven by an alleged hit-and-run driver whose vehicle also  crashed into three cars before it stopped and he was arrested, Los Angeles  police said today.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old North Hollywood boy, whose name was not released pending  notification of relatives, was standing on the center divider at Sherman Way  and Laurel Canyon Boulevard about 6 p.m. Monday when he was struck by a car  driven by Martin Hernandez Torres, 23, of Tujunga, Officer Dennis Smith said.  </P> <P> Smith said Torres was driving north on Laurel Canyon and attempted to turn left  against a red arrow on Sherman Way. As he did, his vehicle hit the rear of a  car driving south on Laurel Canyon. The impact sent Torres' car barreling over  the center divider of Sherman Way, where it hit the youth.  </P> <P> Witnesses told police that Torres backed over the boy as he fled the scene,  driving west on Sherman Way. The boy was taken to AMI Medical Center of North  Hollywood, where he died a short time later.  </P> <P> Smith said Torres' car collided with two other vehicles as he attempted to turn  south on Whitsett Avenue from Sherman Way. Torres was chased from the scene of  the second collision by two motorcycle officers who witnessed the crashes. In  the 6800 block of Whitsett, Torres and a passenger, Alejandro Torres, 33, got  out of the car and ran but were found nearby.  </P> <P> Both were arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter. Martin Torres also  was arrested on suspicion of three counts of felony drunk driving, driving  without a license and driving without auto insurance. Both were being held in  lieu of $5,000 bail.  </P> <P> Alejandro Torres was treated for minor injuries at the County-USC Hospital jail  ward. Police were uncertain whether the two men are related.  </P></p>

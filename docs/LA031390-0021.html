			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> 7 OFFICIALS SPENT $4,997 ON 4-DAY TRIP  </P> <P> Four Simi Valley City Council members and three staff members have submitted  $4,997 in receipts for a recent trip to the annual National League of Cities  conference in Washington, D.C., officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The money covered hotel, meals and transportation expenses for the four-day  trip, March 3-6, Councilman Glen McAdoo said.  </P> <P> The city, he said, got more than its money's worth.  </P> <P> "Five thousand dollars is not bad" for seven people, McAdoo said. "That wasn't  even enough to cover it. It cost me $800 of my own money. I had to take  personal vacation time to do it."  </P> <P> Last year, Simi Valley officials were reimbursed $23,242 for expenses incurred  last year on various trips to Sacramento, Washington, D.C., and New Orleans,  Deputy City Manager Bob Heitzman said.  </P> <P> McAdoo said it was imperative for Simi Valley officials to attend certain  out-of-town functions, such as the League of Cities conference, which annually  draws hundreds of city officials from all over the country.  </P> <P> He said that with the ever-growing number of special interest groups, city  officials cannot afford to miss a chance to meet with state representatives and  push for their fair share of federal funds and programs.

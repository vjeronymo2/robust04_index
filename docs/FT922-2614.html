			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / E Germany's industrial production up sharply DAILY industrial production in east Germany rose 10.5 per cent in March. The increase, attributable mainly to a 22.5 per cent surge from the construction industry, was the first significant month-on-month rise since last November. Manufacturing industry also enjoyed a 12 per cent increase. However, the economics ministry said the figures were heavily influenced by seasonal factors. Aggregate industrial output for February and March together is was still 3.8 per cent below the same two months in 1991. The investment goods sector fell 7.3 per cent while consumer goods manufacturing rose 10.5 per cent during the two months. Mining and energy output fell sharply by 40 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. Meanwhile, west German consumer prices increased by a revised 0.4 per cent in May, bringing the year-on-year rate to 4.6 per cent, according to the federal statistics office. The main upwards pressure came from a 7.2 per cent rise in the so-called 'car drivers' index' - an aggregate calculation covering the costs of owning and running a private car. The retail price index was 3.3 per cent up on the year, but rents and the cost of services and repairs showed above average increases of 5.1 per cent and 5.6 per cent.</p>

Rojas was met by Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion;  Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, the joint staff chief;  and other Defense Ministry officials and military leaders.    The Chilean minister will remain here just a few hours, as  he  is scheduled to return to Santiago this afternoon after meeting  with Camilion and lunching at the Alvear Palace Hotel.    In remarks to the journalists, the two defense ministers  ruled out the possibility of discussing the Laguna del Desierto  border problem.    For his part, Camilion said the purchase of the A-4 Skyhawk  planes will be decided during the meetings that Foreign Minister  Guido Di Tella will hold with U.S. officials in the United  States.    Camilion also confirmed a donation by the United States of  three Hercules C-130 planes that will possibly arrive in  Argentina before the end of the month.</p>

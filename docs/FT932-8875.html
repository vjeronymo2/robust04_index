			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Central Office's quiet leap forward TODAY'S INAUGURAL meeting of the Conservative party's new board of management represents another important step in the quiet revolution set in train at Smith Square by Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman. The twin aims of this discreet but comprehensive overhaul are to solve the pressing problem of the party's deficit and to modernise creaking structures which in some cases date from the 1930s. Only fleetingly - as in this spring's meeting of the party's central council at Harrogate, where a rare grassroots rebellion derailed some of Sir Norman's proposals - has the process featured in newspaper headlines. But the changes are no less significant for that, having already triggered the closure of four out of 10 English regional offices and a 40 per cent reduction in Central Office staff. When completed, they will have transformed the party's fundraising, accounting and internal co-ordination. A more ruthless and efficient election-fighting machine is the intended result. Meeting for the first time with a whiff of crisis hanging over both party and government following this month's election disasters, the board of management was set up to act like a company's board of directors. One of two key bodies the reforms will establish, it brings together senior members of the party's professional, elected and voluntary wings. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of the food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan, will bring an external perspective as a non-executive member. A quota of four of the 11 members should enable Central Office to retain a reasonably solid grip on decision-making. The other new body is a board of treasurers, which is intended to add a new edge to the party's fundraising. Under Mr Charles Hambro, its recently appointed chairman, the board will consist of six or seven well-known figures from commerce and industry whose contacts and experience will be exploited to broaden the base of the party's donors. The board was set up following prime minister John Major's decision to depart from the practice of some of his predecessors by including fundraising among the party chairman's responsibilities. With a target of erasing its deficit by 1996, it is not surprising that the party is trying to inject new impetus into its fundraising. But Sir Norman recently wrote to Mr Hambro to 'make it quite clear' that fundraising must be 'independent of any suggestion of political influence'. Donors should be motivated by a desire to sustain a party promoting free enterprise and not by a wish to put pressure on the government to enact certain specific policies. The party will insist that donors make appropriate disclosure of their contributions when there are legal requirements to do so. In certain circumstances, Mr Judge suggests, the party may 'even take references'. Fuller accounts are to be published in a move to counter criticism of the secrecy with which the party surrounds its financial affairs. But these will not include specific details about donors. On accepting foreign money, Mr Judge says donors usually have 'a pretty good reason for wanting to do it and it is usually because they have business or property interests here'. If an entity with no apparent UK assets offered money, the party would 'certainly look at it'.</p>

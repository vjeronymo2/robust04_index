			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Iraq sets out to exploit UN's lack of options: Mark Nicholson on prospects for today's meeting in New York WHATEVER happens at today's meeting between an Iraqi delegation led by Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister, and members of the United Nations Security Council, the two sides are certain to agree on nothing of substance. The purpose of the New York visit - the first time a senior Iraqi minister has set foot in the US since the Gulf war - is to tell the council that Baghdad is complying with the UN ceasefire resolutions which demand the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction. Last night in New York Mr Aziz appealed for sanctions against Iraq to be lifted. After briefing Third World members of the UN, he said that, now Baghdad had met its obligations, the UN should relieve the 'severe hardships' the trade embargo imposed on 18m Iraqi citizens. Today Mr Aziz, in the hope of loosening UN resolve over sustaining the embargo, will publicise the effect on Iraq of 20 months of economic sanctions. Iraq yesterday released a Health Ministry report claiming that more than 21,000 people, 8,000 of them children under five, have died in the first two months of this year from food and drug shortages. The report also says that the embargo has cost 120,000 Iraqi lives in all. However, council members, most vocally the US, Britain and France, will insist that Iraq is in grave breach of the ceasefire resolutions and that, unless it both reveals more of its weapons programmes and destroys what has been found, 'serious consequences' will ensue. Dark warnings of a military strike will be uttered. Members will also reprimand Iraq over its internal economic blockade of the Kurds in the north of the country and its mistreatment of Shia Moslems in the south and insist that it release hundreds of remaining Kuwaiti hostages. And, into the bargain, they will ask why Iraq has refused to sell Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil to buy food and medicine under a special UN dispensation  -one which runs out on March 19. Iraq argues that the embargo infringes its sovereignty. Today's meeting will thus cover familiar ground, and there is nothing to indicate that it will do anything to soften familiar Iraqi intransigence: it is more likely to highlight the UN's difficulties in forcing Iraqi compliance. The victorious Gulf war allies are considering all possible means of tightening the squeeze, short of the ultimate sanction of a further military strike. But options are limited. One suggestion that has emerged from within the US administration is to seize Iraq's Dollars 5bn of overseas assets and use the money to pay for the UN Special Commission charged with investigating and destroying Iraq's weapons programmes, offer relief aid to the Kurds and Shias and pay some compensation to Kuwait. While this proposal might appear to be able to kill a flock of birds with one stone, Britain and France argue that it would present insurmountable legal problems to enforce. 'This one's not going anywhere,' a British official said. Another suggestion is that the council should seize, and similarly spend, Iraq's Dollars 300m deposit with the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. But this also is unlikely to win favour, not least because Switzerland is not part of the UN. Other proposals being aired include the dispatch of UN human rights monitors to Iraq and the possible extension of the protection zone for the Kurds in northern Iraq further south of the 36th parallel. Short of an outright attack, however, there appears to be few effective courses of action apart from hoping that the threat of a strike, combined with intensified military manoeuvres in the Gulf, will frighten Iraq's leadership into compliance. But the west knows that Mr Saddam is not easily frightened or bluffed. It also knows that, even given sufficient political support in the UN for a further military raid, an attack would not necessarily push Mr Saddam into compliance. A strike might destroy weapons and the manufacturing sites which UN inspectors have discovered, but this would only deter Iraq from revealing further components of the weapons and nuclear programmes that UN inspectors are sure it is hiding. Furthermore, the domestic political consequences for the election-conscious governments of the US and Britain would be appealing only insofar as a raid succeeded immediately either in bringing Iraq to heel or, perhaps, in toppling Mr Saddam's regime. UN officials acknowledge that there is little more to be done in the medium-term beyond doggedly and intrusively pursuing further details of Iraq's nuclear and weapons programmes on the ground. Another team of nuclear experts will enter Iraq early next month, and a team of chemical weapons inspectors is at work this week destroying more than 450 damaged chemical warheads. 'Our very presence there is a hindrance (to Iraqi plans),' said a UN official, but 'there's very little else we can practically do, but make plain to Iraq that it's not just the UK and US, but the entire Security Council which will not consider lifting sanctions until Iraq complies.'</p>

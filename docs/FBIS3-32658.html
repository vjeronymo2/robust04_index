"If that is  going to be a marketplace, we are going to remove the money  changers from the temple," President Carlos Roberto Reina has  said.    Visibly cross, the president has reacted to questions from  reporters who asked him about the behavior of certain Government  House officials and the limitations that have been imposed on  normal journalistic activities. He asked for respect for the  dignity of the presidential office, saying he will guarantee  freedom of speech and the conditions necessary for journalists  to obtain news. "If there is some regulation someone does not  like, we will explain and discuss it," he has said.    Reina defended Lucio Izaguirre, his private secretary. He  resented the way Izaguirre has been criticized, saying it was  denigrating and rude. It has been reported that Izaguirre is  the official who has clashed with the press as a result of  unfortunate statements. He has also not established any type of  direct relationship with the reporters who cover the  Presidential House.    Reina said the moral revolution has many enemies. They are  the corrupt individuals "who want to confuse public opinion," he  said. He accused "certain journalists" of wanting to plant  doubts about the moral revolution, saying extreme measures  cannot be taken only six days after taking office.    He has asked reporters to help him stop those doubts,  adding:  "If the press does not help me, the moralization objectives  might be sullied."    Very angry, Reina told one of the reporters it is false the  doors to information in the Government House have been closed.  "It is not true, it is not true," he stated emphatically.  "That is what they have said to tarnish the moral revolution,"  he said.</p>

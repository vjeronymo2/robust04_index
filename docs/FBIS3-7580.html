			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in  Burmese at 1300 GMT on 28 March carries a 63-minute report on  the 28 March plenary session of the National Convention on  drawing up the basic principles for drafting the new  constitution, which was held in the Central Meeting Hall of the  President's Residence compound on Ahlone Road, Rangoon. The  reports includes recorded extracts of the proposal papers read  by nine delegates from the special invitees and political  parties group.    First, U Aung Hkam Ti, a Pa-o national of the Southern Shan  State Special Region-6, reads the report which describes the  ethnic origin and language of Pa-o nationals. Elaborating on  the basic principle prohibiting secession from the Union, he  notes the secession clause in the Soviet Constitution which has  led to the current disintegration of the Soviet Union and points  out "the need to prevent any opportunity for secession."  Therefore, he proposes to include a clause in the constitution  which will prohibit any region, state, self-administered  division, and self-administered zone from seceding from the  Union. The report then points out the weakness of a system of  government led by a prime minister and proposes a presidential  system of government. He concludes the report by calling upon  other groups of delegates to strive to make the constitution  more complete through their proposals.    Next, U Aik Mone of the Northern Shan State Special  Region-7,  reads the report of the group, describing the ethnic origin,  language, culture, and traditions of the Ta-ang Palaung  nationals and their involvement in the tea industry and  agriculture. He explains that the Ta-ang Palaung prefer to call  themselves Ta-ang. He estimates that the congruous territory  inhabited by Ta-ang Palaung covers: "1. the vicinity of and  within Mogok Township in Mandalay Division; 2. the vicinity and  the town of Kyaukme in Kyaukme Township, where Ta-ang Palaung  constitutes 60 percent of the township population; 3. the  western and northern parts of Hsipaw Township; 4. Namtu  Township, where 70 percent of the population are Ta-ang Palaung;  5. Mong Mit Township, where Ta-ang Palaung constitute 40  percent of the township population; 6. Kutkai Township, where  50 percent of the population is Ta-ang Palaung; 7. Namhkam  Township, where Ta-ang Palaung constitutes 70 percent of the  population; 8. Namhsan Township in Northern Shan State, where  90 percent of the population is Ta-ang Palaung. The population  of about 600,000 Ta-ang Palaung live collectively in this  congruous territory." Furthermore, there are Ta-ang Palaung  living in Lashio, Tangyan, Mu-se, and Mong Hsu townships in the  Northern Shan State; Kalaw, Aungban, Lawksawk, and Ywagnan  townships in the Southern Shan State; and Keng Tung, Mong Hkak,  Mong Hsat, and Mong Ping in the Eastern Shan State."    The report proposes that, in consideration of their desire  to  live peacefully with their own language, literature, culture,  customs, and traditions, it is proposed that the Ta-ang  nationals be made the "Ta-ang self-administered division," that  the term "Ta-ang be used instead of Palaung," that "the Mong  Tung region be declared a grade-1 level township, and the Mong  La region be declared Mong La grade-1 level township."    He expresses support for the undertakings of the government  for development of the border regions. In conclusion, he calls  on the delegates to consider his proposals with patience and  magnanimity.    Next, U Kyaw Myint alias U Win Maung of Namhkam presented  his  proposal in his capacity as chairman of the Khulon Lishso  National League. He says the real ethnic name of his group is  not Lisu but Lihso, and explains the existence of various groups  of Lihso. He says most of the Khulon Lisu of Lihso live in the  northern parts of Shan State and they are spread throughout  Myanmar [BurmaBurma Television Network Burmese    Next, U Khin Maung, member of the Central Executive  Committee  of the National Unity Party [NUP], continues reading the NUP  report. He says the status of self-administered divisions and  self-administered zones should be given if the following  requirements are met: "A. a national race which has not  obtained the status of region or state; B. an appropriate size  of population; C. a collective inhabitation in a congruous  territory; D. having a territory which includes existing  townships that can be formed into at least two districts." He  says delicate ethnic issues in the country should be settled  with love, consideration, trust, and under the principle of  racial harmony. He also calls for consideration of the level of  economic development, administrative skill, communications,  racial background, religion, language, customs, and traditions  in deciding on the ethnic issue. He proposes the "prescription  of self-administered zones and self-administered divisions in  the appropriate areas within the regions and states." He then  refers to the existence of Wa, Kokang, Pa-o, Palaung communities  in the Shan State and Naga communities in Sagaing Division and  says they should be entitled to self- administered area status.    Next, the report of the the Union Pa-o National Organization  is read by U Aung Khin. He welcomes the efforts to upgrade the  political status of national races by giving them  self-administration under the new constitution. He stresses  "the time has now come to give the status of self-administered  divisions and self-administered zones to national races who have  not yet obtained their own state." He explains that Ho-pang  meets the requirement for population and congruous territory and  calls for its recognition as "a self-administered division for  the Pa-o." He suggests that the constitution should include a  provision prohibiting secession.    Addressing the chapter on the head of state, he proposes  that  the electoral college be composed of three groups from two  chambers of Parliament to elect a president and two presidents.    The plenary session goes into recess at 1350. When the  session resumes at 1420, U Ti Dar Wai of the Shan State Kokang  Democratic Party reads his party's paper. He says that "Kokang  nationals would like to have the status of a self-administered  division where they can live lawfully with their own literature,  language, culture, and customs and that they would like to live  in peace and freedom under a stable political system formed  along democratic lines which fully guarantees human rights." He  defines "the original size of the territory of Kokang  self-administered zone as an area composed of the (Wetmauk) and  (Kongtha) townships, which existed under the old constitution."  He then discusses the principles for determining the status of  a self-administered division and self-administered zone. He  proposes that, like Kachins, who already have their own state,  other national races should have their self-administered  division or zone in other states and regions and that national  races like Kokang, Wa, Pa-o, Mro or Khami, Palaung, Lihso, Naga,  Lahu, and Akhar should be entitled to a self-administered  division or self- administered zone.    Continuing, he proposes that "the constitution includes a  provision to recognize the peacekeeping force [nyein-chan-ye  tat-phwe] as a legitimate people's armed peacekeeping force in  order to provide national security, security of a respective  self- administered division or self-administered zone,  protection of the life and property of the people, and  protection for the democratic system."    Next, the proposal paper of the Mro or Khami National  Solidarity Organization is read by its representative, U Tha Pan  Aung, of Rakhine State's, Buthidaung Township. He points out  the weakness of the 1947 Constitution, which contains divisive  provisions for national races.    Continuing, he expresses the belief that the granting of a  self- administered zone or self-administered division should not  be based on population and territory alone, but also based on  the historical background of the races concerned. He explains  that Mro or Khami nationals live in the northern part of Rakhine  State and some areas of the Chin Hills. He says the Mro or  Khami would like to live collectively in an area as they have  done in the past. Therefore, he proposes an area consisting of  some townships because of threats from insurgents. The  population of Lihso is estimated to be about 70,000 and most of  the Lihso -- about 40,000 -- live around the Namhkam-Kutkai  mountain range. He asks the alternate chairman to consider  whether the Lihso living in Namhkam-Kutkai area are entitled to  self-administered zone status and to consider the alternative if  the group is not entitled to the status. He says his group is  prepared to abide by the decision of the national convention.  He admits he cannot say whether his presentations are relevant  to the chapter on state structure and asks the national  convention to either put them on record or insert them under an  appropriate chapter heading.    Next, special invitee delegate U Myint Lwin alias U Wan  Twetar from Kutkai Township, representing the Lun nationals from  Northeastern Burma, presents his proposal. He explains the  loyalty of the Lun ethnic group to the country and proposes that  the "Lun national race be added to the list of national races  when the constitution is promulgated". He says he is prepared  to be abide by the decision of the National Convention.    Next, U Tun Yi, general secretary of the National Unity  Party, presents his party's report, which suggests: "1. Myanmar  is a sovereign independent democratic republic; 2. the state  shall be called the Republic of the Union of Myanmar; 3. the  Republic of the Union of Myanmar is a nation where leaders of  national races with equal status have lived eternally in harmony  and unity; 4. the sovereign power of the state stems from the  citizens and reside in the entire country; 5. the legislative,  administrative, and judicial powers which stem from the citizens  and the central organs of state power which represent the  citizens and which are established in accordance with the  constitution are to exercise these powers according to law.  Civil service organizations or a single civil service personnel  delegated by the central organs of state power shall be able to  legally utilize these powers;" "6. the territory of the  Republic of the Union of Myanmar shall be the land, sea, and  airspace which constitute its territory on the day the  constitution is adopted."    Next, U Khin Maung, member of the Central Executive  Committee  of the National Unity Party [NUP], continues reading the NUP  report. He says the status of self-administered divisions and  self-administered zones should be given if the following  requirements are met: "A. a national race which has not  obtained the status of region or state; B. an appropriate size  of population; C. a collective inhabitation in a congruous  territory; D. having a territory which includes existing  townships that can be formed into at least two districts." He  says delicate ethnic issues in the country should be settled  with love, consideration, trust, and under the principle of  racial harmony. He also calls for consideration of the level of  economic development, administrative skill, communications,  racial background, religion, language, customs, and traditions  in deciding on the ethnic issue. He proposes the "prescription  of self-administered zones and self- administered divisions in  the appropriate areas within the regions and states." He then  refers to the existence of Wa, Kokang, Pa-o, Palaung communities  in the Shan State and Naga communities in Sagaing Division and  says they should be entitled to self- administered area status.    Next, the report of the the Union Pa-o National Organization  is read by U Aung Khin. He welcomes the efforts to upgrade the  political status of national races by giving them  self-administration under the new constitution. He stresses  "the time has now come to give the status of self-administered  divisions and self-administered zones to national races who have  not yet obtained their own state." He explains that Ho-pang  meets the requirement for population and congruous territory and  calls for its recognition as "a self-administered division for  the Pa-o." He suggests that the constitution should include a  provision prohibiting secession.    Addressing the chapter on the head of state, he proposes  that  the electoral college be composed of three groups from two  chambers of Parliament to elect a president and two presidents.    The plenary session goes into recess at 1350. When the  session resumes at 1420, U Ti Dar Wai of the Shan State Kokang  Democratic Party reads his party's paper.

He then discusses the principles for determining the status of  a self-administered division and self-administered zone. He  proposes that, like Kachins, who already have their own state,  other national races should have their self-administered  division or zone in other states and regions and that national  races like Kokang, Wa, Pa-o, Mro or Khami, Palaung, Lihso, Naga,  Lahu, and Akhar should be entitled to a self-administered  division or self-administered zone.    Continuing, he proposes that "the constitution includes a  provision to recognize the peacekeeping force [nyein-chan-ye  tat-phwe] as a legitimate people's armed peacekeeping force in  order to provide national security, security of a respective  self-administered division or self-administered zone, protection  of the life and property of the people, and protection for the  democratic system."

He says the Mro or  Khami would like to live collectively in an area as they have  done in the past. Therefore, he proposes an area consisting of  some townships in the northern Rakhine State and (?Falam) as a  self-administered division for Mro or Khami.    Addressing the issue of head of state, he proposes that the  electoral college for electing the president and two vice  presidents be composed of all members from the two chambers of  Parliament.    The plenary session ends at 1540.</p>

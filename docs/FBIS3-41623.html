			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Neskoromnyy, journalist, Moscow: </F> ``Through Russian Potholes in a `Little Old Ford,' or, Is the  Peaceful Atom Not as Scary As It Is Presented?'']    [Text] Stop a passerby on the street and ask him  about ecology. Undoubtedly he will just shrug his shoulders in  surprise. Really, do we have time for that? They say that  ecological problems are the problems of a ``well-fed'' society.  For now, our society is not in that category. It is not  improbable, however, that after having assured ourselves of a  reliable piece of bread, we shall find ourselves under a sky  that is riddled with ozone holes. This problem faces both the  ``well-fed'' society that promotes the consumers' paradise, as  well as the ``hungry,'' who have been tightening their belts for  severty years in expectation of mythical benefits. We all live  on the same planet. What will convince us? Poplar leaves one  meter long? Six-legged colts or toxic fish that attack people? A  second Chernobyl? Or a third or fourth...?    The discrediting of Russian nuclear energy is the goal of  the  ``Greenpeace Russia'' ecological organization, according to  Sergey Yermakov, deputy chief of the Department for Public  Information and Communication of the Russian Federation's  Ministry of Atomic Energy (``Who Benefits From It?'' DELOVOY  MIR, 30 July 1993). He reached this conclusion ``without having  any direct evidence,'' but based only on the ``activities of one  branch of `Greenpeace Russia.''' He noticed that one of its  leaders, a certain Litvinov, who is a United States citizen, has  a Russian passport. S. Yermakov concluded that ``Litvinov and a  number of other activists of that organization are not  concealing the fact that as a first priority they are carrying  out plans to discredit Russian electrical and nuclear power.''  The representative of the Ministry of Atomic Energy declined to  comment on ``this fact,'' and suggested that readers can do it  themselves independently. Well, what kind of commentary is  proposed here? In order to answer, we have to remember what was  talked about a little earlier: ``... behind the attempts to  discredit Russian nuclear power stations ... is the desire to  squeeze Russia out of her traditional markets and lessen the  interest of her potential partners in purchasing Russian nuclear  power equipment and technology, as well as an attempt to impart  an inferiority complex' to our experts, so that it would be  easier to obtain new ideas, plans, and technology from Russia.''  Continuing in this same terminological vein, it is fully logical  to suspect ``Greenpeace Russia'' of wanting to weaken the  country's security....    The international ecology organization ``Greenpeace'' was  formed in 1971. It has its branches in dozens of countries and  is presently supported by five million inhabitants of our  planet. Nothing at all can be said about any kind of assistance  from ``Greenpeace Russia'' with regard to increasing security  measures at Russian nuclear power stations, a step that has been  called for both by the representative of the Ministry of Atomic  Energy and by the editorial offices of DELOVOY MIR. The goal of  that organization is to present the problems to governments,  which should then resolve them. ``Greenpeace''--as an  international organization--and all its branches in different  countries, including Russian, take their stand against the  nuclear industry and demand the closure of all nuclear power  stations beginning with the most dangerous. This goal has  remained the same since the 1970's, when the organization began  its anti-nuclear program.    I agree with S. Yermakov that our domestic nuclear fuel  cycle  ``is for all practical purposes no worse than what the West  has.'' I shall only note that the processing and enriching stage  for the uranium is one of the dirtiest in the world. Everywhere.    I agree that financial assistance allocated by the European  Community after Chernobyl began to be spent on the  ``bureaucratic machine.'' But the money would not have  disappeared if it had been put into a specific program. No such  program, however, was ever proposed.    I do not agree that the ``Ministry of Atomic Energy is able  to exercise full control over the situation in the nuclear  industry branch.'' The Ministry of Atomic Energy depends on the  Russian joint-stock company that has a monopoly over selling  electrical power to foreign countries, as well as domestically.  Enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic Energy constantly complain  about poor financing. Pre-labor strike situations develop at  these enterprises, and sometimes they turn into labor strikes.  With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, contacts between  facilities of industrial branches have also fallen apart.  Everyone resolves this problem in his own way: The managers of  the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, for example, are trying to  organize a consortium of enterprises in Leningrad Oblast.  Accidents happen one after another: Mid-May at the Zaporozhskiy  Nuclear Power Station; end of May--at the Kolskiy Nuclear Power  Station; and mid-July--at the Balakovskiy Nuclear Power Station.    I agree that the ``technology in our country for building  reactors is superior to that of the West in a number of specific  details.'' But only on paper. In practice, the situation is  different. All existing reactors are experimental models: Among  them is not a single one that went into series production, from  which it follows that not a single aspect of technology proved  itself. In constructing the foundation blocks for the  Balakovskiy Nuclear Power Station, the marble pads were replaced  by local limestone, with which ground water actively interacted,  causing the limestone to dissolve. The marble was used,  according to unsubstantiated information, to build a  departmental sanatorium.    I do not agree that ``construction (of the RBMK  [channel-type, graphite-moderated] reactor) ... changed for the  better with regard to security or that it conforms to world  standards.'' Ye. Reshetnikov, Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy,  noted at one of his press conferences last year that  theoretically it was impossible to modernize the old Russian  reactors. Dmitriy Tolmatskiy, coordinator of anti-nuclear  programs for ``Greenpeace Russia,'' adds that whatever is done  consists only of cosmetic measures, as for example, increasing  the number of rods. Hans Blix, director of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), compared the RBMK reactors to old  Ford automobiles: One can go for a long time in a car like that,  but only if you choose the direction correctly and drive slowly.  He emphasized that these reactors could not be brought up to  Western standards bacause of the excessive cost of the  protective casings. I think that many readers will agree that it  would be very problematical to drive in an ``old Ford,'' on  Russian roads that are full of economic ruts, inter-national  potholes, and political bumps.    In the 1960's it seemed that nuclear energy would become an  inexhaustable, inexpensive, and harmless source for those living  on our planet. Time gradually dispersed these illusions. In  1979, an accident at Three Mile Island; 1986--the accident at  Chernobyl. The peaceful atom turned out to be not as harmless as  many had thought. There were fewer and fewer supporters of  nuclear energy. Right now not a single insurance company will  insure a nuclear power station anywhere in the world. Atomic  energy has become insolvent, not only from an ecological, but  also from an economic standpoint. Before, the cost of atomic  energy did not include expenditures for liquidating accident  damages, mining the raw material, processing and transporting  it. Alternative sources of energy require a lot fewer expenses,  as we shall discuss later. All this led to the nuclear industry  being squeezed out of the world energy producing market. This  conclusion was reached by researchers at the Institute for World  Processes (Washington), the Services for Energy Information  (Paris), and the International Greenpeace organization  (Amsterdam). From their ``Report on the Status of the World  Nuclear Industry: 1992'' (hereafter cited as ``Report''), we  find that at the beginning of 1992 there were ten fewer nuclear  power stations in the world than in December 1988; and at the  end of 1991, 49 stations were being built around the world,  which is four times fewer than ten years ago.    S. Yermakov does not agree with this. He maintains that ``an  accelerated development of nuclear power engineering is taking  place in a number of Western countries,'' and he cites the  examples of Japan, France, and England. Since Japan and France  are exceptions to the worldwide trend, all supporters of nuclear  power engineering in the world are rallying to their  ``expansionist'' plans.    The nuclear industry in France began to develop in the  1970's  as a result of concern at increasing oil prices, according to  the ``Report.'' At present, 56 reactors working at full capacity  provide 75 percent of France's electrical power. Since there are  seven reactors too many, France has to sell its energy to  neighboring countries at low prices. France has nearly one half  of the nuclear power potential of Western Europe. As a result of  this large-scale construction, the debt of the state municipal  services of France was 214 million French francs (or 38 million  US dollars) at the beginning of 1992. The debt grew because huge  subsidies were given as a reward for using nuclear energy and to  justify investments in this branch of industry. For the amount  of energy produced per one megawatt of power in a nuclear power  station, France is on a rather low level in comparison with  other countries. This gap will increase if five additional  nuclear power stations are built by the end of the century. The  development of French nuclear power engineering is, however,  slowing down and is now at the level where it can only support  the work of the state nuclear industry. The last order for  building a nuclear reactor was received in 1987. Japan has 42  nuclear power stations that provide 27 percent of all the  country's energy. Ten additional stations are being built. By  the year 2010, the government plans to have 80 reactors, which  is improbable. There is also serious opposition to these plans:  47 percent of the population believes that Japanese nuclear  power stations are ``relatively unsafe'' or ``completely  unsafe.'' Even nuclear experts agree that new nuclear power  stations can be built only in countries that already have them.  In the last five years, however, not a single new area has been  acquired for this purpose.    What then would replace nuclear power stations if we  decide--after all--to do away with them? Alternative sources of  energy: Solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal plants. But the main  attention, according to Lika Galkina, coordinator of  anti-nuclear programs of ``Greenpeace Russia,'' should be  devoted to gas turbine plants of the ``Vityaz'' type that we  already have. A necessary parallel action is to decrease losses  of oil and gas during extraction and transportation. Several  million tonnes of oil spill out of broken pipelines every year  in Russia, notes Aleksey Yablokov, adviser to the president of  the Russian Federation on ecology and health protection. The  most lit up part of our planet as seen in a night photograph  taken from space is the area of Northwest Siberia: Tens of  thousands of continually burning torches merge into a spot  brighter than New York, Los Angeles, or Tokyo. The quickest and  most effective way to slow down global warming, according to  U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, is to stop the gas leaks in  Siberia. A great amount of energy is lost in thermal and  electrical grids because of the use of old power-consuming  technology and simply because of poor insulation of houses. In  order to regulate heating, special battery-operated valves  should be installed, as has been done in all developed countries  for many years now. Incidentally, 70 percent of the people  living in Munich turn off their heating even when they go for a  two-hour walk. The loss of electrical energy will be  substantially less if old electrical motors are exchanged for  new, more efficient ones. Electrical motors in most of the  industrial countries now use over one half of available  electrical power. Fluorescent lamps, replacing the usual  incandescent lamps, give off as much light, use one quarter of  the energy needed by their predecessors, and last ten times  longer. It would be advisable to introduce conditions for the  efficient use of energy in making financial loans, such as, for  example, what the World Bank did with a loan to Brazil.    ``After me, the deluge!'' This pronouncement of Louis XV is,  unfortunately, more famous than the slogan of the ``Greenpeace''  people: ``To save in the environment what can still be saved!''  How can we reach the point where we shall think not only of our  stomachs, but also about nature which fills our stomachs with  its gifts? One time the Greenpeace people made a giant  transparency 1,000 square meters in size. Too small? I think  they could make it even 2,000 square meters. And how much is  needed? Three, four?....</p>

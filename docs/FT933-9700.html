			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Fantastic years with the Oslo Phil - Andrew Clark admires the loyalty and skill of conductor Mariss Jansons MEMBERS of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra still cannot believe their good fortune. Ten years after attracting international attention with the first of their Tchaikovsky recordings, their performances of romantic and early modern masterpieces continue to draw critical superlatives. The architect of the orchestra's success, Mariss Jansons, shows no sign of leaving, despite big-money offers from elsewhere. Their touring schedule this month takes in Europe's four leading music festivals - Salzburg, Lucerne, Edinburgh and the London Proms. Like their colleagues in Birmingham, the Oslo musicians have successfully challenged the supremacy of traditional musical centres like London and Vienna. They have developed a reputation for fresh, alertly-balanced and often thrilling performances, notable for clarity and point - a reflection of Jansons's own virtues. They have avoided the trap of being tied to a particular corner of the repertoire: it is over two years since they played a Tchaikovsky symphony, and in the absence of a strong national school of music in Norway, they are free to take on tour everything from Berlioz to Bartok. And yet success has sprung from an unlikely source. Here is an orchestra which, despite a 75-year history, has no great tradition of its own; which is based on the fringe of musical Europe, in a country with the same population as Finland (four million) but fewer than half the number of symphony orchestras; which is paid less than its counterparts in Denmark and Germany; and which receives at home a shadow of the acclaim it wins abroad. So why does a world-class conductor like Jansons choose to stay? It is widely accepted that the two other orchestras with which he is closely associated - the St Petersburg and London Philharmonics - would be better off with Jansons than with their present chief conductors. He tours extensively with the St Petersburg orchestra (another London concert is scheduled for November), and the LPO link is developing well, with a steady flow of recordings and talk of a Glyndebourne production. But with the Oslo Philharmonic, the relationship can only be defined in terms of love. Jansons - at 50 still remarkably boyish-looking - is a conductor who gets close to his musicians, who refuses to rush his career or repertoire. When he came to Oslo in 1979, it was his first principal conductor's post, giving him the chance to develop out of the international limelight. The orchestra is his 'child': most of the players are in their mid-to-late thirties, have grown with him and now reflect his musical personality. They have repaid his loyalty with unstinting dedication. His own view is that as long as he has something to give and is wanted, he will stay. A visit to the Oslo Concert Hall, a stone's throw from the waterfront in the city centre, uncovers some of the mechanics of this extraordinary partnership. Jansons limits his time with the Oslo Philharmonic to 12 weeks of the year, in the belief that every time a chief conductor returns 'it should be an event. Some joy is very important'. This is reflected in the buzz pervading the hall when he is present. He may not hold the title of artistic director - the orchestra itself takes responsibility for year-round decision-making (an unheard-of arrangement for a contract orchestra in Britain) - but his influence is immense, every visit a hectic round of meetings, auditions and rehearsals. According to Trond Okkelmo, the orchestra's manager, 'Mariss doesn't need power and position to have authority. That's his personality - he lets things flourish as long as he thinks it's in the right direction.' Jansons's ideals - many of them learned from his mentor, the legendary St Petersburg conductor Evgeny Mravinsky - have become part of the orchestra's work ethic. The Oslo musicians respond best to conductors who work them hard, because that is the way Jansons has trained them. Although there is room for humour, rehearsals are notable for the absence of chatter. Jansons, speaking in a mixture of English, German and Italian, is quick and precise in his corrections, the sign of a conductor who comes well prepared. The players organise their own weekly sectional rehearsals. Distinguished guest instrumentalists are invited to lead three-day seminars. Lack of complacency is one of the Oslo Philharmonic's most refreshing qualities. Nothing is taken for granted - not even recognition at home. That is in part a reflection of the Norwegian character: 'if you have a success, don't allow yourself to believe you're somebody', as one of the musicians disdainfully puts it. The orchestra receives the same basic pay as its regional counterparts in Bergen and Trondheim. This has prompted Jansons - Latvian by birth, Russian by citizenship - to go on the offensive, campaigning for tangible acknowledgement of the orchestra's achievements. Recent years have seen the playing strength raised from 78 to 103, capitalising on the stream of talented string players graduating from Oslo's young music academy. Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest industrial enterprise, has signed a long-term sponsorship contract, enabling the orchestra to maintain a healthy output of recordings and go on tour with heavily-scored works like Strauss's Alpine Symphony (and an orchestra physiotherapist]). The musicians are now looking for a white knight to finance acoustical adjustments to their home, a dark prism-shaped auditorium dating from 1977, with a stage so wide that they cannot hear each other properly. Despite the relatively low pay, the Oslo Philharmonic knows the meaning of job satisfaction. Its musicians have permanent contracts and play to full houses. Each of their concerts is broadcast nationally (by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, which contributes a third of the orchestra's budget). Above all, they have in Jansons a conductor who is as inspiring as he is uncompromising. 'Whenever this ends, we're going to look back and say these were fantastic years,' muses Arne Jorgen Oian, the orchestra's principal second violin. 'The great thing is, we're realising it while it happens.' Mariss Jansons conducts the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra at Salzburg tomorrow morning, at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, on August 22, London's Royal Albert Hall on August 23 and 24, Lucerne on August 26 and 27, and Birmingham's Symphony Hall on August 31. The tour soloists are Yuri Bashmet and Midori.</p>

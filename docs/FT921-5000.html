			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Singer &amp; Friedlander up 13.5% to Pounds 15.4m SINGER &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property group, yesterday signalled its resilience to recession in the UK economy by reporting a 13.5 per cent increase to Pounds 15.41m in pre-tax profits for 1991. Earnings per share were up from 3.92p in 1990 to 4.8p. The dividend is unchanged at 2.5p. Mr Anthony Solomons, group chairman, said that dividend cover was below 2 and it would not have been appropriate to increase the pay-out. Instead the group yesterday bought 31.5m of its own shares, about 14 per cent of its capital, in the market for Pounds 12.5m or 40p per share. The purchase included the entire holding of 24.45m of its shares from the supervisors of B&amp;C Investment Holdings. 'This enhances the assets and earnings per share for the rest of the shareholders,' Mr Solomons said. Group assets grew from Pounds 708m in 1990 to Pounds 744.6m. The group's banking operations made a profit of Pounds 7.01m, up from Pounds 6.57m. There was an extraordinary profit of Pounds 4.76m from the sale of a stake in Takare for Pounds 25.4m. Singer's shares closed the day at 44p, up 3p.</p>

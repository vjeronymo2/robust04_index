			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (3): Land of the rising paradox - Japan buys little but imports are no longer taboo Japan's power equipment market is changing fast, presenting foreign suppliers with opportunities to cash in on one of the world's largest but toughest markets. Japan is a mature economy where overall growth has skidded to a halt after several decades as one of the world's top performers, and its increase in electricity demand has slowed accordingly. According to Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), Japan's largest power company, which sells about a third of the country's total electricity, total Japanese electricity demand will rise from 689bn kwh in 1993 to just 885bn in 2003. In the 10 years between 1965 and 1975 it tripled. Estimates for annual growth in the generation equipment market are correspondingly low. Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MEC), which provides machinery in power projects run by its cousin Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), reckons Japan will yield around 84GW of new capacity over the next 10 years. 'It is a very mature market,' says Del Williamson, president of GE Power Systems Asia. 'The low growth has continued to decline. Percentage wise it's like the US - in the one to two per cent range.' Two growth areas will be plants running off liquid natural gas (LNG) and nuclear energy. Japan has always been extremely nervous about the fact that it depends on the outside world for almost all its energy requirements, and has been trying to cut down the amount of power it generates from oil to reduce its dependence on the Middle East. LNG and nuclear has been a major feature of this policy. In 1973, Japan generated 60 per cent of its electricity from oil, but last year that was down to 16 per cent. In 2003 the figure is expected to fall further to 10 per cent, according to Tepco. LNG accounted for 33 per cent of total electricity generation in 1993, which should rise to 37 per cent 10 years later, while the nuclear proportion will increase from 25 per cent to 26. There is also a move towards upgrading existing facilities with equipment that is cleaner and more efficient. The main feature of this is combined-cycle systems, which can boost energy use efficiency some five per cent to around 48 per cent. 'The modernisation and upgrade and replacement is similar to what was seen 10 years ago in the US,' says George Butterfield, president of Westinghouse Energy Systems Japan. 'A lot of equipment for the growth period in Japan in the 1960s and 1970s is reaching the age for modernisation.' Tepco says it has already increased capacity by replacing some of the thermal facilities it started up during the period from the late 1950s to 1970. It is now considering scrapping a plant in Shinagawa in Tokyo, consisting of three 125MW generators, and building a 1,108GW facility instead. Recently, however, recession and two successive cold summers, which cut electricity demand from air conditioning, have eaten into the power companies' revenues, prompting them to rein in their spending on new capital equipment. Tepco announced in April that its capital investment for the 1994/95 fiscal year (ending March 31, 1995) will fall 0.2 per cent from the previous year to 1.692 trillion yen - its first decline in seven years. Combined investment by Japan's 10 electric power companies is likely to slip below five trillion yen in the year, from 5.01 trillion in 1993/94. 'Investment by the utilities has been very strong, but it's starting to slow,' says Timothy Marrable, a senior analyst at Baring Securities (Japan). While there may not be much good news for Japan's market as a whole, it at least looks more enticing for foreign companies. Pressure on Japan, especially from the US, to reduce its enormous trade surplus has led the government here to encourage companies in all sectors to look beyond their domestic suppliers and buy equipment from abroad. 'The requirement to import more equipment to offset the balance of trade has caused Tepco to buy even more equipment on a direct basis from outside Japan,' says Mr Williamson of GE. 'It's opening the door a crack at least to outside suppliers.' However, with the yen reaching unprecedented highs over the last six months, many companies, under pressure to cut costs are all too glad to do this. Tepco recently announced it would publish annually a list of equipment purchases it is planning for each year. Also, starting with Tepco the power companies are planning to increase the proportion of outside procurements they make through competitive bidding which currently accounts for only around a third of these. Westinghouse's Mr Butterfield sees costs as the main factor in the industry's new openness. 'I don't believe there's been restrictions in the power industry. It's difficult to do business here because of the expectations of the customer in the power industry and I think some of these expectations are reasonable,' he says. 'The power companies themselves have taken the initiative to go to the world looking for components and equipment. I think cost is more of an issue (than trade friction).' Up to now most of the business won by foreigners in Japan has been through relationships with Japanese makers rather than through direct sales. Westinghouse has worked closely with MHI, while GE has relationships with both Hitachi and Toshiba. GE's co-operation with Toshiba in the gas turbine field has included providing combined-cycle units for Tepco's Futtsu Thermal Power Plant in Chiba, near Tokyo, commissioned between 1985 and 1988. It is supplying Hitachi with three of the seven gas turbines for a 1,650MW Chubu Electric Co plant near Nagoya, and building nuclear reactors and supplying two 1,350MW steam turbine generators for the world's first advanced boiling water reactor plants in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast. Part of a Toshiba-led project, these are faster and easier to construct than ordinary boiling water reactors and will also run more safely and efficiently.</p>

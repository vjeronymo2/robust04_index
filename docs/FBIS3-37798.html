According to the Hungarian minister, Russia is today the  second largest economic and trade partner of Hungary, while the  latter holds eighth place in the list of Russia's major economic  partners. "Very important for the development of our cultural  cooperation are contacts between the religious leaders of the  two countries," the Hungarian minister said. He recalled in  this connection that Budapest would be visited on March 3 by  Patriarch of Moscow and All of Russia Aleksius II.    Dwelling on the Hungarian foreign policy's orientation,  Jeszenszky noted that integration into the European structures  of the North Atlantic treaty Organisation and the European Union  were of primary importance for Budapest, as well as the  country's active participation in the CSCE process and in the  implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" programme.  Touching on the situation in Bosnia, the Hungarian foreign  minister stressed that "the stands of Budapest and Moscow on  this question have no serious distinctions".    "Russia attaches great importance to relations with  Hungary,"  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told the press conference.  "This is specially noted in the treaty between the two  countries, recently signed at summit level." The minister  expressed the hope that it would be ratified by the new Russian  parliament.    "I wish to back my friend Jeszenszky's words about the  prospects for relations between Russia and Hungary," Kozyrev  stated. "Russia has no hegemonic or neo-imperialist designs in  Central and Eastern Europe. The attraction of the peoples of  our countries towards each other is perfectly natural," he added.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Swedish currency weakens The Swedish krona weakened ominously yesterday despite Thursday's surprise increase in interest rates by the central bank aimed at stiffening the currency and halting signs of resurgent inflation. The combination of rising interest rates and a sagging currency heightened fears that Sweden, carrying a huge budget deficit and spiralling public debt, is entering a vicious cycle in which high interest rates deepen the deficit in the public sector, which in turn weakens the krona and ultimately leads to greater borrowing requirements. The krona slipped below SKr5 to the D-Mark to end the day at SKr5.018 and was also weaker against an Ecu-denominated index. The index rose by 0.45 to stand at 128.99. Meanwhile, the Stockholm stock exchange fell by more than 1.8 per cent for the second day and market interest rates continued to increase. Support for Sweden's bid to join the European Union has increased significantly, cutting the lead held by the anti-Brussels camp in the EU referendum campaign to its smallest margin for months, an opinion poll published yesterday showed. The Gallup poll in Expressen newspaper, the first on the EU issue since before the July holiday, showed the Yes vote rising three points to 38 per cent from a similar poll in June, while the No vote slipped one point to 40 per cent. The result is a boost for the right-centre coalition government and the opposition Social Democratic party, which are campaigning for a Yes vote in the November 13 referendum.</p>

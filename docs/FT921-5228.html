			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Heywood Williams falls to Pounds 19.2m HEYWOOD WILLIAMS, the UK's largest glass distributor, yesterday announced its seventh acquisition since last year's Pounds 28m rights issue as it unveiled a 17 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31 1991. The profits fall, from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 19.2m, was struck on turnover up by 5 per cent from Pounds 331.5m to Pounds 347.4m and was mainly due to the depressed state of the UK construction industry. Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, Heywood's chairman, said: 'The whole of the fall can be put down to aluminium and glass connected with commercial buildings.' He added that there were no real signs of an upturn in the UK. The result, helped by last year's acquisition of Thurgar Bardex, the Kettering-based manufacturer of windows and doors, was still above market expectations. The shares rose 8p to close at 331p. Door Panels Group, a manufacturer of plastic door panels bought for Pounds 7.8m, will be incorporated into the group's growing plastics division, which presently accounts for one quarter of total sales. Continental operations finished well ahead of 1990 and have recently been boosted by two new businesses in The Netherlands and France. The group's US businesses were only just behind their 1990 result. The UK workforce was reduced by 420 to a total of 5,380. In the US the Georgia manufacturing plant was closed and several glass operations in the UK were amalgamated. Borrowings have fallen slightly to Pounds 20m, representing 20 per cent of shareholders' funds. Earnings per share fell from an adjusted 22.8p to 17.2p. A final dividend of 8p is proposed, making a total for the year of 12.5p (12p adjusted). COMMENT There is not much Heywood Williams can do about depressed demand in one of its main businesses. Apart from a pick up in the home improvement market in the second half there is little chance of a significant upturn in UK housing or construction. The group has taken advantage of the low prices of plastic and glass business during the recession by snapping up seven companies in its last financial year. The plastics division is growing in size and profitability while the Continental glass operations are also providing better results. With expected full-year profits for 1992 of Pounds 26m, giving earnings per share of 21.1, the shares are trading on a prospective multiple of 15.6 compared to a sector average of 18.2. Given the expected increase in profits the shares look good value.</p>

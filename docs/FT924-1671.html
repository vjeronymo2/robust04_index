			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Argentina close to finance for debt deal ARGENTINA looks set this week to secure the necessary financing to back its Dollars 31bn (Pounds 20.3bn) bank debt reduction agreement now being signed by commercial bank creditors. The agreement requires Dollars 3.2bn of finance to be provided for guarantees, or 'enhancements', for the concessionary bonds which banks will exchange for their old loans. Yesterday, the board of the InterAmerican Development Bank agreed a Dollars 350m loan to encourage reform of the Argentine investment sector, Dollars 75m of which will go toward enhancements. The board is expected to agree another Dollars 400m loan on Friday to finance enhancements. In addition to Dollars 742m of Argentina's own resources, the International Monetary Fund is expected to provide Dollars 945m, the World Bank Dollars 745m and the Japanese ExIm Bank Dollars 800m for enhancements. The Dollars 400m loan will be the first loan by a multilateral bank entirely used to back a debt reduction deal, and will take new IADB credits to Argentina to over Dollars 1bn, making Argentina the largest recipient of new IADB commitments in 1992.</p>

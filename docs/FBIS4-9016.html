			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Sharkov] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- The 19th session of the  Bulgarian-Libyan Joint Commission for Economic, Industrial,  Technical and Business cooperation today signed a protocol aimed  to reconsider the joint activity in a variety of spheres and set  the direction for its future development, Construction and  Regional Development Minister Khristo Totev, who heads the  Bulgarian delegation, told journalists.    The 15 April sittings were attended by officials of all  branch ministries and organizations with a stable share of  Libya's market. The discussions focused on the future of the  bilateral cooperation in a number of spheres, including  industry, agriculture, transport, trade, construction and health  care. The Bulgarian side informed their Libyan counterparts on  the drafting of a bilateral agreement on reciprocal investment  protection. During their stay in this country the Libyan guests  met Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev, Agriculture  Minister Georgi Tanev and Industry Minister Rumen Bikov, as well  as representatives of different companies. They expressed their  positive impressions from the performance of Bulgarian  construction and engineering experts working in Libya. Secretary  for Agriculture 'Isa 'Abd-al-Kafi, who heads the Libyan  delegation, today met the leader of the Bulgarian Socialist  Party Zhan Videnov.    The Libyan side was welcomed to send a delegation to  Bulgaria  to investigate the cooperation opportunities this country's  industry has to offer. The food-processing industry, transport  machine building, metal processing, the pharmaceutical industry,  refrigerating equipment and the leather industry are of  particular interest for the future cooperation between the two  countries, according to Mr. Totev. The guests pledged to  approach the competent Libyan authorities to help overcome the  payment-related difficulties facing Bulgarian specialists in  Libya. The document that was signed today also seeks to ease  the work visa regulations for Bulgarians. An expert meeting  will be followed by singing an accord for reciprocal recognition  of university diplomas and degrees. The Bulgarian delegation to  the session reiterated this country's readiness to sign an  interdepartmental accord in health care and an intergovernmental  accord on the employment of Bulgarian citizens on Libyan  territory. This country will come up with a draft agreement on  employment by the end of this June.    Bulgaria and Libya started to develop extensive economic,  trade and scientific cooperation some 30 years ago, Mr. Totev  told BTA. Following a 3- to 4-year break, the work of the joint  commission is now expected to double the number of Bulgarian  experts in Libya, overcoming a sharp drop of this figure, the  construction and regional development minister said. About  6,000 Bulgarians are now working in Libya, most of them  construction engineers, workers and medical staff. According to  Mr. Totev, some 4-5 years ago the Bulgarian-Libyan commercial  exchange was as much as 900 million U.S. dollars per year and  there was a total of 15,000 to 18,000 Bulgarian experts in Libya.</p>

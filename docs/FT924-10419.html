			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Hawks and Handsaws: Every word counts I WAS IN Toronto the other morning, eating my breakfast, reading the papers, when my eye fell upon an article celebrating Black Monday, in October 1987, and wondering what series of events, what doomsday scenario, would trigger the next great stock market crash. I enjoy such articles, for they remind me that my own investments, though insignificant - they account for 0.000000000000 0000000000000000002 of global net wealth - need to be husbanded just as carefully as those of Carl Icahn. Icahn, the New York corporate investor, was one of the gurus consulted for the article. 'I think in the next year or two you'll see another crash that might make 1987 seem like kindergarten,' said Icahn. Reason: herd behaviour by US pension fund executives, many of whom have 50 to 70 per cent of their funds invested in the stock market. 'The fellows who run these funds run them like cookie-cookers,' said Icahn, 'and when they all go for the exits, you're going to see apocalypse.' He says that Dollars 3.8 trillion worth of funds are concentrated in just a few hands. 'It's the same type of guy. They live in the same type of house, drive the same type of car, have the same type of Harvard degree. They're not bad people. They're bright people. But they've never been through a bad crash. 1987 was not earth-shaking.' The guru who gave me greatest pause for thought was John Templeton, chairman of Templeton mutual funds, who pointed to the possibility that stock market apocalypse could be triggered by real apocalypse. A nuclear war, he said, could 'have a depressing effect for quite a while.' Alternatively, there might be a media-induced panic reminiscent of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds caused by 'the enormous increase in the quantity of information going around the world simultaneously.' Think about it. The number of bits of information now circling the globe simultaneously is estimated at 57 tril tril zil. That is a lot of information. And most of it is useless. Or excessively duplicated. Or just plain stupid. So here is an idea. To help counteract the possibility of media-induced apocalypse, I think it behoves all of us who toil in the media vineyard to reduce our word-counts substantially. Diminish the number of bits of information flying wildly through the ether by 98 per cent of 57 tril tril zil. This week, I spoke to political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic. They told me numerous things. Things to make your ears pop. But instead of bombarding you with everything they told me, I have edited their words to the essence, so as to reduce the quantity of information flowing mindlessly round the globe: John Major: 'Good evening, Michael. Thankyou very much for telephoning me. Am I alarmed by - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ? Certainly not  -- - - - - - - backbenchers don't frighten me - - - - - - - - safe pair of hands - - - - - - general election - - - - - call out the tanks - - - - - -  -- - - Army's loyalty not in question - - - - - - - - - - - - - nuclear submarines - - - - - - - - fight against inflation - - - - - - - Maastricht or bust - - - - - - - Thankyou, Michael. I always enjoy conversing with you.' Norman Lamont: ' - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - .' Michael Heseltine: 'I'm curiously well, thankyou - - - - - - - Oliver Cromwell - - - - - - - - president-for-life - - - - - - - - - Princess Margaret, dual coronation - - - - - - stuff the working class - - - - - - -  -Indubitably so, Michael, indubitably so.' George Bush: 'Hiya, Mikey, nice of you to call. Of course it'll be a landslide. Those boys did really well - - - - perch running hot - - - - - long par four - - - - call it 30-40 - - - - - tension city, Mikey - - - - won't see my trail for dust.

Ross Perot: 'How y'doing, boy? - - - media long-hairs and half-wits - - - -  -- Dollars 250m - - - crazy, crazy, crazy - - - - - - - CIA, FBI - - - - -  -- - country up for grabs - - - - - - Any time you like, boy, any time you like.' If all journalists were to filet their output like that, the amount of garbage swirling round the globe could be cut to a trickle.

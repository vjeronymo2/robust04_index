Vyacheslav  Shtyrov, vice president of the republic and chairman of the  Yakutia Government, informed INTERFAX of this.    In November 1993, the Yakutia Government and 16 producers of  cut diamonds, jewelry, and tools in which diamonds are used  agreed to set up a diamond exchange which, according to  documents, is being established to "hold trading sessions,  auctions, and wholesale and retail sale of products made of  cuttable and industrial diamonds, precious metals and stones,  and as a secondary market for the sale of rough diamonds."  According to Pavel Andreyev, the president of the exchange who  heads the republic association of exporters, Sakhaeksport, it is  planned to hold the first session on the exchange, which will be  located in the capital of the republic, Yakutsk, in February of  this year.    Experts from Yakutia project that the volume of sales on the  exchange in 1994 may come to $50 million. It is planned to sell  cut diamonds and jewelry worth $15 million at the first trading  session.    All diamonds for the first trading session will be  manufactured by cutters especially brought in from Belgium, as  well as from Kiev and Smolensk. They have been commissioned to  manufacture up to 10 cut diamonds, the cost of each of which may  reach $1 million.    The Yakutia diamond exchange has been founded as a privately  held joint-stock company with the statutory capital of 1 billion  rubles [R] (the republic accounts for virtually the entire  volume of diamond production in Russia). However, the initial  statutory capital will be smaller by a factor of two--R500  million. This is due to the fact that most producers of  diamonds, jewelry, and tools using industrial diamonds do not  have sufficient financial resources at present.    According to Prime Minister Vasiliy Shtyrov, the delay in M.  Nikolayev's edict (it was expected as early as the end of  November 1993, after a meeting of the founders of the  exchange--note by INTERFAX) has been caused by the desire to  coordinate the actions with the international association of  diamond exchanges. According to charter documents of the  exchange, the Yakutia Government will receive 30 percent of the  stock, the face value of which will come to 5 million rubles.  The rest of the founders will hold 3 to 7 percent of the stock.</p>

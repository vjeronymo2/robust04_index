			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD GAME AT NEVADA RENO ENDED BY FIGHT IN FIFTH  </P> <P> The University of San Diego baseball team's game with Nevada-Reno was suspended  in the fifth inning Friday after a bench-clearing, five-minute brawl.  </P> <P> There were no serious injuries or arrests in the fight between the two West  Coast Conference teams, according to officials.  </P> <P> But several players on both squads suffered facial cuts and bruises and some  fights broke out between spectators in the parking lot, according to campus  police officers.  </P> <P> The two teams had been scheduled to complete their season series today at 11  a.m. in a doubleheader, but USD Coach John Cunningham told a reporter from the  Reno Gazette-Journal that the Toreros would forfeit.  </P> <P> The Wolf Pack was leading, 3-1, when the fight started.  </P> <P> The brawl began after a USD player rammed his knee into a Nevada Reno player,  who responded by slapping his face, according to the host team.  </P> <P> Cunningham said players "came out of both dugouts with the intent of hurting  someone. In 28 years of coaching, I've seen fights, but nope, nothing ever like  this."  </P> <P> Said Nevada Reno Coach Gary Powers: "There's no excuse for what took place  here. It was an ugly, ugly incident that should not have happened."  </P> <P> The teams had played three previous games this season, with USD winning two.  USD entered the game 23-29, 15-15 in the WCC. Nevada Reno was 26-20 and 8-12.  </P></p>

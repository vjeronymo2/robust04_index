			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S ANGELS WHO DO THE BASHING IN WIN OVER A'S  </P> <P> The Oakland Athletics' starters look more like offensive linemen than baseball  players. The A's first seven batters Monday night averaged 6-foot-2 and 213  pounds.  </P> <P> It was the Angels, however, who were flexing their muscles as Chili Davis and  Jack Howell hit solo homers in a 5-4 victory in front of a sellout crowd of  44,548 in the Oakland Coliseum.  </P> <P> Davis, who came up in the seventh inning with five hits in his last 38 at-bats  and hadn't hit a home run since July 1, lined a shot over the fence in  left-center. And Howell, who had one hit in his previous 24 at-bats, homered to  center in the eighth.  </P> <P> Both came against A's reliever Gene Nelson (2-5), who had given up only two  home runs this season before Monday.  </P> <P> "They've both persevered and come through with some big hits when we've needed  them most," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "And that's more important than  hitting .300."  </P> <P> The homers gave the Angels a 5-3 lead, but the A's scored once in the eighth on  a single by Rickey Henderson, a groundout and a run-scoring single by Mark  McGwire.  </P> <P> Bryan Harvey came in to get the last four outs and earn his 13th save, but the  Angels' version of Senor Smoke -- (that's what Rader does a lot of when  Harvey's pitching) -- made it, well, interesting once again.  </P> <P> Harvey, who has walked 28 batters in 35 innings this season, was wild again  Monday night.  </P> <P> He ran the count to 3-and-0 on Jose Canseco, who was leading off the ninth,  before striking him out on three called strikes. Then he walked Terry Steinbach  on four pitches. Then he got Tony Phillips and pinch-hitter Ron Hassey on  called third strikes.  </P> <P> "Everything's not going to be perfect," Rader said. "Bryan got the four outs we  needed. So he got three balls on a couple of people and walked a guy. That's  just Bryan."  </P> <P> The victory lifted the Angels to a one-game lead over Oakland in the American  League West. Both teams have deemed this the who-cares series -- insisting it's  too early for a showdown. But the Angels looked excited while running out to  congratulate Harvey after the ninth.  </P> <P> "I don't know what it feels like to play in a playoff game, so I don't know  what a 'playoff atmosphere' is like," Harvey said. "But hell, it's July. If we  lose the next two here and we can't come back, we don't deserve it."  </P> <P> Davis, who is struggling at the plate these days, said the series carries a  certain amount of importance.  </P> <P> "I personally feel we can compete with these guys," he said. "But it's  important that we win now and establish that. But it's still going to be a long  year."  </P> <P> If it wasn't a showdown, it was certainly show time.  </P> <P> "That was a big league game in every way," Rader said. "Did you notice how  close the two teams' statistics were coming in? We had the same (team) batting  averages and we had scored four more runs this season. It's unbelievable how  close we are and the game reflected that."  </P> <P> It started out as if it might be an Oakland blowout.  </P> <P> Angel starter Kirk McCaskill, who missed his last start because of a tired arm,  looked as if nine-days rest might not have been enough.  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson led off the first inning with a line-drive single to center  and Carney Lansford followed with a line-drive single to right, sending  Henderson to third. Henderson scored when Dave Parker grounded into a double  play and then McGwire flied deep to center to end the inning.  </P> <P> The A's got at least one hit in each of the next three innings, but three more  Angel double plays kept McCaskill in the game. He lasted five innings, yielding  seven hits and three runs.  </P> <P> The Angels got to Oakland starter Curt Young for three runs in the fourth  inning with four consecutive singles and some smart baserunning by Brian  Downing. With one out, Johnny Ray singled to center, Devon White singled to  right and Wally Joyner drove in Ray with another single to right. Downing's  single to right scored White to give the Angels a 2-1 lead.  </P> <P> Then Lance Parrish hit a soft grounder to second baseman Tony Phillips. Downing  stopped in front of Phillips and ran back toward first, forcing Phillips to  throw to first for one out. Downing then broke for second and was out by 20  feet, but he had bought enough time to allow Joyner to score the Angels' third  run before the third out was recorded.  </P> <P> "Everyone's talking about Chili and Jack, but what about the baserunning of  Brian Downing?" Rader asked. "That was as big a run as any in the game."  </P> <P> The A's tied the score in the fifth, almost without the benefit of a hit.  Phillips walked and Mike Gallego hit a drive to right-center. Right fielder  Tony Armas appeared to catch the ball, but it popped loose and Gallego was  credited with a double, the A's only extra-base hit of the game. The next two  batters -- Rickey Henderson and Lansford -- hit sacrifice flies to center,  tying the score, 3-3.  </P> <P> Willie Fraser came on to pitch the sixth for the Angels and earned the victory  to boost his record to 3-5. He retired six A's in a row before surrendering a  leadoff single to Henderson in the eighth.  </P> <P> Still, the Angels, who were swept in a three-game series here in late April,  were trying hard to stay low-key about this particular victory. Rader brought  home that point when asked what bearing this victory would have on today's  game.  </P> <P> "We'll show up," he said.  </P> <P> WELCOMED RELIEF Bryan Harvey gets four big outs to finish off the Angel  victory.

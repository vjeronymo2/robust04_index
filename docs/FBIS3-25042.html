DP Western Cape leader Mr Hennie Bester said in a statement  on Monday [7 February] his party was deeply distressed by the  ongoing reports of "total shambles" in these camps. "The  appointment of Major-General Ramushwana and his acknowledgement  that the force will not be ready for election day has done  nothing to calm these fears."    The Western Cape DP demanded that impartial observers and  the  media be allowed to visit the camps and make a full public  report. "Should these reports prove to be correct, the  Democratic Party will do everything in its power to resist the  deployment of the peace-keeping force in the Western Cape.  Intimidators cannot be used to combat intimidation," Mr Bester  said.    Two alternative possiblities were:     -  that a force be drawn from citizens in the Western Cape  and be trained in the region; and,    -  that international peace-keepers be asked to do the job.</p>

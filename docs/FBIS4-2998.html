			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] A ranking economic official said that state-run  enterprises are expected to funnel a total of approximately $2  billion of investment into Indonesia in the coming three years,  part of the effort to comply with the government's go-south  investment policy. Vice Economic Minister S.J. Lee made these  remarks at a press conference held after his return to Taiwan  from a 9-day trip to Indonesia as the leader of the 33-member  Taipei delegation. The group comprised senior executives from  state-run enterprises under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of  Economic Affairs. Lee said his ministry will try to speed up  efforts to materialize the go-south investment policy, greatly  advocated by both President Li and Premier Lien, by helping  government-owned and private enterprises with investments in  Southeast Asian countries, especially Indonesia, Vietnam, and  the Philippines. During the 9-day stay in Indonesia, senior  executives of seven state-run enterprises and their Indonesian  counterparts reached a consensus on 13 joint venture investments  and technical cooperation projects.</p>

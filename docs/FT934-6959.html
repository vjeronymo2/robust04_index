			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Italy's poll rout sparks sharp fall in lira, shares: Coalition support collapses as left and far right make sweeping gains Italian financial markets fell sharply yesterday after the former communists and the far right made sweeping gains in local elections as ruling parties suffered an unprecedented collapse in support. Shares on the Milan bourse declined an average 3.2 per cent and the lira weakened in the belief that the rout of parties backing prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi would increase political uncertainty ahead of a general election expected early next year. The weekend polls, which covered a quarter of the electorate in 428 cities and towns, resulted in a severe mauling for every party that has ruled Italy since the second world war. According to preliminary returns, the long-dominant Christian Democrat vote fell to no more than 10 per cent - less than half its showing in local polls in June. The election rebuff left the Christian Democrats and their three allies in the ruling coalition with less than 15 per cent of the vote, against 48.8 per cent in the 1992 general elections. The big beneficiary was the Democratic Left (PDS), the former Communist party, and the leftwing alliances it sponsored. On the right, the protest vote in central and southern Italy swung heavily in favour of the neo-fascist MSI. The MSI is expected to pick up about 30 per cent of the vote in Rome and Naples. In northern Italy, the populist Northern League continued to attract a protest vote. The Christian Democrats have now lost control of every big city administration, including Palermo, the Sicilian capital, where Mr Leoluca Orlando and founder of the reformist movement, La Rete (The Network) obtained a remarkable 74 per cent to become mayor in a clear rebuff to the dominance of the Mafia. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, Christian Democrat leader, said: 'The defeat was very severe, very bitter and much bigger in scale than one could imagine.' On the basis of Sunday's poll involving 11.1m voters, a quarter of the electorate, the sole political force likely to muster a coalition to govern Italy after an early general election would be the PDS. But the PDS is the heir to the former Communist party of Italy (PCI) and since 1947 the political and business establishment has fought to prevent the Communists from entering government. Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, sought to calm fears that Italian politics had polarised between left and right. He said he was anxious to co-operate with forces in the centre. The markets believe that the collapse in support for the coalition parties is likely to weaken Mr Ciampi's authority as his government, mainly technocrats, seeks to win approval for the 1994 budget. There are also fears that the privatisation programme will be slowed or altered. The Milan bourse saw its largest single decline since November 1992 in the wake of the European currency crisis. However, the shares of quoted companies in which the state is due to sell off its stake fared worse. The lira had already weakened last week, influenced by opinion polls predicting a shift of voter allegiance. However, the sheer scale of the shift was underestimated and the lira fell to L988 against the D-Mark compared with L975 last week.

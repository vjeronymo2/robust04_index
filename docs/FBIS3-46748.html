The Japan Automobile Dealers Association said sales of cars,  trucks and buses, excluding minivehicles, totaled 4,887,179  vehicles, down 8.4 percent from the previous year. The figure  was the lowest since 1987 when sales totaled about 4,344,000  vehicles, the association said. Sales declined in all  categories for the first time since 1980, underscoring the  severity of the automobile market slump, association officials  said. They said there is little possibility of market recovery  at least until March, with expected sales for 1994 inching up to  around 5 million vehicles.    Of the 1993 total, passenger cars accounted for 3,427,088  vehicles, down 6.9 percent, posting the third straight  year-to-year fall, the association said.    It said sales of cars with engine capacity of over 2 liters  dipped 4.2 percent from the year before to 683,763 while those  of subcompact cars fell 7.5 percent to 2,743,325.    The association said sales of trucks were down 11.7 percent  at 1,632,376 while those of buses totaled 19,025, down 11.8  percent.    Imported car sales grew 9.1 percent to 201,484 vehicles, the  association said. Among 11 major automakers, only three --  Daihatsu Motor Co., Suzuki Motor Corp. and Fuji Heavy Industries  Ltd. -- posted sales growth, the association said.    Industry leader Toyota Motor Corp. suffered a 7.7 percent  drop in sales while sales of Nissan Motor Co., Mazda Motor Corp.  and Honda Motor Co. declined 8.4 percent, 16.8 percent and 14.9  percent, respectively. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s sales also  declined 7.2 percent.    In December, the association said, sales totaled 345,715  vehicles, down 11.1 percent from the year before and down 13.8  percent from the preceding month. It was the ninth straight  month that sales dropped from the year-before levels, the  association said.    Sales of passenger cars slumped 9.3 percent to 251,451 while  those of trucks and buses were down 15.6 percent and 12.3  percent, respectively, at 93,354 and 910, [as received] it said.</p>

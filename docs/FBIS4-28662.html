			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Some leaders of the  governing coalition Monday [13 June] stepped up their bid to  entice the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  into their camp to create a new stable conservative government.    The top coalition strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, told a news  conference, "whether (possible partners) include the LDP or  others, we had better discuss (the possibility of forming an  alliance) openly, if only we can narrow our policy gaps to reach  an agreement." Ozawa said, however, the ruling coalition might  not be able to integrate all LDP legislators into its fold,  saying, "the LDP has a variety of legislators whose ideas on  diplomacy and domestic policies differ completely with each  other." "Primarily, I want to reconcile policy differences with  the Social Democratic Party (SDP)" to form an alliance, said the  secretary general of Shinseito, a key coalition party. The  coalition must work out a "more specific agreement" than the  April 22 policy platform accord among coalition leaders in order  to counteract the increasingly tense nuclear standoff on the  Korean peninsula, he said.    In the April 22 common policy agreement, coalition partners  used fuzzy language to gloss over sharp gaps on tax system  reforms and Japan's response to North Korea's suspected nuclear  arms development.    Kansei Nakano, new secretary general of the Democratic  Socialist Party, another coalition party, told a separate news  conference the coalition wants to entice into its fold "the SDP  primarily, but we are not limiting options of our possible  partners to the SDP alone."    Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa called for quick  policy coordination inside the coalition, saying, "even if we  tried to appeal to the LDP to come to our camp, we would not be  able to do so without working out a (more clear-cut common  policy accord.)" The LDP responded to these calls with  conflicting voices.    Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe said he perceived it  as a good idea to bring together conservative forces inside both  the LDP and the ruling coalition, saying, "I prefer to push an  orthodox approach" under which people of similar political ideas  form a political bloc.    LDP President Yohei Kono urged the ruling coalition to  "first  declare" that they will stop talking with the SDP on a possible  merger before seeking to entice the LDP into its fold. He told  a news conference in Gifu, Gifu Prefecture, "I cannot believe  their proposal deserves our serious response in view of their  approach which appears to be (made through) deceptive tactics."    Meanwhile, the coalition's secretaries general agreed that  the critical criteria for forming an alliance with any partners  should be whether the coalition and such partners can alleviate  policy gaps on tax reforms and Japan's response to the North  Korean nuclear issue. They also agreed to start discussions  next week on working out a more specific policy accord on these  two points, including the issue of how sharply the government  should raise the rate of the consumption tax from the current 3  percent.    The ruling coalition is under strong parliamentary fire from  the SDP and some LDP legislators, including Kono, who urged it  to take a softer approach toward North Korea over the nuclear  standoff.</p>

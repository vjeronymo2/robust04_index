			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] president, His  Excellency Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, visited the Rusumo area  in Kibungo Prefecture, where he was welcomed by local senior  army officers.    While at Rusumo, President Kanyarengwe was interviewed for  one and a half hours by correspondents from Radio France  International, Radio Burundi, Radio Tanzania, and Tanzanian  newspapers, among others. Our Muhabura correspondent [name  indistinct], was also present.    To the first question, concerning when the RPF would set up  a  government, President Kanyarengwe said that the war was  continuing, but that the warring armies were going to meet to  work out how to solve the problem of war. He said that in case  the negotiations failed, the RPF would carry on with the war and  capture the town of Kigali, as well as the entire country, and  would then establish leadership. President Kanyarengwe said  that the RPF would cooperate with those parties that stood for  democracy in Rwanda and that it could not recognize the  government of Kambanda and Sindikubwabo.    Concerning the war, President Kanyarengwe said the RPF  forces  were doing well. He said that they controlled more than half of  Rwanda, and occupied important points in Kigali.    On the contributions of our neighboring countries to stop  the  war in Rwanda, President Kanyarengwe first thanked the countries  that had accepted refugees, and the international community,  which continues to support us. He called upon Zaire and  Tanzania to continue their mediation efforts.    He also indicated that a meeting had been called by  Tanzanian  President Ali Hassan Mwinyi and that it would take place in  Tanzania. In short, he said, all the neighboring countries were  helping us, and urged them to continue doing so.    The journalists wished to know if the Arusha agreements were  still useful. President Kanyarengwe said the Arusha agreements  would continue to be a crucial basis, especially with regard to  the establishment of a leadership based on law, democracy, the  unity of Rwandans, justice, and other priciples. Concerning  justice, the agreement would ensure the punishment of all  murderers. Correspondents also asked questions about intertribal  relations in Rwanda. President Kanyarengwe said that the tribal  question was just a pretext leaders use to manipulate the  people, so that they could continue to cling to power, kill  innocent people, and misinform the international community about  Rwanda's real problems. President Kanyarengwe said the real  problems of Rwanda were essentially political, because a clique  wanted to grab the leadership and victimize innocent people.  [passage omitted]    The journalists are also reported to have visited the  Nyarubuye parish, where they saw an unbelievable number of  bodies -- more than 20,000 of them. They were reportedly  tongue-tied. [passage omitted]</p>

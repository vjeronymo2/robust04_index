			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The town of Bimbila, near Tamale, in northern  Ghana, has become a no-go area for police. It is a region  bedeviled by ethnic clashes. A government mediating team has  been touring the north for some weeks trying to cool things  down, but, at Bimbila, local people turned on police after a  truck carrying ammunition was seized. From Tamale, our reporter  Adama Eliasu telexed this report: [read by announcer]    Last Tuesday [25 January], a group of people at Bimbila in  the northern region attacked and wounded security personnel and  burned down the police station, as well as the residence of the  assistant superintendent of police. The trouble broke out after  a vehicle carrying ammunition was intercepted by security  personnel. It is illegal to carry arms and ammunition in the  area because of the longstanding tribal tensions there.    Tuesday's attack resulted in six policemen and two soldiers  being seriously injured. A police source told me the injuries  happened when a mob forcibly freed the vehicle after it was  seized and took away the ammunition. The mob then also stole  four rifles and a pistol from the police. According to the  police source, when the vehicle carrying the ammunition was  impounded, the local Ghana Private Road Transport Union [GPRTU]  chairman, Mr. Pantina Dawuni, intervened and insisted that the  vehicle and its ammunition be released or else there would be  trouble. The GPRTU chairman then mobilized people armed with  cudgels and offensive weapons, who attacked the police at the  (Pandi)-Bimbila barrier, where the vehicle was intercepted. The  chairman then mobilized another group to attack the police  station and burn it down. The crowd then invaded the police  superintendent's residence and seized about 200 guns, which the  police had taken over the last 10 years.    A detachment of 76 policemen from Tamale, Sunyani, and  Kumasi  -- dispatched to Bimbila to maintain law and order -- have now  been refused entry. Pantina Dawuni has sent a message to the  divisional headquarters at Yendi, 43 miles from Bimbila, warning  of an inevitable confrontation if the police dare to enter the  town. A police source said that to avoid a bloodbath, they were  temporarily staying away to allow members of the Northern  Regional Security Committee and parliamentarians of the area to  go as peacebrokers. Meanwhile, the 6th Battalion of Infantry,  stationed at Tamale, have been put on the alert and they will  move in if the situation demands it.</p>

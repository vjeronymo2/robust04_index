He told journalists in Moscow today that the decision  regarding the ultimatum was adopted at a high-level session of  the European Union (EU) and session of the NATO Permanent  Council in Brussels. The ultimatum's essence is a threat of  carrying out air strikes on Serb positions, if the Serbs do not  pull out their heavy weapons from the security zone around  Sarajevo by a specified date, he said.    The problem is not to put an end to the inhuman siege of the  Bosnian capital, the German parliamentarian added, nobody is  opposed to it. The question concerns consequences of such a  step, which are difficult to predict now. In order to put the  ultimatum into action, inevitably further decisions will have to  be adopted, which will not only involve a military, but also a  political risk. At stake is the prestige of the U.N. and the  capability of the world organization to carry out further  actions in order to settle the Sarajevo conflict.    Besides this, Sarajevo is not an isolated incident. There  are other cities in Bosnia which have been besieged not only by  the Serbs, but also by the Moslems and Croats. That is why  while resolving the Bosnian problem, all politicians should also  take into consideration its complexity and diversity, Voigt  noted.    Replying to a question asked by this correspondent, the  Bundestag member expressed an understanding of the Russian  Foreign Ministry's position. I share the apprehensions of  Russian diplomats regarding the use of military means in order  to resolve the problem, Voigt said. Like them, I also think  that the use of force will lead to a further escalation of  violence. Difference of opinions exist in the assessment of the  situation, which has emerged after the declaration of the  ultimatum, he emphasised. Now the U.N. and the North Atlantic  Union should seek its implementation, so as to maintain the  convincingness [as received] of its policy and capability in the  future, he said.</p>

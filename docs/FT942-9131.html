			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil declines 1.4 per cent in slack trading Equities in Sao Paulo ended 1.4 per cent down after listless trade, investors having spent most of the day on the sidelines awaiting news on the Brazilian presidential race and today's meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee, Reuter reports. The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares dipped 233 to 15,626. Turnover was Cr584bn (Dollars 374m), but brokers said 49 per cent of the volume was due to the settlement of a special May options series. On the presidential race, market participants were jittery over the rise of leftist candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in a recent opinion poll, which gave him 41 per cent, against 17 per cent for former economy minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso.</p>

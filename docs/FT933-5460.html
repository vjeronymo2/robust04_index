			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Some support for broader A-levels MR WILLIAM Waldegrave, minister for science, told the British Association he was sympathetic to the idea of broadening A-levels, Clive Cookson writes. This would allow candidates to study five or six subjects, including at least one science, instead of the normal three. Last month's A-level results disturbed scientists by showing a sharp fall in those taking science and mathematics. Mr Waldegrave added, however, that there would be no point in diluting A-level courses to make room for an extra science subject if it meant having to add another year to university courses to compensate. As part of the government's campaign to increase public understanding of science, Mr Waldegrave announced yesterday a Pounds 265,000 grant for the British Association to work with the Gatsby Foundation (a charitable arm of the Sainsbury family) on setting up a network of regional co-ordinators. Their job will be to 'promote and publicise existing public understanding activities, and to encourage and develop new ideas'.</p>

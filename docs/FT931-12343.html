			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: MFI The sang froid of MFI's management offers a soothing contrast to the company's trading performance since sterling left the ERM. Despite the sharp fall in interest rates, turnover is down, and this January's sale compares poorly with last year's. Indeed, the company seems more sensitive to increases in unemployment and the declining housing market than to cuts in interest rates. Last autumn's heavy redundancies hit the blue-collar workers who are MFI's natural customers. With consumers still keen to reduce debt, expensive domestic purchases like kitchens are likely to remain a low priority when recovery eventually starts. Of course MFI is still generating cash and has an enviable return on capital, even at the low point of the cycle. When the housing market picks up, profits will certainly rise sharply. But timing is all. Even if MFI meets the City's profits expectations for the next financial year, the company will still be at a 20 per cent premium to the sector. The risk remains that those expectations will be frustrated. The management's readiness to blame market conditions might be more palatable if it were not going to take at least another 18 months to return to the profit level achieved before last summer's flotation.</p>

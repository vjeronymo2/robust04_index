			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Receivers act to help truck factory restart LIMITED production resumed yesterday at Leyland Daf's truck plant in Leyland, Lancashire, as the receivers reactivated component supply lines that had been halted on Tuesday when the truck group collapsed. The 2,000 employees at Leyland Daf's van plant, at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, are to resume production today. In Amsterdam, Daf said it expects regular production at its Eindhoven and Westerlo truck facilities to resume on Monday. At present both its Dutch and Belgian truck plants are suffering parts shortages. Daf said the receivers of Leyland Daf would travel to Daf headquarters at Eindhoven 'in the near future' for talks. Meanwhile, all 5,500 of Leyland Daf's employees were at their workplaces yesterday and its UK network of 54 dealers were told that they could take and place orders. The Leyland plant produced only a handful of trucks yesterday because of components shortage. 'But the situation has been getting easier throughout the day,' said one employee. A spokesman for Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the receivers, said the intention was to resume 'business as normal' as quickly as possible while alternative strategies for the future of the UK operations were studied. He indicated that an initial assessment of whether and how the UK operations might be put on the market could be in place by early next week. More than half of the UK dealers say they will continue at their own expense to undertake warranty and other work normally paid for by Leyland Daf.</p>

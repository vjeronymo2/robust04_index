			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: PINKERTON'S 3RD-QUARTER PROFIT UP 61% FROM 1989  </P> <P> Pinkerton's Inc., a Van Nuys-based security services concern, said its fiscal  third-quarter profit soared 61% from a year earlier despite a 4% decline in  revenue.  </P> <P> In the quarter ended Sept. 7, Pinkerton's said its net income jumped to $2.79  million from $1.73 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> Its revenue slipped to $135.5 million from $140.6 million, which the company  said reflected its decision to drop some marginal clients.  </P> <P> In the first nine months of its fiscal year, Pinkerton's profit was $2.99  million, down from $3.73 million a year earlier. The lower earnings were due to  a one-time, $2.8-million charge in the latest period stemming from Pinkerton's  early repayment of debt. Its nine-month revenue fell 4% to $403.1 million from  $419.6 million.  </P></p>

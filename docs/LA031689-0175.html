Las Vegas entered this  week at 2-4 in conference play and 6-8 overall.  </P> <P> The Broncos have been led by the pitching of sophomore Nicky Luce, who has an  8-3 record, and senior Lori Thompson, 8-2. Pomona has received solid hitting  from outfielder Nikki Bush, shortstop Shellie McCall and catcher Denise Correa.  </P> <P> Pomona suffered its first conference loss, 1-0, to 18th-ranked Pacific last  week and then won its three games.  </P> <P> While Pomona was winning three of its four conference games last week, Las  Vegas lost three of four. The Rebels are headed by pitcher Lori Harrigan, who  is 4-6 with a 1.60 earned-run average, and catcher Sheree Corniel, who is  batting .333.  </P> <P> Center Niki Bracken of Cal Poly Pomona, who led the Broncos to their eighth  straight California Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball championship,  has been named the conference's most valuable player.  </P> <P> Bracken, a 6-2 junior from Compton who was second-team all-conference last  season, has averaged 19.8 points and 8.6 rebounds to lead the Broncos into the  NCAA Division II quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Pomona also placed guard Cathy Gooden on the first team while Cal State Los  Angeles was represented on the first team by center Lupe Quintana.  </P> <P> Gooden, a 5-5 senior who was a first-team Division II All-American last season,  is second in scoring for Pomona with 15.5 points and leads in assists at 5.6.  </P> <P> For Quintana, a 6-0 senior, it marked the third straight year that she was  named to the all-conference first team. She finished her career with 1,200  rebounds -- two short of the all-time conference record.  </P> <P> She is her school's all-time third-leading scorer. As a senior she averaged  14.5 points and a conference-high 11.1 rebounds.  </P> <P> Pomona placed senior forward Susan Luckinbill (5-9) on the all-conference  second team while Pomona guard Carrie Egan (5-8) and Cal State L.A. forward  Tina Slatinsky (6-0) received honorable mention.  </P> <P> In men's basketball, Pomona's Forrest Barnes (6-5) was selected to the All-CCAA  second team.  </P> <P> Center Amy Walter of Azusa Pacific University, who led her team to a share of  its first Golden State Athletic Conference women's basketball title, has been  named NAIA District III Player of the Year.  </P> <P> The 6-2 junior averaged 22.3 points and 10.3 rebounds to lead the GSAC in both  categories. She made 59.4% of her field-goal attempts and set a school record  by scoring 30 points or more in eight games this season.  </P> <P> The Cougars, who finished with a 21-10 record and tied Fresno Pacific for first  place in the GSAC at 10-2, also placed two other players on the NAIA  All-District III team: junior forward Holly Ingersoll (5-11) and senior guard  Tracey Emberley (5-6).  </P> <P> Ingersoll, a strong inside player, averaged 13.6 points and 9.5 rebounds.  Emberley, considered the team's top ball handler and defensive player, averaged  5.9 points and 5.4 assists.  </P> <P> Don Ruh and John Norton of Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut have been selected  state community college cross-country Coaches of the Year by the California  Coaches Assn.  </P> <P> Norton coached the women's cross-country team to the state community college  championship and Ruh guided the men's cross-country squad to third in the  Southern California regionals and eighth in the state. For the women's team, it  was its first state title in the program's 11-year history.  </P> <P> Glendora High School will play host to its second Spring Team Tennis Classic  from Monday through Wednesday at the high school and Goddard Middle School  Park.  </P> <P> Eight teams will compete in the event, including San Gabriel Valley schools  Arroyo, Baldwin Park, Bishop Amat and Damien.

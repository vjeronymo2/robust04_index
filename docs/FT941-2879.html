			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 121m restructuring costs hit UB United Biscuits' full year profits before exceptionals were up 6 per cent before tax at Pounds 181.8m, in what the company said was a year of progress. However, the figures were marred by reorganisation costs totalling Pounds 121.3m, and profit falls in UB's central business of UK biscuits and snacks. The restructuring costs fall mostly on UB's troubled US subsidiary Keebler. Including provisions already announced of Pounds 11.2m for the closure of a snack plant at Raleigh, North Carolina, the total US cost will come to Pounds 92.5m. In the UK and Europe costs will be Pounds 28.8m, of which Pounds 4m will be spent on closing a plant in Hungary and the rest chiefly on redundancies, especially in middle management. Before exceptionals, profits in UK biscuits were down 10 per cent at Pounds 83.8m, while UK snack profits were down 4 per cent at Pounds 34.8m. Biscuit profits overseas were up 10 per cent at Pounds 21m. Snack profits in Europe were up 49 per cent at Pounds 12.8m, while snack profits in the Asia Pacific region, helped by last year's acquisition of Smith's in Australia, went from an Pounds 0.7m loss to a Pounds 15.5m profit. Ross Young's, the UK frozen foods business, increased profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 30.4m. At Keebler, profits before exceptionals were up 51 per cent to Pounds 40.1m. In dollar terms, profits of Dollars 64m were still well below the 1991 peak of Dollars 120m. Mr Eric Nicoli, chief executive, said Keebler's dollar profits were up 55 per cent in the secondhalf. Volume sales of biscuits in the US had fallen substantially last year, he said. However, studies UB had undertaken as part of its rationalisation programme did not envisage volume falling further, Group sales were up 10 per cent at Pounds 3.45bn. Overseas sales were 55 per cent of the total, compared to 52 per cent the year before. Exceptional charges totalled Pounds 65.1m, with the reorganisation costs partly offset by Pounds 47.6m profits on disposals, chiefly the UK confectioner Terry's. After reorganisation costs, pre-tax profit was down 28 per cent at Pounds 116.7m. Earnings per share before exceptionals were up 4 per cent at 24.2p. After exceptionals, earnings were 12.8p, leaving an unchanged dividend of 15.3p for the year only 84 per cent covered. UB said its intention was to rebuild dividend cover to two times. UB said there were encouraging signs for trading in the current year, though all its main markets remained highly competitive.</p>

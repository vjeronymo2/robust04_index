			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO  </P> <P> Hyundai of Escondido settled a lawsuit Thursday filed by the district attorney  that alleged the auto dealer engaged in misleading advertising. The dealer will  pay $122,000 in civil penalties.  </P> <P> Without admitting wrongdoing, the firm agreed to pay $80,000 in civil  penalties, $10,000 to the state Department of Motor Vehicles for investigative  costs, and $32,000 in restitution to 45 potential buyers.  </P> <P> Linda Miller, a spokeswoman for the district attorney, said the false and  misleading newspaper ads failed to disclose that only a limited number of autos  were available at the advertised sale prices.  </P> <P> As part of the settlement, the dealer was prohibited from engaging in false  advertising and unfair business practices in the future.  </P> <P> Miller said the investigation was initiated by the DMV after a potential  customer complained that he went to Hyundai of Escondido looking for an  advertised deal and a salesperson told him there had only been one such car and  it had been sold.  </P> <P> The suit alleged that the illegal practices were carried out between Dec. 26,  1987, and April 28, 1988.  </P></p>

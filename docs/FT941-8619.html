			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney banks to get final audit data on Monday The Euro Disney banks on Monday will receive the final version of an investigative audit of the troubled leisure group's finances from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, and will then call a meeting with Euro Disney to begin negotiations over its emergency financial restructuring. Next week's meeting will follow a formal meeting in Paris earlier this week in which the banks discussed preliminary proposals for the restructuring with senior executives of Euro Disney and Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of its equity. However, the banks had on Monday only seen a draft version of the KPMG report, which analyses Euro Disney's current financial position and future capital requirements. As a result they were not able to begin full-scale discussions with the Disney camp. KPMG yesterday confirmed that all Euro Disney's 60 banks will receive the final audit on Monday thereby enabling them to begin formal negotiations at a meeting later in the week. The banks have formed a steering committee, led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, to negotiate directly with Euro Disney, advised by S. G. Warburg in London, and Walt Disney, advised by Lazard Freres in New York. Walt Disney has asked the banks to agree to halve Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.39bn) debt through the combination of a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. However, the preliminary findings of the KPMG audit suggest that Euro Disney will require a higher capital injection of between FFr12bn and FFr13bn. The banks are keen to ensure that the US group plays a larger part in the restructuring. They plan to press Walt Disney to make concessions such as reducing its royalty payments from Euro Disney which were worth FFr262m last year. The banks have also asked KPMG to scrutinise Euro Disney's corporate strategy to assess whether there should be changes in senior personnel and operating policy. KPMG declined to comment on whether it would be presenting its corporate analysis on Monday alongside the financial audit.</p>

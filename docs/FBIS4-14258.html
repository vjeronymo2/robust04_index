			<p>BFN     [Text] The president, Mr. Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari,  has called upon the opposition to end its boycott and join the  proceedings of the National Assembly. He was talking to newsmen  in Islamabad this morning after laying the foundation stone of  the National Police Academy. The president said boycott is a  constitutional right of the opposition, but it is high time that  politicians must play their due role to defuse tension and end  polarization in the national body politic. He said even  otherwise there is no justification for the opposition to resort  to boycott at this moment.    Replying to various questions, the president said he has  done  nothing unconstitutional as far as the NWFP [Northwest Frontier  Province] is concerned. He said that Syed Sabir Shah, after  losing majority in the Provincial Assembly, adopted improper  tactics to sustain his government. He said it is a democratic  norm that when one loses majority, he should step aside.</p>

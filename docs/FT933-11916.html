			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Low prices hurt US paper group STONE Container, the US paper and packaging group, yesterday reported a deeper second-quarter loss, saying it continued to be hurt by poor pricing conditions for most of its products, Reuter reports. It said that, except for recent improvements in newsprint prices, it was unable to raise prices for other products. Prices of most of its other products declined in the first half of 1993, the company said. The second-quarter net loss was Dollars 71.6m, or Dollars 1.03 a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 40.7m, or 60 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 1.27bn, down from Dollars 1.37bn last time. 'Even though linerboard has been under discounting pressure recently, we believe that conditions are favourable for price recovery beginning as early as this fall and perhaps lasting for a period of years,' Mr Roger Stone, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said. 'Clearly, since the majority of our revenues are derived from this product line, we are looking forward to this favourable development,' he added. The company said it planned to shut down temporarily six of its mills in the US and Canada. The mills are scheduled to resume production during the third quarter, it added.</p>

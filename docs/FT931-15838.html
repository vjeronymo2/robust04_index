			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Foley warns Clinton to rethink plan to cut income tax MR TOM FOLEY, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, yesterday advised President-elect Bill Clinton to re-think his campaign promise to cut income taxes on the middle class because of the growing federal budget deficit. In a TV interview, Mr Foley said it was 'probably true' that some popular social programmes would have to be curtailed and some taxes raised in the light of the deficit problem. He urged Mr Clinton not to duck such tough choices, saying 'people are mature enough to be told the truth.' He thought Mr Clinton should have his legislative programme ready 'reasonably soon', but not necessarily immediately after the inauguration next week. There was not, he added, 'a use-it-or-lose-it momentum' problem for the new president, since both Republicans and Democrats were willing to support the right sort of policy proposals. Last week, the outgoing Bush administration produced its final econonic projections pointing to wider, not narrower, deficits, assuming no policy changes. Forecasting shortfalls of over Dollars 300bn (Pounds 193bn), they seemed immediately to call into question Mr Clinton's promise to cut the deficit in half in his first term. Mr Richard Darman, Mr Bush's budget director, also publicly questioned the wisdom of some of Mr Clinton's ideas, claiming that 'they do not add up.' This prompted a tart reply from the president-elect to the effect that Mr Darman's maths had not proved so reliable either, as the final deficit forecasts showed. The Clinton economic team met in Little Rock last week to review policy options but announced no conclusions beyond acknowledgment of the severity of the deficit problem. This, in itself, may imply that the tax cut is to be deferred. There is some concern in Washington about the slowness in the formation of the new government. Although all the cabinet appointments were in place before Christmas, none of the critical policy-making positions at the next tier have been formally announced, though rumours of recruitment abound, including that of Mr Larry Summers, the Harvard economist, to be treasury undersecretary for international affairs.

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy With wholesale price inflation apparently so muted and manufacturing output flat, it is not immediately obvious why the Bank of England should still be banging on about corporate margins. Where domestic margins have increased, it is more a case of costs being cut than prices put up. The manufacturing output figures may understate the true level of demand - surely the spurt in electricity production cannot all be due to cold weather. But the anecdotal evidence suggests consumers remain extraordinarily price conscious. The export trade presents a different picture. If they believe figures which have become highly suspect, the authorities have some reason for disappointment that export prices have increased about as fast as import prices since the UK left the ERM. Business is apparently taking advantage of the devaluation to widen margins rather than increase volume. The trend is worrying because it suggests failure to adapt to a low inflation environment. Presumably companies would be jacking up domestic prices if only the market would permit. The Bank will have to labour the point to drive home what is a long term message. If the fight against inflation is not to be too painful, companies must believe that the authorities will not accommodate excessive margin increases. That does not exclude the possibility of lower base rates in the short term. Tomorrow's retail prices index could be a better guide to the immediate chances than yesterday's speech by the deputy governor.</p>

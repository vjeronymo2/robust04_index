			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sorin Rosca Stanescu report: "Accused of Espionage"] </F>   [Text] Last week Traian Basescu, former transportation  minister in the Petre Roman cabinet [and currently a member of  the Chamber of Deputies for the Democratic Party-National  Salvation Front -- PD-FSN], voiced accusations unprecedented in  Romania's history. According to him, representatives of the  executive and the presidential institution passed secret  information about the Petromin fleet to Greek intelligence  General Nikos Grylakis [name as published]. In that context the  PD-FSN deputy named Paul Teodoru, current transportation  minister, and [General] Vasile Ionel, counselor of President Ion  Iliescu. The presidential counselor is supposed to have  personally handed over a file containing secret information to  the Greek general. Basescu claims that the information had been  previously obtained from Petromin Director Romanuel Posedaru.    Until now the representatives of the government, as well as  those of the presidential institution, have not officially  denied anything.    The press remained speechless when it learned about the  accusations of such gravity. If the accusations are sustained  by evidence, the Petromin-Forum Maritime scandal will eventually  be cleared up by simply revealing the details of an espionage  affair the perpetrators of which are top officials in Bucharest  and Athens.    Here are some details for our readers. The persons directly  accused or merely hinted at by Basescu are: General Nikos  Grylakis, the man who in 1993 triggered "the scandal of the  century" in Athens, Stellos Katounis, owner of the Forum  Maritime company, and the Palestinian Fathi Mohamad Taher [name  as published], the owner of the Elite restaurant in Bucharest,  the Greek business adversary of the previous two persons, the  shipping tycoon Iannis Alafouzos, who also owns a number of  radio and television networks, while on the Bucharest side of  the affair they are Paul Teodoru and General Vasile Ionel. On a  secondary plane the names of Konstandinos Mitsotakis, the former  prime minister of Greece, Nicolae Vacaroiu, the head of the  executive in Bucharest, and Ion Iliescu have also been mentioned.    If Basescu's allegations are true, the center figure of the  whole affair is General Grylakis. His career came to an end in  September 1993, previous to which he held the office of Prime  Minister Mitsotakis' counselor for security and defense issues.  Born on the isle of Crete he later graduated from the Military  Academy and the War Academy. He was specially trained by the  Mosad (Israel's intelligence service.) During the 1967 military  dictatorship he was the head of the Greek secret service. In  1989 he organized an illegal network to tap the telephone  conversations of various Greek political figures and gather  information about them. Three years ago he set up the Bureau  for Balkan Affairs. He had contacts with many Balkan leaders.  He publicly claimed that he supported and influenced things to  have Ion Iliescu elected as president. For that service,  according to the Greek press, in 1993 he received a medal in  Bucharest. Iliescu does not deny this. In the same year Premier  Vacaroiu invites him to Snagov to celebrate the conclusion of  the Petromin-Forum Maritime deal. He is a friend of Stellos  Katounis and the Palestinian Taher (both of whom have very tight  business connections with Moscow), and an enemy of Andreas  Papandreou, the current Greek prime minister, and of Alafouzos,  the influential shipping tycoon, who last September managed to  bring General Grylakis to justice.    In the same month [September 1993] our daily already  signaled, for the first time, that he is involved in the  Petromin-Forum Maritime deal. From first-class Greek sources  (who for the time being wish to remain anonymous) we learned  that immediately after "the scandal of the century" erupted in  Athens, General Grylakis made an unexpected move: In exchange  for the extinguishing of the conflict he offered a number of  confidential documents to his adversaries. Among those  documents was the file referred to by Basescu and which contains  evidence regarding the involvement of top Romanian officials in  an espionage affair. In those documents Grylakis describes in  detail the persons from whom he obtained classified information  and how.    Basescu's accusations are so serious that they place the  Romanian intelligence services in a difficult position. The  Foreign Information Service, the Romanian Intelligence Service  [SRI], and UM 0215 (the Intelligence Service of the Ministry of  Interior) are now compelled to urgently provide answers to the  Romanian public.</p>

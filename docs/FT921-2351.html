			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Conservative Manifesto): Personal choice a priority The Tories pledge to move towards an income tax rate of 20p, continue the privatisation programme and maintain an independent line on monetary union. They intend to use British presidency of the EC to increase competition. The keynotes are responsibility and choice. Manifesto highlights are: Foreign Affairs WE WILL support an enhanced role for the UN in peace-keeping and combating state-sponsored terrorism. We are determined that Iraq should comply with the terms of the gulf War cease-fire agreement, and in particular that it should co-operate with the UN in dismantling its weapons of mass destruction. We support early Russian membership of the IMF and World Bank, as well as a stabilisation fund for the rouble. We are co-operating with our partners to provide urgent help to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to upgrade the safety of their nuclear power stations. We strongly support the peace process in the Middle East. We will use overseas aid to promote good government, sensible economic policies, the rooting out of corruption, and crucially  - respect for human rights and the rule of law. We will promote the development of multi-party systems through the new Westminster Foundation for Democracy. We will promote the English language by strengthening both the British Council and the BBC World Service. Security and defence We will complete the deployment of the next generation of Britain's minimum nuclear deterrent. We will order and complete the fourth Trident submarine. The Reserves will play an even more important role and we will introduce legislation to allow their more flexible use. European Community We will continue to resist changes to the Treaty of Rome that would damage British business. We will resist Commission initiatives which run counter to the principle that issues should be dealt with on a national basis wherever possible. We will work for a successful outcome to the Gatt negotiations. We will redouble our efforts to reform the Common Agricultural Policy to reduce costs to taxpayers and consumers. We will insist on more effective control over Community spending and will resist pressure to extend Community competence to new areas. Our priorities for the Presidency will be: To start negotiations with those Efta countries who want to join the Community so that they can join by 1995 To build on the EC's Association Agreements with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland so that we can welcome them to full membership by the year 2000. To conclude EC trade and co-operation agreements with the main republics of the former Soviet Union. To complete the single market and extend it to the seven countries of Efta. We will provide guidance and help to any British company encountering a trade barrier illegal under European law. We will press for progress on the environment, including the Fifth Environment Action Programme. Inflation and sterling In the 1990s, the government's task will be to provide an economic environment which encourages enterprise - the mainspring of prosperity. Our aims must be: To achieve price stability. To keep firm control over public spending. To continue to reduce taxes as fast as we prudently can. To make sure the market mechanisms and incentives are allowed to do their job. In due course, we will move to the narrow bands of the ERM. We will play our full part in the design and discussion of monetary institutions for Europe. When or if other members of the EC move to a monetary union with a single currency, we will take our own unfettered decision on whether to join. That decision will be taken by the UK parliament. Route to lower taxes We announced in the Budget an important first step towards a basic income tax rate of 20p. By applying a 20p rate to the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income, we have cut taxes for all 25 million taxpayers, and taken the 4m on lowest incomes out of 25p tax altogether. We will make further progress towards a basic Income Tax rate of 20p. We will see the Budget return towards balance as the economy recovers. Homes and inheritance tax We will aim to bring home ownership, share ownership and personal pensions within the reach of more families. We will continue to reform the taxation of savings, building on the success of Peps and Tessas. We will raise the tax threshold for inheritance tax so that the homes and savings of an increasing number of our citizens can pass unemcumbered from one generation to another. We will encourage companies to make dealing in their own shares easier, especially for small shareholders, and encourage wider share ownership, through, for example, the establishment of 'Share Shops'. We will abolish stamp duty on share transactions. Business taxation We will continue to reduce tax burdens on business, as we have done this year for the motor industry, whenever it is possible to do so. We will abolish unnecessary licences and reduce the need for specific approvals for product design. We will back British companies encountering any discrimination, trade barriers or state subsidies that should no longer exist within the single market. We will back the regulators of the financial services industry in their efforts to achieve high standards while keeping the rule books down to manageable size. Privatisation We will continue our privatisation programme. British Coal will be returned to the private sector. So will local authority bus companies. We will encourage local authorities to sell their airports. We will end British Rail's monopoly. We will sell certain rail services and franchise others. The Ports Act 1991 has paved the way for the privatisation of the Trust Ports by competitive tender. We are privatising Northern Ireland Electricity and will privatise the Northern Ireland water and sewage services. We will bring private-sector enterprise into the public services by encouraging contracting out and competitive tendering throughout government. We will maintain our programme of compulsory competitive tendering of local authority services. We will ensure that competitive tendering is extended to white-collar local authority services, such as those offered by lawyers, accountants, architects and surveyors. We will introduce new legislation giving stronger powers to deal with cartels. Energy We will continue to encourage competition in energy markets. We will progressively reduce British Gas' monopoly of the retail gas market, to give small users the same rights as big firms. We will privatise British Coal in a way that enables employees to enjoy a stake in the industry. We will increase our support for British Coal Enterprise, which promotes economic regeneration in areas affected by the closure of mines, and has successfully assisted 76,000 people in finding new jobs. We will review the future of the nuclear industry in 1994. We are committed to safe and economical nuclear power. Regional policies We will ensure that regional policy is well targeted. We will continue to support all parts of the UK in their campaigns to attract inward investment. We will give additional emphasis to upgrading skills and technology when allocating funds. Small businesses We will develop a new Enterprise Service to give small and medium-sized companies help in diagnosing their most important strategic needs. Tecs and Lecs will be closely involved in developing and implementing this new initiative. Consumer affairs We will introduce legislation designed to give consumers confidence that what they purchase is properly described  - and that adequate compensation is offered where these requirements are not met. We will enable the courts to override unfair terms in contracts and improve our powers to deal with rogue traders. We will tighten up the rules on holiday brochures and contracts, and introduce a 'cooling-off' period into timeshare contracts. We will introduce legislation to simplify trade mark registration and extend the rights they confer. We will enforce science-based controls on the use of chemicals in food production, and will maintain our policy of open access to information on pesticide safety. Citizen's Charter The Audit Commission will be able to publish league tables of performance including each local council and health authority so that people can compare the quality of service. We will ensure that inspection reports are published and widely available. We will require British Rail to tighten its targets for reliability and punctuality on all lines, and report monthly to passengers on how it is doing. London Underground will publish its own charter. We will expect Post Offices and Jobcentres to set our standards of service and levels of achievement. A new Charter Mark award will give recognition to those parts of the public sevice that best meet charter standards. We will act to ensure that private firms bidding to improve local authority public services are not obstructed by unscrupulous practices in councils or unfair contracts. We will encourage the wider use of performance pay inside the Civil Service and in other parts of the public service. We are ensuring that the regulators have the powers they need to promote competition and safeguard the interests of the customer by controlling price increases. We will increase competition in the gas and water markets. The Post Office We are committed to maintaining a nationwide letter service, within a uniform structure of prices, and with a nationwide network of Post Offices. We will lower the limit on the Post Office monopoly much closer to the level of the first-class stamp. We will consider requests to license limited specialist services to compete with the Post Office monopoly. Whitehall We will give a cabinet minister responsibility for the Citi zen's Charter programme and reforming the Civil Service, taking charge of the Citizen's Charter Unit, Efficiency Unit, the programme for creating Agencies and the Public Competition and Purchasing Unit. We intend to create a new department, under a cabinet minister, with responsibility for broadcasting, arts, sport, tourism, the national heritage and the film industry. We will transfer the core responsiblities of the Department of Energy to the Department of Trade and Industry, and responsibilities for energy efficiency to the Department of the Environment, ending the need for a separate department. Small businesses are the seedcorn of our future prosperity. We believe the DTI should take over responsibility for them. We also want to strengthen the links between the DTI and the highly successful Training and Enterprise Councils. Responsibility for overseeing all financial services will be brought together in the Treasury, in line with the practice adopted in most other advanced countries. New programmes for regenerating our inner cities are outlined in this manifesto. Responsibilities will be brought together in the Department of the Environment. We are determined to ensure that women in the workforce realise their full potential. We will transfer from the Home Office to the Department of Employment the lead responsibility for co-ordinating government policy on issues of particular concern to women. Open government We will review the 80 or so statutory restrictions which exist on the disclosure of information  - retaining only those needed to protect privacy and essential confidentiality. We will seek to provide greater access to personal records held by government. We will be less secretive about the workings of government. For example, when the Committees of the Cabinet are reconstituted after the election we will, for the first time, set out their names and membership. We will update and  - for the first time  - publish the guidance for mInisters on procedure. Education We will complete the introduction of the National Curriculum offering 10 subjects at a nationally defined standard  - English, mathematics, science, history, geography, technology, art, music, PE and, in secondary schools, a foreign language. Regular and straightforward tests will be in place for all 7, 11 and 14-year-olds by 1994. GCSE at age 16 will be integrated into the National Curriculum, with a new A+ grade to test the most able. The majority of marks will come from a written exam. We will continue to encourage the creation of nursery places. Full information will be published annually about the performance of all local schools in each area. Popular schools which are over-subscribed will be given the resources to expand. The Technology Schools Initiative will be expanded across the country. Existing schools which opt for GM status will be able to emulate City Technology Colleges and attract private technology sponsorship. We will maintain the Assisted Places scheme, which gives access to independent education to many families who could not otherwise afford it. We will develop an Advanced Diploma which can be earned by students pursuing either academic or vocational courses, and a new General National Vocational Qualification. Training By the end of the new parliament, the new system of National Vocational Qualifications should cover virtually every occupation in the economy. The CBI's training targets envisage 80% of young people reaching NVQ level 2 by the end of the parliament. We intend to make training credits available to all 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds within the lifetime of the new parliament. The Tecs will continue to be responsible for the YT programme for this age group. We will continue to finance training programmes for the long-term unemployed and those who face particular difficulties. We will launch with the Tecs a new initiative, giving people a voucher with which they can buy a 'skill check', providing assessment and guidance on how to make the most of their working lives. Workers and unions We will require employers to give everyone who works for them for more than eight hours a week a clear written statement of their terms and conditions of employment. We will make automatic deduction of union membership dues without written authorisation unlawful. We will take measures to give individuals greater freedom in choosing a union. We will legislate to require that all pre-strike ballots are postal and subject to independent scrutiny, and that at least seven days' notice of a strike is given after a ballot. People who use public services will have the right to restrain the disruption of those services by unlawful industrial action. Police We are continuing to increase police numbers. There will be 1,000 extra police officers this year. We will set up a working party to examine what more can be done to protect the police and members of other emergency services from assault. 'Joyriders' will now face prison sentences of up to five years, unlimited fines and unlimited driving bans. We will extend the maximum sentence for causing death through dangerous or drink driving. We will sustain our massive prison reform and building programme. We will introduce a major Criminal Justice Bill in the lifetime of the new parliament. We will bring forward proposals for reform of Sunday trading laws once the legal position has been made clear by the European Court of Justice. Pornography, privacy, libel British domestic controls on pornography will remain in place even after the completion of the single European market. Community relations Racial and sexual discrimination have no place in our society. We have given the police stronger powers to deal with racial hatred. We will continue to ensure that the full force of the law is used to deal with racial attacks. Immigration Asylum Bill to be reintroduced in the new parliament to create a faster and more effective system of determining who are genuine political refugees. Health We will, year by year, increase the level of real resources committed to the NHS. Savings made through greater efficiency will be ploughed back into the service. We will continue to develop the NHS Trust movement which places responsibility for managing hospitals and other services with local teams who are closest to patients. We will ensure that the benefits of fundholding arrangements are available to any GP who wishes to apply, and we will be ready to extend the scope of the scheme further as it develops. Patient's Charter Binding guarantees will be set locally for in-patient waiting times, starting with the operations where waiting causes most distress. To ensure that progress on waiting times continues, we intend that from 31 March 1993, no one should have to wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee replacement, or a cataract operation. We are sure that, as now, many hospitals will be able to do better than this. We will move to a system under which a named nurse or midwife will be responsible for your care while you are in hospital. We will set specific targets for out-patient waiting times. Children We will ensure that the standards implemented through the Children Act are applied sensibly, and do not discourage private of voluntary arrangments which are often best suited to the needs of children and parents. We will carry forward a family support initiative, encouraging the voluntary sector to work in partnership with families and local authorities. Child benefit will remain the cornerstone of our policy for all families with children. Its value will increase each year in line with prices. Pensions We will continue to pay from April 1993 a rebate at the level recommended by the Government Actuary for all those who contract out of the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme. We will legislate to provide a new 1 per cent incentive for holders of personal pensions aged 30 and over from April 1993, when the existing incentive ends. We will consider proposals for a new system of rebates to come into effect from April 1996 with the aim of ensuring that personal pensions remain attractive across the age range. We are firmly committed to equal treatment for men and women in pensions. Following assessment of the responses to our discussion paper, we will bring forward legislation to achieve this. Mortgages and rent We will maintain mortgage tax relief. We will introduce a nation-wide 'Rents to Mortgages' scheme, enabling council tenants to take a part-share in their home, gradually stepping up to full ownership. We will put more of the Housing Corporation's Pounds 2bn budget into do-it-yourself shared ownership. We will introduce 'commonhold' legislation, giving residential leaseholders in blocks of flats the right to acquire the freehold of their block at the market rate. Leaseholders of higher-rated houses will also be given the right to buy the freehold of their property. Leaseholders who live in a block which does not qualify will have a new right to buy an extended lease. We will introduce statutory time limits for answers by local authorities to standard inquiries by house-buyers. We will extend nationwide the scheme we have piloted to increase private renting, whereby housing associations manage properties. As soon as possible in the new parliament, we will introduce a new 'Rent a Room' scheme under which home-owners will be able to let rooms to lodgers without having to pay tax on the rent. Housing needs We will revolutionise management of council houses and flats. Compulsory competitive tendering will oblige local authorities to bring in managers. We will give tenants a new Right to Improve, so they can receive compensation for certain home improvements. We will work with the Housing Corporation to establish an Ombudsman for housing association tenants. We will set up a task force  - headed by an independent chairman  - to help bring empty government residential properties back into use. We will introduce a new pilot scheme to promote homesteading. Transport Franchising will be introduced to give the private sector the fullest opportunity to operate existing passenger railway services. Required standards of punctuality, reliability and quality of service will be specified by franchises; subsidy will continue to be provided where necessary; arrangements to sustain the current national network of services will be maintained; and through-ticketing will be required. A new Rail Regulator  - who will ensure that all companies have fair access to the track  - will award the franchises and make sure franchisees honour the terms of the contract. BR's accounting systems and internal structures will be reorganised. One part of BR will continue to be responsible for all track and infrastructure. The operating side of BR will continue to provide passenger services until they are franchised out. Our aim will be to franchise out services in such a way as to reflect regional and local identity and make operating sense. We want to recover a sense of pride in our railways and to recapture the spirit of the old regional companies. We will sell BR's freight operations outright. We will also sell its parcels business. We will be prepared to sell stations  - which we want to be centres of activity  - to franchisees or independent companies. The Railway Inspectorate will be given full powers to ensure the highest standards of safety. We will improve road transport by: Investing Pounds 6.3bn in our trunk road and motorway network over the next three years, concentrating particularly on bypasses. Privatising the remaining 39 local authority bus companies. Deregulating buses in London and privatising the London Buses subsidiaries. A new London Bus Executive will be responsible for bus stops, stands and stations and for contracting out socially necessary services. Changing the system under which motorway service areas are provided. Encouraging action internationally, and within our own motor industry, to promote more fuel-efficient vehicles. We will further liberalise transatlantic air services and encourage more international flights to and from regional airports. We will encourage local authorities to sell their airports. We will seek to privatise the Docklands Light Railway during the next parliament. Local government We will set up a commission to examine, area by area, the appropriate local government arrangements in England. Local communities will be fully consulted and their loyalties and interests will be central to the commission's task in deciding whether in any area a single tier of local government could provide better accountability and greater efficiency. We will replace the community charge (poll tax) with a new council tax in April 1993. It will be fair and will rightly reflect both the value of the property and the number of adults who live in it. Reviving cities We will continue to extend City Challenge and allocate a greater proportion of resources by competitive bidding. We will bring together resources for targeted inner-city programmes into a single budget. New, integrated regional offices of the appropriate Whitehall departments will be established. We will establish a new Urban Regeneration Agency. London We will convene a new private sector forum to promote London's position internationally. We will establish a new cabinet sub-committee to co-ordinate policy on London. We will give a single transport minister responsibility for services in London. Broadcasting We will publish a discussion paper on the future of the BBC, recognising its special responsibilities for providing public service broadcasting.</p>

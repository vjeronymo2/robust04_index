			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" No. 11 feature] </F>   [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis, at the briefing Monday,  said that he regrets Yegor Gaydar's resignation, since he  believes that Gaydar's economic policies are rational and  concrete.    Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs believes that Yegor  Gaydar's resignation will not influence Russian-Latvian economic  relations.    He told Interfax that over the past two years the volume of  economic contacts between the two countries had decreased so  much that it would not be serious to talk about any further  deterioration.    He believes that whenever possible the Latvian government  will continue economic dialogue with the Russian government  irrespective of the changes in it.    He described Gaydar's resignation as "Russia's inner  political games" which will have no decisive impact on the  neighboring states."</p>

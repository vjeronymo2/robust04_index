			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Agenda" page by David Chu, Preliminary </F> Working Committee member and PRC adviser: "Revised Laws  Imminent But Not Draconian"]    [Text] Freedom of movement has played a vital role in Hong  Kong's success. I believe it must be preserved and indeed  enhanced in the future. To foster an open Hong Kong, the future  regulations on permanent residency should be moderate and  inclusive rather than harsh and exclusive.    The Basic Law was written in this spirit. As an  illustration, it states quite clearly that anyone living in Hong  Kong who has no right of abode elsewhere can become a permanent  resident of the Special Administrative Region (SAR). In theory,  if any Hong Kong resident -- regardless of race or former  nationality -- wants to become a permanent resident, all he has  to do is give up his right of abode elsewhere before 1997. He  will not even need to pledge allegiance or go through a ceremony  or any such rigmarole, which is customary in most, if not all,  countries.    As a member of the panel on security and welfare of the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), I am working on various  recommendations regarding the granting of permanent residency to  returning former residents with new foreign passports, foreign  nationals who are currently living and working in Hong Kong and  future newcomers. Some of the tentative thinking of the panel  is outlined below and more consultation is required before these  recommendations are formalised and submitted to the 1996  Preparatory Committee.    For returning former Hong Kong residents with foreign  passports, their residency in the territory before acquiring  their new passports can be used to fulfil the seven-year  residency requirement in the Basic Law.    Foreign residents having completed the seven-year residency  requirement need only fill in a form (no supporting material  required) and meet some objective conditions to support their  claim that they intend to stay in Hong Kong. These conditions  relate to ownership of property, job or business investments,  the presence of family in Hong Kong and time spent in the  territory. No proof that these conditions have been met is  required. This welcoming attitude is in stark contrast to the  British 1981 Nationality Act, which stripped Hong Kong people of  the right of abode in the United Kingdom.    The British Government is advising China that it is in  China's interest to keep Hong Kong open to all. Although China  is likely to go down this line, I would certainly question the  sincerity of the British advice. There has been some grumbling  that China's nationality criteria are racially based or biased.  This is an emotive oversimplification. While China confers  citizenship on its people -- who may be Han, Xi Yuan, Korean,  Manchu, Tibetan Mongolian or other ethnic stock -- it is not  acting in any way out of the ordinary. For example, the German  constitution accords instant residency and citizenship to anyone  of German descent, whether or not that individual speaks the  language and even if his family has been living abroad for  generations. A Turk born in Germany is not so privileged.    The United Kingdom has granted citizenship to white South  Africans with tenuous blood links to Britain, but its attitude  towards the Hong Kong Chinese, however, is quite different.  Japan also welcomes home its prodigals, including those of its  nationals born or left behind in China after World War 11, but  it is rather meaner towards ethnic Koreans, some of whom have  been harshly treated for generations.    I believe that Hong Kong should be open and truly  international. Only then can we attract experts and investors --  be they American, Japanese, Singaporean, German, French or  British -- to live, work and compete, and who will complement  the ethnic Chinese on terms of equality not quite possible while  Hong Kong is a colony of the United Kingdom. I am sure the  British would welcome the new competition in the spirit  of"openness" and "fairness".    Whatever wrongs have been inflicted on China by foreign  powers, and even though Hong Kong is a reminder of its past  humiliations, China has nevertheless accepted the special  circumstances of this diverse city and the qualities that make  it unique. The PWC is entrusted with giving thorough advice to  the Chinese Government to preserve the extraordinary qualities  of Hong Kong.    I personally invite people, whatever their nationality and  race, to take heart and to take part in the SAR. That the Basic  Law allows for 20 per cent of the future legislature to be open  to foreign nationals is remarkably generous. I cannot think of  a legislature anywhere -- not the British House of Commons and  not the American Senate -- quite like it.    Experts predict that Hong Kong will be the financial mecca  of  the next century, surpassing Tokyo. If that comes to pass, some  of the credit should go to the policy, which the PWC advocates,  of opening Hong Kong to even more international trade, commerce  and investment, partly through the welcoming of other nationals  to reside here.</p>

Last summer, Los Angeles  Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes the project, called for a  40% reduction in the amount of office space, expansion of the wetlands and a  new environmental impact report.  </P> <P> Nelson C. Rising, who will head the development team for Playa Vista, said it  was too early to say what specific changes will be made in the original plan.  </P></p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Dixons leads slow day with Dollars 100m offering With US markets closed, the Eurobond market caught its breath after last week's record-breaking flood of supply, and saw only a handful of new issues. Dixons Group, the UK consumer electronics and domestic appliances retailer, was the first UK non-financial corporate borrower to tap the Euro sterling sector in months, raising Dollars 100m of 10-year bonds via Samuel Montagu. The bonds, priced to yield 140 basis points over gilts at the re-offer price of 99.30, ended the day at 99.40 bid, yielding some 137 basis points over gilts. Most of the paper had been pre-placed by the lead manager last week, ensuring the issue went smoothly. The dollar floating-rate note (FRN) sector saw Dollars 100m of five-year notes for the Cassa di Risparmio di Verona and Dollars 75m two-year notes for Commerzbank International. The Cassa di Risparmio deal was reported to have met with healthy demand, especially from banks, which like to hold floating-rate assets to match their liabilities. The Commerzbank floater, structured so that interest only accrues when Libor falls within a specific range at certain times, was harder to place, partly because the borrower was Commerzbank's Luxembourg subsidiary, one trader said. Alcatel Alsthom, the French-based engineering, transport and telecommunications group, issued FFr2bn of 10-year bonds via Societe Generale. Despite a profit warning from the company's chairman which caused its share price to slide by 12 per cent last week, the deal met with demand from a broad range of European investors. The bonds were priced to yield 36 basis points over the benchmark 10-year OAT, and while the price came off in line with the underlying bond market, the spread remained constant. Meanwhile, market participants are gearing up for another raft of large issues in coming weeks. On Friday, Mexico's Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext) is expected to issue a Dollars 1bn global bond via Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. Market talk indicates a yield spread over US Treasuries of some 150-165 basis points. A roadshow for the issuer will be held in London today. China is expected to launch a Dollars 1bn issue of 10-year global bonds via Merrill Lynch, following a series of investor presentations due to start tomorrow in Hong Kong. Rumours of a Dollars 1.5bn FRN for the Canadian Province of Ontario remained on the boil, while Lloyds Bank was said to have postponed its planned Pounds 300m 25-year sterling bond after the details of the deal had been widely leaked in the market. Elsewhere, Swedish Export Credit is said to be planning the first Swedish krone global bond, with Merrill Lynch tipped as lead manager for the SKr2.0bn deal.</p>

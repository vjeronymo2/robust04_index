			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CBS PLANS MINISERIES ON NUSSBAUM OF STEINBERG CASE  </P> <P> CBS Entertainment has set itself the task of making a 4-hour miniseries out of  one of the more unattractive stories of the decade: how Hedda Nussbaum, a  onetime book editor, came under the thrall of a disbarred New York lawyer Joel  Steinberg, endured 11 years of beatings at his hands and stood by while he  fatally beat the couple's illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter, Lisa.  </P> <P> A murder charge against Nussbaum was dropped in exchange for her testimony  against Steinberg, 47, who is serving an 8- to 25-year prison term for the  fatal beating of Lisa.  </P> <P> The deal was arranged by CBS News' "West 57th" executive producer, Andrew Lack,  and Nussbaum's attorney, Barry Sheck. Lack will produce the movie for the CBS  Entertainment division, part of the deal he made with CBS News recently when he  signed a new contract after being courted by NBC News  </P> <P> A source at CBS Entertainment said Friday that the miniseries could be ready  sometime late in the 1989-90 season.  </P> <P> CBS sources said Friday the network paid "considerably less" than $100,000 for  the deal, which includes access to hundreds of pages of personal diaries  Nussbaum has kept since she was 15.  </P> <P> Nussbaum, 46, is a patient at a Westchester, N.Y., psychiatric hospital. She is  scheduled to be released soon and reportedly has been looking for a furnished  apartment near the hospital. Steinberg is appealing his first-degree  manslaughter conviction. He was sentenced 3 weeks ago.  </P> <P> In addition to the diaries, Lack told the New York Daily News, "there's an  enormous amount of material she has kept as a result of her legal and medical  problems that's going to be the basis for much of the story I hope to tell. I  want it to be an honest and compelling account of who this woman is and what  happened to her."  </P> <P> In 7 days of testimony at the trial, Nussbaum related how Steinberg would  punish her by forcing her to beg for food, sleep on the floor and take ice  water baths. She suffered 16 broken ribs and injuries to virtually every part  of her body during the 11 years of the relationship, which ended Nov. 2, 1987,  when Lisa was found unconscious in the couple's Greenwich Village apartment.  </P> <P> NBC reportedly had been "active" in trying to secure rights to Nussbaum's  story. An ABC spokesman Friday would not comment on whether his network was  planning a dramatization of the case, or on reports that ABC would make its own  miniseries based on Susan Brownmiller's "Waverly Place," a novel loosely based  on the case.  </P> <P> One big question remains for CBS Entertainment: how to promote such an  unpleasant 4 hours of TV.  </P> <P> Bob Shanks, a veteran U.S. producer and writer, took over Sunday as executive  managing director of Channel 10 in Australia, one of three privately owned  national channels Down Under.  </P> <P> Shanks has signed a 3-year contract with the Sydney-based TV channel, owned by  Frank Lowy, for a job equivalent to president and chief executive officer in  the United States.  </P> <P> In 1987, Shanks served as creator and executive producer of CBS's "The Morning  Program," starring Mariette Hartley and Rolland Smith, which debuted in January  but was replaced in late November of that year by "CBS This Morning."  </P> <P> Shanks, who previously served as an executive vice president at ABC for six  years, helped create both "Good Morning America" and "20-20" for that network.  Most recently, he wrote four made-for-TV movies for CBS Entertainment, which  were co-produced by his wife, Ann Shanks, as well as two PBS specials.  </P></p>

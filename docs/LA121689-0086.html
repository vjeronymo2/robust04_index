			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN THE EAST BLOC;  </P> <P> W. GERMAN RIGHT EXTOLS UNIFICATION;  </P> <P> EUROPE: RIGHTIST PARTY PLANS A WING IN EAST GERMANY TO EXPLOIT NATIONALIST  FEELINGS IN THE MAY ELECTION.  </P> <P> The far-right Republicans party of West Germany is exploiting the sensitive  issue of German reunification in a way that has the centrist parties worried.  </P> <P> The Republicans' latest move, under the direction of former SS Sgt. Franz  Schoenhuber, is the announcement of the formation of an East German wing of the  party, to put up candidates in the free elections scheduled for May 6.  </P> <P> The Republicans say they plan to capitalize on the East Germans' desire for  reunification of the two Germanys, as shown repeatedly by demonstrations in  Leipzig and other East German cities.  </P> <P> Political specialists in Bonn and East Berlin say that because the main  opposition groups in East Germany have not yet organized as political parties,  the Republicans could have a strong appeal to nationalist feelings.  </P> <P> "We want an active German policy with the aim of reunification," party leader  Schoenhuber says. "We want free . . . elections for East Germany and then a  plebiscite on reunification."  </P> <P> The issue could develop political momentum on both sides of the border, the  analysts say, because the Republicans are exploiting both sides of the issue.  </P> <P> They are calling for reunification and at the same time urging East Germans to  stay in their country and not join the hundreds of thousands who have fled to  the West. This position is supported by many West Germans, who fear that the  newcomers will take needed jobs and housing.  </P> <P> The Republicans party could prove to be the natural political home for the new  arrivals, who might reject the West German opposition Social Democrats because,  as political analyst Angelika Wolle, has put it, "Socialism has become a dirty  word for them."  </P> <P> The Christian Democrats as well as the Social Democrats are worried about  losing votes to the Republicans in next December's elections. The Republicans  party has its roots in the rural areas of Bavaria, where their values are  widely shared: patriotism, hard work, family, law and order, tougher  immigration laws, national assertiveness.  </P> <P> In Bavaria, the Republicans have cut into the right-wing vote that has usually  gone to the Christian Democrats. In local elections this year, the Republicans  also showed strength in other parts of West Germany, including northern cities,  where they made gains among working-class people who had customarily voted for  Social Democratic candidates.  </P> <P> The Republicans polled more than 7% nationally in last June's elections for the  European Parliament. Schoenhuber himself won a seat in the European Parliament.  </P> <P> The Republicans also worry the liberal Free Democrats, who normally get only 7%  to 8% of the vote. A minimum of 5% is needed if a party is to be represented in  the national Parliament, so the Free Democrats cannot afford to have their  strength eroded.  </P> <P> Many West German political commentators are concerned about the possibility  that the Republicans will move even further to the right. The party's rallies  raise disturbing memories of the rise of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party in the  1920s.  </P> <P> "For a long time," a political specialist remarked the other day, "the news  media ignored Schoenhuber, but since he started winning elections, the media  has not only discovered him but turned him into a demon."  </P> <P> Schoenhuber, however, complains that lately the media have ignored the  Republicans or written them off as right-wing fanatics.  </P> <P> "I say intelligent things," he says, "but the German media doesn't bother to  put the intelligent things in their stories."  </P> <P> Schoenhuber, 66, is a former television journalist who makes no apology for his  service with the SS, which began as Hitler's bodyguard but grew to the point  that it included armored divisions and provided guards for concentration camps.  </P> <P> At his rallies, drinking beer and eating sausage, he comes across not as a  demon but as an affable politician who is on to a good thing.  </P> <P> "Look around," he told a visitor at a recent rally in Furth-im-Wald, in  Bavaria. "These are the people who work for our party. They are our core. Do  they look and act like extremists? Like neo-Nazis?  </P> <P> "Certainly we are on the right wing of the political spectrum. But that has  nothing to do with Nazism or fascism. Hitler brought a great catastrophe for  our country and the whole world. He was a criminal idiot. But we do say yes to  patriotism, and no more mea culpas; the time for apologizing is past. I was a  patriotic young German soldier. I am still patriotic, and that is the appeal of  the Republicans."  </P> <P> Schoenhuber has been concentrating in the past few months on organization -- he  wants to create a party structure independent of his own personality -- and has  been out of the political limelight. He re-emerged with the announcement of the  party's involvement in East Germany.  </P> <P> "We have a definite future," he said, "because our members are young -- 70% of  them 30 or younger. We are the youngest party in Germany, and many of our  members are civil servants, in the police, the armed forces, government  offices."  </P> <P> Schoenhuber denies that being on the far right makes him automatically suspect  as anti-Semitic.  </P> <P> "How could I be?" he said. "My first wife was a Hungarian Jew, and my daughter  living in the United States is half-Jewish. Racism of any kind is deadly and  unacceptable."  </P> <P> Political observers say the Republicans could look to get the votes of people  who feel passed over by the economic boom and think their jobs and social  benefits are jeopardized by the influx of refugees.  </P> <P> "Generally speaking," Schoenhuber said, "we are the party of the poorer  people."  </P> <P> Other political parties embrace the virtues of West Germany's ties with the  Western Alliance, but the Republicans emphasize "Germany first."  </P> <P> "I feel proud to be German," Schoenhuber said. "We are the only party in favor  of immediate reunification. I'm convinced that time and events are working for  us."  </P></p>

The parliament resolution, adopted on March 29, says that  the  blame for this crime rests entirely with the Soviet authorities,  led by Mikhail Gorbachev, and on the Azerbaijani leadership of  that time, above all Abdurakhman Vizirov and Viktor Polyanichko,  then first and second secretaries of the Azerbaijani Communist  Party; Ayaz Mutalibov, the chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers,  Elmira Gafarova, the chairperson of the parliament's presidium,  and Vagif Gusseynov, the chairman of Azerbaijan's KGB. Legal  action has been initiated against these figures and also against  former head of the Azerbaijani KGB's 4th department Nikolay  Starchenkov, and Mark Shmotkin, the commander of the Baku Higher  Military School, who organized an explosion in the Azerbaijani  TV center.    The document also says that legal action against Polyanichko  and Gafarova were stopped because of the said figures' death.    Meanwhile, some of the deputies insisted that the list of  those guilty of the tragedy shall be supplemented with the names  of Yevgeny Primakov, Dmitriy Yazov, Nikolay Kryuchkov and Vadim  Bakatin.    Most of the deputies agreed with President Gaydar Aliyev,  who  said that the blame for the tragedy rests with the former Soviet  state.    A leader of the parliamentary opposition Etibar Mamedov  believes that the final assessment of the events in Baku in  January 1990, may only be given by a new parliament, not the  current one, elected during the rule of communists.</p>

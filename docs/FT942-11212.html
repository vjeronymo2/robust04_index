The pre-tax outcome - Pounds 314,139 against losses last time of Pounds 95,498 - came on turnover marginally down at Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 15.2m) and was struck after a Pounds 284,000 reduction in distribution and administrative costs to Pounds 4.34m. Interest payable declined to Pounds 184,418 (Pounds 306,360).

			<p>BFN     [Text] Basel, Switzerland, May 9 (AFP) -- Group of Ten  central bank governors held a "confidential" discussion Monday  [9 May] on the situation on the foreign exchange markets, German  Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said here after the  governors' regular monthly meeting.    The talks came in the wake of large-scale concerted  intervention last week by central banks to prop up the slumping  U.S. dollar.    "We talked about developments on the forex markets and their  implications for monetary policy", said Tietmeyer, who chairs  the G-10 governors' committee. "Our discussion was  confidential."    He added that the committee had not discussed exchange rate  targets at their meeting at the Basel headquarters of the Bank  for International Settlements.    The governors also talked about the derivatives markets, the  growth of which is causing them some worries. "We decided today  to make a study, to be completed in April 1995, of all  participants on this market," the Bundesbank chief said.    He also said the governors were a little more optimistic  than  previously about the world economy.</p>

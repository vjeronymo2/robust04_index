			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by AL-BILAD's political editor] </F>   [Excerpts] The conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian  economic agreement and Jordan's announcement that it has adopted  new measures regulating the residence of West Bankers in Jordan  have been among the most prominent events reviving the  undeclared state of war between the PLO and Jordan.    Well-informed sources say that Jordan is disturbed by the  economic agreement that the PLO signed with Israel because it  contains many points that have overlooked the Jordanian role and  the economic agreements that should be signed with it while PLO  leaders view Jordan's measures on the residency of West Bankers  in Jordan as a step to pull the carpet out from under the PLO's  feet and a new Jordanian attempt to confirm its authority over  the Palestinians.    A ranking Jordanian official believes that mending the  Jordanian- Palestinian relationship has become somewhat  difficult following the PLO-Israeli economic agreement, which  conflicts to some extent with the contents of the agreement on  economic understanding between Jordan and the PLO. [passage  omitted]    A Palestinian official who declined to be named says that  the  Palestinians major concern during the formulation of the  economic agreement with Israel had been how to wrest some gains  that will enable them to build the nucleus of an independent  Palestinian economy that would depend on neither the Israelis or  the Jordanians.    The official told Al-BILAD that Israel has agreed to the  Palestinians right to directly import from Arab and world  markets.    The Palestinian official reveals that on his arrival in the  occupied territories, President 'Arafat will immediately start  building a floating port in Gaza to enable him to import  commodities needed by the autonomous region until the Gaza Port  is completed in two years.    The PLO's move toward direct import greatly worries Jordan.  If it materializes, Jordan will not be the lungs through which  the occupied territories will breathe and will not be the place  through which all commodities will pass. Thus, Jordan will be  deprived of the unique economic relationship which binds it to  the West Bank and on which Jordan had wagered much to achieve  economic recovery.    While Jordan has such fears, the PLO also has similar  apprehensions, particularly with respect to the recent measures  on easing restrictions imposed on the West Bankers.    Palestinian officials believe that with its surprise  measures  Jordan wants to enhance its relations with Palestinians in the  occupied territories and reinvigorate them within a legal  framework in a manner that will give it historical tutelage over  them.    However, Jordanian Interior Minister Salamah Hammad had  emphasized that the recent Jordanian measures and the facilities  that were given to the West Bankers have no political  connotations.    Political observers believe that the recent Jordanian  measures would lead to a Palestinian exodus from the territories  toward Jordan. Some expect that approximatley 200,000 people  will leave.    Observers also believe that this exodus will be accompanied  by a transfer of captial from the West Bank to Jordan while the  prevailing belief had been that Palestinian capital would move  from Jordan to the West Bank.    These observers believe that the rivalry between Jordan and  the PLO to win the hearts of Palestinians will exacerbate,  particularly since Jordan enjoys a good reputation among some  Palestinian leaders.    Palestinian sources told AL-BILAD that President 'Arafat  might adopt several measures to tighten his control on the  population and to put the Palestinian house in order, such as  the closing of the borders with Jordan for a period that could  last three months.    In any case, the coming days will reveal the dimensions of  the dispute and the war between the PLO and Jordan.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Cardoso faces some hard choices: There are worrying signs of inflation reviving Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, probably Brazil's next president, will inherit an economy apparently in its best shape for years. The new Real currency, which he planned when finance minister, is backed by Dollars 40bn of foreign reserves and has cut monthly inflation from 50 per cent in June to less than 2 per cent last month. This year's per capita growth is forecast at 2 per cent, while exports are at record levels. But serious problems stemming from years of high inflation and political interference in the economy, remain. Unless Mr Cardoso acts quickly, inflation could return to undermine the credibility he has built with the Real. Inflation may already be increasing by the time he takes over on January 1. Some food prices are rising because of a drought. Businesses are likely to raise prices in the run-up to Christmas, especially now the election is over. Consumer demand has risen sharply since the Real's launch, because the fall in inflation has left poorer consumers better off. August sales of televisions were 85 per cent up on a year ago and Sao Paulo's factories are the busiest since 1989. These signals of higher inflation are worrying, although most analysts expect the outgoing government's tight hold on credit and interest rates will stop any rapid rise. 'Increasing demand worries me but it is not an explosion and it is controllable,' said Mr Mailson da Nobrega, former finance minister, who estimates inflation will remain at 2-3 per cent a month this year. A bigger threat on the inflation front comes from the government's finances. Part of the reason for the Real's success was that the government managed to balance this year's budget, helped by one-off spending cuts and higher than expected tax revenues. Next year the picture is less promising. An emergency tax on bank accounts, which raises about Dollars 6bn annually, runs out this year. Without a replacement, next year's budget will have a deficit equal to about 1 per cent of GDP. Mr Cardoso's advisers are well aware of the budget problems. Reforms to the fiscal and social security systems which were planned last year when he was finance minister were blocked by Congressional opposition. These changes include raising taxes and the number of tax payers - only 7m of the economically active population of 50m pay income tax. The social security system also needs thorough reform. It is underfunded and, because of generous benefits such as early retirement introduced in 1988, the social security bill is set to reach Dollars 24.5bn this year, compared to just Dollars 14.5bn in 1992. Mr Cardoso's apparent big election victory could give him the momentum to persuade Congress to pass unpopular measures such as higher taxes or reduced social benefits. But such reforms would not take effect until 1996 or even 1997, prompting observers like Mr Nobrega to call for a speeded up privatisation programme. There is increasing consensus in the private sector that these reforms are needed and that the state's role in the economy should be reduced. Politicians, who often use the state for private purposes, or to win elections, will need more persuasion. For example, Sao Paulo is Brazil's most important state economically, but has a budget deficit equal to three years of tax revenues because of successive years of bad government. It owes about Dollars 7bn to its state owned bank, Banespa, which has had to approve politically inspired lending, much of which may never be repaid. Other urgent changes are needed to stop state governments employing unqualified people ahead of elections in return for their votes. Corruption and waste is seen as extremely high in the health system, while the federal and state governments are expensively overstaffed yet rarely even check if their employees turn up for work. Mr Eduardo Giannetti, a Sao Paulo-based economist, says Mr Cardoso needs to confront all these problems and end politicians' control over state banks. 'In the abstract everyone agrees these questions should be tackled, until it comes down to imposing the loss. A new president has the authority to make people accept change, but he needs to act quickly. The first year is worth more than the last three of his mandate,' he says. With so much remaining to be done, confidence in the Real's future remains fragile. Unlike other countries fighting inflation, Brazil decided against making the Real fully convertible or setting it at parity with the US dollar. Instead, the Real is backed by foreign exchange reserves, and a government promise not to breach its own money supply targets. If Mr Cardoso can use his first few months in office to instigate reform of the state and constitution, his momentum will help underpin the Real and inflation can be contained. If not, financial markets may lose confidence and Brazil's inflationary cycle could start again. 'We are not yet talking about (economic) stabilisation achieved. Inflation could come back and would mean a great loss of respect for democracy. People would feel they had again been cheated ahead of elections,' said Mr Giannetti.</p>

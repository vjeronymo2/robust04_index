			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Letter (4): Coal seen as victim of muddled economic thinking and lack of long-term strategy Sir, Mr Heseltine was reported as saying that 'British Coal cannot go on producing coal that cannot be sold' and that the closure of 31 pits and the redundancy of 30,000 miners was the painful but inevitable result. Even before considering the knock-on effects of such economic devastation the government's judgment in terms of business sense is lacking. Instead of developing an economic framework and infrastructure that gives some support during the recession to this national industrial asset, the government has exacerbated the situation by allowing the short-term, narrow interests of the power generators and suppliers to determine energy policy. By privatising the electricity generating and supply industries, the government gave the green light to the 'dash for gas'. Now it argues that the demise of 'King Coal' was caused by market forces: these inanimate processes that mere mortals, such as government ministers, cannot alter and tamper with at their peril. All this, of course, is ideological nonsense. Other countries - Germany, France, Japan for instance - have market economies, but ones in which the state is prepared to intervene to influence corporate investments, to protect or induce industrial sectors considered essential to national economic health. The British government kowtows to only one of many versions of the market economy, and the one which recent history has shown to be the least capable of delivering high productivity-high wage, prosperous economies.

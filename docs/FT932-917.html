			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking trims recent share gains CURRENCY uncertainties cast a shadow over the UK stock market yesterday, leaving the FT-SE 100 Index to drift below the 2,900 mark in modest profit-taking. The improvement in the US dollar brought little response from the blue chip internationals, while domestic consumer issues were left confused by the withdrawal of the German finance minister from the planned Franco-German financial discussions. UK equities opened lower as a good start in stock index futures failed to counterbalance overnight weakness in New York. The loss of the Footsie 2,900 mark was not unexpected in the market since several leading securities firms were known to be ready to take profits above that level. Selling pressure was not heavy, but with the September future contract on the Footsie at a smaller premium than earlier this week, the underlying Footsie-listed stocks weakened and the market was soon down by 12.8 points. Traders reported little sign of buying at the lower levels, suggesting that investors might have been restrained yesterday by the resignation of a UK government member. Equities steadied but turned indecisive again while dealers watched the screens for further details of the apparent row in Germany ahead of the Franco-German financial talks. Hopes that the French delegation would press for co-ordinated interest rate cuts were dashed when the Germans pulled out of today's meeting in Paris. London rallied towards the close when Wall Street made a braver start to the new session, gaining 9.13 Dow points in UK trading hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,894.7 for a decline on the day of 6 points. Seaq volume fell to 517.2m shares from Wednesday's 603.3m, with non-Footsie business making up about 59 per cent of the total - an average proportion for recent sessions. On Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.33bn, maintaining the healthy daily averages of the past nine months. Traders were not unduly dismayed to see the 2,900 level lost in a market still keenly awaiting convincing evidence from the corporate sector that the economic recession is lifting. Profits statements yesterday from Lonrho, the international trading group, and from TSB, the UK bank, did nothing to change perceptions of the outlook for equities. At Kleinwort Benson Securities, Mr Trevor Laugharne commented that the stock market looked unlikely to hold above 2,900, but said the firm was lifting its forecast for the short term trading range to 2,800 to 3,000. 'We are somewhat more optimistic about the market than we have been in recent weeks,' he added. The heavyweight end of the market was again held down by US selling of the pharmaceutical stocks, although losses were fairly modest yesterday. Shares in ICI weakened as market analysts turned their attention to a group now firmly focused on chemicals following the successful demerger of the bio science and pharmaceuticals interests into Zeneca; a few pence were shed by Zeneca but the market remained well pleased with the outcome of the demerger rights issue. Uncertainty over the outlook for Wall Street also lay heavily across the leading oil shares and prompted some profit-taking in Reuters, the electronic global financial news network.</p>

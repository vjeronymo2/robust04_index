			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea today vowed defiance against  unreasonable pressure concerning the replacement of fuel rods at  a reactor.    On May 30, the United Nations Security Council adopted a  presidential statement, demanding the DPRK to hold consultations  with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over the  measures of the replacement of fuel rods at the reactor.    A Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that the statement by  the U.N. Security Council "groundlessly" slandered the DPRK.    He added, "It is entirely wrong for the Security Council to  have discussed the question of the DPRK on the basis of the  wrong judgment made by the Secretariat of the agency (IAEA)  without any justifiable reason."    The presidential statement of the U.N. Security Council also  asked the IAEA inspectors to stay in DPRK and continue the  inspection.    However, the DPRK spokesman argued, "Since we are in a  unique  status after a temporary suspension of the effectuation of our  declared withdrawal from the NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty on  nuclear arms), it is clear that we cannot accept such routine  and ad hoc inspection as selected preservation of fuel rods."    if the IAEA Secretariat and the U.N. Security Council,  bereft  of impartiality, insist on pressure with an unreasonable  attitude, DPRK will take "decisive countermeasures" to continue  its peaceful nuclear activities, said the spokesman.    "We will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the  intention to deal with the issue in a fair way and resolve it in  a peaceful way through dialogue," declared the spokesman.    But he added, "We will counter without slightest compromise  any intention to unjustifiably put pressure on us, ignoring our  sovereignty, if but a little."</p>

Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy under  secretary; and Ertugrul Atakan, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy  director general of Cypriot and Greek affairs; today visited  Prime Minister Atun; Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy  prime minister; and Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and  defense minister.    In a speech during his meeting with the Turkish delegation,  Prime Minister Atun said the coalition government views the  Cyprus problem as the priority issue before it. However, he  said, we are determined to defend the rights of the people  vigorously while tackling the issue.    Tugay Ulucevik briefed the prime minister on Turkey's role  and attitude in the current stage of the Cyprus problem.  Ulucevik pointed out that there was a slowdown in efforts to  reach a solution to the problem due to the early general  elections. He said the international community expects the  Cyprus problem to be tackled now that the new government  received a vote of confidence, adding that the  confidence-building measures are now on the agenda. As always,  he stressed, Turkey wants the decision to be reached in Cyprus.  The Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot people will make their  own decisions regarding this issue, he added.    Ulucevik stated that for a decision to be reached, the  method  of free negotiations is essential. That is what Turkey  believes, he said.    Ulucevik pointed out that even though it is up to the  Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus to decide on the confidence-building  measures, in principle, Turkey has always looked positively at  the idea that the two communities should take  confidence-building measures. In principle, he added, Turkey  supports this issue.    Ulucevik said that in the coming days, the search for a  solution will focus on this issue between the two communities.  Naturally, the decision will be made by the Turkish Cypriot  Government, he said.    Speaking at his meeting with Ulucevik and Atakan, Ozker  Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister, said he has  always been in favor of a solution of the Cyprus problem, which  has been going on for the past 30 years. The world expects this  problem to be resolved, he said.    Ozgur pointed out that he shares Ulucevik's views on the  Cyprus problem. He said: The coalition government has a  positive approach to the solution of the Cyprus problem as soon  as possible. There is a confidence crisis between the two  communities created during the past 30 years. The coalition  government will do all it can to eliminate this. Our government  wants an acceptable solution.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Butte future aided by fresh funds The future of Butte Mining, the UK company whose main activity is prosecuting US lawsuits - it is seeking damages of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) from former managers and promoters - looked more secure yesterday, the directors stated, after the promise of an inflow of fresh funds and hopes of a favourable US appeals court hearing. Butte's former Australian subsidiary, Vam, which is now called Hillgrove Gold, has completed a fund-raising exercise which will result in the UK company receiving about ADollars 500,000 (Pounds 244,000) in debt repayments. Mr Graham Andrews, Butte's finance director, said the company also intended to sell its remaining 5 per cent stake in Hillgrove Gold to raise about another ADollars 350,000 (Pounds 171,000). The proceeds would partly be used to pay Butte's former Australian legal advisers - its last debt not related to the US court cases - and this would leave the company with about Pounds 200,000. Mr Andrews said that the US appeals court hearing should result in the judge in Montana, where Butte is prosecuting its cases, soon starting pre-trial processes which might lead to the full hearing in 1995.</p>

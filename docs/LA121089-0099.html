			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ACCUSED DOCTOR  </P> <P> Being a partner in a law firm that specializes in representing patients in  medical malpractice actions, I read with interest the article on the doctors  facing possible disciplinary action. Of particular note was the statement by  Dr. Hansel D. Benvenuti that he has never had even a single malpractice suit  and that he was trying to protect his "good name."  </P> <P> In 1978, I personally tried a case for a patient against Dr. Benvenuti, wherein  a jury found he was negligent in her care and supervision during her  hospitalization at Hoag Memorial. Rather substantial money damages were  assessed against him and others. The verdict was upheld on appeal.  </P> <P> JAY CORDELL HORTON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Korean residents in  Japan protested against the crackdown on the Osaka Prefectural  Headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) and its branches by Japanese police, according  to KNS reports from Tokyo.    Representatives of the Federation of Korean Traders and  Industrialists in Japan on April 26 demanded the Japan Police  Agency to probe into the truth behind the murder of  Vice-Chairman of the Federation Ku Cha-yong, saying that the  forcible search into the Osaka prefectural headquarters of  Chongnyon by Osaka prefectural police and assault on a Korean  student are the result of the hostile policy of Japanese  authorities towards the DPRK and Chongnyon.    On the same day, officials and compatriots under the Osaka  prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon thronged to the Osaka  prefectural police headquarters and strongly demanded it  renounce at once the hostile policy towards the DPRK, stop  suppressing Korean residents in Japan and apologize for it and  immediately return the unconcerned materials seized from the  Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and its branches.    Song Chang-to, chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Committee  of  the Union of Korean Teachers in Japan, in his report at its  emergency meeting on April 26, charged that the Japanese  authorities made every effort to undermine the organizations of  Koreans in Japan and obliterate the education of Koreans, before  the war of aggression on Korea was unleashed by the U.S.  imperialists in 1950, and called upon the teachers and students  to cope with the subversive moves of the reactionaries within  and without with heightened vigilance.    At the meeting, O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of the Chongnyon  Central Standing Committee and chairman of the Osaka prefectural  headquarters of Chongnyon, called for smashing the subversive  plots of the reactionaries within and without with united  efforts and actively push ahead with the work.    Meanwhile, Vice-Chairman Paek Han-ki and director of  International Department Kim Tae-hui of the Chongnyon Central  Standing Committee met the cadres of Japan Social-Democratic  Party [JSDP] on April 25 and asked for positive activities of  the JSDP to stop the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese  authorities and immediately renounce and rectify the hostile  policy towards the DPRK.</p>

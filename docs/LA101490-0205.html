			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DAMAGE FROM COSTA MESA FIRE COULD BE MORE THAN $2 MILLION  </P> <P> Fire officials said the damage from a two-alarm fire that raged through an  industrial complex Friday morning could top $2 million, after investigators  found out that the blaze had been fueled by a new inventory of Brazilian  outdoor furniture.  </P> <P> Steve Feather, aide to Costa Mesa's battalion chief, said Saturday that owners  of a patio furniture business, one of two businesses heavily damaged, reported  that a large amount of the wooden furniture from Brazil had been received just  two days before the fire.  </P> <P> "There was a high fire load, and the place was maxed out," Feather said of the  damage to Sunbird Enterprises. He said an adjoining maker of boating products,  HP Marine, was also gutted.  </P> <P> Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the fire, which was reported  at 5:11 a.m. Friday in the 1700 block of Monrovia Avenue and took more than  four hours to extinguish. Two firefighters were treated for minor injuries.  </P> <P> Feather said investigators walked through the remains of the single-story  complex Saturday and found the roof of the Sunbird business destroyed and the  interior gutted.  </P> <P> Officials have said the fire appeared to have started in the Sunbird unit  before spreading to HP Marine.  </P></p>

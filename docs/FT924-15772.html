			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The Property Market: A rich vein that may be losing its lustre - Vanessa Houlder finds Anglo-French developer Paul Raingold upbeat about his latest Parisian venture Mr Paul Raingold, one of the most prominent UK developers working in Paris, has so far lived up to his propitious name. But at a time when the Paris property market is gripped by recession, doubts are growing about his latest  -and most ambitious - deal. The deal, which was agreed in March 1991 and completed two weeks ago, involves one of the most expensive development sites in Europe - the former headquarters of oil company Esso in the heart of La Defense in the west of Paris. The consortium developing the scheme - in which Mr Mr Raingold's company, Generale Continentale Investissements (GCI), has a 6 1/4 per cent share - paid FFr1.808bn (Pounds 200m) for the site; a further FFr1.356bn (Pounds 150m) was paid to Epad, the local planning authority for La Defense, as a contribution towards local infrastructure. The total cost of the plan to build a 190,000 sq m office complex is about Pounds 1bn. It will include two tower blocks of 700,000 sq ft each, shops, restaurants and a modern art museum. Work is due to start within the next six months with the demolition of the existing building. Besides Generale Continentale, other investors in the scheme include property developers Interconstruction and Kaufman &amp; Broad with an 8 3/4 per cent share; the balance is owned by eight of France's leading financial institutions, BNP, Indosuez, Credit Agricole, CFF, Credit National, Societe Generale, Banque Worms and GAN. The scheme has already provoked trepidation in some quarters. 'He (Mr Raingold) has hit gold in La Defense before. But I am nervous that he has gone too far this time,' says one Paris agent. 'The banks could lose millions.' The agent's concerns are three-fold. Does La Defense, where 2m sq ft out of a total of 25m sq ft of office space is already empty, need another 2m sq ft development? Is the scheme, which is designed to be built in a single phase, sufficiently flexible? Was the price paid for the site, agreed before the worst of the property downturn, excessive? These doubts are not shared by the project's admirers. They point out that at least half the 2m sq ft of empty space in La Defense is in small areas scattered around old buildings. Moreover, La Defense's empty space may be absorbed and the market in general may have emerged from recession by the time the scheme comes onto the market in 1996. 'The great advantage of the Esso project is its timing,' says Mr Robert Lipscomb of Healey &amp; Baker, the UK property advisers. Mr Raingold does not claim to have tenants lined up, although he says that 20 per cent of space at the new site has been pre-sold to GAN, one of the scheme's backers. He vigorously defends the acquisition. 'We are very confident. It is a long-term deal and an exceptional site.' Mr Raingold justifies the price paid for the site, insisting that it reflected the downturn in the Paris property market, which, he says, was already apparent in March 1991 when the deal was agreed. Critics dispute this, adding that the price was too high. But most of all, Mr Raingold's confidence in the scheme stems from his belief in La Defense. 'La Defense is coming into another era,' he says. Originally, La Defense was used for back offices, while headquarters remained in central Paris. 'The quality of the early buildings left something to be desired,' he says. Moreover, La Defense lacked prestige, adequate transport and proper shopping facilities. 'Over 20 years, this has changed,' he says. Today La Defense is the headquarters of France's largest companies, with first-class communications, the architecturally-acclaimed Grande Arche and France's largest shopping centre. Mr Raingold argues that the scheme is significant because it is the first time that a building - the old Esso headquarters - in La Defense will have been demolished. 'It is the begining of a trend,' he says. Mr Raingold's work in France began in the early 1970s, when he was managing director of English and Continental Investments. When one of English and Continental's owners sold up following the property collapse in the early 1970s, Mr Raingold set up GCI. Over the next few years while the French market was in the doldrums, GCI concentrated on troubleshooting for UK investors and property management. In 1985, he returned to development, building an office project in the new town of Marne La Vallee, in partnership with Mobax Securities. But he really came to the public's attention in 1988, when a joint venture between GCI and Heron International invested in Les Collines, a high-profile scheme next to the La Defense arch. Like the Esso site, Les Collines attracted much publicity, because of its size and prominence and the involvement of foreign developers. The scheme was eventually judged a success and it was sold when the market was at its peak. Another prominent scheme undertaken by GCI, together with GA, a construction company, is Roissypole, a business park at Charles de Gaulle airport. Mr Raingold grandly dubs this office scheme - in which tenants can see aircraft taxi past their window - 'an aero-city'. 'It was the first of its kind,' he said. Continental Square, the first phase of the Roissypole project comprises four buildings with a total area of 22,500 sq ft, half of which has been let to tenants including Air France. Although he believes the French market will remain difficult for the next two years, he is optimistic about its future. 'With the opening of the east, Europe's centre of gravity has moved,' he says. Despite his obvious attachment to Paris, Mr Raingold has not turned his back on the UK property market. Eighteen months ago, GCI opened an office in London to look for property investments. There have been, he says, many similarities in the development of the two markets over the past 20 years. On occasion when the British have set a trend, the French have followed. But it is the differences that are more striking, particularly in terms of planning and government intervention. In France, for example, tenants need to win official approval before taking on large amounts of new space; in Britain no such requirement is necessary. At the same time, planning can be very restrictive in Paris - a policy that often benefits developers by curbing oversupply. 'The French wanted to keep central Paris as a city where people live. They took enormous pains to respect the grey stone facades of the Haussmann buildings and not allow skyrise buildings to ruin city life in Paris,' says Mr Raingold. Living in Paris is an important ingredient in Mr Raingold's own assessment of his success. Other British companies with developments in the city came unstuck because they were based in the UK and delegated their overseas operations to junior staff. 'The margin between success and failure is very narrow. If you are to be successful in a European market you need a proper structure. It is no use sending over a clerk, you need a heavyweight,' he says.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         RENTAL GROWTH (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Retail   Office   Industrial   All Properties  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year to Aug 92          -1.8     -14.2       -6.1           -7.5 Quarter to Aug 92       -0.7      -4.2       -2.3           -2.3 Month of Aug 92         -0.3      -1.6       -0.6           -0.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

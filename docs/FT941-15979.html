			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: CU and GRE warn of cuts in bonuses Two more insurers have warned of future cuts in with-profits policy bonus levels, while maintaining pay-outs at similar levels this year. Commercial Union has cut pay-outs for shorter term with-profits policies, but announced a special 5 per cent reversionary bonus for longer term policies taken out before January 1 1975. A 25 year endowment, taken out by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, maturing this month, would be worth Pounds 65,599, up 4.2 per cent from last year. A 10-year policy pays Pounds 6,807, down 5 per cent. Guardian Royal Exchange, which pulled out of the with-profits endowment market in 1992, continues to be among the lowest payers on existing with-profits policies. It has held annual bonuses at last year's level, while raising terminal bonuses for policies of over 15 years. Its pay-out on a 25-year policy is Pounds 44,379, up 0.7 per cent from last year, while the 10-year pay-out is down 1.4 per cent at Pounds 4,952.</p>

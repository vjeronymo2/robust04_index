			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Policy not war is price trigger Inflation, as a prominent banker once remarked, is like sin - every government denounces it, and every government practises it. But as a Bank of England report on inflation history illustrates, recent governments should blush more than their predecessors. In spite of the modern assumption that inflation is as inevitable as the weather, study of the three centuries of the Bank's lifespan shows that prices can both rise and fall and that the rise has been more dramatic in the past 50 years than in all of the previous 250. Although the retail prices index rose only threefold between 1694 and 1948, it has risen more than 20-fold since then, leaving prices 67 times higher than in 1694, says the Bank, which is issuing the report in its Quarterly Bulletin to coincide with its 300th birthday. It admits that calculating this rise is far from easy, given the problems of finding equivalents to the modern shopping basket. 'What can we compare with the price today of a second-hand car - a second-hand sedan chair?' it asks, pointing out that even an apparently 'fundamental' item such as potatoes must be qualified - in 1694 potatoes had only recently arrived in England and were considered as exotic as rambutan today. But by using 'timeless' goods such as eggs, bread and coal, the main message to emerge is that until 50 years ago it was war, not policy, that was the main trigger of inflation. The Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century, for example, created one of the most dramatic price rises in the Bank's early history - a crisis fuelled by its failure then to recognise that the government's heavy public borrowing was being monetised, the Bank notes with some historical self-flagellation. In the event this crisis subsided as prices fell during the 19th century - by 1894 bread was actually cheaper than its 1694 price of 5.6d (2.3p). And it was not until the onset of apparently irreversible inflation this century that the number of inflation theories also began to soar, variously citing unemployment, consumer expectations or central-bank credibility as the culprit. The Bank carefully refrains from drawing any policy recommendations from this - although it modestly notes that modern bank clerks start on 25 per cent less salary than their 17th-century counterparts. But after pointing out that the first recorded inflation occured in the second century, when Roman citizens took to cutting their gold coins in half, its conclusion, unsurprisingly, extols monetary caution. 'There have been no instances when inflation has not been associated with an increase in the money supply,' it warns - a message that will have as much relevance for the government perusing this month's money supply figures as the Roman emperors 18 centuries ago.</p>

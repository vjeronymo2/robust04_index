			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Sport: Skiing every day for a year - can it be done? - Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition Skiing a Himalayan glacier in the middle of the night might sound like madness - or smack of unnecessary bravado. But it is going to be vital during the Financial Times Round the World Expedition if we are to ski every day and still make it from one resort to another. Our expedition timetable is littered with logistical problems, such as how to get from the Himalayan slopes to Tokyo via Delhi on a hot May morning so that we can ski the next day. But once Lucy Dicker, my skiing companion, and I decided to ski for 365 consecutive days, such difficulties became inevitable. Skiing every day is a tall order, but if necessary we will ski first thing in the morning, then travel all day and all night, and again the following day to reach our next resort. We will certainly be skiing every morning before we leave a resort in case an accident or road blocked with snow throws us off schedule. We are not trying to ski every resort in the world, nor to ski in a different resort on each day - even if we had skied every known slope in the southern hemisphere, there would still have been a gap while we waited for the snow cannon to start churning out the artificial variety in Colarado or Vermont. So we have settled for skiing every day - but not necessarily in a different resort. Cross-country skiing will only be permissible in an emergency; skiing on grass will only be tackled as a last resort; if our Tahiti connection between Santiago and Auckland fails to materialise, we might even have to waterski. Readers can become involved too, as we will be taking altimeters, speedometers and mileometers to keep a record of our progress and provide data which will form the basis of reader competitions with prizes including magnums of rose champagne, ski holidays and ski clothing. Some people who are aware of our skiing odyssey, which begins in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on January 1, believe we are on a hiding to nothing. Others are profoundly jealous as we embark on what one colleague has described as the 'world's longest freebie'. Both may be true. Miss Dicker prefers to think she has joined an expedition straight out of the pages of a Boy's Own adventure book. Born in the south of France, she has been a staunch Anglophile since she moved to Britain 21 years ago. She has thrown caution to the wind and given up her job to share this adventure. With her Provencal flair and efficiency, Lucy has borne the brunt of the planning. No doubt we shall endure our normal share of problems, ailments and disagreements: even during the planning stages, Lucy and I have made blunders and enjoyed a few rows. One resort - Bridger Bowl in Montana - has even been taking bets on whether Lucy and I will be speaking when we arrive there in February. During the next year we shall struggle breathlessly in the mighty Himalayas, weave our way down the busy slopes of the Japan Alps, gaze in wonder at the awesome Canadian Rockies, marvel at the remote wilderness of the Andes, hear the squawk of Crimson Rosellas in the snow-clad eucalyptus trees of the snowy mountains in New South Wales, and ski among the seagulls amid the maritime peaks of the New Zealand Alps. The idea to ski the world grew out of an article I wrote for Vogue a few years ago when I invented a maiden aunt, Charlotte, and, with the help of an imaginary legacy, skied the world. Prompted by the thought of spending my forthcoming 50th birthday somewhere exotic, we thought we might as well spend the whole year on skis. Originally, I would have spent my milestone birthday in February in Bruce Mound (unkindly dubbed Pimple Horn by a colleague) in a remote part of Wisconsin. I was curious to see it because of its unusually brief vertical drop: 200 feet from top to bottom. But we decided that Bruce Mound might have proved to be an anticlimax: instead we will be in Summit County, Colorado, skiing the likes of Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin, which together form the Ski the Summit area. The grand finale - if we make it - will be at Jackson Hole, where the resort's chief executive, John Resor, is preparing a welcome party at his ranch on January 1, 1995. The telephone number for FlexiSki, featured last week, should have read 071-352 0044. Next Saturday: Arnie's first expedition report, plus reader competitions</p>

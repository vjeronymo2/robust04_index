			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- "There are no toxic agents  or wastes for a genuine chemist -- they are all raw materials,"  this precept by the great Russian chemist Dmitriy Mendeleyev was  repeated time and again by scientists, who took the floor during  the Duma hearings on Russia's participation in international  agreements to scrap chemical weapons. Believing that Russia  should derive definite benefits from the destruction of combat  toxic agents, they moved to include in the state budget a  separate item, envisaging spendings on disarmament and  conversion programmes. Moreover, the scientists hold, it is  necessary to launch a broad explanatory campaign and to discuss  in a professional way all the problems linked with the  destruction of weapons.    ITAR-TASS was told by Major-General Yuriy Tarasevich,  assistant commander of radiation, chemical and biological  defence forces of the Russian Federation, who took part in the  deliberations, that a concept has already been drawn up for  scrapping combat toxic substances, but this required special  financing. Shortage of money for the development of special  technologies, construction of various installations and other  jobs, envisaged by the complex programme, retards the  implementation of the already adopted decisions.    General Tarasevich believes that this year will be decisive  for preparations to begin the planned destruction of chemical  weapons. He denied rumours and publications on the alleged  "incineration of chemical shells". "All the ammunition is being  reliably guarded and poses no threat to the environment,"  Tarasevich said. He believes they could remain stored for  several more years. "It would be wrong to shift the difficult  job of destroying them to the next generation. There is every  opportunity to do it now, relying on international agreements,"  Tarasevich noted.</p>

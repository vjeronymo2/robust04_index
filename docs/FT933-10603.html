			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Govett to acquire US trust for Dollars 3.8m GOVETT &amp; Company, the fund management group, has agreed to buy the North American Trust Company for Dollars 3.8m (Pounds 2.55m) from the Bank of San Diego. The trust company provides pension trust services to law firms and medical services groups in the US and currently administers some Dollars 1.4bn of assets. Govett already has a Jersey-based trust company, London Pacific. Mr Ian Whitehead, chief financial officer, said the purchase gave Govett the administrative and operating capability to manage trust accounts for high net worth individuals, and allowed it the chance to cross-sell its investment management services. Trust companies are a source of high quality earnings, he said. The agreement is subject to regulatory approval which is expected to be granted within six to eight weeks.</p>

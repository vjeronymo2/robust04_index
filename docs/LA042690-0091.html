			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTING PILLS  </P> <P> Question: This is not one of those life-and-death questions that you often get.  </P> <P> I would just like to know if the little piece of absorbent cotton that comes  with bottles of pills should be left in or thrown away once the bottle is  opened. Or does it make any difference?  </P> <P> Answer: The piece of cotton that is often found on the top of medication  bottles is designed to prevent the pills or tablets from breaking. Ordinarily,  you would remove the cotton.  </P></p>

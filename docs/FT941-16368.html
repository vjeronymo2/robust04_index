			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / 460,000 packs of cereal recalled Quaker Oats, the breakfast cereal maker, is recalling 460,000 packs of Sugar Puffs and Quaker Puffed Wheat, with a retail value of about Pounds 800,000, after 'rough grain husks' which could irritate the throat were found in some packs, Neil Buckley writes. About 5,000 packs are believed to be affected by the problem, thought to be the result of a breakdown in the sieving process. The company said there was no danger to children or adults. 'However, these irregular shaped husks, which have rough edges, could cause some throat discomfort and irritation, and small children could cough or regurgitate them,' said Dr Gerry Jewell, quality-control director. Packets affected are Sugar Puffs with a best before date of 30/11/94 and batch codes L52-L90 marked on the packet top, or best before 31/12/94, batch codes L01-L42, or Puffed Wheat best before 31/12/94, batch codes L16-18 and L37-39. Customers with such packs are advised to destroy the contents and send the packet top with their name and address for a replacement voucher to Quaker Oats, Dept 2000, Snowden Drive, Winterhill, Milton Keynes MK6 1HQ.</p>

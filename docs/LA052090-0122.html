			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BITTER DISPUTE RAGES AROUND BULLETPROOF VESTS;  </P> <P> BODY ARMOR: SOME PROTECTIVE CLOTHING HAS BEEN FAILING STRICT GOVERNMENT TESTS.  THE ISSUE IS, WHO SHOULD SET THE STANDARDS?  </P> <P> Slowly, deliberately, Richard Davis loads his .44-caliber magnum revolver. He  grasps it with both hands, points it at his abdomen and stares ahead grimly. He  fires; his body jerks with the impact.  </P> <P> A grin spreads over Davis' weather-beaten face. "Nothing to it, folks!" he says  with the satisfaction of a man who has shot himself more than 130 times in  sales pitches for the bulletproof vests his company manufactures.  </P> <P> But for all the demonstrated confidence in his product, federal body armor  standards that he and other manufacturers consider unreasonable are being  imposed. The dispute has become so bitter that some police groups, for whom  quality armor is a life-or-death matter, are asking Congress to intervene.  </P> <P> Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) said he will introduce a bill to establish  standards this month. Sen. Carl Levin, (D-Mich.) has asked Atty. Gen. Dick  Thornburgh to mediate a compromise. "The increasing uncertainty can only hurt  law enforcement officers," Levin wrote Thornburgh.  </P> <P> The highly technical debate boils down to four issues: how such vests should be  designed (particularly the amount of baffling needed to stop bullets), how the  garments should be tested; who should set the standards and whether they should  be voluntary or mandatory.  </P> <P> The National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Justice Department, has set  quality guidelines for the vests and tested them since the early 1970s.  </P> <P> A vest is tested by mounting it on clay blocks firing at it from various ranges  and angles. To meet NIJ standards, a vest must not only stop bullets; it must  prevent them from making an excessively large dent in the clay. That's because  the impact of some rounds can damage internal organs even without penetrating  the armor.  </P> <P> The standards were upgraded in 1987, to keep pace with changes in weapons and  ammunition, said Lester Shubin, science and technology director for the  institute. Suddenly, more than half the vests being tested were flunking.  </P> <P> The makers -- including Davis' employer, Second Chance Body Armor of Central  Lake, Mich., -- cried foul. They said the only way to make sure their vest  would pass every test would be to make it so thick and bulky that police  wouldn't wear them.  </P> <P> "Police officers don't really want to wear the stuff, anyway. Give them any  excuse to take it off and they will," said Ed Bachner, ballistics manager for  E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which makes Kevlar, the synthetic insulating  material used in most bulletproof armor for the past 20 years.  </P> <P> "Police are dying because they aren't wearing vests, not because the vests are  bad," Bachner said.  </P> <P> Surveys have found that only about 30% of police officers wear armor even  though many departments require it, said George Austin Jr., national executive  officer of the Fraternal Order of Police. Manufacturers say the number of  wearers may be even lower.  </P> <P> Du Pont has documented more than 1,000 incidents in which wearing Kevlar body  armor prevented death or serious injury, Bachner said. Most were shootings but  many were stabbings or auto accidents, and there were even a couple of bull  gorings.  </P> <P> A single vest retails for about $350, Davis said; he recently sold 4,000 of  them to the Detroit police at a unit price of $175.  </P> <P> Larry Gates, executive director of the Personal Protective Armor Assn., said no  vest has ever failed to protect a wearer from bullets it was designed to stop.  </P> <P> "They've performed flawlessly in the field, where it counts," he said, "but in  the laboratory tests under the NIJ standards, over half the vests fail. The  test is flawed . . . but the NIJ won't budge."  </P> <P> Shubin said the vests have a good field record because the agency's tests have  kept inadequate products off the market.  </P> <P> "We believe a lot of their armor is marginal," he said, "but we believe if it  passes our standard, it's going to work 100% on the street, and it has. We're  being faulted for being successful."  </P> <P> Last year, Du Pont and the Personal Protective Armor Assn. established their  own standards, which they say produce more consistent test results without  sacrificing the wearer's comfort.  </P> <P> Shubin and many police leaders aren't reassured, however.  </P> <P> "I could put up with a little discomfort in exchange for extra protection,"  said Austin, the FOP officer and a Poquoson, Va., beat cop. "And I'm the one  out there on the street getting shot at."  </P> <P> Police generally have sided with the government in the dispute, but not  unanimously.  </P> <P> New York City Police Commissioner Lee Brown, who favors the NIJ standards,  called the debate over vest design and testing procedures a "smoke screen."  </P> <P> "The issue is who's going to develop the standards," Brown said. "I want them  developed by someone who has no interest in selling a product."  </P> <P> The Fraternal Order of Police wants Congress to assign a disinterested body,  such as the NIJ, to set the standards, and the International Assn. of Chiefs of  Police has taken a similar position.  </P> <P> The State Assn. of Chiefs of Police, a division of IACP, voted in April to  oppose legislation and to ask the manufacturers and the NIJ to accept binding  arbitration.  </P> <P> One vest manufacturer that supports government standards is Point Blank Body  Armor of Amityville, N. Y. Its president, Richard Stone, said the industry's  primary motive is to protect the dominance of Kevlar.  </P> <P> "This is basically a commercial situation," Stone said. "Du Pont's had a  virtual monopoly on body armor for 20 years, and they want to keep it that  way."  </P> <P> Du Pont's Bachner disagreed. He said the controversy arose before the recent  emergence of competitive synthetic fillers.  </P> <P> "I tell police if they can find a better product, they ought to buy it," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from Medellin de Bravo, </F> Veracruz; from the "Vector 21" newscast]    [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today called for  a crusade in favor of justice, peace, and harmony in rural areas  because this is what Mexico wants. He confirmed that he will  pay more personal attention to peasants in our country, and he  demanded that government officials get out of their offices and  into rural areas, thus joining efforts to solve the problems of  the agricultural sector.    The president was in Veracruz for the 79th anniversary of  the  promulgation of the first agrarian law of Mexico. Here in  Medellin de Bravo, he awarded 30 land titles to peasants. A  total of 6,500 titles will be awarded in the area and nearly  200,000 throughout the entire country. According to the  president, these documents declare the land belongs to the  peasants according to law. He pointed out that the law provides  tranquillity. Let us listen to part of his speech, delivered by  the president of the republic at the municipal sports field in  Medellin de Bravo, Veracruz.    [Begin Salinas recording] In this manner, we can promote  more  progress in Mexican fields. Let us work so there will be  greater well-being for Mexican peasants. In the presence of the  peasants of Veracruz and all the peasants of my fatherland, I  ratify today, 6 January, that I will continue being very close  to the Mexican peasants. I will continue to work for the  peasants of my fatherland. [applause] If I am willing to do  this, then government officials will have to get out of their  offices and out into the fields, get their boots dirty, and join  efforts very close to the Mexican peasants. [end recording]    Six days after President Venustiano Carranza promulgated the  1915 Agrarian Law -- the first one in Mexico -- the first  agrarian committee was created in Medellin de Bravo Municipality  in Veracruz State. Today, the leaders of the Permanent Agrarian  Congress accompanied the president on the podium prepared for  this ceremony. According to President Salinas, this Permanent  Agrarian Congress is a pluralist organization that has met  common goals, thus demonstrating how plurality can lead to  achieving the superior goal of overall national improvement.    Host Governor Patricio Chirinos Calero emphasized that the  people of Veracruz know very well that their greatest asset is  the peace, tranquillity, and stability they enjoy based on more  and better opportunities for social justice. That is why he  seeks to make the fields a true source of justice and well-being  for peasant families.    This is President Carlos Salinas de Gortari first domestic  tour in 1994. It was conducted amid increased security. There  are numbered [word indistinct] for the press, while a large  group of military troops are ensuring order in the ceremonies  being presided over today by the president.    At this time, the president is in Jalapa Municipality,  capital of Veracruz State, where he is awarding land titles. He  will personally deliver 21 titles, while 20,928 are  simultaneously delivered in Jalapa.    To conclude his visit, the president will preside over a  municipal improvement meeting at the government palace in  Jalapa. He will return to Mexico City in the afternoon.</p>

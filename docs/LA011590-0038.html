			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : BUIRSKI: INTENSE ANGUISH AT MCCABE'S  </P> <P> Want to add a little intensity to your life?  </P> <P> Try an evening with Felicity Buirski, who played McCabe's on Friday night.  </P> <P> She's one of the latest buzzes on the female-confessional-singer-songwriter  front.  </P> <P> How's a title like "Internal Bleeding" grab you? Or any of a darkened boudoir  full of songs -- in both first and third person -- about women who have allowed  themselves to be used by men and grew to hate themselves (and the men) for it.  Not exactly first-date entertainment.  </P> <P> Most of the ilk tend to comfort listeners with the knowledge that the pain is  universal. Buirski makes people decidedly uncomfortable in the interest of  existential nurturing.  </P> <P> The experience was part empathy, part catharsis and part emotional voyeurism --  all very comparable to Buirski's obvious mentor Leonard Cohen. But where  Cohen's dry, stately delivery keeps his anguish earthbound, Buirski's forceful,  husky voice -- complemented by two violinists -- sometimes sends it spinning  into the ionosphere. Which is both good (because you have to go chase after it)  and bad (because some people won't bother). STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

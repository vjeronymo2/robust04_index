			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Loss at Zenith deepens to Dollars 24m ZENITH Electronics, the sole surviving US manufacturer of television sets, yesterday unveiled a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 24.7m, or 79 cents a share. A year earlier, the company suffered a net deficit of Dollars 15.2m, or 52 cents, including royalty income of Dollars 13m and a special tax credit of Dollars 4m. In the 1993 quarter, royalty income was Dollars 5m. Sales slipped slightly to Dollars 274.7m from Dollars 280m a year earlier. Increased shipments of colour televisions in the latest quarter were offset by declining shipments of other electronics products. Although the company said it was still feeling the impact of industry price cuts for colour televisions last year, it benefited from higher sales volume and corporate cost reductions. Zenith also said colour television prices had remained relatively stable this year. The company said its operating loss, stripping out royalty income, narrowed to Dollars 26m in the 1993 quarter from Dollars 29m the previous year. For the fist six months, Zenith recorded a net loss of Dollars 46.5m, or Dollars 1.51, on sales of Dollars 565.2m, against a deficit of Dollars 43.8m, or Dollars 1.50, on sales of Dollars 545.2m in the same period of 1992.</p>

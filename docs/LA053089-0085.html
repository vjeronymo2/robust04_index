			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPOSIT GUARANTY BUILDS ON THE RUINS OF TEXAS BANKS  </P> <P> Deposit Guaranty Bank didn't exist 15 months ago. Now it has $600 million in  assets and is a privately owned financial institution built mostly from the  ruins of failed banks.  </P> <P> Deposit Guaranty is the sole holding of TexOp Bancshares Inc., which still has  a fund of $30 million it may use to buy additional banks -- enough capital to  become a $1.5-billion-asset bank without additional financing.  </P> <P> Given the troubles of the Texas financial community, with banks and thrifts  failing almost weekly -- some resulting in multimillion-dollar federal bailouts  -- Deposit Guaranty is swimming against the tide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Survival Plan  </P> <P> But Chairman Ron Steinhart and President Terry Kelley figure they have a sound  plan to stay afloat.  </P> <P> "The mission is to build a profitable, healthy Texas banking organization and  to take advantage of the problems, which are opportunities for somebody,"  Kelley said.  </P> <P> "There was some management in place in various banks that had no capital, and  some capital was available if you could find management.  </P> <P> "We felt like it was a rare opportunity if we could provide the capital and the  management at a time when things were as they were."  </P> <P> Timing was also important, he said, because he and Steinhart believed the state  was returning to economic health.  </P> <P> "Five years ago we'd never have tried it," Steinhart said, "and I don't think  three years from now we'd try it because the opportunity would have passed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking at Larger Banks  </P> <P> While the building blocks so far have generally been small, often one-branch  institutions, Deposit Guaranty executives still toy with the idea of going  after some large Texas banks that remain on the block.  </P> <P> Steinhart, a veteran of buying and selling Texas banks, admits to continuing  interest in Texas American Bancshares Inc., one of the largest remaining  problem banks.  </P> <P> Since it was formed Feb. 8, 1988, Deposit Guaranty has purchased 13 banks, 11  of them in federally assisted transactions that leave it with what Kelley calls  "sterilized assets."  </P> <P> The money came from a pool of private capital raised by Goldman, Sachs &amp;  Co. -- $8.8 million to buy the first bank and then $62 million more to finance  other purchases.  </P> <P> In its first 11 months of operation, Deposit Guaranty earned $1.27 million for  its investors, the largest of which is the Harvard University endowment, with  Goldman Sachs and brothers Robert and Richard Strauss as other principals, plus  Steinhart and Kelley.  </P> <P> Deposit Guaranty has the advantage of obtaining its banks without the  encumbrances of past problems and the burdens of Texas' old banking laws, which  until last year virtually blocked statewide banking.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High Costs  </P> <P> As a result of the old laws, many banks, even those owned by the same holding  company, were operated separately within each county, leading to high  management and real estate costs.  </P> <P> "We can look at what's the most efficient way to operate a bank today and not  be encumbered by an existing organization that may be operated in a more  traditional basis, which may not be cost-effective and efficient in the  future," Steinhart said.  </P> <P> But more important is that all 11 of the failed banks have been purchased in  closed bank transactions, meaning Deposit Guaranty is left with few of the  obligations of the former bank. Even when Deposit Guaranty acquires troubled  assets, it is protected from losses by federal regulators.  </P> <P> "We're buying essentially with problems fully reserved, so that the large  proportion of our people can direct their energies to building a bank and  building a customer base," Steinhart said.  </P> <P> Steinhart and Kelley see a highly competitive future in Texas banking, as  problems are solved and the new owners -- many of which are aggressive,  out-of-state banks -- turn their attention to the market.  </P> <P> "Initially they're sorting out the good loans, the bad loans; who are the key  people to keep and who are the key people to get rid of, those kind of things,"  Kelley said. "One of these days that'll all be history, and they'll be focused  on the market."  </P></p>

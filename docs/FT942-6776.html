			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Lib Dems hope to cash in on Penhaligon legacy: John Authers finds fond memories of an MP who defied London Liberals have long understood how to campaign in Cornwall. Now the Liberal Democrats hope to win Cornwall's seat in the European parliament using the brand of populism typified by the late David Penhaligon, who 'stood up for the Cornish' against London as MP for Truro from 1974 until 1986. Their candidate, Mr Robin Teverson, a 42-year-old transport consultant, has campaigned almost full-time for five months, backed by heavy funding and a stream of national party figures. He could well defeat Mr Christopher Beazley, Conservative MEP for 10 years. Liberal Democrats captured Cornwall County Council last year and gained five wards in Penwith District Council in the county's only local elections this month. The party holds two of the county's five parliamentary seats, and its Euro-campaign is designed to help defeat Cornwall's three Conservative MPs at the next general election. Cornish politics are different. Campaigners for a single local authority for Cornwall say today's county was a separate domain until the 16th century. The ancient Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral, they say, divided Britain into four realms - England, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall. The county has its own nationalist party - Mebyon Kernow, fielding a candidate in the Euro-election - and its own language. Unlike neighbouring south-western counties, Cornwall has an industrial past, to which china clay heaps and disused tin mines bear testimony. Socially and politically, Cornwall is at least as close to Scotland as it is to Devon. Water is the campaign's hottest issue. South West Water charges 50 per cent more than the national average, thanks to a costly coastal clean-up campaign. The Liberal Democrats gleefully refer to the issue as 'Cornwall's poll tax'. The likely introduction of differential charges for gas - given Cornwall's distance from the North Sea - also arouses anger. Local Conservatives acknowledge the water issue is damaging them, and want a national water levy to reduce bills for the South-West. Rail services are also emotive. The Cornish fear that, in future, trains from London will terminate at Plymouth - two hours from Penzance. The government's 'Days at Sea' policy, which temporarily prohibited fishermen from going to sea on specific days, is another Liberal Democrat issue. The policy was introduced to implement European rules to stop over-fishing, but by limiting fishing to certain days - when the weather might be dangerous - Mr Teverson claims Westminster was putting sailors' lives and livelihoods at risk. European funds are taken seriously. The county council opened an office in Brussels to lobby for funds in 1988 - the first UK local authority to do so  -and maintains European liaison staff. Their money helped fund the ambitious new Tate gallery in St Ives. However, Conservatives are not giving the seat up easily, with Mr John Major making an appearance in St Mellion, east Cornwall, earlier this week. The incumbent MEP, Mr Beazley, says predictions of Liberal Democrat gains come from the London media who do not understand the difficulties of campaigning in the area. He claims that Mr Teverson has no experience of Europe, and could not replicate the contacts that have taken 10 years to build. Tories also claim the Cornish vote for candidates they trust personally, regardless of their politics. Mr Beazley avoids the government's record, concentrating instead on Europe and his experience. His posters do not include the word 'Conservative'. Tories point to Mr Teverson's defeat by the Conservative Mr Robert Hicks in South-East Cornwall in the 1992 general election. They also believe that the Liberal Democrat emphasis on local and national issues for a European election will backfire. The angry words of one man Mr Teverson met on the street in the clay-mining town of St Austell showed that the Liberal Democrats still have to look beyond local issues: He said: 'I saw your first pamphlet and it never mentioned Europe once. I never saw the word Europe.' But another who shook Mr Teverson's hand in St Austell said: 'You've got my vote just because of David Penhaligon all those years ago. He was a great guy and he was a great Cornishman.'</p>

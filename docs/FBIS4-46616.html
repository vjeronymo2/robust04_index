			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Maj Gen Vitaliy Nikolayevich </F> Yakovlev, deputy chief of the Main Administration of the Russian  Ministry of Defense, by Kirill Belyaninov; place and date of  interview not given: "Can the Nuclear Charge Be Lost: Major  General Vitaliy Yakovlev From the Ministry of Defense  Categorically Asserts That It Can't"]    [Text] It is said that some time ago, when the cult  of personality had not yet been debunked, and people planted  corn exclusively by their own wish, and not in response to a  special order from the CPSU Central Committee, the Soviet  military-industrial complex provided a certain number of Soviet  schoolchildren with a not entirely ordinary visual aid. In the  city of Semipalatinsk, where a smoky-brown mushroom created by a  nuclear explosion rose above the horizon, young teachers led  children into the schoolyard, and said as they pointed their  finger in the direction of the test range: "That, children, is  where the nuclear shield of our motherland is being forged!"    With time, of course, all that was left of the former  "visual aid" was radiophobia, while the formerly vast nuclear  shield was torn into such a quantity of chunks and pieces that  it is now absolutely impossible to determine what part of it  really remains. The Semipalatinsk test range is the property of  Kazakhstan, while several of the design offices are the property  of Ukraine, not to mention the radar stations and nuclear strike  early warning resources, which remain on the territory of small  but proud and independent Baltic states. And if we add to this  the numerous treaties on disarmament, cessation and  nonproliferation, the cases of misappropriation of nuclear  materials, and the absence of money for scientific developments  and to support any sort of subsistence minimum for our nuclear  scientists, the question that arises is quite simple, but  extremely unpleasant: Is Russia left with anything of the  nuclear shield, of what it was that made it a great power?    It is unpleasant all the more so because skeptical  voices are already being heard both from across the ocean and  from the "vast expanses" of the near abroad. "If sufficient  concern is not displayed toward the arsenal of a superpower of  such dimensions during political and economic reforms, the  result may be historically unprecedented leakage of nuclear  technology, and a catastrophe as yet unwitnessed in the world,"  declared U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter a  month ago.    [Yakovlev] You can't really say that the situation at  enterprises of our nuclear complex is very bright. And of  course, the fact that radioactive materials are being stolen is  a bad symptom. But we mustn't forget that the number of such  cases is relatively small, and that the uranium that has  disappeared was enriched to 2-4, and rarely 30 percent. It has  no relationship to nuclear weapon components. And besides its  use in nuclear fuel assemblies, this kind of uranium isn't much  good for anything but fishing: It might be good bait for  frogfish in terms of its relative weight.    When in 1992, and in subsequent years as well, reports  appeared that Kazakhstan had sold some sort of warheads to Iran,  that the Chechen Republic had possession of two nuclear devices,  and that a nuclear weapon cropped up in Azerbaijan, all we could  do was laugh. There is, after all, an extremely strict system of  controlling the presence and state of nuclear ammunition. All  parts of such ammunition, even those not associated with  fissionable materials--automatic units such as sensors for  example--bear a plant number. There is a data bank that can be  used to easily determine where a device is located, when it was  made, and what work has been done with it. It can even tell us  how many milligrams of precious metals a particular part  contains. If any sort of work is done, written confirmation of  what was inspected, what parts were replaced, and so on is  transmitted immediately to the ministry's central administration.    Moreover there are also a number of organizational measures:  Whenever a storage site is opened, entry of less than three  workers is categorically prohibited, and when charges are  shipped, not only is security intensified but also an escort  system is established and so-called specialized back-up systems  are put into place. I can therefore state quite certainly that  it is impossible to lose not only a nuclear charge but even its  vehicle or any other nonnuclear part of it.    [Belyaninov] Vitaliy Nikolayevich, Western specialists are  especially alarmed at the situation involving our tactical  weapons: nuclear artillery devices, ammunition for aviation, and  short-range missiles. In contrast to strategic missiles, use of  which requires creation of an entire infrastructure, tactical  weapons may be used by practically any state of the world  without any special trouble. Moreover, as they assert in the  United States, the exact quantity of our tactical devices is  still unknown to them. Officials in Washington state a figure of  19,000, while independent experts such as, for example, Bruce  Blaire from the Brookings Institution cites a figure of 43,000.    [Yakovlev] It's true that we never cited a figure. Having  signed an agreement with the United States to eliminate tactical  nuclear ammunition for rocket forces and for ground forces  artillery prior to the year 2000, we regularly hold joint  consultative meetings. But no figures are thrown around in these  meetings. We report that as of the given day 17 percent of  such-and-such forces and resources were eliminated. And that's  all. Although I can say--these data haven't been made public  anywhere yet--that of the total quantity of weapons withdrawn  from Ukraine, we have already eliminated 1,500 units, or over  half.    And if we consider the potential danger of proliferation of  nuclear weapons.... Back during the time of perestroyka--and as  we know, perestroyka meant instability--we gave some thought to  this problem, and we began withdrawing weapons from Warsaw Pact  states and from USSR republics. We began with the Baltic and  Transcaucasian countries, such that by the end of 1991 we still  had nuclear ammunition only in Ukraine, Belorussia and Russia.  After the four-way treaty on elimination was signed in December  1991, in which Kazakhstan participated in addition to the  republics named above, we began withdrawing weapons from the  territories of these states as well.    In this case complexities arose, and are arising now, only  in  regard to Ukraine. The Republic's Supreme Rada began doubting  that we were really destroying the withdrawn weapons, rather  than placing them into combat duty in Russia, and they stopped  releasing our trains across the border. But we were able to find  a solution. Beginning at approximately July 1992 we began  eliminating these weapons under the observation of Ukrainian  specialists. The agreement is still in force, and it also  foresees the presence of specialists from Belorussia and  Kazakhstan. But to be honest, this isn't cheap. Money has to be  paid for the presence of specialists in Russia, for housing and  the like, not counting health services. Apparently understanding  this, neither Belorussia nor Kazakhstan sent their own observers.    As for Russia itself, all we are doing as far as tactical  weapons are concerned is dismantling them. Our enterprises have  not produced a single device since the time the agreement was  signed with the republics.    [Belyaninov] How much time does it take to dismantle a  single  unit of ammunition?    [Yakovlev] Not much. The Americans, for example, have two  main device dismantling "points." The main one of these--Panteks  [transliteration]--eliminates around 2,000 a year. Our rate is  not any lower.    But as with any other country, we are dismantling more than  just tactical weapons. Our ammunition has a shelf life, and a  guarantee period. Upon expiration of this period it is not only  unsuitable but also unsafe to store it: The charge becomes more  sensitive to mechanical effects, and the radiation background  may rise. This is why strategic weapons are also sent to the  dismantling enterprises.    [Belyaninov] Last year was marked by an entire series of  conflicts between the Ukrainian and Russian defense ministries.  Part of the strategic nuclear forces were transferred to  Ukrainian jurisdiction, Russian specialists developing  ammunition were deprived of access to weapons, and it became  impossible to carry out routine repairs and maintenance. As a  result several accidents occurred at bases in Ukraine.    [Yakovlev] It may sound somewhat cynical, but two factors  saved the day: a visit to Kiev by the American President and  Ukraine's economic difficulties. The Americans raised the issue  of granting economic assistance to Ukraine that would be  directly dependent on the timetable for withdrawal of missiles,  while the crisis in atomic energy and the shortage of fuel for  nuclear power plants, which was being produced only in Russia,  compelled Ukraine to sign a trilateral treaty with fewer  stipulations than before. This made our situation much easier.  In accordance with the agreement Russia supplied fuel assemblies  for reactors to the Republic, while our department was given  permission to withdraw all remaining weapons and do all of the  needed work at the bases. Such that we can now take  responsibility for the safety of the weapons. But I'm not about  to make any long-range forecasts: The situation changes so  frequently that it is simply impossible to talk about any kind  of stability.    [Belyaninov] Vitaliy Nikolayevich, the opinions of experts  regarding American assistance differ. Some assert that we don't  need this assistance at all, that while the Americans talk about  hundreds of millions of dollars, they are barely appropriating  hundreds of thousands, and that ultimately this is assisting not  Russia but the American economy.    [Yakovlev] This is true to a certain extent. Little of the  $400 million appropriated by the U.S. Congress this year has in  fact been spent, but the American side shouldn't be the only one  that is blamed. After all, each item in the agreements must pass  through a very long and complex system of consideration and  approval both there--in Congress--and here--in the Duma.    On the other hand any assistance of this sort consists not  of  cash transfers in the millions to the Central Bank, but of  materials and equipment valued at this amount. The United States  does place orders with American companies. But agreements to  provide such assistance are in effect, and some of them have  already been realized. As an example we have received so-called  "Kevlar linings" to be used in transportation of the devices.  They are unique in their properties: They offer good protection  against environmental effects, and several layers of Kevlar can  easily stop a bullet from an automatic weapon. We did not have  such a material before.    We also received special equipment for emergency teams, and  an agreement to produce special railcars to transport nuclear  ammunition is being implemented. These cars are being developed  in the United States, and they offer several levels of  protection. The Americans supply parts for these cars, but they  will be assembled in Russia. There are several agreements  between the Ministry of Atomic Energy and the U.S. Department of  Energy regarding construction of a new storage facility for  plutonium extracted from warheads, regarding delivery of  supercontainers to transport highly radioactive materials, and  so on.    It is evident at least from this list that the total volume  of American assistance already exceeds tens of millions of  dollars.    [Belyaninov] Vitaliy Nikolayevich, many in the United States  associate the volume of assistance being granted with access of  American specialists to Russian technology for dismantling and  destroying weapons. And during one of the sessions of the U.S.  Congress Defense Subcommittee its chairman, John Murtha,  declared that unless all Russian enterprises of the nuclear  complex are opened to the Americans, including military ones,  there will be "no money at all."    [Yakovlev] An agreement to deliver processed uranium  extracted from warheads to the United States was signed by the  Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and the U.S. Department of  Energy. And naturally the American side wants to make sure that  the materials we are transferring are in fact coming from  weapons. The actual issue is at what stage American specialists  could be allowed in. We insist on the beginning of the  processing cycle--that is, when the warhead has already been  dismantled and the material has been extracted and delivered to  the corresponding enterprise. In the meantime the Americans want  to supervise the process from the very beginning, from the  moment the warheads are dismantled. This is a more sensitive  topic, this means access to weapon design, and access to our  military secrets.    When it comes to my own point of view, the problem is easily  solved: Weapon-grade uranium differs dramatically in its  characteristics from that used in the fuel assemblies of nuclear  power plants and nuclear submarine reactors. They're simply  impossible to confuse: The characteristics of a material with  this degree of enrichment are known to any specialist both in  our country and in the USA.    [Belyaninov] There is one other problem that troubles many  today: What is happening with the Russian nuclear program? The  test ranges are closed, tests are not being conducted, and  scientists are living on starvation rations.    [Yakovlev] Testing is in fact a difficult issue. A tombstone  placed over the Semipalatinsk test range long ago, and it will  never again be used to test nuclear weapons. Nor is there any  sense in talking about Novaya Zemlya, as long as we aren't  conducting tests there, and are supporting a policy of their  prohibition. But when we--I'm referring to the military  department--discussed the need for tests, what we had in mind  primarily was not improving nuclear weapons but improving their  safety. Only by conducting experiments, by conducting tests, can  we be certain of the safety of a device that is in storage. But  it would be useless to argue this now. World public opinion is  so negatively oriented, and specialists of all countries  possessing nuclear weapons are experiencing such problems. This  is one of those issues that will not be resolved as long as no  country violates the moratorium and conducts tests first.    As for the nuclear program, it existed before, and it exists  today, although many scientific directions have either been  curtailed or significantly reduced. We have weapon systems, the  design systems have been developed, several systems of nuclear  devices exist, and they have been tested and proven to be  reliable. Such that we aren't under the threat of falling behind  in this area as yet.    There are of course difficulties with specialists. Some of  them will switch to jobs in the International Center for Science  and Technology currently being established in Moscow. It is  being built with American assistance. Testers from the  Semipalatinsk test range will most probably work in one of our  scientific institutes. And as for creating new forms and systems  of weapons, that's something not worth thinking about today,  it's too expensive a pleasure. Such that we are concerned more  today with problems of disarmament.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Emap buys MBC London titles MOST OF the Maxwell Busi-ness Communications group has been sold in a deal believed to be worth about Pounds 32m. Emap, the publishing and exhibitions group, yesterday agreed to buy all the MBC titles based in central London. It is also acquiring Trenton Group, an exhibitions company. Mr Brian Gilbert, MBC chairman until he resigned in November 1990 after disagreements with the late Mr Robert Maxwell, is buying 25 industrial titles based in Kent. They include Modern Power Systems, Office Equipment News and Laboratory World. For Mr Gilbert it is a case of buying back a large part of what once was his. He built up United Trade Press and sold it to Mr Maxwell in 1987 for Pounds 34.8m. Mr Gilbert said yesterday that the businesses he was buying back from the administrator have a similar turnover to those which he sold to Mr Maxwell. Price Waterhouse yesterday declined to disclose the sale price but it is believed that Mr Gilbert's slice of the deal comes to about Pounds 10m. The deals, due to be completed next week, secure the jobs of more than 400 staff on more than 40 MBC magazines and exhibitions. Price Waterhouse has now disposed of the main UK businesses of Maxwell Communication Corporation. For Emap, heavily weighted towards consumer magazines, the acquisition means a major strengthening of its business magazine division. Mr Colin Morrison, chairman of Emap Business Publishing, said that the growth of consumer magazines had been an Emap success story. 'This purchase opens the way for our business publishing division to emulate that achievement.' The Emap purchases include blocks of magazines devoted to the architecture and building, retail, media, fishing and financial fields.</p>

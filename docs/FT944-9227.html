			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: General counsel appointed at AMP Australian Mutual Provident, the large Australian life insurance group which owns the Pearl and London Life in the UK, yesterday said it was appointing Mr Gary Traill, formerly chairman of the Gadens Ridgeway law firm, to the new post of general counsel. One of the tasks facing Mr Traill will be a re-examination the option of 'demutualising' the AMP - that is, turning it into a company owned by shareholders. Mr Ian Salmon, the AMP's previous managing director, indicated that this was not a possibility, but Mr George Trumbull, who moved from Cigna in the US to take over the top job at the AMP earlier this year, has indicated that demutualisation will be reconsidered.</p>

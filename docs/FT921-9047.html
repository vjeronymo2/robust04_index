			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Election delays consumer spending ALMOST one in 10 consumers are delaying making significant purchases because of uncertainty about the general election, according to a survey published by Barclaycard yesterday, Philip Coggan writes. The proportion of those intending to postpone decisions such as moving house, buying furniture or booking holidays, rises to 12 per cent among people aged 35 to 64. Barclaycard gives no explanation for this reluctance to spend, but it does not appear to be related to Labour's plans to increase taxes on the higher paid. Those in social classes AB are less likely to delay decisions than the rest of the population. The survey also shows that in spite of a rise in the official savings ratio, the number of people who say they are saving has fallen to 33 per cent from 36 per cent in October 1991. At the same time, 18 per cent of those surveyed were still running into debt, or using up savings. The survey finds no sign of a revival in the housing market, with only 4 per cent of those questioned planning to take out a mortgage in the next six months. Gallup interviewed 1,000 consumers on behalf of Barclaycard on January 28 and 29.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- A French culture  exhibition opened here today on the 30th anniversary of the  establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties.    The one-month-long exhibition, named "The Exhibition of  Bretagne- Finisterre", introduces with pictures, models and  material objects the history, culture, education, economy and  folk customs of Finisterre, the westernmost department of France.    It was learned that the exhibition, covering 500 sq m in the  China Art Gallery, is in exchange for a Chinese exhibition,  "China Yesterday and Today", which was held last December in  France.    Among those present at today's opening ceremony were Lu  Zhixian, vice-president of the Chinese Association for Cultural  Exchanges With Foreign Countries, Jean-Yves Cozan, delegate of  the French National Assembly and first vice-president of the  General Council of Finisterre Department, and Thierry Audric  [spelling of names as received], counsellor for Cultural and  Scientific Co-operation at the French Embassy in Beijing. They  also cut the ribbon to open the exhibition.    "China always attaches great importance to and cherishes its  cultural exchanges with France," Lu told those attending the  ceremony. "Now, when Sino-French ties have turned a new page,  it is our common desire and responsibility to maintain and  develop our good relations in terms of cultural exchanges."    Cozan said that strengthening bilateral cultural exchanges  can help to expand the co-operation in other fields.    He said that people in his department have deepened their  understanding of China through its cultural coordination with  China, which started three years ago.    Many people from Finisterre have come to invest and do  business in China, he added.    In an interview with XINHUA, Audric said that it was of  great  significance that the exhibition opened on the 30th anniversary  of the establishment of French-Chinese ties.    He said that the introduction of culture and folk customs  can  help the two nations understand each other more deeply and  promote the development of bilateral ties.    The French side hopes that a new French-Chinese cultural  agreement will be reached, and a French cultural center  established in Beijing, Audric said, adding that two large-scale  exhibitions on French culture would be held here within the year.</p>

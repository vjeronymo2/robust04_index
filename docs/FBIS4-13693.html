			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Israel's Ambitions Target All",  AL-BA'TH comments: Dennis Ross, overall U.S. coordinator of the  Middle East peace talks, will reportedly come to the region  shortly to set the stage for a tour by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher. According to some news reports, Christopher  will try to work out with the parties a date for resuming the  stalled talks.    The Americans had said that, as far as the peace talks were  concerned, they had nothing new to offer. Arab and foreign  media have noted that the Americans are backtracking on previous  positions and even gradually adopting the Israeli line and  extending financial and military backing to Tel Aviv. Observers  around the world observe that the U.S. Administration is now  pushing Israel in the direction of war rather than peace.    The paper urges the United States to take a clear-cut  position on the mechanism of the peace process. Washington,  AL-BA'TH adds, is aware that while the Arabs have done all they  could to help the peace process along Israel continues to  maneuver and temporize.    In the overall pan-Arab interests and given that the Arabs  cannot afford further breaches as the Oslo accord and what is  taking place in Muscat and what will take place in Doha, Arab  parties involved in the peace process should commit themselves  to whatever their coming coordination session recommends. If  the Arabs really care about their interests and future, the gaps  through which Israel is infiltrating the Arab world should be  sealed, AL-BA'TH asserts.    We are right to urge all Arabs to sharpen their awareness of  what is going on around them and be more alert to what is being  planned against all of us without exception. It is not as if a  just and comprehensive peace has been attained; indeed, Israel's  rejectionist disposition diminishes the chances for such peace,  AL-BA'TH concludes.</p>

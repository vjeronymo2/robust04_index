When asked if a break-up of the official alliance is  imminent, Rolla replied that Molirena should be asked as "they  are the ones breaking-up." Rolla stressed that the sole  candidate for the 8 May elections is Mireya Moscoso de Gruber  and that the next government will belong to the Arnulfists. "If  other government parties are confused and do not have a  candidate of their own, that is their problem; however, if they  want to be part of the government in the next elections then  they should come under the banner of the Arnulfist Party," Rolla  said.    The experienced politician and health minister warned that  whatever government party wishes to join the triumph of the  Arnulfist party, must work for the needs of the Panamanian  people and not for economic and personal interests, or have in  mind ambassadorial, consular, or banking posts, otherwise they  will harm the party and the country.    Rolla said that whatever party wishes to withdraw from the  government alliance "can leave" because the Arnulfist Party has  the capacity to fill all the ministerial posts. The health  minister insisted that if the Molirena Party leadership decides  to withdraw from the government coalition, "let them," but they  must remember that it is "the Arnulfists who call the shots."    Lastly, Rolla Pimentel confirmed that his Arnulfist Party is  holding talks with parties that are progressive, positive, and  nationalistic, such as the Papa Egoro Movement, National Unity  Mission, and people from the Christian Democratic Party.</p>

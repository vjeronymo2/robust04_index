			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Lukoil unveils scheme to attract foreign investors Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company and one of its most commercially-oriented organisations, yesterday unveiled its strategy to attract between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 7bn in foreign investment over the next few years. Mr Vagit Alekperov, Lukoil president, said he hoped the flotation of as much as 15 per cent of Lukoil shares to foreign investors would be completed in 1996. He was speaking yesterday in London, where senior Lukoil officials met City financial institutions and other potential investors. Earlier this week, the Russian executives made a similar presentation to US investors in New York. Some Lukoil shares are already held by foreigners, including a 3.5 per cent stake by Credit Suisse First Boston. However, substantial work has yet to be done on valuing the company's assets and presenting the information in an internationally-recognised format before it can expand its foreign ownership base. KPMG, the international accounting firm, and McKinsey, the consulting group, are working with the company, as are several western banks seeking to take part in the tender offer. The company has not, however, chosen an international market on which to list its shares. Mr Alekperov said Lukoil, whose fields in western Siberia produce a sixth of Russia's oil, intended to enhance its attractiveness to investors over the next year through internal restructuring and further acquisitions. The company will take full control of its biggest producing subsidiaries in 1995. It also plans to acquire at least five additional companies. Lukoil has begun to transfer some of its social responsibilities, such as housing, to local governments in the areas in which it operates. It also wants to shed some of its extensive ancillary services, such as running railways to transport oil. 'If we can get better services more cheaply, then we will divest immediately,' Mr Alekperov said. Lukoil's long-term strategic goal was to become a fully private company, he said. However, the Russian government, with which Lukoil has close links, still has a 45 per cent shareholding. Mr Alekperov held out the prospect of additional tranches of shares being offered to foreign investors to fund specific projects. 'Our first priority is to broaden our sphere of activity in Russia,' he said. Another priority for Mr Alekperov, who is from Azerbaijan, was participation in oil development projects in the Caspian Sea region. Lukoil has a 10 per cent share in a British Petroleum-led consortium to develop three offshore fields in Azerbaijan. Mr Alekperov said Lukoil also wanted to take part in large oil developments in all the other countries bordering the Caspian. Mr Alekperov expressed confidence that a new oil and gas law governing production-sharing contracts and joint ventures in Russia would soon be passed by parliament.</p>

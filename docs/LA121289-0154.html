			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> HOCKEY HALL OF FAME ON THIN ICE  </P> <P> The U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame may have to close temporarily because of financial  problems, according to its board Chairman John Heneman.  </P> <P> "We are in deep financial trouble," Heneman said Monday. "We just don't have  any money and it may be that it may have to be closed temporarily. We get lots  of promises, but we haven't got any money."  </P> <P> The board has considered private and public sources for operating money,  Heneman said. Hall of Fame board members met last summer with Gov. Rudy Perpich  and were encouraged, but so far no state money has been made available, he  said.  </P> <P> A total of 72 U.S.-born hockey standouts have been named to the hall, which  opened in 1973.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIEFS HAVE WORD FOR VICTORY, 43-24;  </P> <P> INTERCONFERENCE: KANSAS CITY'S BARRY WORD UPSTAGES TEAMMATE CHRISTIAN OKOYE AND  THE LIONS' BARRY SANDERS WITH TEAM-RECORD 200 YARDS.  </P> <P> The game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Detroit Lions was supposed to  be a matchup between defending NFL rushing champion Christian Okoye and  runner-up Barry Sanders.  </P> <P> Instead, it was a showcase for Chief running back Barry Word, who rushed for a  team-record 200 yards in 18 carries Sunday to lead the Chiefs to a 43-24  victory.  </P> <P> Word's 200 yards were seven more than the club record set in 1981 by the late  Joe Delaney. Word's big day included a 45-yard run in the third quarter and  touchdown runs of 53 yards and one yard in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "I've never had a day like this. That's why I don't know how to feel," said  Word, who spent 4 1/2 months in prison in 1986 on charges of conspiracy to  distribute cocaine.  </P> <P> Word, who played at Virginia, had spent two years with the New Orleans Saints  but was working for a telephone company last May when the Chiefs picked him up.  </P> <P> "I'm amazed," he said. "I knew I was capable if I just got a chance."  </P> <P> The Chiefs (4-2) had a 17-14 halftime lead before taking complete command of  the Lions (2-4) in the second half.  </P> <P> The Chiefs piled up 566 yards in total offense, second-highest in team history.  The 43 points were the most by Kansas City in five years.  </P> <P> "We got our tails whipped," Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes said. "That happens once  in a while in the NFL.  </P> <P> "We played very poorly, and I'm very disappointed in our football team. We were  a bad football team, and as a whole, we stunk. Thank you very much."  </P> <P> Okoye, who rushed for 1,480 yards last season, finished Sunday's game with 91  yards, scoring on touchdown runs of four and one yard.  </P> <P> Sanders, who gained 1,470 yards in 1989, rushed for 90 yards and scored  first-quarter touchdowns on a 47-yard touchdown pass play from Bob Gagliano and  a 13-yard run that gave the Lions a 14-3 lead.  </P> <P> Sanders had five receptions for a career-best 135 yards.  </P> <P> Chief quarterback Steve DeBerg completed 15 of 26 passes for 256 yards,  including a one-yard touchdown pass to Jonathan Hayes.  </P></p>

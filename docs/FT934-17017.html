			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Tavener turns to Akhmatova FOR almost two decades Cricklade has hosted an intimate festival of music based on the towered Cotswold church of St Sampson's. The Moscow Orthodox Choir, Budapest Strings and Chilingirian Quartet have all been featured, plus a stream of vocal and instrumental soloists of the front rank. This year saw the commissioning, with help from Southern Arts, of a new song cycle from John Tavener for the soprano Patricia Rozario, who sang the title role in the premiere of Tavener's latest opera, Mary of Egypt, at Aldeburgh last year. Only last summer Tavener's A Village Wedding, a new set of Greek songs written for the Hilliard Ensemble, was heard at the Vale of Glamorgan Festival. Now he has turned to the writings of Anna Akhmatova, the poet who witnessed the hopes and reversals of revolution and survived the cultural attacks of Zhdanov, to be rehabilitated under Khrushchev as one of the giants of Russian 20th century literature. Tavener's Akhmatova Songs for voice and cello are, as one might expect of this composer, simple and monodic. They are sung in Russian, though assisted by clear translations. The first three poems evoke the work of other writers: Dante, Pushkin, Lermontov and Pasternak. The first serves as a prelude, a fragile melody in minor key in which voice and cello (Steven Isserlis) echo each other; in the next, the vocal line rides high above soft cello intervals of a rising and falling sixth. Despite a beautiful sound, Miss Rozario never quite caught the fluid, relaxed zeal of the third (marked 'innocent') while Isserlis' sforzandi seemed unduly muted. Uncharacteristically, neither performer seemed fully abreast of Tavener's flowing lines and measured pauses; while the church's acoustic appeared muffled by the tendency of the sound to channel upwards. The fourth song - a series of glissandoed arpeggios culminating in voice and cello settling on a held D and E flat - proved a turning point. 'The Muse' ('. . . Did you dictate to Dante the script of Hell?') descended to precisely the awesome close the composer intended; while the whispered final song, and epilogue and recapitulation, saw a return to Akhmatova's favoured theme of death. This compact cycle may not easily stand alongside more revealing settings of Akhmatova by Shostakovich and others, but in the last two songs in particular Tavener made good use of both performers.</p>

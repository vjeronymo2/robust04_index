			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed application requires the applicant to provide a copy of the judicial protective order (JPO) to the appropriate ITA official (Item 19). This will assist the ITA in tracking the certifications required by Item 18 above. This item provides the ITA with an additional safeguard to confirm that APO information is properly protected at the conclusion of a case. The certification required by Item 18, or a copy of a JPO required by this condition, will assist the ITA in tracking the final disposition of materials released under APO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The following items have not changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Items 3, 4 and 6 provide basic instructions for the filing and service of the application, and refer the applicant to the appropriate sections of the ITA regulations that pertain to the release of proprietary information under APO. Items 20 through 25 require the applicant to (1) acknowledge sanctions for the breach of the conditions of the protective order, (2) inform the ITA if any of the facts in the application change during the existence of the requested APO, (3) affirm that all statements in the application are true, accurate, and complete, (4) agree to be bound by the terms stated in the APO, (5) assume responsibility for the violation of the APO by any employees of the firm who are granted access to APO information, and (6) identify the party represented. Items 26 and 27 require an attorney applicant or non-attorney applicant to answer particular questions concerning any other relationship the applicant may have with that party. Item 28 requires the identification and signatures of support staff and reiterates the assumption of responsibility for any violation of the protective order by those individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The Proposed Standard APO <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing that a standard APO be placed on the record of each segment of a proceeding shortly after the initiation notice is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It should be understood that the ``standard APO'' will be specific to each segment of a proceeding, thereby allowing for modifications, if necessary, to fit the specific circumstances of different proceedings. Generally, however, the standard APO is the version on which we are seeking comment. The ITA's current practice is to issue one standard APO to all of the applicants from the same firm; ``other representatives'' retained by the attorney or non-attorney representative are listed on the same APO. The placement of one APO on the record of each segment of the proceeding would eliminate specific APOs for the separate parties and streamline the administrative process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed APO contains the standard language that is already used in ITA APOs, and requires the release of all business proprietary information in a proceeding which the submitting party agrees to release or the ITA determines to release, except for the information noted below that is exempt from APO release in accordance with statute and regulations: customer names in an investigation only (Section 135(b) of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 specifically amended Section 777 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677f) to prohibit the release of customer names by Commerce during any investigation which requires an injury determination by the International Trade Commission until either an order is published as a result of the investigation or the investigation is suspended or terminated.); privileged information; classified information; and specific information of a type for which the ITA determines there is a clear and compelling need to withhold from disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed APO sets forth three procedures regarding electronic data. Procedures 1 and 2 are taken from the current ``computer tape'' APO. Procedure 1 requires direct service of electronic data on a party authorized to receive information in this form and requires that the electronic information submitted to the ITA be APO releasable in its entirety. Procedure 2 requires the requesting party to pay the submitter of the electronic data for copying costs and the medium if the applicant requests access to information in electronic form. Procedure 2 does not, however, set a recommended price structure for the electronic data/medium. Although current ``computer tape'' APOs suggest a price limit for the reproduction costs of a computer tape or floppy disk/diskette, we do not believe that the ITA should be involved in pricing materials over which we have no direct knowledge. The APO requires the party requesting electronic data to pay all reasonable costs incurred by the submitter of the data for the copying of its electronic data released to the applicant. It states that reasonable costs may include the cost of the electronic medium and the cost of copying the complete proprietary version of the electronic data/medium submitted to the ITA in APO releasable form. The APO further states that the amount charged for copying the electronic data may not include costs borne by the submitter of the electronic data in the creation of the electronic data/medium submitted to the ITA for use in presenting its case. Procedure 3 releases electronic data generated by the ITA through established procedures. The ITA has not released its own proceeding-specific computer programs and resulting output in electronic form under APO on a routine basis. Procedures are now being developed to provide for the release of this information when it is requested. We have not required that all parties ask for release of electronic data in order to limit proliferation of information in this sensitive form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

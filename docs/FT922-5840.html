			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Edinburgh joins contest for EC bank EDINBURGH yesterday pitted itself against Frankfurt, London and Paris, as well as Amsterdam and Manchester, in formally joining the acrimonious struggle to become the location of the European Central Bank. Edinburgh would like the whole of the new institution to come to the city. It believes its best chance of success, however, lies in persuading the European Community to disperse departments of the bank around member states, with Edinburgh becoming the home of an important sector. Under decisions taken at last year's Maastricht summit to achieve European monetary union by the end of the century, the bank would operate monetary policy across the community when the third stage of monetary union starts either in 1997 or in 1999. Decisions on siting of the bank should in theory be taken by the end of this year. London, Frankfurt and Paris are fighting to be the bank's home, with Amsterdam seen as a possible compromise candidate. Manchester is the only other British city to have put its hat into the ring. Last week Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, raised the hopes of centres other than London when he told the Commons that he believed 'that Britain - not London alone but other centres - will be the strongest candidate' to be the bank's headquarters. The campaign to bring all or part of the bank to Edinburgh was launched at a conference in the city attended by some 200 members of its financial community. A consortium of local authorities and economic development bodies is spending Pounds 250,000 on the campaign. Professor Donald MacKay, an economist who heads the economic consultancy Pieda, said European monetary policy would best be controlled by the bank from a financial centre where trading took place, which would rule out Edinburgh - but there was no reason why other functions, such as money transmission, accounting, research and collation of statistics, could not be located in Edinburgh. He said the city had considerable expertise in its financial community and good telecommunications, and was an inexpensive place to operate. He believed the bank would employ between 1,500 and 2,000 people in all, of which between 750 and 1,000 jobs would be in backroom functions of the kind that Edinburgh could hope to attract.

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell associate told to repay Pounds 6.6m MR KEVIN MAXWELL gave instructions for payments totalling Pounds 6.6m from private companies in the Maxwell empire which were used in an allegedly unlawful share support operation, according to evidence lodged in the High Court. The payments came to light yesterday when the court ordered Mr Sheldon Aboff, a New York lawyer and a long-time associate of the late Mr Robert Maxwell, to repay the money, with interest, to the private companies. The evidence names Mr Darryl Warnford-Davies, Mr Kevin Maxwell's brother-in-law, and four Maxwell executives as having been involved in the transactions. The court documents described for the first time in detail the roles played by Mr Kevin Maxwell and some fellow executives in the months before Mr Robert Maxwell died and his empire collapsed. Seven payments were made by London &amp; Bishopsgate Group, Robert Maxwell Group and Bishopsgate Investment Trust to Mr Aboff, via stockbrokers Townsley &amp; Co and Astaire &amp; Partners, between June and November last year. The money was used to buy 1.7m shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation and 760,000 shares in Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr Maxwell's two public companies. The court ordered Mr Aboff, a former executive of several Maxwell private companies, to pay back the Pounds 6.6m, plus Pounds 477,065 interest, and to deliver up certificates in respect of the MCC and MGN shares. An order made last December freezing up to Pounds 4.35m of Mr Aboff's assets was increased to Pounds 7m and extended until enforcement of yesterday's judgment against him. The orders were made in actions by chartered accountants Arthur Andersen, as administrators of the three private companies, who were given judgment in the absence of any defence by Mr Aboff to their claims. Mr Mark Phillips, counsel for the administrators, told Mr Justice Hoffmann: 'Each transaction was made on the directions of one or other of the key players - Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell. 'We say that Mr Aboff knew these transactions were part of a share support operation and were made in breach of the fiduciary duties of the directors. 'There was no basis on which Mr Aboff could have concluded he was entitled to such substantial payments from these companies,' Mr Phillips said. The evidence stated that the administrators believe the transactions were part of an unlawful share support operation and that the borrowings of the private companies in the Robert Maxwell Group were to a large extent secured by the pledge of MCC and MGN shares. 'Accordingly, in order to support the level of borrowing, it was vital that the share price of these companies, especially MCC, should be maintained.' The administrators had identified a number of substantial flows of funds from private group companies now in administration which had been used for the purchase of shares in MCC and MGN in the names of offshore third parties 'where there was no corresponding benefit to the private companies in question.' At the time of the share transactions, Mr Warnford-Davies had been employed by Townsley, having moved there from Astaire. The evidence mentions memoranda which refer to Townsley and Astaire as 'very nervous people.' Various other instructions for transfer of funds, purchase of shares or other transactions were made by Mr Robert Bunn, finance director of many Maxwell companies, Mr Jonathan Ford and Mr Larry Trachtenberg, who were both London and Bishopsgate directors, and Mr Carson, then London and Bishopsgate's legal counsel and compliance officer.</p>

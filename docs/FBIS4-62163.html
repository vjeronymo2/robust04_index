			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "War in Bosnia: Russia and the EU </F> Fail To Surmount Differences with the United States"]    [Text] On the threshold of the meeting of the foreign  ministers of Russia, the United States, France, Britain,  Germany, Belgium, and Greece scheduled for 13 May in Geneva the  "Great Powers" have failed to surmount the serious differences  preventing them from working out a coordinated position.    The Russian and French diplomats who initiated the Geneva  talks had hoped to be able to persuade the Americans to alter  their approach -- which would have enabled Russia, the United  States, and the EU [European Union] finally to act as a united  front and put effective pressure on the opposing sides in  Bosnia. To judge from recent statements by Secretary of State  Warren Christopher and other U.S. officials, there is little  chance of this.    Washington is still skeptical about the plan proposed by the  EU and supported by Moscow for a repartition of Bosnia, under  which the Serbs are to get 49 percent of the republic's  territory and the Muslims and Croats 51 percent. It has also  proved impossible to find a common language on the question of  sanctions against Yugoslavia. Russia has long been demanding  that they be lifted. The Europeans are prepared to agree to a  gradual easing of sanctions in exchange for Serb compromises.  As for the Americans, they are categorically opposed to any  indulgence for Belgrade.    The Russians and West Europeans in turn stubbornly reject  the  U.S. idea of lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the  Bosnian Government. Moscow is afraid that this step will alter  the correlation of forces to the Serbs' disadvantage and will  inspire the Muslims to new offensive operations. The EU  countries fear for the fate of their peacemakers, who could end  up hostages in the event of the conflict's escalation.    In the opinion of informed Russian Foreign Ministry  personnel  the Geneva talks will be very complex. The sides will hardly be  able to form a single approach to all key questions and thereby  prepare the ground for a summit meeting on Bosnia, the need for  which has been stated repeatedly by Moscow.    There is a more modest but, so people on Smolensk Square  believe, perfectly attainable goal: to advance a joint  initiative for a cease-fire on all fronts in Bosnia. This would  make it possible to remove the tension in the region of the  Serb-controlled city of Brcko, around which large Muslim and  Croat forces have been concentrated. If the Bosnian government  troops succeed in taking the city and cutting the narrow  corridor connecting Serb regions in Bosnia with Yugoslavia, the  Serbs' position will deteriorate sharply, and the war will  commence a new spiral.    The aim of Russian diplomacy is to prevent such a  development  of events and to make the warring sides sign an armistice. The  Serbs, who have seized practically all the territories that they  wanted, are to all appearances ready to agree to a cease-fire.  The hardest task is to convince the Muslims of this -- which is  only possible if the Americans come out decisively in support of  an armistice. How ready they are for this must come to light  during the Geneva meeting.</p>

Undersecretary of State Joan Spero said Washington is  disappointed with the progress in the four-month-old  negotiations aimed at securing U.S. access to the automobile and  other key market sectors in Japan.    Spero was particularly critical of Japanese resistance to  U.S. proposals to use "quantitative indicators" as yardsticks to  measure whether Japanese markets are as open to imports as other  developed nations.    "I don't think this is something that is negotiable," Spero  said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE and JIJI PRESS.    Spero, the top State Department official in charge of  economic issues, gave the interview ahead of a trip to Japan on  Friday for talks with Japanese officials on the framework  negotiations.    Japanese and U.S. negotiators are committed to concluding  the  current phase of negotiations prior to a summit between Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on  February 11.    "We don't want to settle for some cosmetic fix on February  11th. We want to have a real change in this relationship," she  said. She laid the blame for an apparent stalemate in the talks  on Japanese negotiators, who she described as tough, rigid  bargainers.    "It seems that in all areas our Japanese interlocutors are  being quite rigid," Spero told a news conference earlier in the  day.    The current negotiations, based on the so-called "framework"  trade accord concluded last July, focuses on four key Japanese  market areas of particular interest to U.S. firms.    In addition to increased auto and auto parts sales in Japan,  the U.S. wants the Japanese Government to buy more foreign  telecommunications and medical equipment and to allow foreign  firms unrestricted access to the Japanese insurance market.    While the Tokyo Government has promised to make it easier  for  foreign firms to do business in Japan as part of a commitment to  reduce Japan's trade surplus, Japanese officials have balked at  using numerical figures to assess progress.    "They don't want to talk about measurement even though we  agreed very clearly in our written document that we will discuss  these indicators," Spero said, referring to a provision in the  framework agreement for the use of objective indicators.    Spero said Japanese negotiators are particularly negative in  talks on Japan's automobile market.    "They are totally resisting any serious dialogue in  automotive and auto parts issues," she said.    Spero accused what she described as her "Japanese  colleagues"  of misrepresenting U.S. intentions on the framework talks.    "One of the things that our Japanese colleagues have been  saying to you in the press, and you have been saying in your  articles, is 'the U.S. wants another series of (market  share-setting) semiconductor agreements.' I think this is  disinformation," she said.    Spero said the United States is not asking for one single  indicator but multiple benchmarks to show that foreign firms  enjoy the same level of penetration in Japanese markets as in  other developed countries.    "By any standard, Japan is not as open as the other  developed  market economies," Spero said.</p>

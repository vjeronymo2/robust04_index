			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Closing peak for the FT-SE 100 Share Index - Market report The London stock market ended Budget week on a triumphant note yesterday, with the FT-SE 100 Share Index pushing through to a new closing peak, helped by firmness in sterling and in UK government bonds. Earlier in the session, the UK market traced an erratic pattern and the focus on domestic factors restrained it from following the upward trend in other European bourses which greeted the cut in French interest rates. Technical factors also helped the UK market ahead. Although the squeeze in the futures market eased, the premium on the December contract on the Footsie remained strong and the pressures were transferred to the equity market where marketmakers have been caught badly short of stock this week. There were reports that some marketmakers urgently sought a widening of price spreads yesterday. After moving between an early low of 3,212.2, followed quickly by a day's high of 3,240.8, the FT-SE Index closed 10.3 higher at 3,234.2. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index edged ahead by 0.6 to 3,566.5, also a closing peak. Seaq volume died away a little to 747.1m shares compared with 1,048.6m in the previous session. Thursday's retail business was worth Pounds 2.31bn, among the highest daily totals for the year, and confirming the increased business levels which have cheered securities firms in the City of London this year. Government bonds also showed uncertainty at first as profits were taken in the wake of the dramatic rise of the past two trading sessions. Firmness in sterling and in the sterling future contract at the very close of trading spurred a recovery in bond prices. Short-dated gilts ended a touch firmer as confidence that UK base rates will be cut soon after Christmas grew stronger. The longer dates, reflecting similar confidence that domestic inflation will remain low, gained around 1/4 points higher, bringing yields down to 6.76 per cent. At last night's close, the Footsie showed a gain of 122.8 points or nearly 4 per cent over the week. Investment confidence has been boosted by the absence from the UK Budget of the feared assault on the tax status of the UK pension funds and by the relatively benign stance adopted by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Some further selling pressure was seen in oil stocks, however, as international investors continued to back away in the face of the persistent weakness in global oil prices. There were further gains yesterday in the bank stocks which will benefit quickly from improvement in the trading success of their customers, many of whom feature on the banks' bad debt lists and also in store and consumer issues which look for early cuts in base rates. Firmness in pharmaceutical issues provided a boost for market indices. While most equity strategists remained optimistic for the near term, there were warnings that Friday afternoon is well known as a treacherous time for investors. A highly optimistic weekend press review of the Budget and of the stock market's response is expected and the stock market expects increased private investor activity. This week's interest rate cuts in Europe, although not spearheaded by the Bundesbank, have strengthened the likelihood that the UK base rates cuts widely predicted by analysts in London could come earlier in the New Year than expected.</p>

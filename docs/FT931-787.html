			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Books: Law of the jungle THE PEOPLE IN THE PLAYGROUND by Iona Opie Oxford Pounds 15.95, 240 pages IF YOU ever wonder what actually happens to your child on the other side of the school gates, here is the answer. Children, like everyone else, are obsessed by food and sex. In the playground, potato crisps are a currency, doled out as rewards and to win favours. Stories about sex, and sexual and scatological jokes, are relentless. A real whiff of danger means that 'Kiss Chase' or 'Snoggers' is being played. And yes, even at seven the male of the species is 'more egoistical, enterprising, competitive, aggressive and daring' than the female; he is also more likely to be the exhibitionist or clown that makes the playground an irresistible place. Since the 1950s, Iona and Peter Opie have collected the songs and games of childhood and explored the diversity and longevity of children's customs in bestsellers such as The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren (1959), still the classic on the subject. The Opies were the first to suggest the English playground as an anthropological paradise; now, in The People in the Playground, Iona Opie charts the fieldwork of weekly visits to a local junior school over 14 years. Written as diary extracts, this new work at once sparkles with a sense of being there, of what it is like to be a child in the alert, fast-moving school yard, and allows Mrs Opie to pull together a lifetime's observations through particular, vivid details, from seasonal variations in marbles to the way a story evolves in the telling or a game is suddenly devised and forgotten. 'I still feel the excitement of the hunter when I hear children coming out to play,' she writes. The playground as jungle is the overwhelming impression of her book. Survival is all, which means that friendship works like a contract; that a powerful girl of eight whose febrile energy can motivate large groups of children controls playground dynamics as if by right; and that the need to fight, among boys, or to perform, among, say, cartwheeling girls, is ever-present. Judgments against outsiders are speedy, ruthless, matter-of-fact: 'the boys have been calling her Poofy, 'cos she smells, and they say she's got fleas' some girls explain, 'as if they were reporting a leaking tap'. Attraction across the sexes is instantly public and has ten-year-olds earnestly reciting poems about their peers - such as 'Down in the meadow where the green grass grows/There stands Linda without any clothes./ Along comes Andrew clipperty-clop/Down with 'is trousers, out with 'is cock.' Jokes, as among adults, come from fears - coffins and castration are favourite subjects - or out of a wish to feel superior, as in the long-running Irish jokes. Mrs Opie jotted it all down as it was told, watched by the children - 'A kindly little boy by my side said 'If you can't spell starkers just put in the nude'' - who emerge sympathetically as a range of playground types: the raconteur, the defensive loner, the 'mouse boy'. Most people will remember them; it is hard to read this bubbling account without bursts of nostalgia, for the continuity of children's lore, from 'knock knock' jokes to singing games, is astonishing. No one can match Mrs Opie's breadth of reference here, or the immediacy with which she evokes, through a single rhyme, an entire mood and culture. When at Christmas 1978, for example, her pupils sing 'We three kings of Leicester Square/Trying to sell ladies' underwear/How fantastic, no elastic . . .', she recalls the 1952 version - 'We are three spivs of Trafalgar Square/ Flogging nylons tuppence a pair/All fully fashioned, all off the ration . . .' Such details, VS Pritchett wrote of the Opies' early work, take you deeply into British life; it is a verdict which holds true for this fascinating addition to the Opie opus.</p>

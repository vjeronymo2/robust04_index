			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Delay over Maxwell ruling A HIGH COURT judge has deferred to September his ruling on an application by the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management for immediate judgment in their Pounds 450m damages action against Mr Ian Maxwell, a son of Robert Maxwell. The liquidators, partners in Robson Rhodes, have argued that Mr Maxwell has no defence to allegations that he breached his fiduciary duty as a director of BIM, from which hundreds of millions of pounds in pension funds disappeared. Mr Maxwell opposed the liquidators' claim that the case should not go to a full trial.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANGEROUS TOYS ON RISE, GROUP WARNS  </P> <P> A 4-year-old Connecticut boy is just one victim of a barrage of potentially  dangerous toys that will bombard parents looking for perfect toys as holiday  gifts for children, a consumer group said Monday.  </P> <P> "We think that it's a more dangerous situation this year than we've remembered  in our 18 years of toy surveying," Ann Brown, chairwoman of the Consumer  Affairs Committee of Americans for Democratic Action, said in releasing the  group's annual toy safety and quality report.  </P> <P> Brown was joined by Judy Lavoie and her son, Greg, of Bethel, Conn.  </P> <P> Greg had two operations after perforating his eardrum with a packing stick  included with the Pepsi-Cola/Coca-Cola Delivery Truck, listed by the consumer  group as one of its most potentially dangerous toys.  </P> <P> Lavoie said the manufacturer, New Jersey-based Buddy L Corp., told her that the  package clearly states the stick is a part of the packaging and not the toy,  but she displayed an unopened model of the toy she said she bought over the  weekend that didn't include that information.  </P> <P> The manufacturer temporarily suspended shipment of the trucks after Greg's  August, 1988, accident and printed larger stickers warning parents that the  packing rod should be discarded, said George Fink, Buddy L senior vice  president.  </P> <P> "We did not feel that after shipping 750,000 of these units, with one complaint  that we had a dangerous toy," said Fink, explaining why the company didn't  recall the trucks already on the market to include the warning sticker.  </P> <P> "Toy safety has become a contradiction in terms," according to the consumer  group's 135-page report that surveyed 51 toys.  </P> <P> Brown blamed the influx of more dangerous toys on the "powerlessness" of the  Consumer Product Safety Commission.  </P> <P> "The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has jurisdiction over toys, used  to be just be a toothless tiger," she said. "I'm afraid the tiger has now  fallen over dead."  </P> <P> Brown criticized the panel's lack of a quorum of three commissioners since  January. Early Saturday, the Senate confirmed Jacqueline Jones-Smith as the  third commissioner and chairwoman of the panel.  </P> <P> "We will look into every product on that list . . . and make a determination as  to whether any action is necessary," said CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt.  </P> <P> The report cites CPSC statistics that estimate there were 142,000 toy-related  injuries in 1988, an increase of 11,000 over 1987. Nursery product-related  injuries to children under 5 totaled 72,000 in 1988. The ADA report, which  previously cited only toys, this year includes infant and children's products.  </P> <P> RISKY TOYS  </P> <P> Here is the list of the Americans for Democratic Action Consumer Affairs  Committee's "baker's dirty dozen" of what it considers potentially dangerous  toys.  </P> <P> 1.

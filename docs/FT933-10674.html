			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Exporters see fall in prompt payments THE DOWNTURN in continental Europe has been reflected by a sharp deterioration in the number of export companies being paid on time, Trade Indemnity, the credit insurer, said. The company's quarterly financial trends survey found only 2 per cent of UK companies saying they were being paid on time, although there was a reduced exposure to domestic bad debts. In continental Europe 9 per cent of exporters say they were being paid on time, down from 19 per cent the previous quarter.</p>

Reporting this event in its latest issue, the Kazakhstan  SARBAZY (KAZAKH SERVICEMAN) newspaper quotes the words by the  defence minister on the future of the armed forces of his  republic and the Commonwealth of Independent States.    "There was the Soviet Union. There is the Commonwealth of  Independent States now," he said, adding that not a single state  of the former union can exist independently.

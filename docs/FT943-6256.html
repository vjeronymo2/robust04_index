			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Low Pay Network says abolition has meant pay cuts The abolition of wages councils has resulted in significant pay cuts, according to the Low Pay Network. Wages councils used to give legal minimum pay rates to more than 2.5m workers, mainly in hotels and catering, retail, hairdressing and clothing manufacture. They were abolished last August. A report published by the Low Pay Network, an organisation that seeks to improve pay and conditions for low-paid workers, analysed nearly 6,000 jobs offered in Jobcentres in sectors formerly covered by councils. In the retail sector 25.2 per cent of jobs advertised were below the old minimum rates.</p>

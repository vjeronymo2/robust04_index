			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA'S THIRD STREET MALL SET TO PROMENADE;  </P> <P> REOPENS SATURDAY WITH HIGH HOPES AFTER AN ELABORATE FACE LIFT BY CITY  </P> <P> Santa Monica's Third Street Mall, an aging and tattered outdoor retail center,  is ready to promenade into the 1990s as a place where people will still shop,  but where city officials and merchants hope they will also go for dining and  entertainment.  </P> <P> After a two-year, $10-million renovation project and a name change, the  three-block-long, 25-year-old mall will reopen next weekend as the Third Street  Promenade, complete with life-size shrubs trimmed in the shape of dinosaurs,  fountains and other landscaping embellishments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cafes, Theaters  </P> <P> The opening of the promenade will be celebrated Saturday from noon to 7 p.m.  with a parade and dance concert.  </P> <P> For the first time in 25 years, pedestrians will share 3rd Street with cars.  The new promenade will accommodate one lane of vehicle traffic in each  direction, although the city will probably restrict such traffic to the late  afternoon and evening.  </P> <P> The Third Street Promenade will still have many of the same retail shops,  including the J.C. Penney department store, but it will eventually have new  outdoor cafes, movie theaters, classy restaurants, nightclubs with dancing and  live entertainment, office buildings and some residential units.  </P> <P> "The character will be one of a place where people will walk around from place  to place," said Thomas H. Carroll, executive director of the Bayside District  Corp., the nonprofit group that will manage the promenade. "It's exactly what  we wanted."  </P> <P> "I think the design of the public space is lovely," said Mayor Dennis Zane, a  major force in the mall's renovation. "It was on a slow death march, and we  have saved it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Businesses Killed  </P> <P> The mall's decline was substantially aided by a succession of planning  decisions by the city. Built in the mid-1960s, when outdoor pedestrian malls  were the rage, Third Street met with modest initial success despite a serious  shortage of convenient parking.  </P> <P> The city tried to solve that problem by building parking garages along 2nd and  4th streets -- killing most business along those streets in the process and  putting the entire neighborhood into a tailspin. The final blow to the mall was  when Santa Monica Place, an enclosed shopping center with two department stores  as anchors, opened across from the mall in 1981.  </P> <P> Efforts to renovate the run-down shops and offices along 3rd Street between  Broadway and Wilshire Boulevard began in 1983. A final plan was adopted in  1987, and construction began in May, 1988.  </P> <P> City officials actually began their effort to create a new shopping and  entertainment district a few years ago by persuading two comedy clubs, Second  City and The Improv, to open on Santa Monica Boulevard between 2nd and 4th  streets. City officials also encouraged new restaurants, such as the Broadway  Bar and Grill, to open.  </P> <P> New construction focused on public improvements along the street, since the  buildings are all privately owned. The city issued $13 million in bonds, with  $3 million to pay existing debt, $4 million for new parking spaces and $6  million for the street improvements.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Parking  </P> <P> Property owners will repay the bonds over 30 years through an assessment  district.  </P> <P> For their money, property owners are getting 300 new parking spaces to bring  the total in six garages along 2nd and 4th streets to 3,000.  </P> <P> In planning the revival, city officials and private developers included the  entire neighborhood, not just 3rd Street. To restore some life to 2nd and 4th  streets, retail space has been constructed on the street level of the garages,  and the city will subsidize some rents there to bring in desirable tenants.  </P> <P> Along 3rd Street, the city has planted palm and jacaranda trees, improved  lighting, placed wrought-iron benches and trash receptacles and built plazas at  each end of the three blocks, containing fountains and the topiary dinosaurs.  Sidewalks have been widened to 30 feet and the street narrowed to 20 feet.  </P> <P> The City Council will decide Tuesday what hours traffic will be allowed on the  promenade, although it is likely to be limited to after 3 p.m.  </P> <P> Though the improvements along the street have been all cosmetic, they have  created excitement among developers and merchants who are moving into the  promenade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Going to Be Wonderful'  </P> <P> "In 1984 it was a very tough sell, but now everybody wants to be there," said  Barbara Tenzer, a commercial real estate broker for Sommer Broida Commercial  Brokerage Co. who has been involved in the project for six years. "I think it's  going to be wonderful."  </P> <P> The Janss Corp. is building three commercial projects along the promenade:  </P> <P> * A seven-story, 58,000-square-foot building at 3rd and Broadway with office  space, a four-screen Cineplex Odeon theater, 32 apartments and a restaurant  operated by Bruce Marder, whose other restaurants include DC3 and Rebecca's.  </P> <P> * A four-story, 56,000-square-foot office and retail building at Santa Monica  Boulevard and 3rd Street, scheduled to open in the summer of 1991.  </P> <P> * A six-story, 80,000-square-foot office building on 2nd Street in conjunction  with Century West Development Co., also scheduled for completion in summer,  1991.  </P> <P> Bill Janss, president of Janss Corp., said he probably would not have built  along the promenade if the city had not made the improvements.  </P> <P> "The fact that improvements were being made was instrumental in our decision to  build there," Janss said. "But it's not just the improvements themselves, but  the excitement when you get a district that has a lot of development."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Viewed as Extension  </P> <P> Although the 8-year-old Santa Monica Place shopping center is on the south end  of the promenade, it is being viewed as a complement rather than a competitor  to the promenade.  </P> <P> "I see (the promenade) as a tremendous boost for the 160 businesses in the  center," said Tom Gilmore, group marketing manager for Rouse Co., the Columbia,  Md.-based owner of the shopping center. "It will increase the critical mass  necessary to get people to Santa Monica."  </P> <P> Gilmore said Santa Monica Place will make some improvements of its own early  next year, particularly in its food court and entrances.  </P> <P> But with the new shops and restaurants coming into the promenade, many older  businesses have left. Some have moved to the rent-subsidized street-level  spaces along 2nd and 4th streets, but other merchants have gone out of  business.  </P> <P> Bayside District Corp. director Carroll said there is about a 30% vacancy rate  in the 500,000 square feet of retail space along the promenade and 2nd and 4th  streets. He said he hopes to have a mix of shops on the promenade, but  acknowledged that when leases are up in a few years, many older shops may be  priced out or find that the promenade's new clientele is not interested in  their merchandise.  </P> <P> "It's regrettable," said Mayor Zane of the expected exodus, "but I'm not sure  it's avoidable."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THIRD STREET PROMENADE  </P> <P> Location: a three-block stretch of 3rd Street, from Broadway to Wilshire  Boulevard.  </P> <P> Size: 500,000 square feet of retail space in six square blocks, including shops  along 2nd and 4th streets.  </P> <P> Parking: 3,000 spaces in six garages along 2nd and 4th streets.  </P> <P> Cost: $10 million.  </P></p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (6): The largest reefers in the world - Lauritzen's role in the 'ship of the future' A SMALL but highly qualified crew is not only operationally the most satisfactory; it is also the safest,' says Mr Ole Rendbaek, managing director of the Lauritzen Group's Danyard, in Frederikshavn, Jutland. He has a vested interest in this philosophy, as Danyard has built the four largest and technically most advanced refrigerated cargo vessels ('reefers') in the world for the group's shipping company, J. Lauritzen, which operates one of the world's largest reefer fleets. These 16,600 dwt giants, with a cargo capacity of 765,650 cubic feet, are approved for a crew of six and sail with a crew of seven or eight. The four reefers were the upshot of a ship development project initiated by the Ministry for Industry back in 1987 - 'Project Ship'. The ministry's idea was to develop high technology ships, with low manning requirements and a high degree of manoeuvrability. The project was carried out over three years with the participation of 22 Danish companies and two international classification societies. The ministry contributed DKr25m to the project and the participating companies another DKr20m. Lauritzen took up the opportunity to participate in this 'ship of the future' scheme, after hesitating about being the first to introduce new technology and in spite of uncertainty about the final cost (in the event, money was not made on the first three new reefer vessels produced at Danyard, but the fourth, as well as subsequent ships in the not entirely identical series now being built for other owners did produce a positive return). The project had an important spin-off for Frederikshavn's other yard, the Orskov Yard, which has adapted Project Ship technology into the small container carriers (feeders) in which it currently specialises. 'Our ships are not quite so advanced as the Project Ship vessels,' says Mr Niels Orskov Christensen, whose father founded the yard in 1958 and whose 29-year-old son, trained as a naval architect, has just joined the firm. 'But we took over a lot of knowledge from Project Ship and put it to practical use.' The 10,000dwt container vessels from Orskov, which look remarkably imposing when in the process of construction on stocks in the yard, sail with a complement of 10, including cook and cabin boy. The outstanding characteristic of the Project Ship vessels is the integrated ship control systems, designed by electronics company Soren T. Lyngsoe, using state-of-the-art information technology, for navigation and supervision of the engine room and the cargo holds so that all supervision and control can be carried out from the bridge by one person. The ships are the 'one-man reefer,' in the language of Danyard's promotional material: 'Total one-man control of all ship functions, port to port, is now a reality.' Since for long periods there may be only one man on the bridge, an alarm system is activated if no controls are touched over a predetermined period of time, and a second alarm goes off if the first alarm yields no response. Non-bridge functions are also designed for one-man operation, such as the rams for opening and closing hatch covers on the main deck and between decks, operated by a one-man remote control unit, the deployment of pilot ladders and the mooring winches. The Lauritzen Group, with a 1991 turnover of DKr13.1bn, net profits of DKr420m, assets of DKr15.5bn and equity capital of DKr3.8bn, could well be described as the complete maritime conglomerate. Mr Sven Dyrlov Madsen Group, chief executive, refers to the group's 'synergising sisters'. The group includes J. Lauritzen Shipping, which in addition to a large reefer fleet operates a big fleet of small gas tankers, more than 30 bulk carriers, five offshore drilling rigs and a small fleet of tankers. It also incorporates DFDS, the shipping and transport group which operates passenger and freight services on the North Sea and an extensive European onshore haulage business. On the industrial side, in addition to Danyard, the group includes Sabroe Refrigeration and Aalborg Ciserv. Sabroe is a specialist in industrial refrigeration and the world's leading supplier of refrigeration systems for reefer vessels. It was thus heavily involved in the four Project Ship reefer vessels, for which it designed what it claims to be the market's most sophisticated refrigeration system. The refrigeration system is controlled by Sabroe's fully-computerised refrigeration control and management system, which provides for complete scanning of plant performance and hold conditions. The system is a windows-based menu system, which means that relatively little training is required before a person with no knowledge of computer technology is fully competent to operate it. New additions to the Sabroe family are Klinge Cool and Lanng &amp; Stelman, which produce cooling systems for seaborne containers and electronic control systems for cooler containers and marine engines. Aalborg Ciserv is a leading producer of boilers for marine and other industrial purposes. The group has a long tradition in the building and repair of ships. It also provides a complete marine maintenance service, winning a long-term contract last year to service the motors and machinery on the four new Lauritzen reefers. The repair and maintenance service operates from 25 locations around the world.</p>

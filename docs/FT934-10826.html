			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar gains at DM's expense ENCOURAGING economic data from the US gave a lift to the dollar, which recorded a significant rise against the D-Mark yesterday. The German currency was also weak against several European currencies, particularly sterling, which consolidated above DM2.50, writes Peter John. The dollar tried to move higher in Tokyo trading but ended steady against the yen and D-Mark after late profit-taking, apparently by Japanese life insurers. Then at the start of European dealing, the German Bundesbank announced that today's securities repurchase operations would be carried out at a variable rate. This gave hope that the repo would fall from its current 6.40 per cent to around 6.35 per cent. Belief that Germany will continue to cut rates was given additional impetus by figures showing German industrial output was still very weak. Switching from the D-Mark to the dollar pushed the US currency above DM1.70. It slipped at midday, but when the US markets opened, figures were released showing a surge in home sales and it moved higher again. Ms Francoise Skelley of Credit Suisse said charts of recent buying trends showed that the dollar was now well supported at DM1.6850 and DM1.6920, while DM1.70 and DM1.7250 were resistance levels on the way up. The dollar finished at DM1.6945, up from DM1.6935. Against the pound it eased to Dollars 1.4825 from Dollars 1.4810, and against the yen it slipped to Y107.50 from a previous Y108.20. At the close of New York trading the dollar stood at DM1.7032 and Y107.75, with sterling at Dollars 1.4735. Meanwhile, a weaker D-Mark was most strikingly reflected by the relative strength of the pound. Sterling continued to build on its rise at the start of the week as the argument against an early cut in interest rates developed. Previous statements by Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, sought to dampen speculation that the base rate is set to fall. Yesterday's Bank of England inflation report did little to support the case for a near-term cut in base rate. Sterling reached a high of DM2.5157 in the afternoon before settling at DM2.5125, up from DM 2.5075. Foreign exchange dealers now consider it can quite easily rise as high as DM2.54 before there is any strong desire to switch funds. The D-Mark also declined against the Danish krone, falling below DKr4.0 to close at DKr3.9990 from DKr4.0209. It slid against the Italian lira to L967.40 from L975.30, with technical analysts saying it could reach L960 soon. The German currency was easier against the French franc as Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French finance minister, reaffirmed France's policy to maintain a strong currency. In contrast, it gained against the Swiss franc to finish at SFr1.299, up from SFr1.287.</p>

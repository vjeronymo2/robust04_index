			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LIKELY SALE SPURS TORRANCE AUDIT OF CABLE TV FIRM  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council voted unanimously this week to audit Paragon  Communications, which provides cable television service for about 54,000 homes  in five South Bay cities.  </P> <P> Under Federal Communication Commission rules, it is likely that Paragon will be  sold as a result of the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. City  officials said they want information on the company's finances so that they can  negotiate a franchise agreement with a new owner.  </P> <P> Without discussion, the council voted Tuesday to pay the Sherman Oaks  accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand $15,000 for the audit. Ken Flewellyn,  Torrance's assistant financial director, said he does not know how long the  audit will take to complete.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officials Interested  </P> <P> The city has not previously audited Paragon, which took over the cable TV  franchise from Group W Cable in 1987, he said. The audit would also "make sure  we are receiving our fair share" of the company's revenues, Flewellyn said.  </P> <P> Paragon has franchise agreements with Torrance, Gardena, Lawndale, Hawthorne  and El Segundo. Officials in the five cities are interested in the possible  sale because their franchise agreements with Paragon require the cities to  approve any change in ownership.  </P> <P> Torrance City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said the FCC will probably require the sale  because otherwise Time Warner Inc. would control both Paragon and KCOP-TV in  Los Angeles, which serves most of Southern California.  </P> <P> Time now owns 82% of American Television and Communications, which owns 50% of  Paragon. Warner owns 42% of BHC Inc., which owns KCOP.  </P> <P> The FCC prohibits a company from holding more than 5% of the stock in both a  cable system and a television station in the same market, agency officials  said.  </P> <P> Barrett Brick, a lawyer for the FCC in Washington, said the agency has granted  Time Warner Inc. until January, 1991, to come into compliance with the  regulation. He said Time Warner Inc. can sell KCOP to comply with FCC rules,  but he said the company will most likely sell Paragon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Opposed to Audit  </P> <P> Jerome Ramsey, vice president of Paragon Communications, said he is not opposed  to an audit but hopes the auditors can avoid disrupting the company's work  schedule.  </P> <P> While officials in the other South Bay cities have yet to take action similar  to Torrance's, in the past they have said they would be watching the merger  because the sale of Paragon would permit them to renegotiate their franchise  agreements with the new cable company.  </P> <P> Harry Reeves, Hawthorne's chief of special services, said that if Paragon is  sold, the city could negotiate a new agreement that would include improvements  to the cable system.  </P> <P> Reeves said Torrance's audit of Paragon is "a prudent thing to do." Hawthorne  has not asked for an audit of Paragon but may do so soon, he said. "I think it  might be a good thing for all the cities to do."  </P></p>

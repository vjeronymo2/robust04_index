			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burburlis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, 7 May -- The 49th anniversary of the end of  the Second World War will not be celebrated officially in  Lithuania. But war veterans will undoubtedly meet up to recall  the past and lay wreaths at the graves of their fallen  comrades-in-arms.    The single official gesture related to the event was a  statement by President Algirdas Brazauskas published today,  which to all intents puts the occupiers and liberators of  Lithuania on the same level. The head of state said that  Lithuania had been occupied more than once and trampled upon by  more than one occupier during the years of the Second World War.    At the same time, the president notes that thousands of  Lithuania's citizens -- Lithuanians, Russians, Poles, and Jews  -- had contributed to the joint struggle against Hitler. No one  has the right to erase them from history, belittle their  sacrifice, or wipe their names from the national memory.</p>

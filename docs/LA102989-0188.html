			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> OAKLAND ATHLETICS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS;  </P> <P> GIANT STAFF VIRTUALLY UNARMED AGAINST A'S POWERFUL LINEUP  </P> <P> Over the 162 games of their fife and drum march to a National League  championship, the San Francisco Giants employed 15 starting pitchers. Each  member of their original rotation spent time on the disabled list except Don  Robinson.  </P> <P> Faced with physical shortcomings of a similar nature in the best-of-seven World  Series, it was not surprising that the Giants came up short in other ways as  well.  </P> <P> The critical category was games won. The Oakland A's swept the Series, four  games to none. The score Saturday night was 9-6, the aforementioned Robinson  lasting only 1 2/3 innings as the Giants' starter.  </P> <P> Over the long season, the Giants' patchwork pitching staff finished third in  the league in team earned-run average at 3.30.  </P> <P> In the Series, with Robinson nursing a sore knee that restricted him to 8 1/3  innings over the previous six weeks, and with Scott Garrelts complaining of a  sore elbow and Rick Reuschel in and out of the rotation with back, groin and  shoulder problems, San Francisco's starters compiled an ERA of 11.77 and  averaged 3 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> "The one thing that surprised me most," Giant Manager Roger Craig said, "is  that we didn't pitch up to expectations. Some of our guys weren't 100%, but I'm  not going to use that as an excuse.  </P> <P> "If we had pitched to expectations, we'd still be playing, but we were four or  five runs behind in every game, and it's tough to have to keep battling back in  a short series."  </P> <P> The Giants were outhit, 44-28, and outscored, 32-14. Of their 14 runs, 10 came  after they trailed, 13-3, and 8-0, in Games 3 and 4.  </P> <P> The staff ERA was 8.21 compared to the A's 3.50.  </P> <P> Attempting to keep the Giants alive, Robinson said his knee was a factor  Saturday night, but he also played it down.  </P> <P> "It's tough enough trying to beat that team when you're 100% and almost  impossible when you're 80%," he said.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't have been out there if I hadn't thought I was capable of pitching,  but it did take away some from my velocity. I wasn't able to push off like I  normally do."  </P> <P> The pitch that proved fatal to Robinson was a two-strike, two-out fastball to  opposing pitcher Mike Moore in the second inning.  </P> <P> Moore swung and missed at two high fastballs, but this one was down a little  and he hammered it over the head of center fielder Brett Butler for a two-run  double and a 3-0 Oakland lead. Moore scored on a single by Rickey Henderson,  and Robinson left, trailing, 4-0.  </P> <P> "They scored three runs off one pitch," Robinson said of Moore's double. "I  wanted to get it in the same place as those first two pitches but made a  mistake.  </P> <P> "Maybe if I had pitched more in the last few weeks I'd have had more confidence  in a breaking pitch or a cutter (cut fastball) in that situation, but I'm not  going to second-guess the selection, just the location."  </P> <P> Robinson opened the game by falling behind Rickey Henderson, throwing two  consecutive balls on cut fastballs. He had to come in with a fastball, and  Henderson hit it over the left-field fence.  </P> <P> "My cutter wasn't working at all," Robinson said of his best pitch. "Part of  that was the knee. Part of it was not having been out there much recently. I  fell behind and had to make too many good pitches to too many good hitters.  </P> <P> "The A's have everything, and we didn't do the job in any category, especially  starting pitching. We won a National League pennant with the third-best ERA in  the league, but we didn't pitch well against the A's. We weren't in any game.  We didn't give our offense a chance. That's a disappointment."  </P> <P> Having dismissed the injuries as a reason for the pitching breakdown, Craig  also dismissed the uncertainty of the 10-day layoff created by the Oct. 17  earthquake.  </P> <P> "Oakland's starters were off the same number of days and didn't seem to have  any problems," he said. "We just didn't make the pitches we wanted to make.  </P> <P> "We were outpitched, outhit and outplayed. I give the A's a lot of the credit.  They have the type team that should be up there for a number of years to come."  </P> <P> Craig had a brief team meeting after the final out Saturday night and said he  told his players they have nothing to be ashamed about.  </P> <P> "I reminded them that nobody even expected us to be here, that they battled  back all year to win a National League championship and that they could expect  to be even better next year," he said.  </P> <P> "I told them that was all I wanted them to think about. I mean, we were beat by  a great club, and as much as I hate to lose four in a row, I won't go home  feeling badly about this.  </P> <P> "My dauber isn't down."  </P> <P> The Giants have responded aggressively in previous winters to correct deficient  areas. They signed Butler as a free agent to play center field and be the  leadoff hitter. They traded for Steve Bedrosian as the stopper out of the  bullpen.  </P> <P> Craig said that he and club president Al Rosen have already addressed the  club's needs, and the acquisition of a starting pitcher is among them. The  Giants are expected to pursue free-agent pitcher Mark Langston while also  bidding to beef up their hitting. A new right fielder is another need.  </P> <P> Against the A's, the bottom five hitters in the Giant lineup were 10 for 68.  The A's also controlled Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell, who drove in a combined  total of four runs and were nine for 33.  </P> <P> Said National League playoff star Clark, sitting at his locker: "Their pitching  was very good, very consistent. They held us down in crucial situations.  Everyone talks about their big boppers, but I think their pitching and defense  is very underrated."  </P> <P> Said Terry Kennedy, the Giant catcher: "It hurts to get beat as soundly as we  did, but I'm not going to let that take anything away from what we did this  year.  </P> <P> "Being league champion is no small thing, and I think it's a crime what some  people are saying now about some of our pitchers, considering what they  accomplished this year. The A's just kept pushing at the door, and we didn't  have enough guys to keep it shut."  </P> <P> Enough guys physically healthy enough to keep it shut, but that may be  corrected now that it's finally the off-season.  </P> <P> Said Craig, forcing a smile: "We'll do anything to improve the club except  change managers."  </P></p>

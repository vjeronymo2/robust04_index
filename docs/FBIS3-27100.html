			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Fierce regional opposition has forced Beijing to  back down on a controversial new land tax, the first time it has  bent to local demands since a new national tax system was  introduced earlier this year.    A senior official at the State Administration of Taxation in  Beijing said the detailed regulations of the tax on capital  gains on land sales--due out in late February or early  March--would differ significantly from the central government's  original announcement of the basic tax law last month.    "New problems came up when we talked with Guangdong and  other  provinces about this, [so] adjustments will be made to take  account of their views," he said.    But the official denied statements by provincial authorities  in Guangdong and Shanghai suggesting the tax may be delayed for  one or two years.    "I have heard this, but it is not correct. The State Council  has already announced the tax, so it cannot be reversed," he  said.    Coastal regions have given Beijing an earful about its plans  to levy the new tax, which would have assessed real estate  investment profits at rates of 30 to 60 per cent under the  original scheme.    Even though local governments would have retained all the  proceeds, there was concern that the tax would drive away  foreign investment.    "The tax was too high. We told the central government this  was not correct," said Liang Yixi, deputy director of the  Guangdong Provincial Land Bureau.    Beijing finally backed down on implementation of the new tax  only after numerous meetings with provincial leaders, Liang  said. "The local role will be increased," she said.    Shanghai's mayor, Huang Ju, had made at least two trips to  Beijing to protest against the tax in the past month, an  official at the municipal Foreign Investment Commission said.    "There have been too many complaints. The central government  could not just carry on," he said.    Details of the centre's retreat have been leaked to foreign  economists and property consultants in the past few weeks as  Beijing sought to allay the unease of foreign investors.    "The new regulations will be much more relaxed," said Chen  Xingdong, chief economist for Crosby Securities in Beijing.    Chen said the changes would probably allow developers to  deduct interest charges and inflation from their capital gains.    Gains of under 20 or 30 per cent would also be exempted from  the tax, Chen said. In addition, local governments would be  allowed to exempt certain types of property developments.    But Beijing would not change the basic rate of the new tax  or  the January 1 implementation date, Chen said.    "This would show their inability to manage," he said.    Local governments will also be allowed to rebate a  significant portion of the tax to developers in certain  circumstances, according to Harry Chan of the property  consultants Francis Lau &amp; Co in Hong Kong.    "We were told by Beijing that local governments will be  given  a lot of decision-making power in order to soften the effects,"  he said.    The backdown on the land tax is a blow to the central  government, which was counting on it to boost local revenues in  compensation for taking a larger share of the total fiscal pie  under the new national tax system.    Only weeks ago the Minister of Finance, Liu Zhongli, stated  publicly that any adjustments or modifications to the tax made  by local authorities would be considered invalid.    "Local governments have no choice but to obey the  regulations  laid down by the central government," Liu said.</p>

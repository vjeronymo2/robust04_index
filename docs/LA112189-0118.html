			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS DINE IN PROTEST OF PLAN TO CURB SOUP KITCHENS  </P> <P> About 150 homeless people gathered outside City Hall on Monday night for an  early Thanksgiving dinner and to protest a city proposal that would place  restrictions on soup kitchens.  </P> <P> The Orange County Committee to Feed the Homeless, a group made up of five  organizations, served a turkey dinner and handed out hundreds of blankets to  people who began lining up at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> The dinner was intended to protest a proposal to require mobile soup kitchens  to set up portable toilets, tables and trash cans at each stop, according to  Jonathan Parfrey, a member of Catholic Worker, a Santa Ana group that serves  hot meals every Monday from a van.  </P> <P> People began arriving outside City Hall at about 5:45 p.m., pushing shopping  carts or carrying plastic bags with their belongings. As volunteers began  serving 16 turkeys, 150 pounds of mashed potatoes, 10 gallons of gravy and  peas, the guests returned with their plates to nearby benches, or sat on the  concrete, or simply stood and ate. Some carried candles given to them by the  volunteers.  </P> <P> Tom, who didn't want to give his last name, said he has been homeless for five  months. After receiving his plate, Tom observed: "I know the city has been  harassing a lot of us, so it means so much just to sit here and eat dinner,  right outside the chambers."  </P> <P> Another guest, Pat Ford, who sleeps at night in the Civic Center area, said:  "It's not so much for the food that we're here. It's to say to the City  Council, please help us."  </P> <P> Councilmen Ron May, Miguel A. Pulido and Richards L. Norton helped to  distribute hygiene kits and blankets to the homeless, some of whom jeered them.  </P> <P> Scott Mather, a member of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force,  described the dinner as a grass-roots protest against the plan to place  restrictions on soup kitchens.  </P> <P> "This shows that the homeless are not voiceless," he said. "They are saying to  the council, 'Stop this proposal before it gets too far.' "  </P> <P> A citizens group called Cleanup Our Businesses and Residential Areas helped  draft that proposal and filed it with the city's Planning Department. It is  undergoing legal screening, city officials said, before going to the Planning  Commission and City Council.  </P> <P> Groups that help the homeless in Santa Ana say the proposal would be too costly  and eventually would force them to stop serving food.  </P> <P> "Santa Ana is trying to limit the serving of any kind of food to the homeless,"  Parfrey said. "We are willing to work with the city, but they are not willing  to work with us."  </P> <P> City Manager David N. Ream said the city does not have a policy on the homeless  and has been working with the organizations. Ream declined to comment on the  protest.  </P> <P> Orange County has about 10,000 homeless people, 1,500 of whom stay in Santa  Ana, it is estimated.  </P> <P> The city has had a shaky relationship with its homeless populace for years,  advocates for the homeless said. In 1988, the city confiscated belongings of  the homeless, such as bedding and clothes stashed around the Civic Center. The  city stopped its actions after a protest was filed and allowed homeless people  to pick up their belongings at Centennial Regional Park.  </P></p>

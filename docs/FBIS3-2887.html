Chinese  sources said as the health of the senior leader deteriorated,  contenders for power in the post-Deng China were trying to  accumulate political capital by claiming to have his blessings.  The sources said Mr. Deng was no longer fit to pay close  attention to national policy.    Before delivering his Government Work Report to the National  People's Congress yesterday, however, Premier Li Peng hinted  that his report had lived up to the expectations of the  89-year-old patriarch. "Comrade Deng has all along provided  guidance to the report," Mr. Li reportedly told the legislators.  "He has shown concern for the fact that the contents of the  report should highlight the themes of reform, development and  stability and that it (the report) must be practical."    Analysts said, however, that Mr. Li's report had omitted the  bulk of the remarks that Mr. Deng had made in Shanghai before  Lunar New Year about "fast-paced reform and development". They  said the premier had invoked Mr. Deng's name solely to boost his  own authority.    Informed sources said members of the Deng family had agreed  to use Mr. Deng's name and authority to buttress the power base  of the patriarch's proteges.    For example, while touring Japan earlier this week, Deng  Rong, Mr. Deng's daughter and private secretary, told  journalists that the senior leader had entrusted major national  affairs to President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li and Executive Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji.    This is despite the fact that on private occasions, Mr. Deng  had expressed reservations about the commitment of Mr. Jiang and  Mr. Li to his reforms.    At the same time, members of the Chinese Communist Party's  conservative faction have revived those of Mr. Deng's old  speeches that advocate iron-clad control in the ideology and  media fields. In a recent speech on stopping the "infiltration  of corrupt ideas and culture from outside of China", the  Minister of Radio, Film and Television, Ai Zhisheng, quoted a  maxim of Mr. Deng on fighting "bourgeois liberalisation".    In a dispatch last night, the semi-official Hong Kong China  News Service [press agency name as published] quoted Mr. Ai as  citing this Deng dictum: "While resolutely implementing the  open door policy, we must be cool-headed and insist on  sabotaging the infiltration of decadent ideas from abroad. We  must never allow the inundation of a bourgeois-liberal lifestyle  in our country." In their public speeches, however,  conservatives like Mr. Ai have omitted Mr. Deng's more liberal  views on ideology and propaganda.    Western diplomats said as Mr. Deng's health deteriorated,  there was a possibility he would be "controlled" by family  members and confidants who were in a position to attribute  policies and instructions to the patriarch.</p>

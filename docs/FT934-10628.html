			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wigmore plans to raise Pounds 50m WIGMORE Property Invest-ment Trust is attempting to raise up to Pounds 50m via a placing and offer-for-subscription of shares at 100p, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. The trust will be managed by Baring Investment Management and will use Baring, Houston &amp; Sanders as property adviser. Wigmore will aim to outperform the FT-A Property Index by investing in shares and other securities of UK property companies with market capitalisations of less than Pounds 250m. The principal holdings will be in property investment companies, but there will be some holdings in development companies and up to 20 per cent of the fund can be invested in special situations, such as joint ventures. The 10 largest investments in the initial portfolio are expected to be: City Site Estates, Chesterfield Properties, The Ex-Lands, Hemingway Properties, London &amp; Associated Investment Trust, Olives Property, Prior, Southend Property Holdings, Tops Estates and Town Centre Securities. Institutional investors and some property companies have agreed to to subscribe for 19.36m shares in return for cash and/or securities. In a separate deal, 3.06m shares are being subscribed for by property companies which have been given a cash election. Under this arrangement, once sufficient funds have been raised, the property companies will receive cash, rather than trust shares, in return for their own shares.</p>

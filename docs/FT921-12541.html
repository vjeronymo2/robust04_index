			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Signs of recovery seen in housing market THE practice of gazumping could be back, according to reports from an estate agent in Orpington, Kent, after a would-be house-buyer whose offer of Pounds 138,000 was accepted was later outbid by an offer of Pounds 142,000. The estate agent said this was its first case of gazumping 'in ages'. A West Yorkshire estate agent announced that it just had the busiest Saturday for 18 months for clients making appointments to view homes. A Pounds 230,000 town house at Newmarket, Suffolk, was recently sold in just two weeks. According to one agent a similar sale last year would have taken at least four months. While no one is suggesting that the UK housing market is returning to the frenzy of several years ago, there are tentative signs that the worst of the slump may be over. A straw poll of housebuilders, mortgage lenders and estate agents, conducted this week by the Financial Times, has revealed a sharp rise in interest from potential buyers since the start of this year. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, Britain's second-largest housebuilder, says traffic through the company's show houses is about 10 to 15 per cent higher than during the first three weeks of last year. Some other builders and agents report similar increases. The number of people agreeing to make purchases has also risen although sellers warn that deals have still to be completed. A common feature of the housing market during the recession has been a high number of buyers withdrawing from deals before completion. Sellers warned against over-optimism in a market which during the last 18 months has seen several false dawns. Mr Dennis Webb, managing director of Beazer Homes, the third-largest housebuilder in the country, says: 'Sales during the first few weeks of this year are up by 10 per cent. This, however, is compared with last January when sales were depressed during the run-up to the Gulf War. We are encouraged. I do believe the bottom of the market has been reached but it is still too early to talk of a recovery.' Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, says that the increase in activity is no more than might be expected at this time of year. But it adds that an improvement in the economy is required before there will be an increase in confidence in the housing market. Sir Lawrie Barratt, executive chairman of Barratt which last year announced a Pounds 106m pre-tax loss, is more optimistic, however. 'Visitor rates through our sites are up 40 per cent on a year ago and sales are up 10 per cent,' he says. 'House prices in relation to earnings are at the lowest level since the early 1980s. Confidence is returning and we are forecasting that house prices will rise by about 5 per cent this year.' Estate agents say that falls in mortgage interest rates and the government's decision to abolish stamp duty on most house purchases for eight months may have helped stimulate interest. Mr Malcolm Duffey, residential manager of Jackson Stops &amp; Staff in East Anglia, reports increased regional demand for houses priced between Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 300,000. He says: 'This may indicate that professional managers able to afford these homes are taking the view that prices will not fall any further.' Other agents say that while falling prices and interest rates have made homes more affordable, fears of job losses make it more difficult to achieve sales. Most say that prices are unlikely to rise even if the sales improvement is sustained - such is the backlog of properties to be sold. Tenant's Charter, Page 4</p>

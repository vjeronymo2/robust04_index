			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Radical change needed, or just tinkering? Sir, The paradox of the debate - or lack of - about building society governance is that among large societies individual members provide some 70 per cent of the loanable funds. At the same time, at least 99 per cent of their directors have been initially appointed, not by members, but in typical plc style by existing boards. Boards of societies have been happy to tolerate a gap between constitutional governance theory and practice so long as its results were convenient. The financial services industry has over-capacity. A mutual, member-based constitution diffuses power and the pressure of accountability. It also prevents an effective market for building societies developing. Low participation rates among building society members is nothing new. It is even lower among mutual life insurance companies. The real question is whether this is an issue for radical change or mere tinkering? Will the Building Societies Commission please take note?

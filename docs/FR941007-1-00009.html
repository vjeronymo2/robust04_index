			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department recognizes that, for many pollutants, the literature on the damages caused by additional emissions is not well developed. When information on damages is lacking, the Department may consider the use of information related to the costs of emissions reduction in its effort to values externalities. The rationale for this approach is that control costs convey information about social willingness-to-pay for emissions reduction. If legislative and regulatory actions to limit emissions were economically rational (i.e., control measures were adopted in strictly increasing order of marginal cost, stopping at the point where marginal control cost and marginal benefits were equated), marginal control costs would provide an indirect measure of marginal damages. It is generally recognized, however, that actual regulatory practice often diverges significantly from these conditions. Therefore, the Department proposes to consider the use of control cost information to estimate externality values in situations where changes in efficiency standards affect emission levels only in those cases where direct damage information is unavailable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Case 2: The pollutant is subject to a binding emissions cap and changes in the efficiency standard selected will not change national emission levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With a binding, national emissions cap in place, the aggregate level of emissions will not be affected by the appliance efficiency standard selected. Because of the cap, there is no net change in emissions and, therefore, there are usually no environmental externalities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although in the case of an emissions cap there is usually no net environmental change on a national level, and therefore no external environmental effect, the level of appliance efficiency standard selected may affect the net national cost of meeting the emissions cap. For example, such a situation could arise from the need to meet progress requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In such a case, adoption of a less stringent efficiency standard could trigger adjustments in the State Implementation Plan to impose additional controls on other sources to compensate for higher emissions from electricity generation or fuel combustion. If a more stringent appliance standard were adopted, States might avoid the imposition of additional controls on other parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department seeks comments on whether and how the net change in environmental control costs attributable to variation across alternative appliance standards should be included as an external effect. In this regard, DOE notes that the effect on control costs of lower energy demand resulting from a more stringent appliance standard will vary according to the structure of pre-existing regulatory programs. In the case of sulfur dioxide, for example, control obligations of each emission source will remain fixed, but total compliance costs will fall. In the case of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and of VOCs, however, lower energy demand could reduce the extent to which State Implementation Plans must ratchet down control requirements or expand the set of sources subject to emissions controls. The Department solicits comment as to whether it is appropriate to differentiate these two situations, and how to calculate appropriate values of net external cost savings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is worth noting that a binding national emissions cap may become non-binding over time, for example, through technology improvements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Case 3: The pollutant is subject to regional emission caps and changes in the efficiency standard selected will change emission levels in some areas of the country, but not others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For situations that fall into this category, DOE would propose to use a combination of the previous two cases for computing external effects. Comments on how to combine these two approaches would be particularly helpful. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issue 5: The use of cost information to provide a basis for determining society's willingness-to-pay for emissions reduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the preferred method for computing damages from a change in emissions is to rely on direct information from damage-based studies. When damage-based studies are not available, however, the Department will consider using control cost information to develop indirect estimates of externality values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that existing environmental programs may embody an extremely wide range of marginal costs for emission reductions for the same pollutant. Costs within existing programs may vary by an order of magnitude or more across regions, and even across sources in a given region. For example, some areas have failed to implement advanced inspection and maintenance programs costing $100 per ton, while choosing to implement other standards to reduce the same pollutants costing $3,000 to $10,000 per ton. One issue is whether the cost of the most expensive option adopted, the least expensive option rejected, or some other value between the two should be considered as most representative of revealed societal willingness-to-pay for an emissions reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

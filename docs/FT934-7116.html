			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Jurys Hotel rises 30% and calls for IPounds 7.6m JURYS HOTEL Group, the Irish-based hotel operator, yesterday announced a 30 per cent increase in interim profits and a IPounds 7.59m (Pounds 7.25m) rights issue to fund expansion plans. The rights issue of 7.58m new ordinary shares is on a seven-for-two basis at 105p per share. Mr Walter Beatty, chairman, said all proceeds would be used to cut borrowings thus enabling Jurys to finance continued growth, both internally and by acquisitions. Following the purchase of the Jurys Kensington Hotel, which was funded by debt, Jurys gearing now stands at 38 per cent. After the rights issue, this will be reduced to 24 per cent. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 grew from IPounds 2.16m to IPounds 2.8m (Pounds 2.67m). Turnover rose 21 per cent to IPounds 17.6m and earnings per share came to 10.1p (7.6p). The interim dividend has been held at 2p. Mr Beatty said group business strengthened as the summer months progressed and was aided considerably by the trading of the new inns, in Christchurch and Galway, which was at the upper end of expectations.</p>

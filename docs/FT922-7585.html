			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Plans for a better world could cost Dollars 75bn a year THE crunch in the World Bank's report is over the cost of its proposals. The total sum needed to finance work on water and sanitation, electric power, road transport, emissions, agriculture, population and female education could reach Dollars 75bn (Pounds 42.3bn) a year by 2000. This would be over and above investments which are already being made, and would amount to 1.4 per cent of the GNP of developing countries. But the report is quick to point out that these additional investments should pay off because countries with good economic policies grow twice as fast as those without. Much of the money will have to come from the developing countries themselves. But more must come through an open international trade system, and adequate access to the international capital market. A further source will be official aid from the developed nations. The World Bank tries not to be daunted by the task ahead. Despite what the doomsayers predict, poverty could be eliminated in the next generation, the world's water-based problems could be solved and food production raised without harming the environment. But it will all depend on rising incomes, investment, education and increased employment.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Plan for 'green' audits BRITISH AIRWAYS and Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian manufacturing group, are to conduct annual environmental audits to assess the ecological impact of their business activities. Norsk Hydro's plans, among the first announced in the UK, involve adding an environmental statement to the annual accounts of its UK subsidiary, starting from the current financial year. The energy, metals and chemicals group, which is Norway's largest quoted company, is also considering repeating an environmental assessment of its UK activities which it produced in October 1990 and which was audited by Lloyd's register, a consultancy firm. The developments follow a detailed report on the parent company's environmental impact published in Norway three years ago. British Airways is drafting the first of what it hopes will become an annual environmental report to accompany the annual accounts, which will be published this summer. It will contain a numerical assessment of the business under six headings: noise, emissions, congestion, waste, tourism and staff involvement in the community. The work will build on an environmental review produced by the company last year, which examined the impact of its activities at Heathrow Airport, including trends in aircraft noise exposure, fuel consumption and emissions.</p>

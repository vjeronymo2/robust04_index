			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Likud to pick new leader by year-end ISRAEL'S Likud party, reeling from its election defeat by Labour last week, announced yesterday it would choose a new leader by the end of the year to succeed Mr Yitzhak Shamir, who has already said he will stand down. President Chaim Herzog is due later this week to call on Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Labour leader, to form a new government. Mr Rabin says this could be in place by mid-July and will be committed to speedy progress in Middle East peace talks. The Likud, in government for 15 consecutive years, is resigned to a spell in opposition during which it will attempt to renew its electoral appeal. As a first step, Likud ministers yesterday decided to hold a ballot of its 100,000 members by the end of the year to elect a new leader. The main prospective contenders are Mr Binyamin Begin, son of the late Menachem Begin, Likud's first prime minister, Mr David Levy, the outgoing foreign minister, Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister, and Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's spokesman at the Middle East peace talks. The party, its morale in tatters after losing one fifth of its parliamentary strength, will also hold its first full party convention since 1985, when bitter internal arguments over its defeat and future policy will be aired. None of the leadership contenders has yet suggested any shift away from the Likud's hardline policy of holding on to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, although several leaders have acknowledged that the public spurned this. In an interview, Mr Shamir said he realised a majority of Israelis rejected the policy, but he hoped they would come to accept it. With startling honesty, he confirmed suspicions that he was never seriously committed to the peace talks, an attitude which contributed to his defeat. Mr Shamir said he had intended spinning out negotiations on the first stage of Palestinian self-rule 'for 10 years' while he filled the occupied territories with Jewish settlers. 'Moderation can only be tactical and not the goal,' he said. Mr Rabin's hope of wrapping up in two weeks negotiations with the small parties that Labour needs for a majority coalition may be possible as many of these parties are eager not to be left in opposition. As well as Meretz, an alliance of pro-peace groups which is a natural Labour partner, two ultra-orthodox religious parties have signalled their willingness to join Labour. Tzomet, an extreme right-wing party, also says it may be prepared to swallow its ideology for the sake of seats in government - as has the National Religious party, which is close to the Likud. Reuter adds from Jerusalem: The US Congress has sent a team of investigators to Israel to probe the troubled Arrow anti-missile project. The visit has fuelled speculation that the Arrow, a favourite scheme of outgoing Defence Minister Moshe Arens and designed to be part of the US Strategic Defence Initiative, may be axed. The missile failed in its three main prototype tests.</p>

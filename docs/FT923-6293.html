			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pollution threat to US smelters ONLY TWO US smelters would be able to meet tighter pollution regulations proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, according to a study by the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy organisation. It also concludes that 'some base metals producers, particularly in North America and Europe, simply will not survive the sort of tightening of environmental laws that is being proposed and the tough legislation that is being enacted'. The study suggests that in Chile smelters face bills totalling about Dollars 900m if they are to meet the government's new regulations to limit sulphur dioxide emissions. It says France's tough Plan National pour l'Environment also proposes huge reductions of sulphur dioxide emissions by the year 2000. 'In Germany, unless former East German base metal plants and mines come into compliance with West German environmental laws by October this year, they will have to close down,' says Mr Simon Hobson, an executive director of MMRS and one of the authors of the study. He says there are eight pieces of European Community legislation concerning the environment and metals production that are either at the discussion or implementation stage. Tightening environmental standards have already forced closures: MMRS points to among other examples the shut-down of Billiton's secondary (scrap) lead smelter (35,000 tonnes a year) at Arnhem in the Netherlands while in Spain Metaleurop's Cartagena primary lead smelter (85,000 tonnes) and Ercosa's secondary copper smelter (30,000 tonnes) have closed. MMRS suggests that the US mining and metals industry is under the most intense pressure because of the resources available to environmental groups. The top ten environmental organisations there, headed by the Nature Conservancy, have 8m members and a combined annual budget of more than Dollars 253m. Another eight US environmental groups have an additional membership of about 6.5m and collect annual dues of over Dollars 110m. The study shows that the US Environmental Protection Agency, under the terms of a new Clean Air Act, is pressing for permitted emissions of sulphur dioxide from smelters to be reduced by more than three quarters to only 0.75 parts per million (ppm) monitored over five-minute intervals. It says only RTZ Corporation's proposed new copper smelter at its Kennecott subsidiary's Bingham Canyon mine and Cyprus Minerals new furnace at Miami, Arizona, based on the Australian Isasmelt process, could meet such stringent standards. 'It is an example of a proposed law which does not take account of standards base metals producers can reasonably meet but is designed to combat what the EPA and pressure groups believe may be public health risks,' says Mr Hobson. The American Mining Congress, which represents the US mining industry, is fighting this legislation. In the US there are 14 pieces of environmental law, regulations and guidelines which are to be changed very shortly, some very radically, says MMRS.

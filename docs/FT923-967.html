			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The Property Market: Double whammy for Hatfield - Vanessa Houlder reports on a town feeling the full force of recession BAe's announcement this week that it is to close its historic plant at Hatfield in south-east England with the loss of some 2,300 jobs is the second recession-induced blow to have hit the town within the past fortnight. The Hatfield Galleria, which went into receivership with debts of Pounds 175m, is the other casualty and it could hardly be more conspicuous: some 40m motorists a year drive past the hangar-like steel and glass structure that straddles the A1 dual carriageway. From the day it opened in September last year, the centre has drawn attention to itself with fanfares of marketing hyperbole. 'An opulent, relaxed, spacious and dazzling shopping centre modelled on the most prestigious malls in the US,' it boasted. There are no shortage of factors that finally forced the centre's downfall. The overriding problems, according to Mr Scott Barnes of Grant Thornton, the receiver, were two-fold: cost overruns and the harsh economic climate which cut rental income; this latter factor was particularly severe since rents were linked to turnover. Equally, the collapse of the project can be blamed on fundamental flaws in its conception and its controversial planning history. The story of the Galleria began in the early-1980s when the local Welwyn Hatfield Council agreed in principle to build a shopping centre on land on top of the tunnel over the new A1 dual carriageway at Hatfield. The council tried to allay the fears of local developers and retailers by emphasising that the new centre would be a 'speciality leisure centre', which would be obliged to exclude fashion, convenience, food and variety shops. Critics argued that such a scheme would not be viable. 'We felt the scheme would never work,' said Mr Roger Carey, development director of Slough Estates, which built a rival shopping centre in nearby Welwyn Garden City. But the Hatfield scheme was given planning consent in 1986 by Mr Kenneth Baker, then secretary of state for the environment, who overruled the decision of a public inquiry. By then, retail fashions had changed and the developers decided to upgrade the centre from a 'covered street' to a shopping mall. At the same time, the developers concluded that the centre needed more flexibility in its choice of tenants. After some behind-the-scene dealings by the council - later described by a High Court judge as an 'abuse of power' - restrictions on the choice of tenants was relaxed. Slough Estates is set to sue the council for damages on the grounds that it would not have gone ahead with its project in Welwyn had it known that the Galleria would ultimately seek similar retailers to its own project. But even if the Galleria took business away from neighbouring town centres it was not a success in its own right. Property consultants attribute the Galleria's problems to the lack of an 'anchor' tenant and its relatively small size, which limited its appeal to shoppers outside its vicinity. The Galleria tried to make a virtue out of its lack of well-known high street names and its emphasis on boutiques, restaurants, cinema and a health club. This concept of 'fun shopping' lost its appeal in the depths of recession. In any case, it is still unclear whether the Galleria's catchment area is affluent enough to support such a 'theme' centre. The Carroll Foundation, a private diversified industrial group which developed the Galleria and is considering a rescue, rejects this criticism. It points out that when the centre opened 85 per cent of its 380,000 square feet was let. Furthermore, some shops and restaurants report brisk trade. Instead, Carroll attributes the Galleria's financial problems to 'a combination of a Pounds 60m cost overrun in the initial Pounds 90m construction budget, an 18-month delay in the original 21-month building timetable and the failure to complete the complex to its original specifications.' Carroll has issued writs totalling more than Pounds 50m against several parties, including Aukett Group, the architect. Aukett says that teething problems are only to be expected for a development of this size. 'We will defend ourselves vigorously,' says Mr Gerry Deighton, Aukett's chairman. 'We are not aware we have done anything other than we should have.' Whatever the reasons for the cost overuns, the centre's finances have become unsustainable. Its debts cannot be serviced by its income. A year ago, the developers predicted income of about Pounds 10m for 1992. But the receiver is upbeat about the project's prospects once it is able to support a smaller debt burden. 'The Galleria now faces a rosier and more secure future,' Grant Thornton said last week, announcing the receivership. Even last week, its comments seemed optimistic. The announcement of more than 2,000 jobs losses at BAe's Hatfield plant will put that optimism to the test.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S. J. DIAMOND: ENVIRONMENT DEMANDS LIFESTYLE CHANGES  </P> <P> Nothing like an environmental issue to bring out vigilantes. People want free  choice but, having made their own, want everyone else to choose likewise.  </P> <P> The choices aren't always easy. A recent column on disposable diapers, for  example, reported on the downsides of both disposable and washable diapers.  Disposables first use up raw material (trees) and finally, space in our  landfills. Washable cotton diapers use up water and energy in manufacture and  use and cause more water and air pollution. "Both generate costs and  environmental impacts," says Allen Hershkowitz, senior scientist at the Natural  Resources Defense Council.  </P> <P> Neither choice is clearly superior, except to those who have chosen sides. The  clear choice is theirs.  </P> <P> The conviction of those in business is understandable. They want their  Cottontails and Bunnies and Tushies (I kid you not) out there with Huggies and  Luvs and Pampers, entering the competition with compostable degradable insides,  disposable insides and washable outsides, 40% less plastic, 60% cotton and no  detectable dioxin.  </P> <P> Many environmental activists and their consumer supporters have even stronger  convictions. Most support washables, speaking for the trees and the landfill.  They reject any possible problems of energy and fuel and water, because some  diaper services use only 4 1/2 quarts of water "per child per day" and run  trucks on propane. Disposable users, they say, can easily switch.  </P> <P> Apparently not. For all the studies indicating that environmental concerns are  a priority for most Americans -- including diaper buyers -- disposables  continue to hold 85% to 90% of the market. Even ardent advocates of washables  continue to buy disposables, justifying the seeming contradiction because their  child has diaper rash or because they only use disposables "away from home."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, they can be unusually self-righteous, even bellicose, toward  anyone who chooses "plastic" over its "natural fiber" alternative. Of all the  activists he meets, only washable diaper advocates get personal, says  Hershkowitz, demanding that he reveal and defend what he puts on his own  children.  </P> <P> Like many products, diapers present further, less obvious environmental  considerations as well. Those wanting only washables on the market must deal  with the use of pesticides in growing cotton and with the fact that washables  are a worse problem in areas of severe drought. Those pushing biodegradable  plastics must consider that nothing degrades in a dense and airless landfill;  those pushing compostable plastics must admit that very few areas of the  country do any composting.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult to make appropriate and moral decisions," says Jeffrey  Rayport, an environmental management specialist at Harvard Business School,  "because there are few answers independent of your local infrastructure."  </P> <P> It's difficult even for experts. When McDonald's, under pressure from the  Environmental Defense Fund, announced that it would switch from polystyrene to  paper boxes, everyone immediately applauded, assuming, says Rayport, that  "paper is better because we know what a tree is, and that plastic is bad."  </P> <P> But studies indicate that polystyrene packaging is better. Such plastics can  lighten the weight of packaging, consume less energy in production and be  incinerated and/or recycled better than paperboard -- a premise McDonald's was  about to start testing with a new recycling program.  </P> <P> To add a further perspective: The particular material is less the problem, says  Rayport, than "the packaging intensity." Given all the fast food Americans  consume, it should be possible to "buy so we don't use so much packaging." Why  use any for the 40% of McDonald's orders that are eaten in the restaurant?  </P> <P> Similarly, the environmental problem behind diapers is the total amount of  solid waste we generate (agricultural, industrial, mining, etc.), not just the  16 billion disposable diapers that constitute almost 2% of municipal waste --  itself only 2% of the total, says Hershkowitz. Why argue endlessly -- and  people do -- whether that's relatively much or relatively little, while  ignoring everything else?  </P> <P> The overriding problem is consumption, an economy built on, now overwhelmed by  goods, packaging, unnecessary things. Unfortunately, they've become necessary:  A ban on disposable diapers could cut more jobs than the preservation of the  spotted owl.  </P> <P> Environmental decisions must take into account all possible effects and  trade-offs, but who is capable of such an unbiased, cosmic view? Government  could play more of a role, says Rayport, "disseminating technical and  scientific information. Government also has to figure out what we should do,  not just now but years years hence." But government agencies work piecemeal,  and legislators are primarily political.  </P> <P> Industry is even more suspect, and environmental organizations as well, each  business having a bias tied to its fortunes. Indeed, environmental advocates  automatically reject industry-sponsored studies, and vice versa.  </P> <P> As the diaper question demonstrates, significant change requires consensus on  both problems and solutions. It also requires not just little changes in  materials, but what Rayport calls "quantum leaps" into doing things  differently.  </P></p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Observer: Silvio lining Yet another plaudit comes the way of Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister and media magnate. He has just been voted 'International Marketing Superstar' - one of 44 such individuals - by US trade mag Advertising Age International. Berlusconi joins this elect band thanks to his using 'everything he knew about television, advertising and public relations to create the charismatic image that propelled him into office'. Marketing gimmicks are going to come in very useful over the next few months. His latest message to the nation - 'sacrifices will be necessary' if Italy is to avoid 'bankruptcy' - will certainly take all his creative selling powers. Of course all the best salesmen sugar the pill somehow; wonder what he will come up with?</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Lines of defence keep falling: Peter Norman examines the latest troubles afflicting the franc in the crisis-prone ERM Crisis tends to be an overworked word in the European Monetary System. But there is little doubt that the past week's turmoil, centred on a flight from the French franc in Europe's semi-fixed exchange rate system, has richly deserved the description. Massive central bank intervention on Thursday - estimated at up to DM15bn (Pounds 5.8bn) on the part of the Bundesbank alone - failed to give the franc more than fleeting support in the European exchange rate mechanism. By yesterday, the German and French authorities had resorted to their second line of defence to keep the franc from falling to its Ffr3.4305 floor against the D-mark. They produced a joint statement of support for the franc's current EMS parity while the Bank of France pushed up its 24-hour lending rate to 10 per cent from 7.75 per cent. After a morning of more turmoil - made all the more confusing by the backwash of the political crisis in Britain and signs of new trade tensions between the US and Japan - it was difficult yesterday to find anybody willing to say that the franc was out of the woods. Europe's latest monetary troubles have shown the ERM at its worst. France is in recession. As the graph shows, it is suffering from sharply rising unemployment. Its inflation rate is low, with figures yesterday showing a 0.1 per cent drop in consumer prices in June and a year-on-year increase of only 1.9 per cent. And yet the French authorities have been forced to push their interest rates decisively above German levels when the nation needs lower rates to cut unemployment. Germany is also in recession. But unlike France it has an inflation problem. Its money supply, up an annual 7.1 per cent in June, is growing faster than the Bundesbank's 4.6 to 6.5 per cent target range. Regional cost of living figures for July, due soon, are expected to show year-on-year inflation accelerating from June's 4.2 per cent rate. And yet the Bundesbank is coming under growing pressure from financial markets to cut its key discount rate from 6.75 per cent by half or even a full percentage point. The ERM's latest problems have not been confined to the French and German currencies. The Danish krone has been subject to speculative pressures similar to those suffered by the French franc, with the Danish authorities forced to raise rates in its defence. Yesterday Belgium also tightened credit conditions, with the Belgian national bank pushing its central rate up to 7.15 per cent from 6.7 per cent and its emergency lending rate to 10 per cent from 8.5 per cent. Outside the ERM's 'hard core', both the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo tumbled precipitately on Thursday as rumours of an early ERM realignment swept the foreign exchange markets. The crisis-prone nature of the ERM stands in marked contrast to its orginal goal of creating 'a zone of monetary stability in Europe' when it was launched in March 1979. Its present instability is causing a tightening of monetary conditions in countries that are struggling either with slow growth or recession. Since last September, when it was wracked by the crisis that culminated in the departure of the British pound and Italian lira from the system, the ERM has increasingly become an engine of speculation. The disappearance of exchange controls in Europe and the ever-growing interaction between the markets for foreign exchange, money, bonds and their derivative products have given astute operators scope to move funds on a massive scale from one market to another. They can speculate in the hope of large gains from an ERM realignment or collapse of the system at the risk of comparatively small losses. Central bank reserves offer only limited protection against such forces and can be swiftly depleted. For example, in the week to July 15 when speculation against the franc was modest compared with week, the Bank of France's official net reserves fell Ffr17.81bn or more than 10 per cent to an estimated Ffr137.16bn. Some observers believe that the latest crisis facing the ERM could be bigger than that of January and February, when the franc faced and withstood speculative attack, and even the generalised ERM crisis of last September. According to Mr Paul Chertkow, the London-based chief currency strategist of UBS, the Swiss banking group, it is ominous that the speculative pressure in the system has grown without any political event, such as last September's French referendum on Maastricht, acting as a catalyst. The pressure on the ERM may yet grow in intensity because some of the big players of last September have yet to join the fray. Although there were reports late this week that conservative pension funds were pulling out of the French bond market and moving into German government paper, there has been no sign yet of a decisive attack on the weak ERM currencies by the New York-based hedge funds, which last autumn toppled sterling. At the same time, however, France's ability to withstand speculative selling of the franc through higher interest rates has declined. In earlier crises, France's banking system could protect clients from the worst effects of the higher interest rates. It is thought that this is less true today, after recession and a depressed property market have cut into the banks' capital. So far, the consensus in France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium has been strongly in favour of the EMS. But business people on the continent are becoming aware that there is an alternative. Britain's recovery since leaving the ERM was highlighted yesterday by gross domestic product figures showing growth of 0.5 per cent between the first and second quarters of this year. Over the past fortnight, the UK has reported the strongest monthly increase in manufacturing output for four years, a fifth successive monthly fall in unemployment, robust retail sales growth and the fastest growth in manufacturing productivity in more than six years. Inflation in the UK has remained subdued. Indeed, despite devaluation, unit wage costs in UK manufacturing have just recorded their largest fall since records began in 1970 and are falling faster than in any other member of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. While economic logic might point increasingly in the direction of a departure of the franc from the ERM, political considerations point the other way. Mr Edouard Balladur, has threatened to resign if the franc is devalued. The franc fort remains crucial to the government's policy of binding Germany into a more integrated Europe and pressing ahead towards the the Maastricht treaty goals of economic and monetary union. And there is, indeed, a rosy scenario in which the foreign exchange market travails of the past weeks would quickly be forgotten. If the Bundesbank can be persuaded to ease its credit policy, France and the other embattled ERM members should be able to lower their rates and return to growth, building on their success in reducing inflation. In some respects the scenario is not so far fetched. Figures this week showed that French manufacturing output rose 0.2 per cent in May while Insee, France's official statistics organisation, has forecast stable GDP in the third quarter and a small gain towards the end of the year. However, the Bundesbank seems unlikely to oblige with a rate cut soon enough. Its decision-making central council meets for the last time before its summer break next Thursday. Yesterday, Mr Reimut Jochimsen, one of Germany's regional central bankers who is also a council member, said a cut in German interest rates was 'not on the cards' because of high inflation and excessive government borrowing. Analysts agree that financial markets will keep the ERM under strain in the absence of a German rate cut. The longer the pressure keeps up, the more likely the system is to buckle. The traditional response to such acute crisis in the ERM has been realignment of currency parities. But political conditions in France make this especially difficult. Restoring exchange controls is a theoretical possibility but is extremely unlikely because of practical problems and the huge damage that it would inflict on the EC's internal market. On Thursday, rumours swept the market that the EC would decide wider fluctuation margins than the current 2.25 per cent either side of bilateral central rates for the D-mark, French franc, Danish krone, Dutch guilder, Belgian franc and Irish punt. They could be widened to the 6 per cent margins used by the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo or further. But such a move would represent a profound setback for the system and might prove no more than a short-term palliative if the weak currencies were pushed quickly to their new limits. If pressure intensifies, market analysts in London believe that there may be no alternative but to suspend the system until economic conditions in France and Germany come more into line. Such an action would be drastic and there is no sign of politicial support for such an idea on either side of the Rhine. But the EMS since German union at the end of the 1980s has been hallmarked by the failure of the system's political masters to react in time to events. Developments this week suggest that, in this respect, nothing has changed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Federal Police have seized 7 tonnes of  cocaine hidden inside tobacco boxes in Tocantins State. This is  the largest drug seizure ever made in Brazil. The operation  began yesterday at a farm in the municipality of Guarai in  Tocantins State.    The Federal Police have been closely watching this area in  Tocantins State, where the drug traffickers own a 750 hectare  farm whose sole purpose, according to police, is to receive  drugs.    The trucks loaded with cocaine were intercepted near the  Belem-Brasilia highway. They had been planning to travel  directly to the port of Santos [Sao Paulo State], where the  drugs were to be shipped to the United States.    The police are surprised at the organizational level of the  drug traffickers. The drugs were hidden inside tobacco bundles  purchased in Rio Grande do Sul, and brought here through  operations carried out by ghost firms. After weighing the drugs  the police confirmed a surprising 7 tonnes of cocaine. [passage  omitted]    According to the police agents who commanded this operation,  the cocaine was brought into Brazil by Colombian drug  traffickers, to some as yet unidentified point in Rondonia  State. From there, it was flown in small Brazilian airplanes to  their probable refueling base in the city of Alta Floresta in  Mato Grosso State, from where the cocaine was flown to the farm  in Guarai, Tocantins and unloaded.    Following a shootout at the farm, the police arrested seven  drug traffickers. The leader, a Lebanese who had become a  naturalized Brazilian citizen, Nasrat Jamil Hazul, is a  businessman from Foz do Iguacu and Paraguay. According to the  police, the drug traffickers expected to earn a lot of money  because they spent nearly $1 million bringing the drugs from  Colombia. [passage omitted]    In making a final control of the weight of the drugs, the  police found an additional half tonne of cocaine. This means  that the police seized 7.5 tonnes of cocaine. The police found  and arrested three other drug traffickers. The gang members  confessed that last year they sent 2 tonnes of cocaine abroad  using this same route.    The police arrested two men that were in charge of the  bureaucratic procedures of the drug trafficking gang. All the  documents that the gang needed were forged on the fifth floor of  this building downtown in Sao Paulo. Today here, the Federal  Police arrested forwarding agent Sergio Ricardo de Souza, who  already had a police record for forging documents. The police  likewise arrested business administrator Jacques Juarez  Minicozky. Souza was in charge of forging the lading bills,  while Minicozky had found a way to have them legalized. This  bill of lading, for example, was made in December of last year,  probably to cover another cocaine shipment. It was made in the  name of the In-Out Comercial Exportadora Lta., a ghost company  created by the two men.    The police also confiscated several seals and documents,  including this passport which was to be used by the man  responsible for receiving the drugs in the United States.  Minicozky told the police he would receive $10,000 for forging  the bill of lading and for looking after the bureaucratic  proceedings for shipping the containers. Minicozky and Souza  are under arrest for using false documents, and a Tocantins  judge has asked for their temporary imprisonment.</p>

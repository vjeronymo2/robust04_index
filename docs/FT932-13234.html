			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Vote-rigging denied THE organisers of tomorrow's federation-wide Russian refenrdum yesterday hit back at allegations that the ballot was likely to be rigged. Speaking at the referendum headquarters in Moscow, Mr Vasily Kazakov, the beleaguered chairman of the referendum committee, insisted that the organising team was politically neutral and that they would try to ensure that voting was carried out according to 'legal means'. But with both the supporters and opponents of Russian president Boris Yeltsin accusing the other of skullduggery, his words did little to defuse the controversy that now surrounds tomorrow's vote. This week the Russian parliament accused Mr Yeltsin of issuing sackfuls of fixed ballot papers to polling stations. Mr Yeltsin's supporters, for their part, yesterday claimed that pro-Yeltsin groups were being intimidated in the many rural regions which are hostile to Mr Yeltsin. Speaking in Moscow, representatives from the pro-Russian 'Democratic Russia' movement said that they would set up a legal 'first aid' telephone service to report cases of fraud. 'There is a great likelihood of falsification,' said Mr Dmitri Katayev of Democratic Russia, who claimed that although Moscow had now enlisted 7,000 observers, many rural regions were still critically short of observers to oversee the vote. With more than 100m voters registered and 96,766 polling stations, the monumental logistics of the vote mean that guarding against fraud, irrespective of political interference, will be, at best, an uncertain task. Since the voting centres lack computers, the ballot papers will be counted by hand, before the results are sent by telegram to Moscow. There could in theory be 400m papers - each of the four referendum questions is printed on a separate sheet - although many eligible voters will not take part. Mr Kazakov yesterday admitted that many of the polling stations, which are scattered across nine time zones, still lacked sufficient voting papers or official placards. Although the organising committee had hoped to ease the counting process by printing the papers in different colours, the plan was dropped when they discovered there was not enough ink in the country to do this.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Nissan UK chief jailed for 8 years Michael Hunt, the managing director of Nissan UK, the former West Sussex-based car importers, was yesterday jailed for eight years for his part in Britain's largest-ever tax fraud. Mr Hunt, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court with his wife, Shirley, was convicted on Saturday of conspiring to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax by helping artificially to inflate freight charges for Nissan cars imported to the UK from Japan.  Sentencing him, the judge said the offence was 'in a category of its own'. Report, Page 7</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japan's long-term credit banks hit by securities losses JAPAN'S three long-term credit banks yesterday reported a halving of their pre-tax profits for the first half, but relatively modest provisions for loan losses in spite of heavy exposure to collapsed developers and speculators. Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ) reported a 48.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y35.5bn (Dollars 286m) while Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) was 57.8 per cent lower at Y23bn, and Nippon Credit Bank (NCB) was down 48.3 per cent to Y22.5bn. Like the country's leading commercial banks, the long-term credit banks reported sharply higher profits in their core banking businesses, due to a drop in interest rates, but were forced to book large appraisal losses on securities holdings. Core profits rose 29.4 cent at IBJ, 101.5 per cent at LTCB and 109.1 per cent at NCB. Securities valuation losses, a result of the troubles on the Tokyo stock market, totalled Y53.9bn at IBJ, Y41.1bn at LTCB, and Y23.8bn at NCB. The non-performing loan problem is most serious at NCB, which has been forced to seek assistance from other banks for the restructuring of three non-bank affiliates. These leasing and finance companies were large lenders to the property market and have been left with non-performing loans equivalent to about 20 per cent of outstanding loans. NCB increased its loan-loss reserve by Y13.6bn to Y48.5bn - equivalent to about 0.9 per cent of total loans or a write-off of 1.8 per cent on an after-tax basis. One problem for the banks is that Japanese tax laws require them to have clear proof of non-payment before a write-off is accepted. This makes it difficult to write off loans from companies which have stopped repayments but are not technically bankrupt. However, the three banks reported capital adequacy ratios well above the target of 8 per cent, as defined by the Bank for International Settlements. The strongest of the banks, IBJ, had the lowest ratio - 8.71 per cent at end-September - while LTCB was at 9.07 per cent and NCB at 9.06 per cent.</p>

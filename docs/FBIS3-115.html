Mr Buthelezi told the  media as he arrived: "The matter concerns us very deeply ... we  haven't come here solely to discuss the elections."    The IFP president refused to answer questions about his  party's threat to boycott the elections, saying his standpoint  on the issue was well known.    In anticipation of talks with the ANC president, Mr  Buthelezi  said: "I don't expect concessions from Mr Mandela and he  shouldn't expect concessions from me."    Later he said the meeting was important "by virtue of the  fact of our constituencies". "Both of us love our country and  both of us have struggled for it in different ways."    Mr Buthelezi said their supporters should benefit by the  culmination of their struggle.</p>

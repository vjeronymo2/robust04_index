			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hardy Oil welcomes PRT transitional relief HARDY OIL &amp; Gas, the North Sea oil explorer, showed the effects of the government's proposed changes to petroleum revenue taxes yesterday when it recommended a flat dividend in spite of a jump in profits. But Mr Peter Elwes, Hardy's managing director, welcomed the government's offer of transitional aid to help smaller companies to cushion them from the immediate effects of the tax changes. 'This is very significant for us and I'm feeling very happy about it,' Mr Elwes said. Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 were Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 3.07m) on turnover of Pounds 50.7m (Pounds 41m). Earnings per share were 11.3p (8.3p) and an unchanged dividend of 1p is proposed. There were petroleum revenue tax credits of Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 4.4m), pushing up retained profits to Pounds 9.28m (Pounds 6.33m). The profit rise came from a rise in volumes of oil and gas produced which rose by 8 per cent. Gas production in the US more than doubled and there were exploration successes in the US, Canada and Australia. Production is expected to be by 20 per cent up this year.</p>

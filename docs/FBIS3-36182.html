			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Aleksandr Ostrovskiy and Oleg Nikiforov; </F> from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] It is the third day of the visit by  Lieutenant-General Henning von Ondarza, commander in chief of  NATO Allied Forces Central Europe, to the central European  sector.    The general has already had a meeting with the chief of the  Russian Federation General Staff, the commander in chief of the  land forces, and the command of the Moscow military district and  paid a visit to the Kantemir Tank Division.    Henning von Ondarza was more interested in the soldiers'  welfare and their attitude to the service as well as in the  principles underpinning manpower acquisition for subunits than  in their combat proficiency or modern equipment.    The general emphasized that armed forces organizational  development in Russia and Germany, which are land-based powers,  is different from that in the United States and the main thing  is that universal military service obligation should be retained  in Russia and Germany alike, so that armies do not become closed  societies and so that high mobilization reserves are preserved.    [Begin Von Ondarza, recording in German fading to Russian  translation] The fact that each person is doing something useful  for their country is the decisive factor in favor of military  service obligation.

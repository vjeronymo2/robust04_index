			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Daewoo may acquire stake in Bulgarian bank Daewoo, South Korea's fourth-largest business group, is considering acquiring a 49 per cent stake in Parva Chastna Banka, a Bulgarian bank. 'The proposed deal is part of Daewoo's strategy of helping finance South Korean investment in eastern Europe by acquiring interests in local financial institutions,' Daewoo said. It has already bought a stake in a Hungarian bank and securities firm. Daewoo has indicated it is interested in investing in Bulgarian hotels, cement plants and telecommunications. But the company added that the proposed Bulgarian bank acquisition 'will take some time to be completed'. It is waiting for an asset valuation of the bank to determine a price for its share. The deal must also be approved by the bank's shareholders.</p>

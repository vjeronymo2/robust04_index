			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Syndicated Loans: Scandinavian deals dominate activity SCANDINAVIAN borrowers dominated the syndicated loans market last week with a flood of deals intended to refinance short-term debt and provide medium-term financing. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken - the largest commercial bank in Sweden, and the bank affiliated to the Wallenberg family - last week launched a SKr9bn acquisition finance facility for Patricia, the Wallenberg family's fund-raising arm. The facility will be used specifically to help finance the acquisition of shares in Saab-Scania, the motor and aerospace group. Investor and Providentia, the two Swedish investment companies controlled by the Wallenberg family which jointly own Patricia, made a SKr12.8bn takeover bid for outstanding shares in Saab-Scania in February. SEB Capital Markets is agent and arranger for the facility, which is being placed with a group of key relationship banks, both international and domestic. These are thought to include J. P. Morgan, Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover, NatWest, Credit Lyonnais, Deutsche Bank and Swiss Bank Corporation among others, although no commitments are in place yet. The deal has an interesting structure because the loan will be available in tranches of different maturities - namely nine months, two years and five years. The pricing ranges from 85 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) to over 100 basis points. The facility will be guaranteed by Investor and Providentia and follows a three-year, Dollars 1.1bn acquisition finance facility for Patricia arranged by SEB earlier this year. Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit-rating service, said last week that Patricia's A-1 commercial paper rating would be upheld. The rating had been placed on CreditWatch in February following the SKr12.8bn takeover bid for Saab-Scania. Separately, SEB Capital Markets launched a Dollars 250m five-year facility last week for Trelleborg, the Swedish mining and industrial conglomerate. The facility consists of a Dollars 200m term loan and Dollars 50m revolving credit facility. Bankers consider the pricing - of 50 basis points over Libor for the first three years, and 55 basis points over Libor thereafter - generous. The Dollars 1.36bn syndicated loan arranged for Stora, the Swedish pulp and paper group, by SEB Capital Markets was signed last week. The five-year revolving credit and term loan facility was oversubscribed, raising Dollars 1.7bn, so the 22 participating banks have had their contributions scaled back accordingly. The loan is intended to refinance Stora's short-term debt, mainly stemming from the acquisition last year of Feldmuhle Nobel, the German forestry and engineering group. Manufacturers Hanover launched a three-year Dollars 60m syndicated revolving credit facility for Ratos, the Swedish investment company which has big shareholdings in companies such as Esselte, Asea, Stora and Industrivarden. Ratos plans to expand its international activities and is using the facility as a back-up for its Eurocommercial paper programme. The interest margin is 55 basis points over Libor, but fees are not being disclosed. Manufacturers Hanover and Den Norske Bank are joint arrangers for a Dollars 60m secured five-year loan for Helikopter Service, the Norwegian group which is Europe's second largest commercial helicopter service and flies workers to North Sea oil platforms. The loan, in limited syndication, will help finance the purchase of helicopters as well as the refinancing of two existing facilities.  -------------------------------------------------------------------        EUROMARKET TURNOVER (M DOLLARS)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Primary Market                  Straights   Conv    FRN   Other US dollars       1,274.2     0.0     0.0   10,890.8 Prev               812.1   249.1    85.0   15,159.3 Other            1,195.9     0.0   171.5    6,913.9 Prev             2,614.2   284.7     8.9    8,120.6 Secondary Market US dollars      18,001.9   703.8 7,172.3    8,075.5 Prev            23,033.3 1,151.4 6,714.9    9,920.8 Other           25,400.5   866.7 2,700.8   35,743.0 Prev            39,089.6 1,603.9 5,219.0   45,111.6                 Cedel     Euroclear    Total US dollars   17,120.0     28,998.5     46,118.5 Prev         19,937.5     37,188.3     57,125.8 Other        29,598.0     43,394.3     72,992.3 Prev         43,290.9     58,761.6     102,052.5 Week to   May 9, 1991  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: AIBD  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

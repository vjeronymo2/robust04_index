			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (8): Start at El Aeropuerto - A no-nonsense A-Z guide for the businessperson in Spain BUSINESS GUIDES, especially to Latin countries, tend to be frivolous affairs full of advice about how to mix business with pleasure. Spain, though, is a serious place so here are some utterly unfrivolous tips for the visiting or newly resident executive: Aeropuerto. Madrid's is, unfortunately, unavoidable. The most most exciting thing in it is the local chamber of commerce bookshop. Some local flights only land at the international terminal, making finding your car very tricky. Barcelona and Seville, thanks to 1992, have new aeropuertos but they are so big that from 1993 onwards will probably be three-quarters cordoned off. La Banca and Barcelona. The banks in Spain look modern but aren't. They take days (sometimes weeks) to transfer your money, charge you for cashing cheques if the branch isn't yours (even if it's the same bank) and will almost never put the customer first. Avoid them if possible. As for Barcelona, it has pretty buildings and prickly people - and is losing out in business importance to Madrid. Conductores y la corrupcion. That is drivers and corruption to you. Watch out for both. Spaniards kill themselves at an amazing rate in cars and then blame the Government for building bad roads. Actually, they just drive like hooligans. Flying is safer and Iberia is a terrific airline. Corruption is serious although the central administration is probably straight. Locally, it gets bad. Discotecas y la droga. Discos and drugs. Possession of any drug is legal. If you have children, they'll be seeing a lot of both. Also, Spaniards love noise and love discos. Most discos have children's hours, when 12 year olds can get their noise fixes without getting drunk. Then they fill up with the auditors and merchant bankers in charge of your Dollars 10m investment.  Ehpana and Eppo 92. Since the country is run by Andalucians it has become fashionable to speak with a southern accent. So drop your S's and X's, learn to enjoy dry sherry (manzanilla for the very deserving), cigarettes and bullfighting. Being churlish about bullfighting will make you no friends. Francia. If you represent a French state company, the Spanish authorities would like to thank you for your interest in their state owned wool/artificial limb/briefcase handle/propeller/ceramic lampshade enterprise but are very sorry. No. You own a great deal of Spain already and you make the Industry Ministry very nervous. Gonzalez, Felipe. Despite trying very hard to get himself sacked lately, Spaniards have decided to punish him for being so conservative by making him prime minister for another 10 years. Hotels. Spaniards are great waiters but all the good ones work in restaurants. The rest go to hotels. Accommodation generally average. Stars awarded for facilities, not service. Good double in the Palace or Ritz in Madrid costs about Dollars 500 a night. Inflation? Stay in the hotel you stayed in last year. Jabugo cured ham. This is what your Spanish hosts will ply you with to break down your resistance to the outrageous amount of money they want for their pickle factory. It always works. One plate of this stuff will make you want to live near a supply forever. F Gonzalez sends a monthly supply to an H Kohl in Germany. Kiosks. Nagel's encyclopaedia guide to Spain doesn't have a 'K' entry but then it isn't sold in kiosks along with your newspaper, tobacco, bus tickets and pools. Kiosks are a great idea but they're always closed when you need one. Lunch (Almuerzo): 2.30pm to 5.30pm at least. Best avoided if you've got work to do. Aperitif with snacks, wine, starter, wine, main course, 'more wine?', sweets, coffee, liquors. All laced with swirls of cigar and cigarette smoke. You leave the restaurant and reel like Dracula as the sun (surprisingly still there) blinds you and, on average, in Madrid, about Dollars 110 poorer for two. Madrid. A great place to do business if you've got a good local lawyer. Mostly very clean, well run, keen to please. Try to get your work done in the mornings. Post-lunch comprehension close to zero. Claims to be Cultural Capital of Europe this year but many museums and monuments still boarded up for renovation. Newspapers. If you read Spanish stick to El Pais and La Vanguardia (Barcelona) for good general, international and business news. Expansion for corporate news and Cinco Dias for whatever the Finance Ministry is thinking. La Gaceta sometimes surprisingly fast with business news. The rest of the nationals are axe-grinders. On most days the FT is in Madrid kiosks at 8.30am. Obsequio. Gifts. Pay close attention to this. Spanish companies give lots of these to business journalists, most of which are unfortunately too valuable to give back. Mainly wine and watches and fax machines and wine and CD players and wine. Government officials have come to expect a little more from business. Post nothing] Franco made every letter posted in Spain pass through Madrid where he could read it. Things have not changed much. The postal service is reckoned to have a running backlog of about 5m items at any one time. Use a messenger service but don't let the blighters use your phone when they arrive. That's to get the next job and it means your message just got delayed. 'Que?' (Huh? What?) is something you'll be hearing and saying a lot as you and your local business partners talk past each other. Don't bother with pardon me and all that. A straight 'What' is fine. Spaniards speak Castillian far too quickly. Latin Americans take their time, which may explain why they produce the best Spanish literature. Riqueza (wealth). It's hard to tell who has money and who doesn't in Madrid. Husbands will forego family medical insurance for a Rolex. Wives have to have a fur. But few rich Spaniards drive lousy cars. Sevilla. Expo 92 there this year so not much work is being done. Spaniards like to think they like Seville but mostly they're scared of its cliquiness. The British are acceptable because the local aristocracy likes to show off in English learned from nannies. Very hot, quite good fun but, ultimately, provincial. Theatre. There is some very good opera and traditional performance theatre in Madrid and Barcelona. One Problem: you can't go. Tickets are hard to get unless you queue at the right window for the half an hour on whatever afternoon they are on sale. Good concert seats always go to friends and family of the official body sponsoring it. A good hotel can fix most things, though. Understanding. Make sure you understand what is being said to you. This is not London or New York. It isn't even Milan. 'Yes, we must do business,' at the end of the meeting does not mean the deal is done. It means, er .. who knows what it means. Keep that lawyer close by. Vino. Totally undiscovered by the battalions of FT wine writers but thriving nonetheless, Spanish wines are as rich and rough and subtle as anyone could ever want them to be. Hardly any good ones get exported. 'W': Seven entries in my dictionary. One of them is Windsurfista (windsurfer). But Spanish is anglicising very slowly. There's faxear (to send a fax) and chequear (to check up on) and zigzaguear (to zigzag) but for the most part you have to be able to defender yourself in Eppanol. 'X': As in X-rated. Catholic Spain is one of Europe's most sexually active societies. Newspapers carry pages of 'relax' ads. Supermarket-sized peep shows popping out all over Madrid. Yanquis come back] Young Spaniards tried hard to dislike America after Franco died but have failed horribly. Even George Bush is popular here. Zimbabwe, Zambia and Zanzibar. This is the foreign policy part. Spaniards steer clear of Africa and Asia. They're scared of the food, the water, the animals and not being able to answer back perfectly when spoken to in English by the locals.</p>

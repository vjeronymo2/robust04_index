			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 300 MOURN ANTI-DRUG CRUSADER  </P> <P> An estimated 300 mourners, including Mayor Edward I. Koch, attended a funeral  Mass Saturday for slain anti-drug crusader Maria Hernandez, amid heavy security  to prevent further violence against her family.  </P> <P> Hernandez, 34, a mother of three who with her husband fought to force drug  dealers out of her Brooklyn neighborhood, was shot to death Tuesday, possibly  in retaliation for her anti-drug efforts.  </P> <P> During a 70-minute Mass conducted in Spanish and English at St. John the  Baptist Catholic Church, the Rev. Charles Plock praised the woman's efforts to  transform her neighborhood into a place where there would be "no mourning, no  tears, no fear. She labored and she struggled and she fought. She organized  people to make her community reflect this new heaven and this new Earth. Maria  gave her life because she was not afraid to speak the truth."  </P></p>

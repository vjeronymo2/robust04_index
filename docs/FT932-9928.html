			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / New law to curb money laundering A 1990 European Council convention aimed at combating money laundering will come into force on September 1 after its ratification this week by the Netherlands and Switzerland, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The treaty, signed by 16 European countries, has already been ratified by the UK and Germany. It is aimed at improving co-operation between police forces in tracing and seizing money laundered by drug dealers and other criminals. The existing European convention does not cover fully the confiscation of money earned by criminals.</p>

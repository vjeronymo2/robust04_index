			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (22): Gateway to the west - Anthony Robinson and Christopher Bobinski visit Szczecin THE end of the cold war and the decision to restore Berlin as the capital of a re-united Germany have opened up exciting long term growth prospects for Sczcecin and much of western Poland. While Berlin was the divided capital of a divided country - 'a PX surrounded by Russians,' in US comedian Bob Hope's immortal phrase - the east German government spent heavily to build up the old Hansa trading city and fishing port of Rostock as a substitute for the loss of Stettin, the German name for Berlin's traditional gateway to the sea. Large federal subsidies continue to be pumped into Rostock and the surrounding Mecklenburg province, where unemployment is up to 40 per cent in some parts. But Rostock is 200 kms from Berlin by inadequate roads and a slow railway, while Szczecin lies only 140 kms away from the restored capital, at the other end of an autobahn built during the Hitler era. More important for a city engaged in the throes of a redevelopment boom, Berlin is connected to Szczecin, and its sister port Swinoujscie on the Baltic, by a network of canals. These inland waterways date from the Bismarck era. They were built for the cheap shipment of bulk goods - grain, steel, cement - into the very heart of eastern Germany and along the valley of the River Oder. After the end of the second world war in 1945 the canals, the autobahn and the railways were under-used. This is changing. 'Of the 13m tonnes of cargo which passed through the port in 1992 over 2m tonnes was transit traffic. Of this, about 900,000 tonnes would have passed through Rostock before re-unification,' says Mr Michal Popik, general director of the recently privatised and re-organised Szczecin-Swinoujscie port authority. He has little doubt that volumes will grow further as cost effectiveness replaces political will as the leitmotiv of economic activity on both sides of the German-Polish border. Fast Shipping, a Belgian-UK-Polish joint venture, has already built a new 8,000 sq metre general cargo warehouse and 500 metre long dedicated quay. New chemical handling facilities have also been built, along with a Dollars 15m, 16,000 ton capacity cold store and Poland's first banana-ripening facility. The cold store is owned by Lodom, a Polish-American joint venture with finance from the Polish American enterprise fund. Wolf, an Austrian timber and wooden frame house building company, wants to set up a saw mill to process cheap timber from Russia. Looking further ahead, the port plans to build a large container and general cargo terminal on Grabowski island, adjacent to port facilities, and to create a free port manufacturing and transhipment area. Under the communist regime Szczecin's port, 65 kms from the open Baltic, was starved of investment, which was concentrated on the coastal port of Swinoujscie, also a Soviet naval base for over 40 years. Swinoujscie was developed as Poland's main bulk handling port, capable of unloading ships of up to 14 metres draught. Swinoujscie is also the southern base for the twice-daily car/passenger and freight ferry service across the Baltic from the Swedish port of Ystad; a five times weekly ferry service to Copenhagen; and regular sailing by Euro-africa, Polish Baltic and Fast lines to other Baltic and Scandinavian ports, Germany, the UK and Africa. The ferry terminal is leased to the Polish Baltic Shipping Company by the local municipality which, together with the shipping line and the ministry of transport, is investing 16bn zloty in a new passenger terminal scheduled for completion by 1994. Until 18 months ago Swinoujscie handled mainly coal exports, phosphates and iron ore. Now, like Szczecin, it also unloads general cargo and is considering building a coal import facility. This move angers Silesian coal miners, who fear that cheap imported coal from South Africa and elsewhere might replace expensively rail-freighted Silesian coal in the city's Dolna Odra power station. Together, the twin ports of Swinoujscie and Szczecin are running at less than under 60 per cent of their 22/24m tonne handling capacity, mainly because of a decline in coal exports. But specialised wharves owned by individual companies handle a further 7m tonnes, bringing total throughput to about 20m tonnes. All expect to benefit strongly from the eventual recovery of the east German economy and rapid economic growth in Poland's western provinces. What has changed most in the last three years is the nature of the Oder-Neisse line. The border formed by these two rivers divided post-war Poland from East Germany for over 40 years. It is now the frontier between a democratic Poland which aspires to full EC membership, and a re-united but somewhat traumatised Germany. It was partly to preserve the increasingly porous nature of this border for Polish-German trade that Poland agreed to co-operate with the drafters of Germany's new asylum laws which depend largely on tighter surveillance of illegal immigrants from the former Soviet Union and the Balkan countries on Poland's eastern and southern borders. Already, new supermarkets and stores have opened up on the Polish side of the border to attract German customers. and Radisson, the US hotel chain, has taken management control of a new Dollars 150m luxury hotel, business and shopping centre, which is designed to attract business to the city. For close observers on both sides, such as like Mr Klaus-Heinrich Standke of Berlin's East-West Economic Academy, and Mr Marek Talasiewicz, the prefect of Szczecin province, the end of the cold war has given Germany and Poland a unique opportunity to make the kind of effort made by France and Germany, former wartime enemies, to put into improve their bilateral relations after the war. Such a rapprochement was impossible while East Germany and Poland were socialist 'brothers' in an artificial partnership dictated from Moscow. But now that it is once more possible to build normal relations between sovereign states, academics and politicians on both sides of the border are not only talking about ways of improving bilateral relations, but also about forging stronger links with Denmark and Sweden. They are and looking ahead to the eventual creation of a new EC 'euro-region' at the western end of the Baltic.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel Rather like Mr Norman Lamont, Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair Morton must be wearying of huge borrowing requirements, fierce political skirmishes and staring down long dark holes. But Sir Alastair can at least see some light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday's encouraging - if tentative - news of progress towards resolution of its dispute with its contractors lifted Eurotunnel's shares by almost 3 per cent. The sterling units have risen nearly 50 per cent since mid-December. Although aided by currency movements, the rise appears to reflect a shift in investor perceptions. Eurotunnel has begun its evolution from unpredictable construction project to more dependable transport utility. Assuming the bitter wrangle with contractors can be resolved satisfactorily, Eurotunnel should be able to complete the project within the year. TV shots of trains carrying beaming passengers will help sentiment, if the opening itself does little to alleviate the project's pressing financial needs. Eurotunnel will probably still require more equity, but the pressure is easing. With about 70 per cent of its debt at floating rates, Eurotunnel will benefit if interest rates remain low in the UK and start falling in France. Once construction and refinancing are complete, investors should be able to look forward to a predictable income stream. But everything depends on traffic volumes. It is not yet clear what sort of price war rival operators have in mind. The UK government has yet to agree on a high-speed rail link to London and dividends are many years away.</p>

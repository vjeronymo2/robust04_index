			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The planned amount of  27 billion yuan worth of two-year state treasury bonds for this  year was sold out by the end of May 25, five days earlier than  the target date, according to sources from the Ministry of  Finance here today.    In addition, the public have purchased about 40.25 billion  yuan three-year bonds so far, accounting for 67 percent of the  total issue of 60 billion yuan.    Treasury bond sales has been rather smooth this year, thanks  to the sound economic environment and swelling personal purses,  said a finance official in charge of the issue.    He was confident that the remaining 20 billion three-year  bonds would be sold out by the end of June as planned.    The interest rate for 1994 two-year treasury bonds is 13  percent, and 13.96 percent for three-year ones. Both are higher  than the interest rates for bank deposits of the same term.</p>

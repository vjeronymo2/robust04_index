			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Black Sea fleet becomes post-Soviet battleground AFTER more than two centuries of defending the Russian empire and the Soviet Union which succeeded it, the Black Sea fleet has itself become a battleground. From its Sebastopol headquarters, perched on the tip of the Crimean peninsula, the Black Sea fleet has become one of the most fiercely contested standards in the contest over the political shape of what was once the Soviet Union. Ukraine's campaign to take over the fleet has sparked passionate resistance from Russian leaders and the Soviet Admiralty. Unlike the Baltic republics, which seek the withdrawal of the Soviet 'occupation' army, Ukraine has moved steadily to transform the troops on its soil into a Ukrainian national army. In Sebastopol much more is at stake than the Black Sea fleet's 90,000 personnel, 300 small ships, 45 warships, 28 submarines, and 159 aircraft. The fierce objections to the Ukrainian takeover are a rearguard effort to preserve some shadow of the Soviet Union by maintaining a united military and beefing up the authority of the Commonwealth. Founded by Catherine the Great in the 18th century, the fleet is also a touchstone for Russian nationalism and a symbol of Russia's striving to become a world power. It is a proxy for the contested Crimean peninsula, which was only transferred to Ukraine in 1954 and which many Russians would like back. Fleet press attache Captain Andrei Graichov is bitter. 'They took away our homeland and in its place they gave us an open economic zone,' he said. 'How can I take an oath to an individual republic? My mother is Ukrainian, my father is Russian: whose people should I serve?' Captain Graichov's confusion echoes his commander's. Admiral Igor Kasatonov  -an ethnic Russian who was only transferred to Ukraine last autumn - would not describe himself as a citizen either of Ukraine or Russia. Instead, he said he was a citizen of the Commonwealth, a classification which has no legal status. Admiral Kasatonov argued that the fleet should not be divided, citing the need to counterbalance the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. But, while the commanders of the fleet make a point of taking their orders only from Moscow, a slim majority of officers seem to be swaying towards Kiev, as suggested by the fleet's 75 per cent endorsement of independence in Ukraine's referendum. Sailing through the choppy Sebastopol harbour on a civilian ferry, Volodia, a captain who teaches at one of the city's famed naval academies, says there is a rift between the vertushka, or command, and the officer corps. An ethnic Russian, Volodia says he is ready to swear allegiance to Ukraine. Like many of his comrades, he is concerned more about tensions than about politics and feels Ukraine promises greater material security. The geopolitical and ideological struggle has now been thinly disguised as a quarrel over semantics. On January 12, Russia and Ukraine agreed 'strategic forces' should be under central control, but the definition of these is hotly disputed. Western experts say the fleet currently carries no nuclear weapons but can be armed with tactical nuclear missiles now in storage. Ukraine's endgame is to push the pace of disarmament - all tactical warheads are to be gone by July - and thus qualify for control of a greater part of the fleet.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ruhrgas slips as competition intensifies Ruhrgas, one of Germany's largest energy companies, recorded lower profits and sales last year as a result of growing competition, Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the board, said yesterday. Net profits for the group fell to DM729m (Dollars 436.5m) last year, from DM796m in 1992, while group sales declined to DM14.34bn from DM14.4bn over the same period. Group earnings per share fell to DM20.58 from DM24.24. Ruhrgas, which controls about 75 per cent of western Germany's gas supplies and enjoys a virtual monopoly on imports, is facing increasing competition from Wintershall, the gas distribution subsidiary of BASF, the German chemical group. Under an agreement signed this year, Wintershall dented Ruhrgas's virtual monopoly over gas imports from Russia after it won the right to distribute gas imported from Gazprom, Russia's state-owned gas company, to VNG. VNG is the main east German gas distribution network in which Ruhrgas and its partners holds a majority stake. Despite more competition, and prospects of eventual liberalisation of Germany's energy sector, Mr Liesing said he expected stronger sales for 1994. Sales for the first five months of this year increased by 4 per cent compared with the same period last year. Ruhrgas, through VNG, can also expect stronger growth in eastern Germany. Ruhrgas expects demand for natural gas in western Germany to increase by about 25 per cent by the year 2005, while demand in the eastern states is expected to triple.</p>

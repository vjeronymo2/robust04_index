			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans relieved at capping of Mexican sugar exports to US Caribbean sugar producers, who had feared the loss of their United States market to Mexico when the North American Free Trade Agreement is implemented, are breathing more easily following the capping of Mexico's exports to the US for the first six years of the agreement. The Caribbean exporters, whose production costs have consistently outstripped world market prices, have managed to preserve their industries with preferential prices paid for shipments under quota to the European Union and the US. Pressure from US legislators representing sugar producing states has led to a cap of 7,258 tonnes a year on Mexican sugar exports to the US for the first six years of Nafta. Caribbean producers, excluding Cuba, have a total US quota of 225,508 tonnes for the 1993-1994 crop year, following a 16 per cent reduction of last year's quota by the US Department of Agriculture. The holders of US quotas are Barbados, Belize, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. 'There is some doubt as to whether the Mexican industry can reach the degree of efficiency which will allow it to produce significantly more than its quota in the short term,' said Mr Frank Downie, chief executive of the Sugar Industry Authority of Jamaica. 'Current quota holders are unlikely to be affected by the Mexican industry for many years.' The Caribbean sugar industry had feared that the implementation of Nafta would have allowed Mexico's sugar industry unlimited access to the US, depriving the Caribbean producers of a valuable market. Under the new arrangements, Mexico will be allowed to ship 25,000 tonnes per year to the US market if its industry produces a surplus. After the first six years, the limit will be raised to 150,000 tonnes and the market will take everything produced if there is a surplus for two consecutive years then. The US and Mexico are to phase out barriers to sugar trade over a 15-year transitional period, starting next year. During that period, Mexico will be able to export more than its current quota of 7,258 tonnes to the US only if it becomes a net exporter of sugar. The US and Mexico agreed to consider Mexico's consumption of high fructose corn syrup production in determining whether the country was a net sugar exporter. That was a response to concern in the US industry that Mexico would have a sugar surplus if it substituted high fructose corn syrup for sugar. The Caribbean industry is not unduly worried about the Nafta provisions that allow Mexico to export up to 250,000 tonnes a year to the US if the country becomes a net exporter. 'The US quota holders feel relatively safe from these arrangements,' said Mr Downie. 'Not many in the sugar industry expect Mexico to become a net producer of sugar for many years to come.' Mexico is expected to import about 440,000 tonnes of sugar next year. Consumption is expected to rise steadily, increasing demand for imports and putting the country further away from being a net producer. Caribbean industry officials say that even if the Mexican industry can ship 250,000 tonnes to the US each year, the reduction will be shared by all current quota holders. The combination of a tight supply/demand balance and 'an ever widening circle of uncertainty' are continuing to support world sugar prices, according to London trader ED F. Man, our commodities staff writes. But this bullish scenario is 'dented' by the possibility of an escalating surplus of white (refined) sugar, the trader says in the latest issue of its monthly Sugar Situation report. 'A tight raw sugar situation may emerge particularly in the first half of next year,' the report says. But 'the apparently ever tightening white sugar supply picture was not justified by offtake, in the short term at least, in the short term at least.'</p>

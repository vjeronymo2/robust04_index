			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): New rules for old agreements - Deals between companies and their agents will be subject to new EC legislation Louise Harvey, sales manager of Wren Giftware, says she usually seals the signing up of a new agent with a handshake and a brief letter of confirmation. Normally, the only points of detail to be agreed are the territory to be covered and the level of commission. From January 1, when new European Community-inspired legislation comes into force in the UK, she will have to take a lot more care in drawing up agency agreements. Wren, based in Stoke on Trent, employs 40 people making fine bone china coffee mugs. It has turnover of Pounds 1.3m and uses seven agents in the UK and three elsewhere in Europe. On that date, the UK and Ireland will join the rest of the Community in applying far more detailed rules governing agreements between companies (principals) and their agents. The new regulations apply not just to agents in other EC countries but also to those in the principal's home country. They do not apply to agents outside the EC. The new rules borrow heavily from legislation in Germany, where agents have been able to use their contracts as security for loans and where considerable compensation is available if an agreement is terminated. The result will be to strengthen the legal position of agents and give them a far greater degree of security. The new rules increase the responsibilities of companies using agents as well as the financial consequences of mishandling the relationship. 'This is a very significant change,' says Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export. 'It is a move from a freely negotiated arrangement between two willing parties to a structure where the rules are set in law.' Previously the two sides could agree terms between them, subject to the rules of common law, and if a dispute went to law each case was decided on its own merits. Under the new rules the rights and duties of both sides are specified more precisely. They cannot be written out of contracts. Since agents provide a relatively trouble-free means of expanding into new geographical markets, the new rules have caused considerable concern among many businesses and their trade associations. Two seminars arranged by the Giftware Association to explain the new rules attracted more than 600 people, says Isabel Jones, association secretary. 'The change-over will cause problems, especially in our industry, where the companies are quite small,' she says. 'But if people handle it correctly, the new rules should only amount to good business practice.' The precise form the new rules will take has still to be finalised and the Department of Trade and Industry has only just finished consulting businesses about its second draft of the commercial agents regulations. The final text will be decided in the next few months. Uncertainty about their impact is reflected by the fact that there has been little response to the department's request for views on the likely cost of compliance. Businesses must review their current arrangements and if necessary replace them with more suitable ones before the new regulations come into force, solicitors Fox Williams advise in an explanatory booklet.* The main changes to occur are: Agents will have the right to commission on sales completed within a reasonable time after the agency contract has been ended, when the transaction was mainly the result of the agent's efforts. The new regulations do not set a period during which commission can be claimed so it makes sense to agree a period in the contract to avoid disputes, Fox Williams suggest. At present most companies have very vague arrangements. Principals will no longer be able to delay paying their agents merely because they have not yet been paid. Precise new rules have been drawn up to cover the termination of contracts. Either party must give written notice of not less than one month in the first year, two months in the second year and three months in the third and subsequent years. The two sides may agree longer periods but the principal may not set himself a shorter period than applies to the agent. Provided the agent has not breached the terms of his contract, companies become liable to pay compensation to their agent to cover losses and costs resulting from the termination of the contract. Compensation must take into account the commission the agent might have earned and costs and expenses which he has not been able to recover. 'It will not be so easy to close down an agreement on a non-performing agent,' comments Martin Egan, head of the Essex Export Agency, a consultancy. 'It could make it difficult dealing with a lazy or unscrupulous agent,' notes Hazle Boyles of Hazle Ceramics, a Brentwood, Essex-based manufacturer of 'collectibles' with Pounds 250,000 of sales. 'You could end up paying double if you take on a new agent.' A danger for the smaller company is that the more formal framework may prompt an increase in the number of legal disputes. Small firms may be unable or unwilling to meet these costs, so they must be careful in their choice of agents and in the way they draw up agreements, the experts advise. The Giftware Association has commissioned a model agreement from its lawyers to help its members but principals may still need to consult a lawyer. 'Companies will have to become more professional in drawing up contracts,' says Campbell. 'Too often export decisions are left to junior staff. Senior management is happy until something goes wrong. This is an area of risk management to which companies will have to pay more attention.' *The Commercial Agents Regulations, Fox Williams, City Gate House, 39-45 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1UU.

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OTHER CANDIDATES FOR SHERIFF REJECT ROACHE CAMPAIGN FUND CHALLENGE  </P> <P> Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache on Monday challenged his fellow candidates in this  year's race for San Diego County sheriff to refuse any financial contributions  from members of that department or from other county employees.  </P> <P> But his request was quickly turned down by the other candidates, including Jack  Drown, who, as an assistant sheriff, has drawn much of his financial support  from within the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Roache, a sheriff's captain in Lemon Grove, issued the challenge after  criticizing Drown last week for collecting $2,700 in campaign money from  sheriff's employees or their wives.  </P> <P> That money was raised late last year, despite a sheriff's policy against such  contributions.  </P> <P> The policy was reversed last week, on the eve of the deadline for candidates  filing their first round of financial disclosure forms.  </P> <P> Because of the policy reversal, Roache said he was concerned that some  department employees may donate money to favorite candidates in return for  special treatment.  </P> <P> "The potential for creating an obligation, or encouraging employees to seek  favorable treatment, is just too great," he said.  </P> <P> But Assistant Sheriff Drown said he welcomes support from all sections of the  community, including the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> "I for one am frankly not at all ashamed or embarrassed by the fact that I  enjoy the support of a lot of people in the Sheriff's Department and county  government," he said.  </P> <P> "If those people want to contribute to my campaign, then that's fine with me.  They have a vested interest in the department and they have a right to  contribute if they choose to do so."  </P> <P> He added that Roache is asking all candidates to refrain from soliciting or  accepting money from county employees because "I don't think Jim Roache enjoys  a great deal of support in the Sheriff's Department and he realizes that I do."  </P> <P> "It's a safe move for him," Drown added.  </P> <P> "He wasn't going to get much in contributions from the department to begin  with, and he knew that."  </P> <P> Another candidate, former San Diego police chief Ray Hoobler, said he also will  not agree with Roache's request to shy away from county donations.  </P> <P> He suggested that Roache is only jealous that he doesn't have the same level of  internal support as Drown in the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> "The only reason he's against it now is that he hasn't been able to tap the  well, and Drown beat him to it," Hoobler said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus today rejected the possibility of confrontation  between the government and trade unions mentioned by Deputy  Chairman of the Bohemian-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions  (CMKOS) Pavel Hajek in his address at the CMKOS's first congress  today.    "I believe nobody is interested in confrontation," Klaus  told  journalists at the break in the congress, at which he delivered  a speech.    CMKOS Chairman Vladimir Petrus, commenting on Klaus's  address  said that "he was glad to hear some of Klaus' statements, but  had to think about others."    Regarding the apology which the trade union leadership  demanded from Klaus for comparing the trade union demonstration  on March 22 in Prague Old Town Square to the pro-communist  demonstration from February 25, 1948, Petrus said that Klaus's  presence at the union congress was already his apology.    "Klaus would have definitely not attended a conference of  participants in a new February putsch. He came to the congress  of his own trade unions in the Czech Republic and I personally  fully satisfied with such an apology," Petrus said.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / People: Union Discount in search of new lease of life George Blunden, who took over as chief executive of Union Discount a year ago, is bringing in Ian Martin, formerly of Baring Securities, as his new group managing director. George Lynn, who is leaving at the end of the year, will also hand over the group finance function to Martin in the next few months. While Union's recent troubles have largely stemmed from its disastrous expansion into leasing, Blunden stresses that his parting with 38-year-old Lynn is perfectly amicable. 'He is very much a leasing director and he said some time ago he wanted to pursue opportunities elsewhere. But I asked him not to leave while we went through the trials and tribulations of last winter.' Union was in takeover talks from last autumn until the spring when it succeeded in selling Winterflood Securities, which makes markets in smaller companies. Now Blunden is still eager to retain Lynn's advice as the group unwinds its leasing business over coming months. Lynn had spent ten years at Union, the last four as finance director and previously worked for Baltic, the leasing group. Meanwhile Martin, who is a chartered accountant, will be Blunden's 'extremely active number two', particularly involved in the evaluation of new business. 'I am absolutely useless at accounts' says the one-time SG Warburg bond dealer. Martin, 41, had been group finance director of County NatWest for two years from 1985 before moving to Baring Securities as chief operating officer responsible for group finance, operations and administration. He subsequently took charge of the group's derivatives trading, sales and research, an area which Union is itself keen to develop. Martin stepped down when Baring Securities chief Christopher Heath resigned in March. 'Not a bad start for poor old Union Discount,' says Blunden who wants to retore the discount house's battered reputation by making it known as 'a place where bright people come'. Last month the group acquired 51 per cent of risk management consultancy Guildhall, set up by Craig Kersey, the former head of fixed income trading and risk management from Mitsubishi Finance and George Nianias, former head of quantitative fixed income research at SG Warburg.</p>

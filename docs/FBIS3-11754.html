			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lusiana Colomine; all quotation marks as </F> published]    [Text] Hilarion Cardozo, president of the Social Christian  Party (Copei), yesterday made a dramatic appeal to the nation to  rally around Rafael Caldera's government, claiming that there  will certainly be designs to speed up a forceful solution -- in  other words, a coup d'etat in Venezuela.    At a time when the country is apparently calm -- a calm fed  by expectations created by the new government's search for a  positive change in the course of the economy -- Cardozo openly  reestablished fears of a rebellion or a popular uprising. In  his opinion, "a democratic consensus was not restored" in the 5  December elections because Caldera won the elections by a narrow  margin.    "I hereby declare with unwelcome dread that President  Caldera's democratic election, coming within the framework of a  de jure state, is not a point of unity among all Venezuelans  because there are still unsavory people who insist on continuing  the crisis in the country. For this reason, I urge the  government to make great efforts toward reorganizing democracy."    Cardozo's position can be summed up in three possible  scenarios that could threaten the nation's peace: a  self-inflicted coup, a rightist coup, or a leftist coup, without  forgetting the possibility of agitation by subversive groups.    "I think all three of these elements are at work. Certain  economic and social sectors, as well as Venezuelan capitalists,  are trying to persuade the 27 November coupists into  perpetrating what they describe as a civic-military coup. In  addition, the people who had struggled in the Army as a military  movement, who later became a political group, and who have now  split into two factions with the separation of Chavez and  Cardenas favor an insurrectional coup staged by a group of  former guerrillas. There are some who say it is best to  militarily support the president-elect to reinforce the  government in this way."    Would President Caldera support a self-inflicted coup?    I do not think Caldera would. I know him very well. I  received very good advice from him all my life. He used to tell  me: Freedom and justice can be attained only through the law.  Because of his age, and because of his experience, I do not  think he believes such an action would agree with the law.    Cardozo thinks the possibility of a coup will become clearer  when the coupists who have been acquitted leave San Carlos  prison, "because many rebels want to participate in politics,  but we do not know whether they want to do this by way of  democracy or subversion."    According to Cardozo, the best political consensus ever  attained in Venezuela's democratic history occurred in 1961 when  the Constitution was drafted. A similar consensus should now  bring together the government "to reinforce democracy."  Cardozo also spoke firmly about "subversive techniques." "A  coup is not the only way. There are subversion and dislocation  techniques. There are psychological techniques to create  conflicts and confrontations with one another. There are  demoralization techniques. The government must be aware of  this."    Cardozo says the government and Congress must act. He says  democracy cannot work if the population upholding it is not  incorporated into it. The government must aim its actions at  resolving problems, such as the high cost of living;  joblessness; lack of housing, health, and education; and  personal safety. Only in this way can the people defend  democracy.    "I want to tell you that the worst possible deal is to  gamble  on Caldera's failure, because the hope aroused by this  government is based on him being a trustworthy man who maintains  a clear social awareness. If this crumbles, and if this hope is  turned into disappointment, those who benefit will not be the  system's parties but those who believe that the only solution is  one of a rebellious or military nature."    Cardozo voiced an already general concern, prevailing  confusion. "If there are doubts along the way, it is because no  one is clearly showing the way." In turn, he issued an appeal  to Caldera, who must reach an understanding with all sectors of  the country to restore the people's faith in democracy.    "The unification of the political, economic, and social  sectors is required if we are to seek understanding. If this  escapes Caldera's hands and a fight to the death is unleashed  among the violent sectors to see who can protest more violently  in the streets, chaos and national confrontation will be so  great that they will be difficult to check."    Cardozo's news conference only lacked the musical background  of the first movement of "Carmina Burana" by Carl Orff, because  he finished his remarks with nearly biblical remarks reminiscent  of an apocalyptic finale. Although he did not mention the  "Antichrist," from his remarks, it is evident he is among us.  This is why Cardozo advocated what he called "an alliance for  good" for the sole purpose of making it possible for the  government to meet the economic challenges at hand.</p>

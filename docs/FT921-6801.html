			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Fresh selling by speculators and trade houses sent London robusta coffee prices tumbling to fresh 17-year lows. Dealers held out little hope of recovery in the near term. Robustas from Africa and Asia have plunged by about Dollars 270 a tonne since the middle of January, basis the second position, which closed at Dollars 803 a tonne after hitting a low of Dollars 787. New York arabicas were ahead at midday on short covering. On the LME aluminium absorbed a mid-afternoon decline to session lows, shrugging off a 20,450-tonne rise in LME stocks and rallying strongly to end at seven-month highs. Dealers said the market hit the day's lows when news emerged that Russia's Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter was continuing exports, after threats earlier this month to gradually shut the plant. An official said the Russian government had reduced export taxes. Licences for the export of 60,000 tonnes of metal were believed to have been issued. Copper was underpinned by the labour unrest at Chile's El Teniente mine and the possibility that disputes could spread to other Codelco facilities. The zinc market was supported by the force majeure at Peru's Cajamarquilla and caution ahead of the Big River labour contract expiry. Compiled from Reuters</p>

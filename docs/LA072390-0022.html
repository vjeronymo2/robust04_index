			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MASTERS NATIONAL CYCLING;  </P> <P> PRACTICE DIDN'T MAKE BROZNOWSKI PERFECT  </P> <P> Tom Broznowski lives two blocks away from the course used for the road races of  the Masters National Cycling Championships Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Which makes most think that when Broznowski claimed the national title in the  men's 30-34 89 kilometer race Sunday it's probably because he practices on the  course often.  </P> <P> Wrong.  </P> <P> In fact, Broznowski avoids the course because of a 90-foot climb in one block  which many refer to as the wall.  </P> <P> On the fifth lap of the 17-lap race there was a break-away of three riders  including eventual bronze medalist Steve Wood of Brentwood. The leaders held on  for two laps before they were caught by a group of six riders. The pack then  shifted and those eventually ending up in the top five, Thurlow Rogers (second,  of Van Nuys), Evan Teske (fourth, of Rancho Santa Maria) and Steve Pyle (fifth,  of Riverside, Conn.) plus Broznowski and Wood broke even further away from the  pack. By the final lap the leaders had a three-minute lead on the field.  Broznowski won the event in 2.14:33.  </P> <P> "I think the field became discouraged," Rogers said. "We weren't really going  that fast. I think the field expected us to let up but we never did."  </P> <P> Rogers, 30, didn't know he was racing in the event until Sunday morning. He had  planned to attend the senior nationals but having been a professional until two  years ago he was not allowed to compete in the seniors. So the morning of the  race he petitioned to compete. Rogers had been prepared to do the 110-mile  senior course which is double what the masters do so it wasn't surprising that  once Rogers caught the pack he led until the final sprint.  </P> <P> In the first three laps Broznowski broke a spoke as he climbed the hill. A  Vita-Crunch teammate of his switched tires with him so he was able to continue  immediately without losing much time.  </P> <P> "My strategy all day was to save myself for the final sprint," Broznowski said.  "I knew I couldn't go head to head with some of these guys but I knew from the  track that I can sprint. I've traditionally been a road racer but I just  haven't had that much time to put into it any more."  </P> <P> In the women's 45+ 43 kilometer race three local riders placed in the top five.  Barbara Rasmussen and Marty Rose both of San Diego and Elaine Steinway of  Fallbrook placed second, third and fourth respectively. Camilla Buchanan of  Williamsburg, Va. won the event, her fifth gold medal in five events.  </P> <P> Steinway and her husband Clark both won two silver and two bronze medals during  the week. Barbara won a bronze in the time trials and Clark won his silver in  the men's 50+ pursuit and a bronze in the one kilometer.  </P> <P> "I worry about his races and I know he worries about mine," Barbara said. "He's  very competitive so I'm really glad he's done so well."  </P> <P> Two other local riders, Heather Odom and Tani Barbour, both of Vista, placed  third and fourth respectively in the women's 30-34 63 kilometer race. Liz  Heller of St. Louis won the race in 1.50:29.  </P></p>

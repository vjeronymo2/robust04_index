			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (8): Voices of dissent ECONOMISTS, however, do not make foreign investment decisions. Producers do. And some producers are sceptical that the course now adopted in the region - the economic strategy praised so widely - will necessary yield the expected investment. The Latin American head of one multinational holds a view of economic policies in Brazil and Argentina - two countries in which it has had long-standing operations - which is diametrically opposed to the conventional economic wisdoms. He sees policy in Argentina, where his company is losing money, as disastrously damaging the country's economic structure: low tariffs and a high exchange rate have made imports cheap and forced him to cut prices. Meanwhile, because domestic inflation is slow to come down, his domestic costs structure is rising and his company is caught in a vice. He describes Argentina as a wonderful place to export products to, but as an awful place in which to establish a factory. On the other hand, he is enthusiastic about Brazil, where his company is making significant profits but which economists view almost as an economic disaster zone. Another large multinational, this time from the US, is cited as planning to invest heavily in Latin America - in one country: Brazil. This is because Brazil is the biggest home market and can be used as a base for the rest of Latin America. If the factories were to be established outside Brazil, the company believes it would find it almost impossible to sell into the largest domestic market. Economists would argue that, while it is not unusual for producers to seek to extract benefits from import substitution, the policies that producers tend to favour tend to prop up inefficient industry. These policies have harmed Latin America in the past. Furthermore, the whole point of opening the economy is to create more efficient industries where the country has a comparative advantage, and to close down uncompetitive plant. Thus, under the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, capital-intensive production could be expected to concentrate in the US; and labour-intensive production in Mexico, where it is cheaper.</p>

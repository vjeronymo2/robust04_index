			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: Gold's seasonal drift - At a glance Gold prices, which are in a mid-summer trough after peaking in the winter, appear to be in a seasonal price cycle. Prices showed only a slight improvement of just under Dollars 1 per fine ounce over the week. Analysts are speculating that seasonal movements in both oil and the dollar reinforce the gold price swings. Consumer demand for gold is highest during the winter in many parts of the world, say analysts, because of a concentration of festivals, including Christmas in the west and the Chinese New Year in February.</p>

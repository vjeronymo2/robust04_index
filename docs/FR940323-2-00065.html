			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice or prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirement for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 8, 1993, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico submitted an application for adequacy determination. On February 17, 1994, Puerto Rico made a revised submission. EPA reviewed Puerto Rico's application and the revised submission, and tentatively determined that all portions of Puerto Rico's Subtitle D program are adequate to provide compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 4, 1993, Puerto Rico, acting through its Environmental Quality Board, adopted comprehensive, revised regulations governing solid waste disposal. These regulations are closely patterned after the 40 CFR part 258 Federal Criteria. Certain technical and clarifying amendments have subsequently been considered by the Board and are expected to be adopted within the next several months. The purpose of the revised solid waste regulation and the amendments thereto are to bring Puerto Rico regulations into full conformity with 40 CFR part 258 Federal Criteria. EPA has reviewed Puerto Rico's revised regulation and the technical and clarifying amendments thereto, described above, and has made a preliminary determination that their provisions are adequate to meet part 258 criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board has responsibility for implementing and enforcing solid waste management regulations, including a permit program, inspection authority and enforcement activities. In its application, Puerto Rico states that adequate technical, support, and legal personnel will be assigned to implement its permit program. In addition to identifying the individuals and offices that will be assigned to this effort, Puerto Rico has specifically assigned a complement of attorneys from the Environmental Quality Board to assist in the regulatory enforcement process. Puerto Rico has determined that at present there are 61 landfills throughout the Commonwealth, of which 31 will have stopped receiving waste by April 9, 1994 and will close in direct response to part 258 requirements. Thirty landfills will remain open after April 9, 1994, of which 19 will be closed over the next 5 to 7 years, and 11 regional landfills will thereafter remain open. In recognition of the need to revise existing landfill permits to reflect the revised regulation and part 258 criteria, Puerto Rico plans to modify existing operating permits within the next two years for the 30 landfills that will remain open after April 9, 1994. Each modified operating permit will contain compliance provisions that will bring full compliance with the revised regulation and part 258 within a year's time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA will hold four public hearings on its tentative decision. Two hearings will be held on May 11, 1994 at the Solid Waste Management Authority in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. Two additional hearings will be held on May 12, 1994 at the Mayag&uuml;ez City Hall in Mayag&uuml;ez, Puerto Rico. On each of these dates, the first hearing will begin at 1 p.m. and the second hearing will begin at 7 p.m. Comments can be submitted orally at the hearing or in writing at the time of the hearing. The public may also submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination to the location indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice until May 12, 1994. Copies of Puerto Rico's application are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during each public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for Puerto Rico's program. EPA expects to make a final decision on whether or not to approve Puerto Rico's program by June 24, 1994 and will give notice of it in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and responses to all major comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA will be considered to be in compliance with Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

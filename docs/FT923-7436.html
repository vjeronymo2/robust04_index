			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER rallied on Comex, with the active September contract jumping by more than 3.50 cents a lb in late trading on heavy fund buying. One trader cited trade short covering prompted by an oversold condition last week. Another trader said locals were caught short and had to cover their positions. The trade was continuing to buy on both the LME and Comex, he said. Prices were underpinned by the continued Polish copper workers strike and improved European demand. ZINC again found good buying on any dip on the LME, with buyers further encouraged by copper's surge. ALUMINIUM was supported by talk that the Bonneville Power Administration is again mulling the possibility of reducing power to aluminium smelters in the US Northwest. New York's arabica COFFEE futures were down to fresh 17-year lows as news of talks between Colombia and Brazil had little impact on trading. Nearby September was down more than 2 cents in late trading at 48.30 a lb. GOLD edged ahead on the London bullion market. Initial reports of heightening tension between the US and Iraq were mildly supportive, but it hardly budged on later news of a successful UN arms inspection mission. Compiled from Reuters</p>

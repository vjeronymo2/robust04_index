			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Trafalgar in Pounds 1.2bn offer for Northern: Customers promised Pounds 20 rebate - Rec spurns 'financially challenged' bidder The first contested takeover bid in the UK utility sector was under way last night as Northern Electric, the regional power company for north-east England, rejected a Pounds 1.2bn offer from Trafalgar House. Northern's board said it could see no advantage to its shareholders in becoming part of a 'financially challenged conglomerate, effectively controlled by an offshore minority shareholder'. Hongkong Land, a subsidiary of Bermuda-based Jardine Matheson has a 25 per cent stake in Trafalgar. If Trafalgar succeeds with its bid, signalled last Wednesday, it intends to offer a Pounds 20 rebate to each of Northern's 1.3m to 1.4m customers. Analysts believe that could set a precedent for future takeovers in the sector. Mr Brian Wilson, Labour party industry spokesman, predicted an orgy of bids and mergers involving privatised utilities, offering 'the prospect of guaranteed risk-free profits at the public expense'. He called for the bid to be referred to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission. The bid is also being considered by Prof Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator. Mr Nigel Rich, Trafalgar chief executive, said Prof Littlechild had told him on Sunday that he would be consulting publicly, although the regulator's office was unable to confirm this last night. Mr Simon Keswick, Trafalgar chairman, said he did not believe the bid would be referred to the MMC. 'In our judgment, it is unlikely,' he said. Mr Rich said Trafalgar wanted friendly discussions with Northern's management. 'We have attempted to talk to them but they said they want to see our offer first.' Northern's shareholders are being offered Pounds 44.35 in cash and 65 new Trafalgar convertible preference shares for every 10 shares they hold. With the convertibles down 3 1/2 p to 94 1/2 p yesterday this valued each Northern share at Pounds 10.58. There is also a full cash alternative of Pounds 10.48 a share compared with Northern's close of Pounds 10.18, up 33p. Northern shareholders can opt to obtain part of the consideration in the form of 'grids', interest-bearing bonds which give them rights to shares in the National Grid, 6.5 per cent of which is owned by Northern, if it is floated next summer. For these purposes, Trafalgar estimates that each Northern share contains Pounds 2 for the Grid element. This implies a market capitalisation for the Grid of about Pounds 3.5bn against City estimates of more than Pounds 4bn. Grids will be tradeable and a grey market is expected to develop after the offer document goes out. Hongkong Land has agreed to buy the first Pounds 310m of preference shares to meet elections for the cash alternative, Following implementation of the offer, it could hold up to 31 per cent of the ordinary shares of Trafalgar assuming full conversion. However, it said it had 'no present intention' of holding more than 30 per cent of ordinary shares. Trafalgar is advised by Swiss Bank Corporation and Northern by SG Warburg.

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DELAY SOUGHT IN SENIOR HOUSING  </P> <P> Lawndale city officials sent a letter Friday urging the developer of a  subsidized apartment complex for seniors to stop qualifying potential tenants  until legal questions are resolved about a lottery used to select applicants.  </P> <P> They had previously asked the Detroit-based developer, Cooperative Services  Inc., to reschedule the March 13 lottery after discovering that only a small  number of Lawndale seniors would participate in it.  </P> <P> Of the 306 seniors who applied for one of the 56 subsidized apartment units,  only 52 were from Lawndale. Of the 100 given priority ranking, only 17 were  Lawndale residents. The complex is the city's only subsidized apartment complex  for low-income seniors.  </P> <P> But Cooperative Services refused to reschedule the lottery, saying a new  drawing would be unfair to those who were picked and would delay occupancy of  the complex.  </P> <P> In an April 16 letter to the federal Housing and Urban Development department  -- which provided grants to fund the project -- city officials alleged that the  ethnic composition of those seniors given priority ranking did not reflect that  of the community. Although 1980 census figures indicate that Latinos make up  28.4% of the community, only 15% of the tenant applicants were Latino, the  letter stated.  </P> <P> If HUD declines to compel the developer to hold the lottery again, city  officials may seek a restraining order against Cooperative Services to prevent  the selection process from continuing, City Atty. David J. Aleshire said.  </P></p>

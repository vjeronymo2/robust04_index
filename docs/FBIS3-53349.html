			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 13 Jan (MENA)--Visiting French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe has described his talks with President  Husni Mubarak and other Egyptian officials as positive and  fruitful.    He said in a news conference this evening that Egypt and  France are willing to promote their relations, especially in the  fields of investment, culture, and encouragement of  Francophonism in Egypt.    On the Middle East peace process, Juppe said France has  supported this process since the Oslo declaration, and is eager  for its timetable to be implemented so that it will not be  obstructed.    He emphasized the importance France attaches to Lebanon's  fate in the comprehensive regional settlement. Lebanon's  sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity must be  preserved, and the settlement must not be achieved at Lebanon's  expense, he said.    Juppe said that in his talks in Egypt, cooperation in the  Mediterranean region was discussed. Egypt and France represent  a Mediterranean power, and we are determined to intensify our  dialogue in the economic and security spheres, he said.    He said Egypt was the first to call for a Mediterranean  forum, and added: We have contributed to this idea since  November, and 'Amr Musa and I decided this morning to prepare  for a semi-official meeting next summer "in the same way  unofficial European meetings are held."    On the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the NATO  meetings, Juppe said his country accepts any criticism except  that of being careless. He said France made the biggest efforts  to stop the tragedy and sent 6,000 soldiers to that region. He  noted that those soldiers are subject to many risks, and that  there have been many victims.    The French minister said his country has also sent  humanitarian relief and transferred hundreds of millions of ECUs  for relief operations, which is a tremendous European and French  effort.    Juppe said that in the recent NATO meeting, France demanded  that the question of Bosnia-Herzegovina be listed on the agenda  although everybody else asked that the issue not be discussed.    He explained that the 16 NATO members supported the European  political plan, which says that each community must have enough  land to survive and have its own outlet as a basis for a  peaceful settlement.    If this plan is signed, he said, those countries will be  ready to send some 50,000 soldiers to the field. He added: The  United States has expressed readiness to contribute half this  force, and we are ready to help the United Nations implement its  resolutions by sending planes today if we are asked. However,  no one asked us to attack Serbian positions.    Juppe said there are issues related to two security regions.  The first is Srebrenica, around which the Serbs are tightening  the noose and where France expressed readiness to replace the  Canadian forces, which are willing to withdraw. The second is  Tuzla airport, which is under shelling by Serbia.    Juppe said France demanded that Tuzla airport be reopened,  and French planes will land there to deliver humanitarian aid.  If we are attacked, we will retaliate, he said.    He stressed that the peaceful solution is the actual  solution, and for it to happen, the formation of a court to  punish those who violate human rights and perpetrate crimes  against their peoples must be considered.    The French foreign minister pointed out that his country  made  great financial efforts concerning the Bosnian problems,  spending 500 million ECU. It has also made several initiatives  over the past nine months, but all these efforts failed, and  that is why we were active in the NATO meeting a few days ago,  he said.    Juppe noted the possibility of misunderstanding the  international and European positions toward Bosnia-Herzegovina,  especially by the Islamic world. He said Egypt is affected by  this misunderstanding, where Europe is accused of abandoning  Bosnia and allowing human rights violations there to go  unpunished. He said: But today is not September 1991; it is  January 1994. Things have changed, and Europe is now right in  drafting the only peace plan proposed.    The French foreign minister pointed out that the operations  concerning Srebrenica and Tuzla are useful for humanitarian  purposes, but will not solve the basic problem. He stressed the  need to work out a peaceful plan to stop the bloodshed and  reinforce the airlift to Sarajevo. He said: We warned the  Serbs that we would attack them from the air if they fail to  comply with these resolutions.    If the NATO resolutions are not implemented, he said, the  alliance's prestige will be put to the test.    Asked about the restoration of relations between the Vatican  and Israel, Juppe expressed the belief that this is natural,  positive and it helps advance the peace process. "If the PLO  has recognized Israel, I wonder why the Vatican should not," he  said.    He said the Oslo accord will not solve the problem of  Jerusalem, which will be solved later.    Asked about France's position toward Libya and Iraq, Juppe  said: Concerning Libya, we demand that the UN resolutions and  international law be implemented. We also demand that Iraq  implement the UN resolutions. He noted that Iraq had  implemented some resolutions, but said that all resolutions must  be implemented.    Juppe called for destroying all mass-destruction weapon  networks in Iraq; ensuring the safety of Kuwaiti territory;  Iraq's recognizing the borders and refraining from changing  them; and Iraq's refraining from practicing violence against  population centers.    The French foreign minister said: I would like to point to  some progress concerning Libya. I have heard information on  this topic and have read how far things have gone concerning  some proposals, but no progress has been made in this field.    On French-Iranian relations, Juppe said that his country  shared the European view which stresses the need for a critical  dialogue with Iran. He said the policy of isolation toward that  country is futile. We will ask for official guarantees that  Iran will abandon terrorism and respect international laws, he  said.</p>

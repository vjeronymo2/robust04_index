			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] North Korea is likely to respond on 14 January to  the IAEA checklist that was delivered to the North on 10 January  for inspection of the seven nuclear facilities [haek sisol].    On 13 January, Yun Ho-chin, counselor of the North Korean  Embassy in Vienna, who is the chief North Korean delegate to  working-level contacts with the IAEA, said that North Korea  would respond to the IAEA demand soon and that its response was  delayed because there were many things to review carefully due  to differences in basic positions [kibonjogin ipchang chairo]  between North Korea and the IAEA.    He also hinted that North Korea will not completely meet the  IAEA demand despite an agreement with the United States,  stressing that there is no change in their position that the  nuclear issue should be resolved through negotiations between  North Korea and the United States.</p>

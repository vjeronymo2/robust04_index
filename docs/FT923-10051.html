			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Corporate tax breaks lift Nikkei REPORTS of the government's additional economic stimulus package, which includes planned tax breaks for corporate capital investment, lifted share prices but activity remained subdued ahead of the weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index gained 354.68 to 15,910.28, for a rise of 2.7 per cent on the week. The index fell to the day's low of 15,469.09 in the morning session on small-lot profit-taking, but later surged on index-linked buying by investment trusts, hitting the day's high of 15,967.18 in the afternoon. Volume, however, fell to 200m shares from 223m. Gainers led losers by 805 to 181, with 114 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 25.77 to 1,219.25 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.34 to 968.93. Traders said the bulk of activity consisted of short-covering, and little new demand was seen. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said: 'Sentiment seems to have improved as the government has started to announce concrete measures to counter the weak economy and stock market.' He added that investors were waiting to take profits at higher levels. Reports that central bankers in the US, Japan, and Europe were in close discussions over problem loans at commercial banks, encouraged market participants. Banks and property-related issues, which rose on Thursday on the government's plans to support land prices by purchasing real estate for public works projects, advanced sharply. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y70 to Y1,780 and Sumitomo Bank gained Y60 to Y1,430. Mitsui Fudosan, the leading realtor, added Y69 to Y839, and Mitsubishi Estate Y45 to Y810. Speculative theme stocks strengthened on short-term trading, with Meiji Milk Products gaining Y15 to Y875 and Okamoto Industries Y30 to Y1,060. Foreign investors were seen bargain-hunting in electrical blue chips. Hitachi advanced Y7 to Y723 and Fujitsu gained Y20 to Y587. However, Toshiba fell Y7 to Y614 and NEC lost Y2 to Y760 on continuing concerns over earnings. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 388.23 to 17,750.75 in volume of 12.9m shares. Roundup A FIRMER Wall Street and Tokyo helped most markets in the Pacific Basin to rise. HONG KONG was stronger on selective bargain-hunting.

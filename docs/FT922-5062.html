			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Gas-fired power stations criticised NATIONAL Grid Company may refuse to take power from many of the new gas-fired power stations being built in England and Wales because of fears about the design of the stations, it said yesterday. National Grid, which owns and operates the electricity supply system, was responding to a statement from Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British Coal. He said the new stations would be technically inferior to existing coal-fired stations. This will intensify the row over whether the 16 new stations now committed or being built were necessary. National Grid has warned that they would create a 60 per cent surplus of electricity by 1997. Mr Edwards said the new gas stations were less flexible than coal-fired stations and could not guarantee the stability of the system. He said those shortcomings arose from National Grid's failure to communicate the requirements for the design of the gas-powered stations to developers. That was supported by the contradictory comments from National Grid and developers of the new stations, he said. However, Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity, rejected the claim. 'It's absolute rubbish,' he said. Midlands Electricity is involved in the biggest power station project on Teeside. Mr Townsend said that all new stations had been designed to meet requirements set out by National Grid in its grid code. 'If a plant is designed to meet the grid code, it won't have problems.' Mr Mike Eggleton of Yorkshire Electricity defended the new stations. 'Many of the new gas plant designs are more flexible than the large coal stations,' he said. Yorkshire Electricity is building a power station in south Humberside. National Grid said it was concerned that some of the gas-fired stations might not meet the system's requirements, even though they met the grid code specifications. That was because the code left room for interpretation and did not specify how flexible a new plant had to be. Mr Edwards predicted that National Grid would not be able to take more than half of the total power that all the new stations being built or committed would provide when demand was low without jeopardising the supply. That was good news for coal, he said. Even if gas were cheaper, it might replace the power generated by only about 20m tonnes of coal, rather than the 30m previously expected.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's former special adviser said Thursday [10 February]  the premier made a serious mistake as a reformist in the process  that led to his proposed 7 percent new indirect tax that was  later revoked. Shusei Tanaka said, "Hosokawa's proposal was  scrapped in a jiffy because the government skipped an important  process for a reformist cabinet and only followed the pace of  administrative needs."    In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Tanaka said "the  government cannot get support from people on (the tax system)  unless it makes achievements in the ongoing administrative  reform and rectifies the inequitable tax system."    "The premier had stressed that radical administrative reform  and rectification of the inequitable tax system are  prerequisites before implementing (full-scale) tax reform and he  still hopes to do that," Tanaka said.    But Hosokawa's intention was not manifested and instead he  pushed forward with the idea to implement income tax cuts as  well as a "national welfare" tax, he said.    "The role of a reform-oriented administration is to change  the outmoded social systems, that is to say, to change  political, administrative and economic systems and to establish  a new 'stage setting' for a new era," he said.    Tanaka stepped down as special adviser to Hosokawa on  January  31 shortly after the Diet enacted a set of four political reform  bills, saying his job of helping to enact political reform was  done.    He is currently acting leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), a  small coalition component headed by Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura.    In an early morning news conference on February 3, Hosokawa  unveiled a "national welfare tax," a 7 percent levy on almost  all goods and services, that was to take effect in April 1997,  replacing the current 3 percent consumption tax.    The new revenues were partly aimed at financing a 6 trillion  yen income tax reduction.    The proposal, however, provoked fierce opposition from the  leading coalition bloc, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan]  (SDP) [SDSPJ], which threatened to leave the alliance unless the  new tax proposal was dropped.    Hosokawa's decision to implement the tax measures was done  without the consent of the SDPJ, the largest of the seven-party  coalition.    The coalition parties revoked Hosokawa's proposal the  following day and struck a deal to implement the 6 trillion yen  tax cut in advance of formulating other measures to secure the  lost revenue.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet busy Results at the top end of market expectations were reported by Grand Metropolitan, although profit-taking after the recent run saw the shares finish 11 off at 422p. There were a few aspects to worry an otherwise largely supportive market, with US food business Green Giant again having to extend its recovery timetable. There were also currency considerations, one of the main reasons that most analysts made modest downgrades to the Pounds 960m level for next year. Figures from BT caused unease in the market as dealers and specialists attempted to analyse the wealth of statistics. While most agreed that the pension fund issue was bad for sentiment as well as finances, the overall feeling was that the underlying business was performing well. The shares fell 7 at the opening, then rebounded 11 to move into positive territory before settling just 1 1/2 up at 404p. Turnover was an above average 9.2m. Analysts said that, given the good underlying performance and the upcoming campaign for the BT III sale, the shares appear well favoured. The annual analysts meeting with Rank Organisation, ahead of the group going into closed period, helped the shares to recover some of Wednesday's nervous decline and they closed 4 up at 700p. There were few great surprises on trading, with Japan continuing weak and some worries over the onset of recession in the rest of Europe. But UK and US trading was continuing to show signs of an upturn, in particular the UK holiday market. Analysts'forecasts moved into a range of Pounds 255m to Pounds 265m for the first half of 1993. Ever-present sensitivity to Aids news was responsible for a sharp fall in Wellcome. Positive references to an anti-Aids compound being developed for Glaxo sent the shares down 30 at worst, before recovering slightly to end 24 off at 742p. SmithKline Beecham also suffered in spite of a well-received announcement that it had agreed a joint promotion in the US with a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the 'A' shares declining 15 to 466p. Glaxo held relatively steady, closing only 5 lower at 638p. Scientific equipment group Life Science rose 6 to 142p as it announced a Pounds 33.5m acquisition and agency broker James Capel turned positive. Results from Burton Group saw the shares advance strongly, closing 4 to the good at 85p in turnover of 12m. While many analysts felt that the company has managed to turn the corner, there was some concern raised over its ability to compete with other retail brands and the subsequent pressure on margins. Next, an arch competitor, put on 6 1/2 at 164 1/2 p. Positive presentations in London from Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestle yesterday were seen to augur well for Unilever's results today. The shares advanced 14 to 1104p. RTZ rose 11 to 636p, buoyed by a bounce in copper, which has seen chronic weakness this year, and gold. Lonrho had a busy session as 20m shares were dealt and firmed 4 to 118 1/2 p on talk that the company was planning to float its 73 per cent-owned Western Platinum concern in South Africa. Pearson recovered 4 to 439p as SG Warburg published a buy recommendation. The securities house was also recommending Scottish Television in its sector review, arguing that the shares deserve to reach 520p in the short term. They added 6 at 457p. Also, it is advising more adventurous investors to look at debt-laden PR group Shandwick on the basis that at 33p the shares are on a 50 per cent discount to a 1994 market rating. Shandwick rose 1 1/2 to 20 1/2 p. Carlton Communications continued to resist broad-based support, including a late recommendation from agency broker James Capel, which pointed out a positive article in the trade press. Carlton lost 8 to 719p. Turnover in Rolls-Royce surged to 14m and the shares jumped 10 1/2 to 149p as the market appreciated Wednesday's news of an engine order from Boeing. Sentiment was further boosted by news of a Korean Air deal. Dealers reported switching from British Aerospace and into Rolls-Royce. BAe shed 8 to 317p in trade of 1.9m. The large line of Smiths Industries stock held by UBS that had been overhanging the market was cleared yesterday. The shares rose 8 to 343p. Simon Engineering continued to plunge, losing 21 to 52 1/2 p yesterday after Smith New Court weighed in with a savage profits downgrading. Magazine printer HunterPrint rose 5 to 80p as it brought forward its results amid company concern that the shares had risen from 60 earlier in the week. HunterPrint said it was in talks over a bid and St Ives was mentioned in the market as a possible candidate. St Ives, very heavily traded after the departing chairman and shareholders connected with him placed 6.7m shares with S. G. Warburg, fell 6 to 324p on 13.6m traded.</p>

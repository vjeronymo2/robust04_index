			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Royal Bank of Canada to cut staff by 4,100 Royal Bank of Canada is to cut 4,100 jobs, about 8 per cent of its workforce to improve competitiveness and integrate the recently-acquired operations of Royal Trust. The bank, Canada's biggest financial institution, said about 3,000 jobs will be cut from its own payroll but Royal Trust will be more heavily hit relative to its size, with more than one in five jobs being lost. RBC plans to close more than a third of the trust company's 142 branches. RBC acquired Royal Trust, formerly controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, mainly to gain a strong foothold in fiduciary services on the heels of regulatory reforms last year.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Chernomyrdin restores vodka state monopoly Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, has issued a set of orders designed to 'restore a state monopoly' on vodka and other spirits, first demanded by President Boris Yeltsin almost a year ago. Itar-Tass news agency reported at the weekend that an order signed by Mr Chernomyrdin was aimed at 'defending the state's economic interests and protecting the rights of consumers'. The Russian media have reported an increasing number of cases of poisoning from spirits - hence Mr Chernomyrdin's extension of a state monopoly to the industrial spirits used to manufacture lethal brews. The prime minister set a 30-day deadline for the creation of a system of state licences needed to manufacture, bottle, store, and sell alcoholic drinks wholesale; a two-month deadline for setting the prices to be paid for such licences; and finally, a three-month deadline for the introduction of criminal penalties to punish offenders. Well-established foreign brands, such as Sweden's Absolut, and Smirnoff of the US, will also have to comply with the rules which are described as 'applicable to all types of property regardless of their ownership'. Mr Yeltsin's initial decree proclaiming the restoration of a state monopoly last June was followed by uproar except from domestic vodka producers who face stiff competition from better-marketed foreign brands. Nothing was done to enforce it until this weekend. Given the proliferation of unlicensed manufacturing and sales, as well as widespread corruption among police and officials, the latest measures are unlikely to be enforceable in the near future. Even now most street traders - hawking new brands with names such as Rasputin and Terminator - buy fake certificates from private companies rather than face a byzantine state bureaucracy responsible for granting official trading permits. A profitable state vodka monopoly which prevailed under the Tsars and then the country's communist rulers, collapsed when Russia introduced radical market reforms liberalising all manner of imports and commerce two years ago. Renewed efforts to re-establish state controls over the industry come as the Russian government faces not just a public outcry over the poisoning cases, but protectionist pressures from its own producers, and a desperate shortfall of tax revenues.</p>

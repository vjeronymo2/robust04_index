			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Barzani and Talabani Meet in </F> Silopi, Turkey"]    [Excerpt] London -- In a surprise step, the two Iraqi  Kurdish leaders Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani moved to  Turkey yesterday and held a bilateral meeting in the city of  Silopi near the border with Iraq. Kurdish sources have told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the meeting, in which Turkish military  and security officials participated, was arranged by Ankara.    Iraqi opposition sources see the meeting as evidence of the  difficulties still facing the two Kurdish leaders regarding  normalizing conditions in north Iraq after the fighting that  broke out between Barzani's party and Talabani's party. Sources  from the opposition "[Unified] Iraqi National Congress" told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from the congress' offices  in the Kurdish city of Salah al-Din that the Turks are  interested particularly in consolidating the reconciliation  between the two Kurdish leaders and preventing fighting from  breaking out between them again. Fighting would affect security  conditions on the border area between Iraq and Turkey, which  Ankara says is being used as a staging post for attacks against  the Turkish forces stationed in the mainly Kurdish southeastern  provinces by the separatist Workers' Party of Kurdistan, which  is launching a guerrilla war against the Turkish state.

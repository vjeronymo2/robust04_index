			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Midnight after a hard day in the House - Television The BBC Director-General, John Birt himself, is said to the be the man responsible for the launch of The Midnight Hour, a late-night BBC2 studio discussion designed to 'review the parliamentary day'. It could be a smart move. The BBC already boasts of 'setting the agenda' in the morning with the Today programme on Radio 4 which goes out at just about the only time when politicians, top executives and other 'opinion formers' are available to listen. Midnight is often the only time that such people manage to see a bit of television, so if The Midnight Hour catches on the BBC will be able to claim that they are the gatekeepers at both ends of the political day. But will it catch on? Launched on the evening of the State Opening of Parliament, it has so far had five weeks of four-day transmissions (Monday to Thursday) and has already improved considerably. For instance, the production team seem, thank goodness, to have ditched the 'funny' song illustrating the day's events. This idea is re-invented every time anybody does a studio commentary series but the only times it ever worked were on the Tonight programme in 1957 when Cy Grant sang calypsos written by Bernard Levin, and on That Was The Week in 1962 when the scat intro was sung by the brilliant Millicent Martin. The producers of The Midnight Hour should now abandon their other security-blanket devices: the fluorescent tube logo which was so trendy in the 1980s, the cocktail bar mini-set guaranteed to make any politician look as though he is about to do a high-stool Dicky Valentine number, and the barmy inlay of a giant tropical fish tank which would hardly pass muster on a yoof series. No image on television is more powerful than a talking head against a black background and that is what they should stick to. Even the gimmick of making the men take off their jackets can be safely dropped; we know within two minutes whether we are watching a genuinely relaxed conversation or a tense and contrived interview. This depends largely on the skills of the chairman who should, ideally, have been Vincent Hanna. At Newsnight, A Week In Politics and most recently on Channel 4's Midnight Specials, Hanna has developed a technique combining amiable conspiracy and rib-nudging ridicule which is admirably productive with most politicians. He also has a phenomenal memory for political minutiae. However, The Midnight Hour has gone for a different chairman on each of the four nights, the best of them being former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, and Trevor Phillips, who has done outstanding work as producer and presenter with London Weekend TV. Both are political journalists with considerable broadcasting experience, and although Neil's instincts are those of a political commentator, the squibs he tosses from the chair land pretty well equally in all parts of the political spectrum. The same cannot be said of Bernard Ingham who looks and sounds like a survivor from a different age, but, worse, seems too often incapable of setting aside his political allegiance. Most tedious of all, he likes to remind us of his old glory days. Sarah Baxter may one day fill positions of this sort splendidly, but at present she lacks those attributes of a rugby forward which are necessary in these circumstances. It is not a simple question of masculinity - the decidedly feminine Betty Boothroyd has it, as she proved on the night of the dramatic VAT vote when she bawled out MPs for crowding in over the bar of the House and thundered 'I don't give a  - I don't care where you sit, but you must sit down'. And they did. The Midnight Hour has proved that it can attract cabinet ministers and their shadows, camera pleasers such as Tony Banks, and respected war horses such as Peter Shore. The atmosphere is beginning to feel right, and if they can establish the idea that this is the place to let your hair down after a hard day in the House (a few indiscreet leaks would be handy) this could well become a long term fixture. It is the most interesting post-midnight series for years.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRIBAL LEADERS COMPLAIN TO SENATE PANEL ABOUT LACK OF MONEY, URBAN INTRUSION  </P> <P> An overflow crowd packed the Escondido City Council chambers Thursday as Indian  leaders from throughout Southern California testified before a U. S. Senate  committee about a host of problems besetting local tribes and their  reservations.  </P> <P> Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) chaired the hearing of the Select Committee on  Indian Affairs and told the estimated audience of 250 that he is "aware of the  sad and tragic history of Indians in California."  </P> <P> Inouye began the hearing by reminding representatives of the various tribes  about the hundreds of Indian treaties violated by the federal government.  </P> <P> "The history of Indians in the United States is not a bright chapter. . . .  That is the history of the U. S. government," he said.  </P> <P> Some speakers blamed their tribes' problems on the muddled bureaucracy of the  Bureau of Indian Affairs, but others addressed a variety of issues, including  the shortage of money for reservation health programs and a disparity in  federal funding for San Diego County tribes.  </P> <P> Several speakers pointed out that larger tribes on the East Coast and in the  Midwest receive a greater share of the funds. Inouye said he is aware of that  and explained that the BIA believes the tribes are "too small" and refers to  them as "tribalettes."  </P> <P> He advised the local bands of Mission Indians to form a confederacy, much like  the Iroquois, to lobby Congress.  </P> <P> Jim Fletcher, tribal administrator for the Rincon Indians, said it is the  larger tribes that have the financial resources to hire attorneys and lobbyists  to press Congress for more funds.  </P> <P> Fletcher, who lives on the Pachanga Reservation in Riverside County, was one of  a handful of tribal leaders at the hearing who addressed the problem of urban  encroachment on reservations.  </P> <P> "You don't think about it. You don't see it. But we see the problem from the  reservation, and it's getting worse," he said.  </P> <P> Tribes want to work with the county and local planning commissions on  development and density issues, Fletcher said.  </P> <P> "Reservations have little or no input on development issues. . . . Our survival  depends on our being able to work with the county and local governments on  development issues."  </P> <P> Fletcher cited as an example the new community of Rancho California, north of  Temecula, where more than 6,000 housing units have been built next to the  Pachanga Reservation.  </P> <P> "The county sent us notices about the development," Fletcher said, "but nobody  really asked for our input. . . . The tribes are concerned because developments  often desecrate our burial grounds and other sacred sites."  </P></p>

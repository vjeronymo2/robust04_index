			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Barbara Bethancourt report on interview with Foreign </F> Minister Roberto Robaina by unidentified reporter; place and  date not given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast  -- recorded]    [Text] A year in which Cuban foreign policy gained new  opportunities has been left behind. The reestablishment of  relations with Colombia, a tour through the Caribbean, and  participation in important international meetings were some of  the Cuban Foreign Ministry's activities in the year that has  just concluded and which characterizes the work that will be  maintained in the new year. As a matter of fact, Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina will soon begin a tour of the African  nations.    [Robaina] At the invitation of several Foreign Ministries, I  will visit five African countries in early January.    [Reporter] Which countries?    [Robaina] I will visit Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Ghana,  and [name indistinct] [end recording]    Robaina did not rule out a visit to Spain and to other  European countries this year.    [Robaina] We have another invitation, but I do not know if I  will be able to attend in early January. I believe that at the  invitation of Spain, I will visit that country and other  European countries that [words indistinct].    [Reporter] Are you going to [words indistinct]?    [Robaina] Well, I believe there are also possibilities for a  visit there, but right now I think the invitation made by the  president of our parliament is much more important. I do not  think I will have time to visit other places until I complete my  visits in Africa and Latin America. Besides, we need many  things here, and I have not seen you for a long time because I  have been abroad. I want to be here to share with you what I am  doing here and abroad.    [Reporter] Will you go on your Latin American tour during  the  first six months of 1994?    [Robaina] Yes, the Foreign Ministry has much work to do in  the first six months of 1994. Please keep in mind that it is  not just the minister who has to work hard when there is a lot  of work at the Foreign Ministry. The vice ministers are working  in their respective areas. We must continue working on what we  started in the Caribbean and do it with the same enthusiasm in  Latin America.    For many reasons with which you are familiar, we will work  on  Africa and Europe in the first six months. We cannot do more in  that time because as you know, we have two very important  events. One is the creation of the Association of Caribbean  States [Asociacion de Estados Caribenos], and the other is the  Latin American Summit to be held in Cartagena in June. This  will give us plenty of work during the first six months of the  year.    A conference on immigration and the Cuban situation will  also  be held during the first six months of 1994 in Havana. This is  a continuation of the dialogue between the Cubans of the island  and those residing in other countries. Since this meeting is  being questioned by some anti-Cuban organizations, we asked  Robaina for his opinion.    [Robaina] It surprises me how some people are talking about  an invitation that was never made to them. That really  surprises me. In other words, I would like to know who says  those people were invited to the meeting. I hear them saying  that they accept the invitation and are preparing documents.  They even talk about a vague proposal by the Cuban foreign  minister. They say that the true and only dialogue was the one  made by (?Platform) I don't know how many years ago. Apparently  the people saying these things have very little else to do.    I feel that the rules of the game for the conference to be  held in Cuba during the first months of next year are very clear  and have not changed. They are based on absolute respect,  mutual understanding, and sharing our (?project). The agenda  will cover immigration and family issues, which is what concerns  us. Anyone who tries to impose a political agenda on us is  wasting his time.    I do not think I have to answer for any document because --  honestly -- that document has nothing to do with anything I have  proposed. Inasmuch as it has nothing to do with anything I have  proposed, it is as if did not exist. I think there are many  other things to talk about; for example, how people speak of an  invitation that has never been made.    [Reporter] Has [words indistinct] been invited?    [Robaina] No, we have not invited Gutierrez (Menoya) or any  other person in particular. We are preparing the agenda today.  Once the agenda has been prepared, we must evaluate a list of  participants that will be in line with many (?concepts). If  anyone wants to impose such conditions on an agenda of a meeting  to which he has not been invited....[pauses] When one gets  (?married), plans a party, or gives a speech, one establishes an  agenda. Anyone who is interested in something other than what  is on that agenda is evidently at the wrong party or meeting.  At this time there is no possibility that we will talk about  any person in particular.    I repeat: We are preparing an agenda in which we have many  contacts with representatives of this Cuban community, and we  know what things mutually concern us. I think that requires  many things. If we want a dialogue and we have a meeting or  conference of [words indistinct] so we will have something more  than just a meeting, we must create an atmosphere that will  allow us to identify, among Cubans, the main issues that concern  us. Anyone from abroad who wants to pressure us is obviously  wrong.    [Reporter] Do you think the internal dissidents will be able  to participate in this meeting?    [Robaina] I think those who claim to be internal dissidents  do not have immigration problems. In this meeting, we are going  to discuss the problems with the Cubans who are abroad. They  very much like being abroad, and that involves something else.  With that community we are going to discuss other groups of  issues that have to do with immigration and other topics related  to that community, not only the portion of it that is in the  United States. There is a very large community in Mexico,  Venezuela, the Caribbean, [words indistinct]. There are 65  Cubans in Jordan.    Can you imagine that? I believe the community in the United  States is important, but the people who are in the Caribbean and  Africa are most important. Most of them married students who  were training in Cuba and now live abroad, but they want to  maintain links with the country. We are referring to the normal  communications of a country with its community abroad. We want  to do this as much as possible, and that does not mean only  those in the United States.    If you asked me, I will tell you I have just ordered very  serious and complex discussions with representatives of that  Cuban community in (?Mexico) and other countries in the  Caribbean. They are highly insulted because they say we give  all the exceptions and possibilities to those who are in the  United States and not to those in other countries. So you can  very well imagine that working with the Cuban community abroad  is most complex. [end recording]</p>

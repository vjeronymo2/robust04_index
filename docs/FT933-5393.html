			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Personal View: No case for independent central bank The idea of an independent central bank has become exceedingly fashionable. At present it is a sine qua non for taking part in any European Monetary Union and it is advocated in the UK by a vocal element of the economic establishment. The simplest argument in favour is that politicians manipulate monetary policy to win elections, or are prone to taking the soft option. As all loose money does is to cause inflation, it is better to take monetary policy out of party politics. Yet while loose money generally just causes inflation, too-tight money does more than cause price deflation; it causes recession with often permanent effects on the economy. If Mr Paul Volcker, when chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had let US banks and the government of Mexico go bust in 1982 by maintaining tight money, are we really to believe the world would have been the same a few years later except for a lower price level? The belief that monetary policy is always 'neutral' in the long run, and affects only the price level, is implausible. If, nonetheless, monetary policy can be taken out of politics, why not take fiscal policy out too? In fact, there is much more international evidence of fiscal policy being manipulated for electoral ends than is the case with monetary policy. Yet no-one proposes that fiscal policy should be put in the hands of independent functionaries. A more subtle argument depends on the idea of credibility. Politicians may mean to keep inflation down, but other economic agents, especially in financial markets, know they have an incentive to inflate before elections. Accordingly inflation expectations, and the costs of controlling inflation, will be higher than in the case where the monetary authority is not thought to have any such incentive. An independent central bank will have different incentives from politicians, so its anti-inflationary policy will be more credible and less expensive in terms of lost output than that of the toughest politician. As an argument that is plausible but how important is it? The Bundesbank, for all its credibility, has had to induce a substantial recession in Germany this year in order to reduce inflation. We are left with the argument that, given an independent central bank, financial markets would expect lower inflation so nominal and real interest rates would be lower. What is that worth? In New Zealand the Reserve Bank was made statutorily independent in 1990 and followed a tough policy, bringing inflation down to about 1 per cent. Meanwhile, in Australia, the Reserve Bank, which is not independent, followed an equally tough policy and brought inflation down below 1 per cent. The 'sacrifice' of output in New Zealand was no less than in Australia. Indeed, New Zealand GDP is little higher in real terms than in Australia - and a little higher in real terms than it was in 1985. Since 1989, however, New Zealand 10-year bond yields have been generally lower than Australian ones, whether measured in real or nominal terms. Of course, many other factors have been at work but let us ascribe the difference to a premium on central bank independence. The current difference in nominal yields is 40 basis points (0.4 percentage points), and in real yields about 20 basis points. So there it is. If you abandon democratic control over monetary policy, after a year or so you probably get a quarter to half of one per cent off government bond yields. If the advantages are so nebulous, why are increasing elements of the establishment calling for an independent central bank? The reasons have more to do with political philosophy than with economics. In the liberal tradition, fear of government tyranny is paramount. People of this persuasion advocate explicitly limited powers for government. For them, the evidence for an independent bank does not have to be strong at all. An alternative tradition stresses the importance of democratic process and of accountability to the electorate. While not wanting government to be omni-competent, it prefers a system where elected representatives determine policies, and are responsible for them with fewer restrictions on the capacity for radical change. For this tradition, it would need to be clear beyond doubt that an independent central bank delivered large benefits before it could approve the weakening of democracy that such independence implies. The delphic evidence available so far is not remotely enough. The author is chief economist at Lehman Brothers International and an affiliated professor at London Business School.  His article is based on his recent publication, 'Economic Integration after Maastricht', Institute for Public Policy Research.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, May 26 -- Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  on Thursday barred her cabinet members from issuing any  statement on the country's nuclear programme.    "I will direct the ministers not to speak on the nuclear  issue or answer any question in this regard," Ms. Bhutto said  at a Press conference.    She said the nuclear issue was a specialised subject and  some  nonspecialists were spreading confusion by making statements or  replying to questions asked by reporters.    Complaining that some newspapers twisted statements in this  regard, Ms Bhutto said that from now onward, no one except  herself would speak directly on the issue. "Even the foreign  minister will give a written statement on the subject so that no  one can twist it," she said and added that if any cabinet member  had to reply to any question on the issue he should seek its  answer from the foreign minister.    "Statements are printed to create confusion and that's why  we  say enough is enough," she added.    Ms Bhutto said that first a statement on rolling back  Pakistan's nuclear programme was published and, though the  government denied it, it was made an issue. "They want to trap  us by (printing) such statements"    The Prime Minister regretted that every Tom, Dick and Harry  had become an expert on this specialised subject. "They use  terms like freezing, capping and rolling back, so loosely that  Pakistan's interest is hurt."</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> LOST RING RETURNED TO RINGO  </P> <P> A five-carat diamond ring lost by Ringo Starr turned up recently at a jewelry  shop and has been returned to the former Beatles drummer, police said Sunday.  </P> <P> Starr, 49, lost the ring after a concert last October in the French capital.  </P> <P> Police estimated its worth at more than $172,000.  </P> <P> The ring surfaced a few weeks ago at a jewelry shop in the St. Ouen District of  northern Paris, sold to the owner by a man police said did not know it belonged  to the rock star.  </P> <P> By that time the diamond had already passed "through several persons," police  said. Investigators later found and matched it against a description provided  by the insurance company.  </P> <P> The ring has been returned to Starr, and police said the jewelry shop owner and  the man who sold him the ring will face unspecified criminal charges.  </P></p>

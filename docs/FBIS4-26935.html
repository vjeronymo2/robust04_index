			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Dongyun (3769 0392 0061)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou 26 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Jiang  Shanli, director of the Guangdong Provincial Price  Administration Bureau, stressed here recently that it is  necessary to correctly view the current price situation. The  fact that Guangdong's price rise situation has tended to ease  since April is the initial result of a series of regulatory and  control measures; however, Guangdong's market prices remain at a  high level, and by no means should we be careless about this.    Jiang Shanli indicated that the scope of Guangdong's price  rises in April and May were 19 and 17.3 percent respectively.  Relatively speaking, they have tended to ease compared with the  first three months of this year; however, the margin of rises  remains very high, and is a threat to the province's reform,  development, and stability.    Jiang said that since the beginning of this year,  Guangdong's  relevant departments have adopted a series of measures to  strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, as well as  price controls, and have scored initial results. The major  provincial price checks that began in March have played an  important role in halting excessive price rises.    Jiang Shanli analyzed the characteristics of recent changes  in market prices in Guangdong: First, the range of price rises  has tended to ease; however, the general price level remains  high. Second, the price rise range of foodstuffs and  agricultural production materials has tended to ease, while the  range of price rises for services is comparatively great. And  third, the margin of price rises is on par with the national  average.    He reminded people that, presently, many potential price  rise  factors exist. For example, various places have raised power  prices at every tier since the merger of dual-track power prices  at the beginning of this year; consequently, users have found  power prices on the high side, with production costs rising.  The effects of the petroleum products price reform in May, the  grain price reform presented recently, and the soon to be  implemented price reforms for chemical fertilizers will  gradually make themselves felt. At the same time, wage reform  in the province's administrative units and institutions have  been effective one after another only recently, and some of the  wage increases will be diverted to the consumer market, so  directly affecting market prices. Besides, some areas in the  province suffered drought earlier and now there is flooding.  Agricultural production is suffering losses, which will directly  affect market supply and people's livelihood.    This being the case, he required Guangdong's price  administrations at all levels to increase the magnitude of the  great price check and to work hard to realize 90 percent  coverage in adding explicit price tags to commodities by the end  of July, earnestly implementing various price regulation and  control measures, and strengthening the consolidation of power  prices to lower the level of power prices in rural areas.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc steady as pound surges THE BANK of France yester-day reversed the French franc's recent slide against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism by raising its official short-term interest rates, writes James Blitz. After closing at FFr3.4190 to the D-Mark in London on Monday, the franc ended yesterday at FFr3.4140, more than a centime above its ERM floor against the German currency. However, it was unclear last night whether the interest rate change had done anything more than buy time for the French authorities. 'A big question mark remains over whether France can maintain the existing parities,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London. Sterling appeared to profit remarkably from the renewed crisis over the French franc, and a growing feeling that the UK economy is set for an economic upturn. The pound gained more than 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.5100. France's decision to suspend the 5 to 10-day lending rate and raise the overnight rate to 12 per cent will have made it prohibitively expensive for dealers to borrow francs in order to speculate with them. According to some dealers, the rise in rates was a pre-emptive measure by the French authorities, who attempted to scare off speculators before the franc came under significant pressure. The authorities would also have been concerned that commercial banks could 'round trip', borrowing at the 5 to 10-day rate of 10 per cent and lending at higher money market rates. But money market rates rose even more sharply on the move, with the overnight rate reaching 15 per cent yesterday. With French unemployment at 10.5 per cent and an election less than two months away, such high rates may be unsustainable for long. There was no overt intervention in support of the French currency yesterday from either the Bundesbank or the Bank of France. But news agencies reported a senior German government official as saying that the Bundesbank had spent DM3.5bn defending the franc on Monday. The figure, if true, may help to appease those dealers who believe that German intervention is limited by fears of exacerbating money supply. A dealer, however, suggested that it may indicate the worrying scale which the crisis has already reached. Sterling's spectacular rise to DM2.51 yesterday was partly attributed to tensions in the heart of Europe. Mr MacKinnon of Citibank warned that it would be premature to use the phrase 'safe haven' when referring to the British currency. But he said there was a growing feeling that the British economy was set for an upturn, a view underlined by good money growth indicators yesterday. M0 rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent between November and December.</p>

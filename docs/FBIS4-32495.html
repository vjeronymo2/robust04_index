			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Gyula Horn has described as historic the  coalition agreement on the basis of which a social-liberal  government can be established. Among other things, I asked the  MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] prime minister designate [Gyula  Horn] about this after yesterday's MSZP congress.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] [passage  omitted] We know that this government has to take very tough  economic steps to sort out the country's economy. When do you  think these steps have to be taken? Can steps of this nature be  delayed?    [Horn] [passage omitted] The difficulties are just ahead of  us. By difficulties I mean the country's extremely serious  crisis, because that is what we are talking about. The  financial burdens and financial liabilities are enormous. The  next government's room for maneuver is extremely narrow. There  is a lot we do not yet know, and I have to admit I am afraid  that the next government will be surprised at a lot of things.    [Correspondent] What kind of surprises are you thinking of?  Do you think the outgoing government has not given sufficient  information?    [Horn] When we studied the documents we asked for and which  were promised by [Prime Minister] Peter Boross, we found that  the documents did not give a realistic picture of 1994,  especially of what can be expected in the second half of 1994  and what obligations fall on the next government, which is the  successor of the previous government in this sense. We are not  supposed to break any law or agreement made by the previous  government. [passage omitted]    At the same time, we want to speed up and widen the  opportunities in international relations which, in our view, can  help realize the tasks of modernization. Very urgent meetings  and international negotiations are indispensable for this with  partners such as Germany or Austria, or -- of a totally  different nature -- with Slovakia. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] [passage omitted] It was five years ago that  you, with Alois Mock, cut through the Iron Curtain. [passage  omitted] I could say there is something symbolic in your  becoming prime minister in Hungary five years after this. But I  think it will be quite difficult to surpass that achievement. Am  I wrong?    [Horn] [passage omitted] I am interested in only one thing  --  that we fully meet our commitments toward the electorate, the  country. [passage omitted] We would like to achieve prosperity  for the 10.5 million strong Hungarian nation [magyarsag] living  within our national borders, whether they voted for us or not.  This is our mission. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

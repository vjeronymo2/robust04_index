			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, is on his  way to Indonesia for a two-day visit, refusing to say whether he  will raise Jakarta's magazine bans when he meets President  Suharto on Tuesday. Linda Mottram reports that Mr. Keating also  used a final parliamentary question time prior to his departure  to reassert his right to discuss his republican agenda for  Australia while overseas.    [Begin recording] [Mottram] Mr. Keating's visit will focus  on trade as well as the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Forum]  leaders' meeting to be held in Jakarta later this year. In  parliament, Mr. Keating said the relationship with Indonesia is  a high objective for the Australian Government. But, responding  to opposition questioning on the magazine ban issue, Mr. Keating  said Australia's concerns had already been voiced, refusing to  say whether he would raise the matter with President Suharto.    [Keating] I am not in the business of saying to the leader  of the opposition on the [words indistinct] what I'll say  because it [words indistinct] before I say it.    [Mottram] Mr. Keating was also pressed by the opposition on  his comments two years ago in Jakarta about wanting to see a new  Australian flag. Mr. Keating again distinguished his right to  articulate his government's policy on an Australian Republic,  but he avoided reference to the flag. [end recording]</p>

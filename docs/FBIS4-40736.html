			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 18 (TASS) -- There is a positive thing  about the public accord treaty: "The political struggle in  Russia ceases to be a political squabble and becomes a political  competition," Sergey Filatov, chief of staff of the president's  administration, said today. He spoke at a meeting of the public  chamber under the Russian president. The public chamber  discussed the implementation of the treaty, signed by 863  representatives of power structures, regions, parties and public  organisations.    Filatov believes at the same time that it is too early for  democratically-minded reformers to relax in conditions of  relative political stability. In his opinion, "a period of an  easy-term credit of confidence for the reformers is over."    He urged the like-minded people to combine two principles in  their ideology -- patriotism and democracy, and on their basis  to work for accord in society. In order to work out a strategy  of joint actions, the reformers will hold a forum of democratic  forces next autumn in Moscow.    The purpose of today's meeting of the public chamber was to  set up five commissions included in it -- on political  stability, on socio-economic problems, on the federal setup and  inter-ethnic relations, on the safety of individuals and the  security of society and on problems of science, education and  culture. Those commissions were assigned the task of organising  control over the implementation of the public accord treaty and  drawing up recommendations to be approved at meetings of the  public chamber.</p>

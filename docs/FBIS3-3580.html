According to officials from the World Health Organization  (WHO), the province, home to 26 nationalities, has reached the  level of moderately developed countries in the field.    Since Yunnan is located at an average sea-level of above  2,000 meters, the diversity in climate and natural environment  resulted in spread of many epidemic disease like snail fever,  malaria, leprosy and goiter.    In 1930s, a plague hit Simao region, killing tens of  thousands of people at this important material port in Southeast  Asia.    Thanks to undertakings to improve medical and health  conditions after New China was founded, epidemic diseases have  been so far brought under strict control.    The Ministry of Public Health reported that infectious  incidence rate has seen a dramatic drop in the past 12 years.  Only four out of 10,000 catch such diseases as goiter, malaria  and leprosy in some prefectures.    Among the country's border provinces, Yunnan has become the  first with 85 percent of the population meeting vaccination  requirements set by WHO.    More than half of its rural population of 32 million,  including a large proportion who are ethnic people, now have  access to clean water.    So far, the province has 6,500 hospitals, over 130,000  medical professionals and practitioners and 82,000 hospital  beds, respectively 67-fold, 135-fold and 134-fold more than in  1950.    And a medical network throughout its 127 counties helps the  province keep an eye on epidemic diseases.    Despite the great progress, it is not easy for the province  to achieve the goal of every resident enjoying health care at  the end of this century, as medical education is difficult to  reach its mountainous areas because of poor transportation.</p>

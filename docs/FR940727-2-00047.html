According to the complaint, the respondents' advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that either or both body building products: (1) cause users to lose more body fat and gain more muscle than non-users; (2) cause users to lose body fat and gain muscle more rapidly than non-users; (3) cause users to gain more muscle than users of other body building products; (4) have been demonstrated by scientific research to cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (5) work for all people; and (6) are new and unique. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Weight Loss Products <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's complaint also charges that the respondents deceptively advertised there weight loss products, Cybergenics CyberTrim, Cybergenics Mega-Fat Burner, and Cybergenics QuickTrim. According to the complaint, the respondents' advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that one or more of the wright loss products: (1) cause users to lose body fat and weight more rapidly than non-users; (2) cause users to lose weight and lose or burn more body fat than non-users; (3) cause users to lose more body fat and weight than users of all other weight loss products; (4) cause users to lose weight more rapidly than the users of all other weight loss products; (5) are superior to other appetite suppressants; (6) suppress hunger and the biochemical message stimulated by the catabolism of fat; (7) cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (8) contain an ingredient, chromium picolinate, that has been clinically proven to reduce fat and lower cholesterol; (9) are new and unique; (10) cause users to maintain weight loss longer than non-users; (11) cause maturing women to lose more weight than non-users of the product; (12) are easy to use; and (13) have been demonstrated by scientific evidence to cause users to lose more fat and weight, and to gain more muscle, than non-users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Use of Testimonials <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's complaint also charges that statements and depictions, including ``before'' and ``after'' pictures, in the respondents' advertisements for their body building and weight loss products, represent that the testimonials from consumers who use the advertised product reflect the typical or ordinary experience of members of the public who use the products. According to the complaint, the respondents did not have a reasonable basis for this representation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the complaint alleges that the use of a picture of a man in an advertisement for Cybergenics Total Body Building System ``before'' and ``after'' he used the product for six months is false and misleading. The man pictured in the advertisement, according to the complaint, was a champion body builder prior to the time when the ``before'' picture was taken and, therefore, is not typical of users of the product, and his results as shown in the ``after'' picture are not typical of the experience of ordinary members of the public who use the product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Letter: Roads are not free Sir, You say ('Privatisation plus for BR', May 19) that 'state-owned railway tracks endure charges while users of state-owned roads go free'. With due respect, that is nonsense. There used to be a road fund into which all owners of vehicles paid an annual contribution called the road fund licence. They still pay it, but the government purloined that money for other uses and changed the name of the tax to hide the fact.

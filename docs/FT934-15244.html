			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Mexico plans S American trade pact THE Mexican government plans to sign a free trade agreement with Venezuela, Colombia and possibly Bolivia by the end of this year, and another with Costa Rica, according to Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican trade minister. Mr Serra told the Financial Times the government hoped to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) early next year. Entry should be eased by passage of a new, more liberal foreign investment law, which the government is expected to submit to Congress at the end of this year. Mr Serra said the foreign investment law would be submitted whether or not the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is ratified. The substance of the proposed legislation would be similar in either eventuality, but the access that it gave to specific countries could be different. Mexico has been concurrently negotiating trade agreements with Central America, Venezuela and Colombia in an effort to balance the proposed agreement with the US. President Carlos Salinas said last week that Mexico's relations with the US could be damaged if the trade accord with the US and Canada was not approved. Officials are talking of a possible backlash against US companies in such an event. A senior Mexican government official said he would not rule out the possibility that Mexican tariffs would be raised if Nafta was not passed. Such comments may be no more than part of a campaign to press the US Congress into approving the treaty. A move to discriminate against the US could backfire, since Mexico depends on it for about 60 per cent of its direct foreign investment. The Mexican government expects the fate of Nafta to be settled by November 25, the day by which the House of Representatives has been asked by President Clinton to vote on the legislation which permits Nafta to go ahead. The vote in the Senate, where support for the treaty is stronger than in the House, may not come until after the New Year. Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: Mexico has granted a licence for a joint insurance venture between an Iowa-based company and a Mexican insurance broker in the first new foreign licence issued by Mexican insurance authorities in more than 50 years. The licence allows Principal International to complete an agreement with Servicios Especiales Profesionales to market life insurance and pensions plans.</p>

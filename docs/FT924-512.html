			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Spanish bank accused in fraud inquiry BANCO SANTANDER, Spain's most aggressive commercial bank, has been accused by the country's senior monetary court judge of inducing some of its clients to commit a huge tax fraud. The bank has been ordered to post by Sunday a bond of Pta8bn (Pounds 46.1m), thought to be the biggest ever set in Spain. The order brings to a head a long investigation by judge Miguel Moreiras into the creation by Santander of a tax avoidance instrument, called a credit assignment, in the late 1980s. In a hostile ruling made on Tuesday, Mr Moreiras said he had found 'clear evidence of criminality' against Santander's president, Mr Emilio Botin, its managing director, Mr Rodrigo de Echenique, its directors general and regional and local office managers. Although Mr Moreiras is still investigating the case, legal experts said yesterday his comments significantly increase pressure on Santander. It is up to Mr Moreiras to decide whether to go to trial and who to try. Mr Moreiras' ruling - rejecting an appeal by the bank to shelve the investigation - even questioned Santander's suitability to continue operating as a bank, saying it had abused the confidence of the Finance Ministry - the ultimate bank licensing authority - by committing a 'multitude of fraudulent acts' against the revenue service. He said Santander had made 45,000 credit assignments between 1986 and 1989. Santander says they were legal, but the judge said the bank incited and assisted selected clients to evade taxes. The credit assignment, he said, was 'a contract to commit a fraud'. Credit assignments were prompted by high Bank of Spain reserve requirements, under which banks were required to match a portion of their deposits with obligatory, interest free, deposits with the Bank of Spain. This greatly increased the cost of funding. Using the assignments, Banco Santander would sell loans in its portfolio to a customer. The payment from the customer was not regarded as a deposit and was thus 'liberated' from the reserve rules. Also, the customer's payment attracted interest from the bank but as the amount was not a deposit, Santander says, the interest was not subject to the withholding tax applied to normal deposits. Banco Santander said yesterday it 'categorically rejected' Mr Moreiras' view that the 'payments' were subject to withholding tax as a normal deposit would have been. But Mr Moreiras also indirectly accuses the bank of misleading the tax authority. Frequently, in some 8,000 assignments, worth more than Pta20m each, 'it appears that the names of the certificate holder given by the bank to the revenue service do not coincide with documentation recovered by this court'. Banco Santander owns nearly 10 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland and 16 per cent of First Fidelity Bancorp of the US.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Barclays card unit to help debtors BARCLAYCARD, the card payments arm of Barclays, plans to help set up a new consumer debt counselling service with a network of up to 25 centres covering 90 per cent of the UK population, David Barchard writes. The scheme is modelled on the US National Foundation for Consumer Credit in Houston, Texas. Debtors will be given help in arranging repayment programmes to clear their problem loans over agreed periods of up to four years by paying the credit counselling service a fixed amount each month. The service then shares the payment out between an individual's creditors. Barclaycard says that, unlike other debt-counselling services which have to be maintained through donations, this one will fund itself through contributions from creditors linked to debt repayment.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Invesco shuffles board as profits fall INVESCO MIM, the UK-based fund management group, is to combine the roles of chairman and chief executive into a single role, that of executive chairman. That post will be filled by the current chief executive Mr Charles Brady. The move is part of a wide-ranging reorganisation of the group's board structure following a series of well publicised and highly embarrassing business dealings under Invesco's former chairman and chief executive, Lord Stevens. Invesco will establish separate boards for each of its businesses in North America, Europe and Asia and the group board will be restructured to include a majority of non-executive directors. 'We hope to avoid what went on in the past,' Mr Brady said in explaining why he had sought the new structure. 'There is a different regulatory culture in each of the three regions and we must be sensitive to each.' Mr Brady will be the only executive to sit on all three regional boards as well as on the main board. He said that although the best practice in corporate governance discourages combining the roles of chairman and chief executive, he believed that the new board structure would ensure that authority was not concentrated in a single individual. Mr Brady also said the US Attorney's Office in Atlanta had dropped its investigation into allegations that officials in the group's US division had made gifts to officials at one of its big pension fund clients, the utility company Southern Corporation. Mr Brady said Invesco had been asked to answer questions last autumn by the US Attorney about the matter and that it had since been told that the US Attorney was satisfied. Yesterday, Invesco also unveiled its 1992 results, showing pre-tax profits after exceptional items down from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 12.6m. The dividend for the year is being halved to 3p via a final of 2p. The results included a Pounds 410,000 charge stemming from the write-off of systems and development costs related to the Stock Exchange's decision to cancel its Taurus paperless trading system. The company also took a further Pounds 2.8m charge stemming from costs related to a feasibility study it conducted last year into a flotation of the US businesses. The company's results show that revenues from Invesco's US operations dwarf those from Europe, where the company is losing institutional clients, and Asia. See Lex</p>

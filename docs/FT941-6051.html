			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hollas seeks Pounds 17.3m to fund purchases Hollas Group, the Manchester-based clothing and textiles group, yesterday announced a Pounds 17.3m rights issue that will double the size of the company. The proceeds will be used to acquire two companies - Textilion, a maker of ladies' wear, knitwear and children's clothing, and JB Hunter, holding company of Edward Macbean, which specialises in making clothing for foul weather. The purchases are conditional on shareholder approval at an EGM on March 25. The 5-for-4 rights issue of 73m ordinary shares, fully underwritten by Charterhouse Tilney Securities, will be at 25p a share. The shares closed at 31p, down 1p. In January Hollas announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 254,000 for the six months to end-September following a review of its activities by the new management team which resulted in exceptional costs of Pounds 705,000. Yesterday it forecast a final dividend of 0.3p for the enlarged share capital, giving a total of 0.6p for the year. Hollas is paying Pounds 5m for Textilion, subject to a downward adjustment if pre-tax profits for the year to end-February come in at less than Pounds 440,000 or if net assets are below Pounds 2.59m. In the 1993 year Textilion made operating profits of Pounds 442,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.2m. Net debt at February 4 this year was Pounds 5.6m. The initial consideration for Hunter is Pounds 3.48m, subject to downward adjustment if it does not make a pre-tax profit for the 13 months to March 31 or if net assets are below Pounds 775,000. In the year to February 26 1993 Hunter made operating profits of Pounds 627,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.85m. Net debt at February 4 was Pounds 1.3m. Mr Julian Lee, who came out of retirement to become group chief executive of Hollas in October, said the company had been drifting sideways for several years. Textilion, whose customers include Marks and Spencer, Next and Boots, would complement Gardner, the clothing importer at the heart of Hollas, whose customers include BHS and Woolworths, Mr Lee said. Edward Macbean's protective clothing was a new direction for Hollas. But the potential for quality goods in the health and safety equipment area was tremendous in both the UK and Europe, he said. Mr Lee, who has 2.7m shares, plans to take up all his rights. On Tuesday Mr Jaymin Trivedi, the biggest shareholder with 13 per cent, resigned as a non-executive director because he felt there would be a conflict of interest after the acquisition. He wanted to take up 100 per cent of his rights, but has agreed to take up only 80 per cent.</p>

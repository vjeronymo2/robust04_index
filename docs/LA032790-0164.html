			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STARS PRESS ENVIRONMENTALISM  </P> <P> Some movie stars stayed clear of Hollywood on Academy Awards night.  </P> <P> Christopher Reeve, Susan Sarandon, Ron Silver, Jennifer Beales and Alec  Baldwin, all members of The Creative Coalition, met with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo  and state legislators Monday to promote environmental bills.  </P> <P> "I think sometimes there's a skeptical attitude about celebrities, that we just  do quick hits," Reeve said. "We are a serious group."  </P> <P> The politically active artists' group has pledged to exploit its celebrity  status to promote legislation in New York state that aims to protect the  environment.  </P> <P> "State government has become more powerful as the federal government has  withdrawn from matters of concern to the people of the state and the nation,"  said Silver, the organization's president.  </P> <P> The group supports Cuomo's proposed $1.9-billion environmental bond act, and  will identify lawmakers who try to block pro-environment bills, Silver said.  </P></p>

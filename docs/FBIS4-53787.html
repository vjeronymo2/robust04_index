			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of two-part article by staff reporter Sim Chae-yun] </F>   [Text] Another controversial point with regard to the SOFA  [Status of Forces Agreement] is the allegation that the  bilateral pact has provided the USFK servicemen and their  dependent relatives in Korea with too much preferential  treatment especially in connection with customs duties and use  of military facilities.    So far, the SOFA problems have been neglected to some  extent,  over-shadowed by the pressing need to deal with the "biased"  pact concerning the U.S. criminal suspects.    The agreement virtually enables civilian components and the  their dependents to enter and depart the country with no limit  if they carry appropriate documents issued by the U.S.  authorities without undergoing formalities in accordance with  the (Korean) Immigration Control Law, said Prof. Yi Chang-hui of  the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.    This is in sharp contrast with a pact between the U.S. and  NATO treaty countries, requiring the families of military  personnel to adhere to the relevant domestic laws without any  preferential treatment, Yi said.    What is more problematic is that the U.S. military  servicemen  and their families' entry of materials, supplies and equipment  are free from custom duties and other such charges. They only  have to bring appropriate certifications issued by the USFK  according to a provision of Article 9.    In NATO nations, they need to take necessary procedures as  demanded on civilians through airports in general.    "In part, it is understandable to offer privileges to the  USFK personnel and their dependents taking into account the  specific security situation and the urgent need for joint  defense," said Yi.    "But what matters is that the SOFA acknowledges too many  favors and exceptions," he added.    Some military personnel and their families are suspected of  engaging in smuggling, thus disturbing local market order in  Korea, taking advantage of loopholes in our tax system, an  official of the National Campaign for Eradication of Crime by  U.S. Troops in Korea alleged yesterday. "Some USFK personnel  carry in goods like electric appliances from Japan and Hong Kong  for commercial purposes after spending holidays there," he  alleged.    Prof. Yi also claims the U.S. military and convenience  facilities located outside military camps should controlled  under the relevant regulations and laws of Korea.    Some radical activists even go so far as to argue that the  United States should pay for the USFK's use of facilities in  Korea.    The Defense Ministry maintains a cautious attitude on their  demand, saying, "The matter should be considered seriously."    "We need pay heed of the specific security situation," a  ministry official in charge of U.S. relations said.    But he emphasized the need to revise the SOFA as far as the  matter of dealing with the U.S. criminal suspects is concerned.  "The agreement should be developed in a desirable direction," he  said.    The Foreign Ministry also recognizes the necessity to  rewrite  the SOFA in relation with judiciary rights. "What needs review  in the SOFA is the one related to jurisdiction," he said.    "But it does not necessarily mean that we will start  negotiation right now," he added.</p>

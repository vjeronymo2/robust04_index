			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MD. BACK WINS ACADEMIC APPEAL  </P> <P> Redshirt freshman Frank Wycheck, one of the main weapons in the University of  Maryland's one-back offensive set, has narrowly averted being ruled  academically ineligible for the 1990 football season.  </P> <P> Wycheck was declared academically eligible Wednesday after the academic support  group within the university's athletic department reviewed his appeal.  </P> <P> Wycheck, 6-feet-2 and 214 pounds, was declared academically ineligible Tuesday  by the same group because he was two-thousandths of a point away from the  needed grade point average of 1.78, out of a possible 4.0.  </P> <P> The loss of Wycheck could have been devastating for the Terrapins, who are  using the one-back set as their base offense this year. Maryland opens its  season Saturday against Virginia Tech at Byrd Stadium.  </P></p>

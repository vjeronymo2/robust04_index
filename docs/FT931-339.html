			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (5): Bond-for-debt swap - Banking reform THE essence of the former Yugoslav self-management system was an incestuous relationship between credit- hungry enterprises and the captive banks which they ambiguously 'owned'. The legacy, in Slovenia and throughout former Yugoslavia, can be seen in debt-strapped enterprises and bank balance sheets stuffed with non- performing assets, write Anthony Robinson and Laura Silber. The Slovenian banks were widely perceived as the most professional and competent in the former federation. But they shared many of the basic weaknesses of the old system and their post-independence performance remains distorted by bad debt and the effective confiscation of hard currency deposits transferred to the former Yugoslav central bank, the National Bank of Yugo- slavia (NBY). On January 27, however, the Slovene parliament passed a law which opened the way for banking reform by providing a state guarantee for special bonds to finance the restruc- turing of banks and savings institutions. Reform starts from the assumption that eliminating the financial consequences of the previous system is a long-term project which will have to be financed by the Slovene taxpayer. The method chosen is through the issue of DM3.5bn, 30-year government guaranteed bonds with an 8 per cent coupon, payable quarterly. The bonds will be swapped for specific portions of the bad debt held by commercial banks. The coupon payments will show up on bank income statements, replacing what until now have been accumulated losses. The first bond-for-debt swap has been earmarked for Ljubljanska Banka (LjB), by far the largest of the 31 local and two foreign banks operating in the country. LjB accounts for around 50 per cent of the assets and liabilities in the Slovene banking system and handles around 70 per cent of foreign financial activities. When its 13 'daughter banks' are included, the LjB group accounts for 75 to 78 per cent of total Slovene assets and deposits. Reducing the hitherto preponderant share of LjB is one of the main objects of bank reform. 'In future, we would like to see the emergence of four or five banks of roughly equal size as the basis of a competitive banking system,' says Mr Mitja Gaspari, the finance minister. The process has already begun with the hiving of SKB bank from the LjB group three years ago and the emergence of other former LjB daughter banks, such as Mariborska Banka, as potential core banks in the new system. The task of restructuring the LjB group has been given to Mr Marko Voljc, an experienced international banker. Mr Voljc, a 45-year-old polyglot, is a development banker who returned to Slovenia in September after 13 years at the World Bank. He was appointed as the bank's new chairman and chief executive on the same day as the new bank guarantee law specifically singled out Ljubljanska as the key to reform of the banking system. Mr Voljc spent three years as the World Bank representative in Mexico before returning to Washington in 1990 as head of the Central America and Panama division. For LjB, which is now 100 per cent state-owned, bad debt is less of a problem than those caused by the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the financial irresponsibility of the Serbian authorities in particular. The NBY in Belgrade currently holds around DM450m of frozen Slovene hard currency funds and a further DM850m deposited in the LjB's Croatian subsidiary which were also frozen, and in effect spent, by Belgrade. The LjB in turn is seeking compensation from Zagreb for the seizure of its Croatian subsidiary. Mr Voljc calculates that two-thirds of the bank's non-performing debt is represented by frozen foreign currency accounts, and only one third by the bad debt of Slovene and other former Yugoslav enterprises. This is significant because the Slovene state will refinance only the bad debts of Slovene enter- prises through the new bonds. In the meantime, the bank is methodically converting blocked hard currency accounts into new, convertible hard currency accounts. Most of the 33,000 such accounts were small, individual accounts and over 90 per cent of the small accounts up to DM3,500 have already been converted or are being converted at the rate of DM500 a month. 'In some ways, the problems are more difficult now than a year ago. But we now have a new government with a four- year mandate and we are starting to concentrate on economic reform rather than political battles. The legal framework is in place and the government has the time horizon required for banking reform to work,' Mr Voljc says. What is more, Slovenia is no longer alone. The World Bank, limited in its assistance because of Slovenia's relatively high income, has earmarked Dollars 150m to help bank reform and Slovenia has become a full member of the IMF, the European Bank for Recons- truction and Development and other institutions. Closer ties are also being forged with neighbouring Austrian and Italian banks in particular. On balance, however, the Slovene authorities would prefer foreign banks to enter into joint ventures or take minority shareholdings in Slovene banks rather than set up wholly-owned subsidiaries. Banking, together with tourism, is precisely the kind of clean, high value added service industry on which Slovenia hopes to base the transformation of its economy.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE  </P> <P> San Diego County began sending out a new pamphlet this week to mental health  clients and service providers, marking the final settlement of a lawsuit over  cuts in the mental health budget in October, 1988.  </P> <P> The pamphlet lists what services the county will provide and includes detailed  grievance procedures clients can use if they feel they have been unfairly  denied services.  </P> <P> The grievance procedure was developed to settle the Legal Aid Society of San  Diego's contention that clients were denied due process when $3.2 million was  cut from the budget.  </P> <P> The lawsuit's other key contention, that the county was required to give a  minimum level of service to the mentally ill, became moot in February, 1989.  Superior Court Judge Robert E. May notified the parties then that an appellate  court decision in a similar Los Angeles suit would require him to reject that  argument. Since then, attorneys have been negotiating over the due-process  issue.  </P></p>

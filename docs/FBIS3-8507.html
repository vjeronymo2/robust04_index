			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 10 (TANJUG)--Leader of the Serbian  Radical Party Dr Vojislav Seselj said on Thursday the Washington  agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation had given the Serbs the  most favourable opportunity to unify all their territories.    The Serbian Radical Party is the second-strongest opposition  party in the Serbian Parliament.    "If Jamahiriya (Seselj's term for the Bosnian Moslem state)  and the Bosnian-Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna can subsequently  enter a confederation with Croatia, who can prevent the Bosnian  Serb Republic to join Yugoslavia," Seselj underscored at a press  conference. According to him, Serb politicians should use this  opportunity in the best possible way.    He added, however, that the Belgrade authorities had voiced  their restraint on the issue and lacked courage to make a more  resolved move in their foreign policy. He urged that the  Bosnian Serb Republic and the Republic of Serb Krajina should  merge, and consequently have one government, prime minister and  parliament.    Asked about Germany's decision to expel nationals of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, mainly ethnic Albanians from  Serbia's province of Kosovo/Metohija, Seselj said it was a way  of putting pressure on Belgrade. He added that this problem  could be solved at the border.    His solution for the problem was to deny entrance to  Yugoslavia to all Albanians who had illegaly come to  Kosovo/Metohija in 1948 and later, and who had not acquired  Yugoslav citizenship. As for ethnic Albanians who had refused  to serve their military term with the Yugoslav Army and had,  therefore, escaped to Germany, they should immediately be  arrested.</p>

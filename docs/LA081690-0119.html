			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SERVING COURSE GIVES BARTENDERS SOME ADVICE FOR A CHANGE;  </P> <P> ALCOHOL: ASK-L.A. TEACHES ABOUT THE ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF SERVING  DRINKS, SUCH AS WHEN AND HOW TO SAY NO TO INTOXICATED CUSTOMERS.  </P> <P> Among the many pastimes resurfacing from yesterday and yesteryear, cocktail  lounging seems to be back vogue.  </P> <P> Los Angeles neighborhood bars may be a dying breed in these times of tougher  drunk-driving regulations, but several local restaurants report that they are  crammed with after-work and late-evening crowds of youthful imbibers delighting  in their first taste of low lights, tinkling pianos and heady potions that  slipped from favor years ago when vodka became the main ingredient in 80% of  the hard-alcohol-based beverages served commercially in America.  </P> <P> As social drinking becomes trendy again and with more than one bartender  scratching his head -- uncertain as to what actually goes into a sidecar, much  less which seven liqueurs make up a pousse cafe and in what order -- ASK-L.A.  couldn't have made its debut at a better moment.  </P> <P> ASK-L.A. is the definitive Alcohol Server Knowledge course. Designed by the  health and safety experts at the National Safety Council and implemented within  the last year by 40 agencies around the country -- including the Bartender  Training Institute in Glendale -- the course aims to educate bar and restaurant  personnel in the art of responsible customer management, according to Al  Lauersdorf, the council's alcohol program manager.  </P> <P> The council's frightening statistics make it appear that the course hasn't  arrived a moment too soon: About 25,000 people die and 700,000 more are injured  in alcohol-related traffic accidents each year. Alcohol is a factor in more  than half of all fatal motor vehicle crashes and half of all the intoxicated  drivers on the road got that way in public drinking establishments. Add these  numbers to our local barroom boom and the need for the safer serving of alcohol  becomes even more urgent.  </P> <P> Oregon, Utah and Florida already require that any individual involved in the  sale of alcohol complete a server's course, and in Texas, the server is immune  from the server's liability law if he or she takes and passes such a course.  Chicago has just passed legislation requiring applicants for new liquor  licenses to attend an alcohol server's program.  </P> <P> Scott Carlin, owner and director of the Bartender Training Institute in  Glendale, the only venue at which the ASK-L.A. course is available locally,  predicts that California will soon move onto the list of concerned states  taking action.  </P> <P> "Some type of alcohol server training is likely to become mandatory nationwide  in the not-distant future," Carlin said. "This will not be an  alcohol-prohibitive measure, it will be alcohol management, which has become a  must in our society. Alcohol is a social lubricant and people are always going  to drink, but it's mind-altering and requires controls. In California, you need  a license to cut hair or sell real estate, but as some sort of social  pharmacist a bartender is allowed to dispense a powerful drug without ever  being trained.  </P> <P> "Responsible service is good for the public," Carlin said, "because it results  in saved lives, and it's good for business because knowledgeable servers can  drastically reduce the threat of liability when a customer drives away in an  intoxicated state, and can also help lower insurance rates."  </P> <P> ASK-L.A. is a five-hour, $65 course taught at the Bartender Training Institute  by instructors certified by the National Safety Council. Servers are trained to  recognize signs of alcohol impairment in the customer who has been in an  establishment for an evening as well as the one who has just walked in the  door. They also are taught methods of politely discontinuing service.  </P> <P> "There are no set rules," Carlin said. "It isn't as simple as deciding that  three drinks will make any person drunk; each individual reacts differently to  alcohol. At what point a customer you've been serving drinks has reached his or  her own personal limit depends on many things: whether the person has been just  sitting or up moving around, also on whether the person has eaten during the  evening. With a brand-new customer, you definitely need to know what to look  for."  </P> <P> An ASK-L.A. class has 10 to 15 students who also learn friendly, effective ways  to discourage drinking and driving and who join fellow classmates in  role-playing exercises to help find answers to "What if . . . ?" questions.  </P> <P> Such interaction is contrary to yet another feature of this, the oldest  bartending school operating in the state. At the institute, there is no such  thing as a bartending class. All instruction is done the old-fashioned way,  one-on-one behind the bar.  </P> <P> Who goes to bartending school in times when the national salary average for  this moveable skill is $100 a day in wages and tips? Nearly as many women as  men of all ages attend the institute with goals ranging from a first job to a  career change.  </P> <P> "One of my students had been a mechanical engineer for 15 years and wanted a  new direction," Carlin said. "A friend of his who owned two taverns in England  had offered him a job if he'd learn the trade. He did and I later got a  postcard from him; he was tending bar in London and happy as a clam."  </P> <P> Scott himself is a 1975 graduate of the institute. "I was 24 years old and a  ski bum. In October of 1974, I went up to Mammoth looking for work so I could  spend the winter, but all I could find was one bartending job. I didn't  qualify, so I ended up in Park City, Utah, in food services, watching the  bartenders work nights, ski all day and make good money. When the snow melted,  I came back to L.A. and enrolled in the institute. I went there because I'd  heard the training was good. Little did I know I'd end up owning the place."  </P> <P> After Carlin graduated, he went to work in a restaurant, but when he found  difficulty finding bartenders for private parties, he had business cards  printed and became a one-man free-lance operation. His bartender-for-hire  business took off slowly but surely and he went on to form Scotty's Party  Service, a company still going strong.  </P> <P> The Bartender Training Institute began in Hawaii in 1962 with owner Ed Hanna  bringing the business to the Mainland four years later. Carlin always kept up  his old school ties and in 1986, when Hanna was considering retirement, Carlin  bought the business.  </P> <P> "I've never been sorry," Carlin said. "Not about buying the school and not  about becoming a bartender. Actually, I was just going to do it until I figured  out what I wanted to do with my life and got a real job. I realize more and  more, especially now that we're an agency of the National Safety Council's  Alcohol Server Knowledge program, that this is a real job -- a real important  one. Of course, every once in a while I think about my childhood dream of being  a fireman. But doesn't everyone?"  </P> <P> The Bartender Training Institute -- 3843 San Fernando Road, (818) 247-9968 --  offers a 40-hour program in beverage preparation and service and a 16-hour  course for cocktail waiters and waitresses that teaches drink names,  appropriate garnishes, plus how to order and serve. Courses range in price from  $300 to $1,380 for a 100-hour course that includes bar management, checkout  training and the ASK-L.A. seminar.  </P> <P> The institute is approved as a post-secondary trade school by the State Board  of Education; graduating students receive a certificate of completion.  </P></p>

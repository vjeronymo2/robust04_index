			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> OVER 1,200 OUT AT CONTINENTAL  </P> <P> More than 1,200 flight attendants with Continental Airlines, like Eastern  Airlines a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., have gone on strike, a union  spokeswoman said today on the second day of a walkout.  </P> <P> "We've had 1,207 flight attendants either walk off of aircraft or not show up  for work. We're very encouraged," spokeswoman Myra Clayton said. "Those are not  people who are sick or have days off." Continental has had to delay a number of  flights, she said, and called in all its reserve employees.  </P> <P> Continental, however, said in a statement that only about 2% of its 6,500  flight attendants have responded to the call by the Union of Flight Attendants  and said the action has had no effect on its operations.  </P></p>

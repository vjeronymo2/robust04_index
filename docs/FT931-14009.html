			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / 'Gold-plate era' ends at Lloyd's VISITORS to the chairman's office at Lloyd's of London will no longer be greeted and served tea by 'waiters' in Victorian navy blue and crimson tail coats. Mr 'Tug' Wilson and Mr Malcolm Archard will be the last 'chairman's waiters' in Lloyd's 305-year history. Their redeployment this week signals the adoption of a more business-like approach at the Lloyd's Corporation and the end of what one insider called the 'gold-plated era', as the market adapts to more difficult circumstances after three years of heavy losses. Of the 26 other ancillary staff who worked for the leaders of the Lloyd's market, 12 will lose their jobs this week - among them two of the four chauffeurs formerly assigned exclusively to the chairman, his two deputies and the chief executive. The corporation's Rolls-Royce was sold last year, leaving Lloyd's leaders with the occasional use of two Jaguars. 'The days when the Lloyd's chairman sent three people ahead of him on his travels to check the hotel beds have gone,' said Mr Robert Hiscox, one of two new deputy chairmen, who is delighted at the change. 'It should be run as a business, not an institution,' he added. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, announced a Pounds 26m cut in the corporation's budget late last year. This week staff were asked to apply for voluntary redundancy and early retirement as the corporation pressed ahead with plans to axe 272 of the 2,262 jobs. Further more drastic cuts could come in the next few months.</p>

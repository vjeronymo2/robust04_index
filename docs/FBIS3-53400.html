Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown on  Wednesday [12 January] described his visit to the Middle East  next week as the best indication yet of Washington's commitment  to regional economic development as part of the Arab-Israeli  peace process.    Mr. Brown, who is due in Amman on Monday after visiting  Saudi  Arabia, noted that he would be accompanied by representatives of  American businessmen and said one of the objectives of his trip  was to identify areas where the U.S. private sector could be  encouraged to interact with its counterparts in the countries of  the region.    Parallel to that goal, Mr. Brown said, he would also be  "very  aggressively" pursuing the U.S. quest to have the Arab boycott  of Israel lifted.    "I have raised (this issue) with every meeting I had" with  the concerned governments, he said, noting that he was scheduled  to meet with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) ministers in Riyadh  on Sunday.    "The U.S. is going to continue to push to eliminate all  boycotts and I am going to press it with all the leaders with  (whom) I meet, as I have done before, and as President Clinton  has done," he said.    Answering questions from businessmen and journalists from  Amman, Cairo, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in a satellite interview  from Washington, Mr. Brown declined to be specific on most  issues, saying that all options were under consideration during  his visit.    The American official agreed that the continuing de facto  blockade of the port of al-'Aqabah as part of the enforcement of  the U.N. sanctions against Iraq was contrary to the new-found  spirit of free international trade without any barriers.    But he did not indicate when Washington, through its  influence in the U.N. Security Council, would be moving to  address Jordanian grievances over the high cost the Kingdom's  importers and exporters have to pay for shipping to and from  al-'Aqabah as a result of the costly delays posed by the  inspection.    Mr. Brown did promise, however, that he would study a report  prepared by Jordanian businessmen and handed over to a U.S.  fact- finding mission in September.    He appeared to suggest that the sanctions on Iraq were  somehow directly linked to the overall Middle East peace process  by suggesting that once a regional peace settlement is achieved  the Jordanian concerns could be addressed.    "Vestiges of past tension have to be removed,' he said. "We  hope to move as quickly as possible to that date..."    The commerce secretary also agreed that there had to be a  better "equilibrium" in trade between the U.S. and Jordan, but  did not spell out whether the administration was planning  specific action wherever it could help increase American imports  from Jordan.    According to Dr. Thabit al-Tahir, a former minister and a  current member of the Jordan Businessmen's Association (JBA) who  was one of Wednesday's questioners, Jordanian imports from the  U.N. totalled $301 million in the first 10 months of 1993, while  American imports of Jordanian products remained under $4 million.    Mr. Brown acknowledged that one of his objectives during the  visit was to increase U.S. exports to the region. "I also  understand that a commercial relationship is a two-way  street...there has to be an equilibrium...and that is what we  are trying to create."    Mr. Brown said Washington was "committed to the economic  development" of the Middle East so that people can feel peace  has brought changes" to their standards of living.    His visit to the Middle East at "this crucial" point in time  in the peace process, Mr. Brown said, is intended to be a signal  of this commitment.    "I think that is why this mission is so important," he  added.  "With the coming of peace people's expectations are high in all  the countries involved in the region. People believe that their  lives are going to change ..."    According to Mr. Brown, economic development and cooperation  in the region meant increased job opportunities as one of the  most tangible results of the peace process for the ordinary  citizen.    The U.S. official said he and the businessmen accompanying  him were looking forward to "creative kinds of proposals" from  their interlocutors in the region.    He described the level of American investment in the Middle  East as very low and attributed it to a sense of lack of  stability and security and said Washington wanted to find out  "whether we can increase the comfort level ... the confidence  level" of businessmen in investing in the region.    "We are going to establish direct contacts between American  businessmen and Jordanian, Palestinian, Israeli and Saudi  businessmen," he said.    In the context of the American role in Palestinian economic  development, Mr. Brown specifically referred to a group of  Jewish American and Arab American businessmen under the umbrella  of a new group, "Builders for Peace," and said Washington would  be closely coordinating with the group in terms of encouraging  American businesses to invest.    "Builders for peace" was set up under a  Washington-encouraged  initiative undertaken by former senator James Abourisk and  former congressman Mel Devine. it groups many Arab-American as  well as Jewish-American businessmen who have shown keen interest  in investing in the occupied territories.    Infrastructure for the Palestinians in the occupied  territories is an area where immediate opportunities exist for  potential investors, he said.    "There is very little on that agenda (Palestinian economic  development) that we are not talking about now," Mr. Brown told  a Palestinian questioner from Jerusalem.    "The United States has to put a stake in the ground," he  said.</p>

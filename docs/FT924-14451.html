			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Clarkson slumps to Pounds 1.5m THE PROBLEMS at Lloyd's reflected in the first half figures of Horace Clarkson, the shipping and insurance group, where profits crashed 75 per cent and the interim dividend is being cut to a nominal 0.5p. Mr Carron Greig, chairman, said the problems and the heavy losses incurred by Names in 1988 and 1989 made the placing of personal stop loss extremely difficult. That led to substantially reduced brokerage and increased the cost of servicing claims. For the period to June 30 turnover fell to Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 23.9m), with insurance broking contributing Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 10m). Group pre-tax profit came to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 6.1m) after the insurance side made only Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 4.7m). Mr Greig said the majority of insurance income was earned in the first half, and the division as a whole would report a loss for the full year. Earnings per share worked through to 3.5p (15.7p) and the interim payment compares with 2.75p last time.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: French privatisation With western European governments vying to raise up to Dollars 150bn (Pounds 101.4bn) by selling corporate assets over the next five years, France seems well placed to steal the biggest slice of the privatisation gateau. The French government may realise FFr360bn (Pounds 41.5bn) from selling off 21 companies on its initial list. This will help tame its budget deficit. It will also have wider economic significance: expanding the Paris stock market by as much as one-fifth; swelling the ranks of private shareholders; and sharpening the competitiveness of corporate France. Some companies on the list, such as Elf Aquitaine, are well known quoted businesses which should easily attract investors. The Paris market has been starved of good quality industrial stocks. The government, though, may face a stiffer challenge in selling others, such as Air France and Bull, which require extensive restructuring. Moreover, recent opinion polls suggest the public is lukewarm about the programme. This is hardly surprising after the unhappy experiences surrounding the first wave of privatisation. Having been seduced into buying shares in 1986, investors grimly watched the market crash the following year. Since then, most have reverted to high interest money market funds. The government, though, has been devising schemes to rekindle enthusiasm for equities. Tax breaks, free shares and higher dividends for loyal shareholders are some of the latest wheezes. The FFr40bn Balladur bond, convertible into shares in privatised stocks, provides a further ingenious enticement. The critical determinant of privatisation's success, however, may be the scale of foreign involvement. Despite the irritations of French companies' shareholding structures, international investors seem tempted. This largely reflects the belief that the government cannot afford privatisation to fail. The hope is that the best assets will be sold first at attractive prices. The conservative government certainly needs tangible successes before the presidential elections in 1995. Hemmed in by the big budget deficit, the strong franc and a commitment to fiscal austerity, the government will rely heavily on privatisation proceeds to help stimulate the fast fading economy. The need to tackle unemployment is a political imperative. Ironically, unemployment may worsen as companies heading for privatisation cut their workforces. The precarious state of the economy will remain the greatest worry. Sanguine investors may believe recession will enable them to invest at the bottom of the cycle. The majority, though, will surely be deterred by the dismal outlook for corporate earnings. Given the pressures, the French government must be sorely tempted to sell its soul and permit the franc's devaluation. Such a Faustian compact would be the balm for almost all its short-term ills. Falling interest rates, a surging stock market and renascent industrial competitiveness would provide the perfect backdrop for the flotation of privatisation issues. If last week's market pressures develop, the government's resolve may be fiercely tested once again.</p>

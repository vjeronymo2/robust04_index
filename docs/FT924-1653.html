			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japan urged to open its rice market MR Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, yesterday pressed Japan's government to take a 'political' decision to open the country's rice market, to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Japanese politicians have recently indicated willingness to be 'flexible', but Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, yesterday told Mr Andriessen he could not promise foreign rice would be allowed to enter the country. 'A negotiator should not commit himself unless he is sure that whatever he promises can be delivered,' Mr Watanabe said. As he spoke, Japanese farmers held their second day of protests in Tokyo, including a big rally and another tractor drive through the city's streets. Mr Andriessen encouraged Tokyo to accept the tarification of rice, replacing the existing import ban with tariffs. Japanese officials estimate that an initial tariff on rice is likely to be around 700 per cent, and will insist that tariff reductions proceed more slowly than on other products. Japanese officials said they were pleased the EC appeared ready to submit extensive lists of industrial products and suggested tariff reductions. Tokyo was angered earlier this year when both the EC and US missed deadlines for the submission of these product-by-product lists, and there has been concern that the Uruguay Round could falter on industrial, not agricultural, issues. The industrial products issue is of particular concern to Mr Watanabe, who wrote strongly worded letters of criticism to the US and EC in April and who, as a faction leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, is likely to play an important role in any 'political' decision on rice.</p>

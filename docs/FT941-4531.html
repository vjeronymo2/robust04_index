			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (2): All singing from the same sheet / Business briefing - The information you need is probably in the computer system somewhere. But how can you get at it? Claire Gooding looks at some of the ways companies are bringing information into line for better financial control Most computer users know that having too much information is as difficult as not having enough. The problem is one of delivering it accurately, to the right person, in a comprehensible format, at the point when and where it is needed. If the first hour of any meeting is spent arguing about whose figures are right, you probably have too many systems, and none of them quite right. There have been successive waves of software development: accounting systems, management information systems, executive information systems, all promising to be the answer to financial control. Nevertheless, companies still have cash-flow problems, managers still wade through paper-overload, and still re-key data from paper reports or from one computer to another 'Computer systems, and particularly the financial systems, hold vast amounts of data. But is seems that the packages currently available make it quite difficult to interpret and analyse the data for accounting, modelling, cash flow control,' says John Tate, director of the London-based Tate Bramald consultancy that researches and tracks financial software. In 1993, Tate Bramald had more than 1,000 replies to questionnaires sent out to all members of the Chartered Institute of Certified Accountants, asking what they would like most to change in existing software. Reporting facilities came top in the firing line. Mr Tate adds: 'Typically, a computer system will hold most if not all the key information a company needs to meet legal requirements for historic reporting. So it's easy to see what has happened, but it's difficult if in fact it has failed to help them manage their business today and in the future.' He gives cash flow forecasting as an example. Packages contain up-to-date data on how much customers owe and suppliers are owed. Records show how promptly they have paid or been paid, but most systems fail to pull this together. 'An aged debtors report will give you a lovely report on when the the money is due - theoretically,' says John Tate, 'but it won't tell you about customers' payment habits, and how likely you are to get that cash on time. Also, it won't combine it with similar information in the purchase ledger. It all needs to be brought together to do a useful cash-flow.' There is evidence to suggest that many failing companies are actually profitable, or could be, if they had better financial control. In a cautious recovery from recession, running out of cash through over-trading is a constant danger. One bankruptcy can bring swathes of others in its wake: the problems of being a small creditor of a large, slow-paying organisation, are well-documented. Trading in the 1990s is made even more difficult by the speed of change. Speed of response is essential as 'Just-In-Time' manufacturing techniques push the responsibilities for supply and demand further down the line. Companies change hands: alliances are made and broken, as illustrated by the recent takeover of the Rover Group by BMW, and Honda's impending divorce from Rover. Changing circumstances can trigger off a need for new views of existing data. For example, the effect of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the brewing industry has been profound. It brought about a need for all sorts of information that had never before been required: new information technology mechanisms had to be swiftly put in place. Similarly, a sudden change in European Union regulations about importing bananas has brought new challenges for Geest, the fruit importers, (see case study, page 8). Increasing 'globalisation' of business means that conducting business across national borders bring further demands on information delivery. National accounting regulations are complex enough. International consolidations are akin to playing three-dimensional chess through a mirror. All of this takes place at a time when computing has never been more 'personal.' The biggest investment takes place not in hardware or software but in people and their expertise. Managers who become used to using particular tools are loth to give them up in favour of anything new, however 'whizz-bang' they appear. People like what they know. This was one of the constant themes from users interviewed for this issue of Software At Work. Instead of identifying a single market sector and looking at a range of similar applications, (such as computer-aided design or accounting packages for PCs), the broad topic of financial control called for a different approach. The aim was to find out what different sorts of software packages are available, and how adaptable they are in providing financial control. Interviewees ranged from those concerned with the quality of the 'raw ingredients' of financial control - such as timesheet and estimating systems, and even asset management - to those performing international consolidations. In between came executive information systems, and accounting systems with EIS-like extensions. Several of the most common grumbles were familiar IT bugbears. Agreeing on the accuracy of data is still a problem. So is re-keying of data from one system to another. Viewing information from different angles is a common requirement, as is the need to work in multiple dimensions and currencies. The inflexibility of reporting tools is exactly what has led to the development of top-level presentation and analysis software known as 'executive information systems.' These combine sophisticated analysis with intuitive ease of use, with features such as 'drill down,' which allow the user to track down the sources of a high-level figure. There is often a time-lag between the introduction of such tools in to a company, and their actual use. In fact, the main effort in implementing an EIS can come in the analysis phase beforehand, when people are forced to look at what information and systems they already have, and how, why, and where the information flows. Large organisations with in-house skills are typically turning to management information (MIS) or EIS systems and developing their own reporting structures, feeding from disparate databases or spreadsheets. A similar shift is taking place with accounting systems. Companies such as Great Plains, Platinum, and Systems Union are opening up file structures, and making them available to query languages (such as SQL) and reporting products such as Forest and Trees. Standard front-ends and complementary coupling with other packages seem to be the way forward. IMRS' latest release of its Hyperion financial management software features the Standard Query Language, SQL. Many popular packages allow users to cling to familiar rafts, such as the spreadsheets Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel. Their great advantage, as users confirm, is that everyone else uses them: a lingua franca of finance. This is useful in a world where a company runs a number of operating systems, OS, (Tate Bramald's survey found only a quarter of installations ran only one OS, whereas more than 30 per cent ran four or more OSs). Even so, a spreadsheet has its limitations in two dimensional modelling, and data presentation. PA Consulting's senior consultant Keith Robertson takes a dim view of financial managers who are hooked on pretty graphics, and rely on standalone PC systems to deliver them. But he believes that, while the recession slowed technology's progress, the surviving products are of improved quality. This brings its own dangers: business managers who become experts in their own local software solutions, but lose their focus in their fascination with information technology - 'conversations in sports clubs these days often revolve around what facilities particular packages offer,' he adds. 'A business needs to ensure it pays key staff to provide business skills, rather than falling into the trap of becoming a workshop where staff exchange ideas on new IT products and features. 'Nowhere is this more important than in the area of financial control, where the bottom line has real monetary value, rather than merely being represented by a series of various-size graphics of Big Ben in different shades of green.'

In a survey undertaken jointly with the supplier of information systems SAS Institute, CMG interviewed over 240 executives in the mortgage-lending industry. Fewer than 20 per cent of building societies use EIS, and many had failed in their first attempt. Over half used internal development tools. According to senior consultant Bob Frost, 'there are very few true EIS systems around at present. Many which purport to be EIS are merely graphical presentations of existing information. Over the next five years we foresee a convergence of an organisation's information delivery systems.' Details: CMG EIS Survey; tel 071 976 0066.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dutch publisher improves 22% Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, posted a 22 per cent increase in first-half net profit and predicted a rise of about 20 per cent for 1994 as a whole. The first-half increase, in line with a full-year 1993 rise of 23 per cent, took net profit to Fl 169m (Dollars 97m) compared with Fl 138m in the first six months of last year. Sales were up 1.8 per cent to Fl 1.28bn, mainly reflecting divestments of non-core activities. Wolters Kluwer said it saw strong growth in international scientific publishing and in legal and tax publishing in Europe. The group said growth was satisfactory in business publishing, US medical publishing and Dutch educational publishing. The company expects further acquisitions this year to add to those in Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The group is to concentrate on countries in Europe which are eager to join the European Union and where there is demand for detailed information about Europe from tax and legal professionals. Hunter Douglas, the Dutch-based manufacturer of window coverings and architectural products, reported a 35.7 per cent increase in first-half net profit, reflecting strong results in the US and Australia. Net profit rose to Fl 36.5m (Dollars 20.9m) from Fl 26.9m in the first six months of 1993. Turnover was up 14.3 per cent at Fl 970.5m, helped by an 11.6 per cent increase in the volume of sales.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Ban on Shetland fishing widened THE BAN on fishing in an area off Shetland was widened yesterday after tests revealed higher than normal hydrocarbon levels. The ban, which includes the harvesting of farmed fish and shellfish, was imposed on January 8 because of the risk of pollution from the wreck of the Braer. The Scottish Office said the area was being extended by five nautical miles west of the mainland 'to prevent any possible risk to human health'.</p>

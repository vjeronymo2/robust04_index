			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NURSE WHO WANTED TO BE HERO GUILTY IN SLAYING OF 4 PATIENTS  </P> <P> A nurse was convicted Thursday of killing four hospital patients in a scheme to  make them ill, revive them and be recognized as a hero.  </P> <P> Richard Angelo, 27, of Lindenhurst, sat hunched over and stared straight ahead  during the reading of the verdict finding him guilty of murder in two deaths,  manslaughter in one and criminally negligent homicide in the fourth.  </P> <P> Injections, with lethal doses of muscle relaxants, were given patients at Good  Samaritan Hospital in West Islip on Long Island in 1987. The defense  acknowledged that Angelo injected the patients but said he did not mean to kill  them.  </P> <P> Angelo also was convicted of various degrees of assault in connection with the  deaths and on three counts of assault in connection with injections he  administered to one patient who survived. That patient, a 75-year-old man,  described in court how he had fought for breath after a man had injected him.  </P> <P> He could be sent to prison for 50 years to life for the murders when he is  sentenced on Jan. 17.  </P> <P> "What this guy did to all of these people is beyond words," said a sobbing  Kieran Greene, 24, of North Babylon, whose father, Anthony, was one of Angelo's  victims.  </P> <P> "Enjoy jail, Angelo, for the rest of your life," said Greene, who entered the  courthouse when he heard there was a verdict and hugged prosecutor John  Collins.  </P> <P> Suffolk County officials exhumed 33 bodies of patients who died suspiciously  during Angelo's tenure at Good Samaritan. The medical examiner found traces of  Pavulon in six of the bodies exhumed. He determined that Pavulon directly  caused the death of four of the victims.  </P> <P> The prosecution linked Angelo to the Pavulon through Angelo's admissions in  videotaped and written statements and by a syringe laced with Pavulon found in  his apartment before he was arrested.  </P></p>

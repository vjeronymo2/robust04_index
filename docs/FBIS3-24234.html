			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities </F> and regional policy, member of the Government of the Russian  Federation Presidium, and deputy of the State Duma, and Emil  Pain, leader of the group for nationality policy of the  Presidential Council, by Tamara Zamyatina, observer of  ITAR-TASS, specially for SEGODNYA; place and date not given:  "Federalism or Disintegration--There Is No Other Way"]    [Text] The signing of the treaty between Russia and  Tatarstan has spotlighted more clearly in the public  consciousness the polarization of views on the conversion of the  country from a unitary into a truly federative state. The paths  of the formation of federalism in Russia were reflected in the  president's report which Boris Yeltsin delivered to parliament.  Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities and regional policy,  member of the Government of the Russian Federation Presidium,  and deputy of the State Duma, and Emil Pain, leader of the group  for nationality policy of the Presidential Council, an interview  with whom we publish today, took part in the preparation of one  of its sections.    [Zamyatina] The treaty between Russia and Tatarstan has set  "at odds" two positions on the further formation of the  Federation. Is it a step forward and a renunciation of unitary  approaches or is it, as Sergey Baburin declares, a weakening of  the positions of the center? Your viewpoints, gentlemen?    [Pain] My viewpoint is that all regions should in principle  have equal rights, but they have different conditions for their  realization. It is for this reason that they will to a  dissimilar extent delegate authority to the center, and this  means that treaty relations are in the future inevitable with  all regions. In this sense I welcome the agreement with Tataria  as the first swallow of such treaty relations.    [Zamyatina] That is, you believe that bilateral treaties are  needed with each component of the Federation?    [Shakhray] There is a legal and economic possibility of the  conclusion of treaties similar to that with Tataria with each  component of the Russian Federation. And this is not Shakhray's  opinion. This is Article 11 of the Constitution of the Russian  Federation, clause 3 of which says that the terms of reference  shall be delineated "by this constitution and the Federal and  other treaties."    A government program and state approach are needed on this  issue. In addition, a federal law on the principles of the  delineation of terms of reference and authority is needed  urgently to ensure that the bilateral treaties not look like  backstage bargaining.    As far as Tataria is concerned, its leadership has earned  the  title of "locomotive" of federal relations.    Whoever is prepared to negotiate this path and to  scrupulously prepare a similar treaty--certainly, the next in  line. I believe that a treaty will be signed with Kaliningrad  Oblast. This, again, is not just my desire, it is the position  of the president and the Government of the Russian Federation.    [Zamyatina] In speaking of treaty relations, you have  cautiously sidestepped the problem of the Chechen Republic. Is  it possible to achieve a similar agreement with Chechnya?    [Shakhray] The example of Tataria has shown that neither  unilateral declarations nor one-sided pressure nor rulings of  the Constitutional Court work in the relations of the center and  components of the Federation. Only the voluntary delegation of  authority is acceptable. The treaty with Tataria formulated the  sole possible procedure of the removal of the contradictions  between constitutions of the republics and the Constitution of  the Russian Federation. In respect to the Chechen Republic not  the same text but the procedure of the treaty with Tataria is  applicable, I believe.    [Pain] We both believe that a million Russian citizens,  inhabitants of Chechnya, are today hostages to separatist-minded  politicians, have been deprived of protection on the part of the  Russian Constitution, and are living under conditions of growing  crime, and thousands of families have already been forced to  leave their native parts. This situation is, naturally,  intolerable.    But there is a solution only on a strictly legal basis.  Russia must strive for democratic elections in Chechnya with the  participation of all ethnic, social, and political groups of  society....    [Shakhray] ...opposition included.    [Pain] But negotiations between the federal authorities and  the authorities of Chechnya on a delineation of power are now  possible and necessary also.    [Shakhray] Debate here on the subject of what sovereignty  and  competence mean and what is eaten with them is unpromising at  the start of negotiations, particularly if the political and  economic situation is exacerbated. You can speak for as long as  you like about who invests the "sovereignty" concept with what  meaning. But each party understands by these words a sum total  of practical rights: in the foreign economic sphere, in the  management of state property, in budget and tax relations. But  in the consciousness of a politician these concepts should be  out of the frame, as it were. It is necessary for a start to  negotiate on practical matters. Here we have oil industry, for  example, here we have rail transport, here we have the activity  of the law enforcement authorities, here we have tax rates. And  when a specific agreement has been signed on each of these  questions, the political component of the dispute, it  transpires, and its seriousness and debatability disappear. And,  as a result, it transpires that the tasks for the sake of which  the concepts of sovereignty and independence were invented have  already been accomplished, and it is possible to reach agreement  according to other formulas.    [Zamyatina] Why are attempts not being made to realize this  model in relations with the Chechen Republic?    [Pain] A common ideology of the approach to a resolution of  this problem has yet to be formulated at the level of the  Russian leadership. Attempts were made to approach it from  positions of strength, as did Rutskoy, and, on the other hand,  to forget about it altogether, a Bermuda triangle, in which  everything "cooks" itself, as it were, having been created. But  in real life the stereotyped patterns do not work, they prove  unrealistic. In respect to Chechnya, therefore, I find  absolutely comprehensible today merely the impermissibility of  an armed solution of the problem, which would be madness.    [Zamyatina] The two years of Chechnya's independence have  revealed a certain threshold of readiness not only of the  politicians but also of the population of the republic for a  settlement of the situation. Actual steps and action are needed.  What do the Russian authorities think in this connection?    [Shakhray] The authorities are the president, parliament,  and  the government. Any minister or the leader of any department  feels himself to be in an ambiguous position when on the one  hand he is told: "give pensions to the population of Chechnya"  or "allow the transportation of freight," and, on the other,  there is, seemingly, sovereignty and independence there. By the  decisions of the former Supreme Soviet the federal authorities  deemed the elections in Chechnya illegal, and the regime,  illegal, but have not further identified their position. And for  this reason any minister, myself included, not having an  official position, would in embarking upon negotiations be doing  so at his own risk.    [Zamyatina] But you are not "any minister," you are minister  for nationalities and a member of the government presidium....    [Shakhray] I will hold consultations, I am prepared for the  start of negotiations, as soon as the appropriate political  decision is made.    [Zamyatina] In a forecast for 1994 you, Sergey Mikhaylovich,  expressed the fear that the present year could be one of  interethnic conflicts. Your reasoning?    [Shakhray] There are a minimum of three reasons for this.  First, an unconcealed political struggle among democrats,  communists, nationalists, and so forth continues at the federal  level. The regions have been left to their own devices. It is  easy to take advantage of this situation to raise the national  banner or the problem of economic independence.    The second reason is to be found in the text of the new  constitution, from which at the final stage of modification many  provisions that were by nature federative were ejected. This has  engendered a certain tension in some republics. The treaty with  Tataria provided a very big release in this connection,  incidentally, showing that the center is taking the path of the  country's conversion into a genuine federation. Speak with any  Tatar in Moscow (and this is Russia's second biggest nation in  terms of numbers), and it will be confirmed for you that this  treaty is for the Tatars a grand occasion signifying that  Russia's relations with their ethnic homeland have at last been  normalized.    The third reason for a possible exacerbation of interethnic  problems lies in the fact that the Russian population could with  weapon in hand be a party to interethnic conflicts. Note that  thus far the conflicts have been Ossetian-Ingush,  Georgian-Ossetian, Abkhaz-Georgian. But now Cossacks unhappy at  the problems of the redistribution of land and the purge of  personnel in the authorities of practically all national regions  could, for example, be involved in them for the first time.    It should be said for fairness' sake that the unconcealed  supplanting of national personnel, Caucasians primarily, in  various ministries and departments is taking place in Moscow  also. If they are not actually being dismissed, they are, in any  event, being put in a position in which they are being forced to  leave of their own accord....    [Zamyatina] What paths of an alleviation of these tensions  did you attempt to put into the president's report?    [Shakhray] We have already spoken of one possible method in  the example of Tataria, making it understood to the national  republics that there will no longer be a return to voluntarism.    In the report, on the other hand, we tried to explain  convincingly that federation, as a form of state arrangement,  protects the small peoples and nationalities from the pressure  of the central and local bureaucracy.    Another form of protection of the interests of the populace  is the transition from debate to the realization of the concept  of national and cultural autonomy. The time is coming for the  abandonment of the principle of "for each nation--its own  state." It is necessary to proceed along the path of recognition  that Russia is the common form of state self-determination of  all 15 of our national groups.    [Pain] There is an objective contradiction between two types  of organization of the state: national-territorial and  territorial-administrative. But national-territorial formations  cannot be abolished by decree. They are, meanwhile, the sole  form of preservation of the national culture and demographic  self-preservation of the nations.    But the national republics in their present form, while  ensuring the possibility of self-preservation of the titular  nation, far from always create such conditions for a nontitular  nation. Various forms of cultural autonomies are needed for the  national minorities also.    And, finally, all national processes are to a considerable  extent grounded in economics. When truly market relations take  shape, the differences between the national republics and other  components of the Federation will be supplanted.    [Zamyatina] I shall permit myself to quote the classics: "It  is a pity only that neither I nor you will live in this splendid  time." And I would like to bring you, my esteemed partners, back  from the future to the present day--to the search for  practicable solutions to the interethnic problems of the North  Caucasus, for example. You, Emil Abramovich, last year received  the Woodrow Wilson International Center prize for the theory of  prevention of interethnic conflicts. Is it applicable on native  soil?    [Pain] We propose three basic principles of approach to the  nationality problem. The first is the main national parity. Its  essence lies not only in equality between components of the  Federation and not only between people in relation to the law  but also in the fact that no ethnic group on the territory of  the Russian Federation has a monopoly right to resources, to  institutions of power, and so forth. We put this formula of  national parity into the text of the president's report.    The other two principles represent instruments of  realization  of the first, as it were. They concern the self-organization of  the nations on the basis of local government and state  paternalism in respect to national groups which are particularly  in need of care--the small peoples of the North, for example.    [Shakhray] And I would mention that in a country in which  Russians constitute 83 percent of the population, all  politicians need to constantly bear in mind that the general  feelings of all the other peoples of Russia depend on the  general feelings of the Russian nation.    [Pain] And the fate of Russians is still determined to the  greatest extent by how stable society is. I say all this to  spite some artificial forms of the protection of Russians of the  Russian Republic type, which are being put forward frequently.    [Shakhray] As far as Russians in the near abroad are  concerned, Russia has legal, including international-legal,  commitments to them. And the essence of my plan for the  protection of Russians in the near abroad, which will evoke  irritation in some people, consists of Russia being the  successor of the USSR internationally, and of citizens with  passports of the USSR who have not acquired the citizenship of  another state, being under the jurisdiction of Russia.    I believe also that the Russian Federation cannot be fenced  off by economic or border barriers from the republics of the  CIS. This would create an environment for the subsequent  departure from there of the Russian population.    And, the final point: The Russian Federation should not be  embarrassed at maintaining military bases in these regions on a  treaty basis. Because, as events in a number of former Union  republics have shown, other ways of preserving civil peace and  harmony and of preventing conflicts are insufficient.    This argument could be continued, but humanism in quotation  marks leads to hundreds of thousands of people dying on account  of it.    [Pain] I am disturbed in this argument by the fact that the  talk about the protection of Russians is partially reminiscent  of the former Soviet campaigns--like Protection of Children  Month. Whence all kinds of backing and forthing.    [Shakhray] It has reached the point in the State Duma of a  vote on the formation of a committee for the protection of  Russians in Russia. Imagine, this proposal had the support of  140 deputies.    [Zamyatina] And how do you see the protection of the rights  of Russians in the near abroad?    [Pain] As I have already said, the need for such protection  is frequently being discussed today in the spirit of the former  Soviet campaigns. Much in the way of posturing, distortion, and  insincerity. After all, no less urgent than the protection of  rights for the Russian diaspora is the task of self-organization.    More than three-fourths of the Russian diaspora of the near  abroad lives in Ukraine, in Belarus, in Kazakhstan--on land on  which Russians have lived for centuries--and they have no desire  to leave their native parts. For this reason the strategic line  of Russia's policy should be promotion of the full-fledged  inclusion of the Russian diaspora in the life of the new  independent states. In some cases such integration is possible  in the form of cultural autonomy, in others, administrative  autonomy, like the Crimean Republic, but support for the idea of  the reunification of the lands with Russia is absolutely  impermissible. Under the present conditions such demands could  result merely in most acute conflicts, and the first casualties  of these are, as experience shows, the national minorities.    Another important principle of Russia's policy in relation  to  the near abroad should be an extra-ethnic approach to the  defense of human rights. Democratic Russia is simply duty bound  by its international status to prevent the infringement of the  rights both of the Russian diaspora and of all other ethnic  minorities. As the state which is the successor of the Soviet  Union, it must display a readiness (for certain transitional  period) to accept on its territory any citizen of the USSR,  regardless of his nationality.    And, finally, the basis of a civilized policy is always the  principle of equivalence and parity. If Russia is seeking an  improvement in the conditions of the cultural life of Russians  in the near abroad, it should itself do the same for the  minorities residing on its territory. In Ukraine, for example,  there are dozens of functioning Russian theaters, but in Russia,  in which Ukrainians constitute the third group in terms of size,  there is not a single Ukrainian theater. If Russia is seeking  the right of dual citizenship for Russians in Kazakhstan, it is  obliged to grant the almost 1 million Kazakhs on its territory a  similar right. It is useful to imagine here a situation in which  citizens of another state constitute the majority in certain  areas on the border with Kazakhstan.    [Zamyatina] How is your idea of Russians' adaptation to the  conditions of the new independent states to be combined with the  fact that they are simply being squeezed out of there?    [Pain] There are two sides to this coin. There is a  situation  in which representatives of the Russian diaspora are not being  admitted to citizenship, and there are regions where they  themselves are still choosing and thinking, so to speak. The  choice is frequently complicated by the idea of restoration of  the Soviet Union.    Many problems could be resolved were it possible within the  framework of the CIS to agree on cooperation on assurance of the  rights of the national minorities and to remove the restrictions  on freedom of the residence and movement of people which ensue  today from the difference in their citizenship.    [Shakhray] I agree that it is essential that the Russians in  the near abroad display greater assertiveness for  self-organization. But in the regions where there are political  and psychological barriers to such adaptation we should  determine what is meant by protection of the Russian-speaking  population. It is here that the possibilities need to be  differentiated. As far as the Baltic is concerned, chiefly  economic forms of pressure and appeals to international  standards are applicable there. In Central Asia other solutions  are needed. On the whole, however, a systemic approach to this  problem is needed.    Summing up our discussion, I would like to mention that  federalism is for Russia the sole way to preserve the  territorial integrity of the state. The dilemma here is  perfectly straightforward: Either the disintegration of the  country or genuine federalism. There is no other way.    [Zamyatina] The final question, Sergey Mikhaylovich. How  adequately are the ideas for a strengthening of federalism in  Russia proposed by you and your Party of Russian Unity and  Accord being received by the president and the government? Do  you entertain hopes of these ideas being practicable?    [Shakhray] I will say this: There has been progress. Neither  the president nor the prime minister are any longer rejecting  these problems as incomprehensible, they recognize increasingly  that real control of the economy and the territories is possible  only on the principles of federalism.    The problem is that a lack of translation of conceptual  ideas  into the language of laws and practical organizational forms in  respect to delineation of authority is perceived as yet. The  leaders of the regions, seeking independence, are demanding of  the center, as before, the solution of, say, questions of  housing and municipal services in their republics, krays, and  oblasts. They forget that the powers of the components of the  Russian Federation should be exactly as many as may be realized  at the regional level without disruption of the unity of the  Russian state and its constitutional principles.</p>

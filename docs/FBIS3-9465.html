Membership Request on 1 April"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  NATO </H5>   After meeting with his Hungarian counterpart, Prime Minister  Dehaene emphasized that Hungary's integration is a gradual  process. This does not only apply to EU membership but also to  NATO membership. The Partnership for Peace is a first step in  that direction.    During his official contacts, however, the Belgian prime  minister found out that the Hungarian socialists are not so keen  on joining NATO. The socialists argue that they are not at all  sure that the population wants such a membership.    In Hungary there has been quite a noise about NATO Air Force  General Kehoe's statement that NATO's AWACS airplanes operating  in Hungarian airspace were directly involved in the shooting  down of four Serbian military airplanes by U.S. airplanes at the  end of last month.    On 11 February Prime Minister Boross had ruled that the  AWACS  airplanes would not be allowed to use the Hungarian airspace if  NATO was going to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb  positions around Sarajevo. The prime minister justified this  unexpected decision by referring, among other things, to the  difficult situation of the 430,000 or so ethnic Hungarians  living in the Province of Vojvodina, which is part of Serbia.    The problem of the minorities was also one of the issues  Prime Minister Dehaene brought up in Budapest during his meeting  with the relevant state secretaries. On 7 July 1993 the  Hungarian parliament passed a law on national and ethnic  minorities. According to Dehaene, the law on minorities contains  clauses which are not applicable to Hungary and is mainly  intended as a signal to the neighboring countries, including  Serbia and Montenegro.</p>

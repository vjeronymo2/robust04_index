			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Brussels consultants wait in the wings for EC inquiry decision - The Battle For Midland TRADITIONAL Westminster-style lobbying of the European Commission is not much use to the Midland bidders and counter-bidders. Until the later stages of EC investigations, the procedure is governed by strict rules laying out the timetable and conditions of such inquiries and the main decisions are taken by Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, and Mr Jacques Delors, commission president. MEPs - heavily lobbied when it comes to votes on EC legislation - have no direct influence over the merger control procedure. As a result, the banks have not yet used Brussels' myriad public affairs consultancies and lobbyists. Instead, all three have deployed their lawyers to extract information from the commission, and present their case in the dry legal and economic terms which the EC's competition officials understand. The Hongkong Bank's bid is still in the opening four-week stage of the Brussels inquiry. Sir Leon clarified the situation on Thursday when he said he believed the Hongkong Bank's bid fell under Brussels' jurisdiction, while Lloyds' counter-bid would not. It is Sir Leon and Mr Delors who will decide after four weeks whether a four-month inquiry should be launched, and only in the latter stages of that process will the potential votes of the 15 other commissioners begin to count. Last year's investigation into a Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker, was eventually blocked by the commission - its most controversial merger decision to date. In the final stages of the inquiry, commissioners and their officials were dogged by lobbyists representing all the parties, proving that in a tight corner Brussels consultants can be just as aggressive as their Westminster and Washington counterparts.</p>

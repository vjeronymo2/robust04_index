			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A family divided on health broadcast The voters in the Martin family - Lyn, Tony and Russell, their son - entered the election campaign undecided about which party to support. Paul Cheeseright hears their reaction to the latest Labour election broadcast LYN MARTIN found it 'heart-rending' to see a child in pain with earache. Labour had clearly touched just the nerve it intended. Tony, her husband, agreed that 'it got the point over', although he was cautious: 'I don't know whether it's accurate.' He had reservations about the tastefulness of the broadcast. 'They shouldn't use children like that. It was pitiful, wasn't it?' Labour, Tony said, was playing for 'the sympathy vote'. Russell Martin, the 18-year-old first-time voter, is tending to the Conservative position on trust hospitals. 'I don't side with Labour on this,' he said as he came home from work as a police cadet yesterday evening. He thought the trust hospital would be 'user-friendly - the job will get done for the patient'. His mother is more ambivalent. She works in the Yardley Green part of East Birmingham Hospital - an arm which takes trust status next year. 'When they said they wanted a trust, we all signed petitions; we didn't want it, but it happened anyway.' So far she is not much affected but 'we can see things happening' in preparation for next year, she noted. 'They're closing wards, but then they're building new ones as well.'</p>

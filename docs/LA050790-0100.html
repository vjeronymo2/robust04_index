			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> EVOLUTION OF AN ENTERTAINER  </P> <P> Could it be h i m?  </P> <P> Gasps of anticipation were heard in the Summit arena here as a man in bright  yellow Dick Tracy overcoat and hat stepped from the shadows to join Madonna on  stage.  </P> <P> Could it be Warren Beatty, the star of the upcoming movie about the famous  comic book detective . . . the man who has been reported for months to be  Madonna's beau?  </P> <P> After all, this was the opening night of the 12-city U.S. leg of Madonna's  lavishly designed "Blond Ambition" tour, and the singer-dancer, who plays  Breathless Mahoney in the film, is better at capitalizing on the moment than  anyone in pop music.  </P> <P> Madonna was on MTV so much over the weekend that you'd think she was holding  the cable channel hostage -- and her show 'n' tell escapade with Arsenio Hall  last week may have been the most electric hour of TV since the debut of "Twin  Peaks."  </P> <P> Beatty may yet slip into the overcoat and hat on the tour -- maybe even at the  Los Angeles Sports Arena, where the tour begins a five-night engagement on  Friday. The Summit audience, however, had to settle just for Beatty's recorded  voice. The man in the Tracy outfit last Friday was part of Madonna's cast, and  he merely danced with her as a tape played a Madonna-Beatty duet from her  upcoming album, which includes songs from the film.  </P> <P> But the buzz in the arena sparked by the possibility of Beatty's presence,  however, underscored the way Madonna's personal life has become so entwined  with her professional life.  </P> <P> More than just a star or a performer, Madonna -- in the style of Elvis Presley  and Michael Jackson -- is above all a Celebrity. The highlight of the show for  many in the audience is when she walks on stage -- when they have a chance to  see her in person.  </P> <P> That's what makes Madonna's lastest single, "Vogue," such a terrific piece of  pop. The record and accompanying video are marvelous expressions of the  narcissism associated with pop celebrities -- works that mock Madonna's own  celebrity status while saluting glamour icons from the past.  </P> <P> Sample lines:  </P> <P>  They had style, they had grace  </P> <P>  Rita Hayworth gave good face.  </P> <P>  Lauren, Katharine, Lana, too  </P> <P>  Bette Davis, we love you. . . .  </P> <P>  Strike a pose  </P> <P>  There's nothing to it.  </P> <P>  In some ways, Madonna's enormous success is based on her ability to strike the  best poses. She comes up with a new image and look for every magazine cover,  not to mention every video.  </P> <P> That continuing preoccupation with appearence can be annoying. But the  impressive thing about the "Blond Ambition" tour is that the  singer-actress-dancer doesn't simply rest on celebrity.  </P> <P> Much like Michael and Janet Jackson, Madonna sacrifices the spontaneity of the  normal rock concert experience for the more carefully choreographed and formal  presentation of the Broadway theater.  </P> <P> Despite an endless array of costume changes (Madonna doesn't go on the road to  press the flesh, but to bare it) and a cast of seven male dancers (also  sometimes outfitted with items from her lingerie closet) and two female back-up  singers, the most striking thing about the Summit show was how the one-time  "boy toy" has evolved into such an accomplished entertainer.  </P> <P> The "Blond Ambition" show is even structured with theatrical acts. Act I begins  with a scene of industrial dreariness, reminiscent of the film "Metropolis."  The seven bare-chested dancers look like workmen, drained of energy and  personality. But they come alive as the opening songs, including "Express  Yourself" and "Where's the Party," invite the audience to forget the day's  frustrations.  </P> <P> Act II touches on sex and salvation, a familiar pop theme. Madonna -- her hair  in a severely drawn ponytail throughout show -- moves from the sexual fantasies  of "Like a Virgin" through the questions of religion and guilt reflected in  "Like a Prayer."  </P> <P> Hollywood is the backdrop of Act III, which focuses on songs from the upcoming  album and a good-natured, beauty parlor staging of "Material Girl" inspired by  '50s movie musicals. The formal part of the show ends, appropriately, with  "Vogue."  </P> <P> Where Madonna's music is often criticized, quite justifiably, for lacking the  substance and imagination of pop's most compelling figures, there is an  uplifting edge to her performance.  </P> <P> Her energy and accomplishments stand as symbols of the ability of one to make  the most of one's opportunities and talents. She has long seemed blessed with  blond ambition, but it has never been blind ambition.  </P></p>

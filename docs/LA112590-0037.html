			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIRD OF PARADISE NOT JUST SHOW PIECE  </P> <P> The Bird of Paradise seems to scare off a good many gardeners who think of it  as a show piece for botanical gardens and plant specialists.  </P> <P> Bird of Paradise is less tender than most people think, often standing several  degrees of frost inland and thriving too in cool coastal gardens.  </P> <P> A wise gardener will give it some protection from frost in valley areas and  plenty of sun near the coast. The reward will be bright blooms, almost  startling in their beauty, from fall through spring, and often into summer.  </P></p>

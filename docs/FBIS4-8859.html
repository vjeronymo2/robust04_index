			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nikola Koljevic, vice president of </F> the Srpska republic, by Zivojin Jerotijevic and Dragan Colovic  -- live]    [Text] [Jerotijevic] We have vice president of the Srpska  republic Professor Dr. Nikola Koljevic on our direct telephone  line. Good day!    [Koljevic] Good day!    [Jerotijevic] Professor Koljevic, I will not ask you  anything as we have here our expert, foreign affairs'  commentator Dragan Colovic.    [Colovic] Good day from me, Mr. Koljevic.    [Koljevic] Good day, Mr. Colovic.    [Colovic] How do you view the latest development of the  situation around Gorazde?    [Koljevic] I believe that after today's meeting that we have  had in Pale, that is, after yesterday's meeting with Mr. Akashi,  to be precise, this dilemma of which our Foreign Minister Buha  spoke is nevertheless verging more to the side of peace than to  the possible side of escalation. Namely, after yesterday's  meeting with Mr. Akashi and the appeal that he issued on that  occasion, our authorities decided to immediately implement or  assist in the implementation of the following measures as sign  of goodwill: We agreed that the Serbian forces would stay  outside the 3-km zone on the left bank of the river at Gorazde  and that we would agree to an as speedy as possible deployment  of UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] troops on the left bank in  order to restore peace there as quickly as possible. Namely, it  is well known that there have been more attacks from the Muslim  side after we had agreed to instantaneous peace yesterday.  Yesterday, we also agreed on medical assistance and evacuation  by helicopters. Unfortunately, the Muslim side did not accept  this evacuation this morning for political reasons, so it seems,  because they wanted to dramatize the situation in Gorazde in the  media. However, we did agree on this and it is important that  the international public is aware of this -- the assistance and  evacuation from Gorazde and other settlements -- as well as all  humanitarian organizations, primarily the Red Cross.    We also agreed that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  [UNHCR], the Red Cross, the Medicins sans Frontieres, and the  Handicap International should resume humanitarian convoys as  soon as possible, that all humanitarian workers be guaranteed  free movement throughout the territory of the Srpska republic,  and that our republics' police units would accompany these  convoys to safeguard their safety. This was agreed and I  believe that these are the signals that, above all, show the  improvement of the relations between the UN civilian sector and  our authorities, prove that there is goodwill on the Serbian  side to stop all other activities, and above all ensure correct  information about Gorazde, where plenty of disinformation has  been coming from. Therefore the presence of UNPROFOR on the  left bank of Gorazde could be a major step toward peace in  Gorazde and later also toward proliferation of peace if the  Muslim side would be willing for this in other areas.    [Colovic] Yes, Mr. Koljevic. The implementation of this  agreement will definitely depend on the behavior and reactions  of the Muslim side. Are there any indications regarding this?    [Koljevic] You know that for any agreement at least two, and  for many agreements such as ours, three our four sides are  needed. For the time being we have no indication [words  indistinct] that these helicopters have been rejected this  morning, however, I believe that it is now up to the agencies of  the international community, primarily the Red Cross and the  UNHCR, and we shall see whether they will succeed and be  accepted. The only question remaining now is whether the Muslim  side would accept them on their territory, too.    [Colovic] There have been reports that Vitaliy Churkin,  special envoy of the Russian President Yeltsin, is returning to  Moscow. How do you interpret this, bearing in mind everything  that this mediator has done and accomplished over the last few  days in pacifying this dramatic situation.    [Koljevic] Well, I do not know the precise reasons for his  return to Moscow, however, I presume that he was recalled for  consultations in order to accomplish as soon as possible not  merely this transitional solution for Gorazde, but also an  agreement that would guarantee a general end to hostilities, and  to obtain the Russian position toward this document, which we  need most urgently if we do not want the war to really escalate.    [Colovic] I shall read you a REUTER report. Namely, in  Zagreb, Churkin said, as REUTER quotes, that the defense of  Gorazde has broken down and the town, as it is quoted, continues  to be under Serbian siege. The only thing demanded from the  Serbs is to stop the attacks on Gorazde but, unfortunately, they  are not in a position to do so, Churkin said and added that a  solution could be found if the world would agree to the  abolition of sanctions against Serbia. As he said, the  principles of the abolition of sanctions are important for the  Serbs. How do you comment on this?    [Koljevic] I believe that this, especially the second part  referring to the sanctions, is very accurate. We cannot embark  on any further negotiations before the issue of sanctions, and  not only their abolition, is accepted and also specified. Well,  because things are changing by the hour, I believe that we have  demonstrated out goodwill by agreeing to UNPROFOR presence on  the left bank of Gorazde and the start of demilitarization.  Therefore, this is slightly different today then it was  yesterday when he was here.    [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, you have said that the things are  changing by the hour. I, therefore, ask you what steps can be  expected from the Serbian side in the next few hours?    [Koljevic] In the next few hours we will try -- we will  remain in contact with the UNPROFOR civilian sector -- to secure  as speedy as possible a realization of this agreement, and then  we will strive to improve other liaisons with UNPROFOR. For  instance, the Ukrainian battalion in Zepa needs to be replaced  and this would be a sign of goodwill. Namely, they need  logistical support and we must resolve this in the afternoon.  Naturally, we must inform all our agencies to carry out  preparations for the continuation of the humanitarian work as  early as possible.    Tomorrow morning at approximately 1000 we shall see when the  deployment of UNPROFOR forces, as the most important issue, will  be possible.    [Colovic] Does this mean that a change will occur in the  liaison with the military section of UNPROFOR?    [Koljevic] Well, probably it will occur, however, it cannot  happen immediately. We must... [pauses] for the time being we  only have the authority of our supreme command to communicate  via the civilian sector, however, numerous issues, even the  military ones, can be resolved through the civilian sector.    [Colovic] At the end, Mr. Koljevic, let me ask you, what do  you expect in the Gorazde sector, what further development of  the situation?    [Koljevic] I do not know whether even those who are  currently in the direct vicinity of Gorazde could give a precise  answer to your question. However, judging by our information  here we expect the abatement of the situation, unless  significant propaganda military provocations by the Muslim side  take place in Gorazde. In such a case it would be very  difficult to restore peace in Gorazde, for which we were willing.    [Colovic] Yes, and the aforementioned agreement with special  envoy of the UN Secretary General Akashi, too. Mr. Koljevic,  thank you very much.    [Koljevic] Thank you, too.</p>

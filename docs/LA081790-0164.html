			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 14 HOURS LATE, MAGELLAN 'PHONES HOME';  </P> <P> NASA: THE LONG SILENCE FROM THE SPACECRAFT SENT TO MAP VENUS HAD SCIENTISTS  HOLDING THEIR BREATH.  </P> <P> Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lost contact with Magellan, the  sophisticated radar-mapping spacecraft that entered orbit around Venus just  last Friday, for 14 hours before communications were regained today.  </P> <P> During a routine orientation test Thursday night, the spacecraft turned its  antennas from Earth and pointed a small on-board telescope at two bright stars  whose positions provide reference marks for the spacecraft's internal  gyroscopes.  </P> <P> "We didn't get a signal back," JPL spokesman Allen Wood said today.  </P> <P> This suggests that the spacecraft may have inadvertently locked on to a  different, third star, disorienting its internal reference system so that it  could no longer point its antenna toward Earth.  </P> <P> Researchers said the spacecraft is in no immediate danger. "We're pretty  certain it is not tumbling," Wood said, because Earth-based receivers would  pick up intermittent radio signals if it were.  </P> <P> Loss of Magellan would have been a shattering blow to NASA, which has already  been rocked this summer by the grounding of its shuttle fleet because of  hydrogen leaks and defects in its highly touted Hubble Observatory.  </P> <P> Project manager Tony Spear was in the midst of a news conference today to  outline the loss of contact when excited engineers ran in to announce a signal  had been received from Magellan, the centerpiece of a $551-million mission to  map the hidden surface of Venus.  </P> <P> "It is Magellan's signal," project engineer Steve Wall said. "It is in lock. It  has been verified to be Magellan's signal. This is slow telemetry (but) the  spacecraft looks healthy."  </P> <P> However, both of Magellan's high-data-rate radio transmitters were off,  indicating that the spacecraft was or had been operating in a computer-induced  state of hibernation called a "safe mode."  </P></p>

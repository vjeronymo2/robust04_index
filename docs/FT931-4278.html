			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (8): Fashion house's designer label solution - When it comes to project management, the fashion business and 'special occasion' ladies' wear has more in common with engineering and construction projects than might at first be imagined / Case study of Frank Usher LIKE a cocktail party waiting to happen, ranks of dresses shimmer under wraps in the Frank Usher warehouse. Each glittering creation is the end-product of many processes, each requiring skills of differing levels. At its inception every dress draws on the rare skills of the top fashion designer, whose name might appear on the all-important label. It might seem a strange place to find a project management system surrounded by costly fabrics and fashion sketches. But in the office of Frank Usher's merchandising director Robert Bruh, Computer Associates' SuperProject software package has played an important part in re-evaluating some key relationships in the design and manufacturing process. Like all companies, (see business profile, facing page), Frank Usher has been seeking to cut overheads. In the fashion business, buyers expect a high quality product on time. To meet its deadlines, the manufacturer simply had to expend whatever time, material and was necessary to get the dress right, and on time - 'everybody had their own ideas about where the overheads were occurring, but it was a matter of proving a gut feel,' says Mr Bruh. He undertook a one-off project to examine the processes, and how they affect one another. What he has discovered has itself triggered off another three-year project to restructure and link various systems, streamlining to the point that overheads become slimmer than a selvedge. The various labels at Frank Usher include ready-to-wear party clothes, special occasion suits, and more casual, but still dressy, lycra wear. The outfits are despatched in dozens to outlets all over the world: over half the output is exported, notably to Germany. In the UK, they sell in high volumes through stores such as Harrods and Selfridges, but small, elegant high-street boutiques also buy in small batches of four or five dresses. Typically, they are bought for special occasions: dinner dances, parties, weddings, and other celebrations. Clothes designed by Tom Bowker and Gerald McCann appear on the backs of names so famous that discretion is more valuable than publicity. The company deals in the glamour of high fashion, but is underpinned by precision planning. Every yard of taffeta or velvet, every sequin swirl and jewelled button, is an item for which someone has to account. Because of the nature of its business, Frank Usher acts as both buyer and seller to some of its suppliers. First it commissions individual fabrics and items, to realise prototypes. After a catwalk exhibition, the chosen garments go into production, and Frank Usher may be buying individual components in bulk from any one of its dozens of overseas suppliers. Each garment is a microcosm of the manufacturing process. It has a prototype stage: the design, the implementation of the design on its appropriate fabric (still done with paper patterns), and the prototype modelling of every detail. 'We run an extraordinarily complicated business,' explains Robert Bruh. 'We buy and sell material, manufacture, distribute, subcontract labour, and buy goods. We deal with multiple suppliers and thousands of customers. We're serving an enormous matrix.' The garment details - a piece of embroidery or a sequin detail - might have to go through several stages before being agreed upon, and ordered in bulk. If a prototype goes wrong, the whole process starts again, with the re-ordering of the fabric sample, and the resulting chain of administ rative processing. The high level of clerical and administrative activity was, to Robert Bruh, merely the symptom of a worse ill. 'There was a duplication of paperwork, lots of islands of information with too few bridges between them,' he says. ROBERT BRUH tackled the task of bringing down the overheads with all the energy and thoroughness usually devoted to keeping fabric suppliers up to the mark. Despite describing himself as 'totally IT-illiterate', he has an evident grasp of IT language, and the real issues and implications behind it. He enlisted the help of a Chesham-based consultancy, Catalyst, whose previous work for the retail sector gave them a grasp of the overall business requirements. Consultant Jeremy Marchant recommended that the closest fit for his evaluation exercise would be a project management package. Catalyst chose, supplied, and implemented SuperProject in a turnkey contract, although it is also involved in assessing other strategic IT requirements at the company. Bruh then commissioned a time and work study by a pair of MBA students from the London Business School. Each of the 700 designs was treated as a separate project. The 700 included different sizes of individual designs, because 'grading' (re-engineering one pattern to a larger size) was a separate and skilled process for each. Every operation was given a time-and-cost value (based on salaries for specific jobs), right down to the minutes spent filling out fabric requisitions by clerks. IN THE manufacturing process, there were deep-seated issues to tackle. The revelation came in establishing that in the thirty or so processes involved from start to finish, the design process itself never stopped until production actually started. This was not the in-house perception. It also became clear, from using Gantt time-charts, network diagrams, and critical path analysis, that more time was spent in 'wastage' in the 17 days of the production process than was actually spent making things. There was little overlap: processes were discrete, and so resources could not be re-allocated or shifted about within the project. The SuperProject model was brought down to individual names: Maureen couldn't start her job until Anne had taken a decision on colour. 'At the end of three months we had reliable information which began to reflect reality. We learned to look at people as individuals but also as time resources. It became clear why we needed as many as eight pattern-makers,' says Bruh. The consultant, Jeremy Marchant adds that 'the really valuable thing was to see how the processes affect one another.' Across hundreds of styles, the pattern emerged: there was a 90 per cent failure in the first try-out of a specific garment. It was the re-iterating evolution of a product to the point that worked in both design and engineering terms that was bringing about the extra cost - 'on top of one bottleneck was a whole string of disasters waiting to happen.' Robert Bruh could see this clearly, but, with the help of graphics, was also able prove it and make it obvious to everyone involved. The key was to bring design and engineering rooms, traditionally separate, together in one united team. One of the simplest, but most far-reaching changes has been wrought by simply sitting the two close together. The designers are now designated as holding responsibility for the entire process: sharing information and getting people to act upon it is part of that brief. It became the designer's job to close the gap which had engineer 'tweak' designs so that they were workable, but no longer exactly what had been specified. PLANNING and proving on paper that things can be improved is a different matter from actually bringing about the necessary changes. Robert Bruh is clear about how to tackle the psychological issues: 'Start with the managing director, and drive the change downwards. And don't try to make individuals change. The thing we aimed for was groupwork practices, so that the group forces the change from within.' Left to itself to evolve a leader, he suggests, the group is less likely to resist change seen as both an imposition and an interference from an outsider - 'it has educated me to pick on targets that are achievable. We need to achieve the same tasks with tighter skills, as a team. 'I believe I see a way forward, but it's also a much bigger process . . . that takes years.' Robert Bruh admits that he made unorthodox use of project management techniques, but is nevertheless delighted with what he has achieved. SuperProject, he says, gave him the means to provide and explore management information. He now uses it as a thermometer, to set targets, test and evaluate, and intends to return to using it again in future investigations. WHAT he has discovered has set in process a plan that will eventually embrace all aspects of operations. In the past he has made some innovative and bold moves, and had the foresight to adopt an 'open' Unix-based system early in the 1980s. The software, originally acquired from UCMS, has been adapted and rewritten extensively - Bruh reckons about 80 per cent. Frank Usher also has a small but very effective programming team, whose work in the Progress 4GL has added extensions to the original package. Mr Bruh is now thinking in terms of electronic data interchange between factories, coding fabric stocks as well as individual garments, linking the purchasing database with the existing CAD-CAM system and updating management information as costs change. He is keen to move away from the much-extended old materials handling and purchasing system - 'next time around, we'll go for a database that will allow easy extraction of management information.' The project management system is a valuable part of the toolkit, and he plans to integrate SuperProject into the next generation of company-wide systems. ***** COMPANY PROFILE Frank Usher Frank Usher designs and manufactures ladies' wear for special occasions. The company, which today has 203 employees, was founded in 1944 by German exiles Ann and Max Bruh, who acquired a small fabric company, and with it, the Usher name. The company is now a highly successful exporter, quoted on the USM, and winner of several awards. Company turnover: Pounds 15.59m in 1992 with profits of Pounds 1.06m. The Frank Usher label still carries the weight of the company's business, but the organisation now designs and produces several other labels. These include Tom Bowker, special occasion suits with fine detailing, the Dusk collection aimed at the younger end of the market, by designer Gerald McCann; plus larger-size adaptations of many of these designs under the Oliver James label. Nature of business: garment manufacturing. Around half its output is exported, Germany being its largest customer in Europe. The company has suppliers all over the world, and acts as both buyer and seller of fabric and accessories during the manufacturing process. The company's dresses can be seen on the racks at Harrods, Selfridges, and at other department stores with designer label sections, as well as in smaller high-street dress shops specialising in evening and special occasion wear.

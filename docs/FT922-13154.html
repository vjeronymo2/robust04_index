			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): When bankers talk in mumbo-jumbo - Charles Batchelor reads between the lines of credit reports Just three weeks after one of John James' haulage companies started doing business with a new customer, the customer's bank pulled the plug and John James was left with a bad debt of Pounds 21,000. What was particularly galling was the fact that James had only started doing business on the basis of a favourable reference from the customer's bank. 'I felt very aggrieved,' says James, chairman of Star Cargo, a Harpenden, Hertfordshire-based transport group. 'We had asked for a bank reference to cover Pounds 30,000 and the bank had said that the customer was acceptable.' An exchange of letters with the bank's legal department gave no satisfaction. 'The bank said it had no liability and suggested in so many words that we go away,' recalls James. He believes that banks should compensate customers when the time between a reference and the company failing is very short. Star Cargo's experience highlights a long-standing unease among businesses about the value of bank references. The ferocity of the present recession has meant that the 'shelf-life' of a reference may be very limited. 'There is often a short time-scale in business closure which can catch bank and trade creditors unawares,' comments Pat Oakley, in charge of Lloyds Bank's small business division. Lloyds is currently reviewing its procedures for providing references. 'There is a degree of dissatisfaction among our members about bank references,' says Dave Harrop, a spokesman for the Forum of Private Business, a small business lobby group. 'On their own, bank references are pretty unreliable.' Among the complaints which business organisations voice about bank references are: They are couched in such oblique terms that, at best, they provide a very limited view of the customer's position. At worst they mislead the inquirer. The neutral terminology employed by the banks is used to protect their customers' reputations and the banks' own legal position. 'The banks use mumbo-jumbo which can be misleading for those who don't understand the terminology,' says Peter Allen, chairman of the Institute of Credit Management. 'If they used modern-day language, it would make them think more about the references they give.' Businesses believe that bank managers face a conflict of interest which means they cannot be fully honest about their customers. 'Banks don't like to give a bad reference because sooner or later, the client will find out,' says Allen. 'It is difficult,' acknowledges Bruce Kelsall, head of marketing communications at Barclays Bank. 'You have to be careful not to say something which is detrimental to the interests of the customer. There is a delicate line between honesty and that.' Bank managers are sometimes kept in ignorance of their customers' financial difficulties. 'One of the last people the businessman wants to alienate is his bank manager,' comments Philip Mellor, spokesman for Dun &amp; Bradstreet International, a credit rating and business information group. A bank reference is, strictly speaking, only valid at the time when it is given, although a business is normally expecting to trade for several months with the customer who is the subject of the inquiry. 'It is purely there for that day. It is a snapshot,' says Lloyds Bank's Pat Oakley. This limited view of the validity of the bank's opinion not only contrasts with the expectations of the average business; it does not reflect the banks' own expectations when seeking references on their own behalf. 'When we take references for our own purposes, we would update them every six months,' says Barclays' Bruce Kelsall. 'We would advise our customers to do the same.' The banks will accept no responsibility for the opinion they give. References are unsigned (though they are given on bank headed notepaper) and carry a disclaimer that they are 'without any guarantee or responsibility on the part of this bank or its officials'. Clam-Brummer, an east London manufacturer of industrial adhesives, says one of its customers was put into receivership by its bank six days after the bank had provided a satisfactory reference. Unfortunately, Clam-Brummer had already made a Pounds 1,000 delivery. It continues to use bank references on new customers as a rough filter to weed out the unscrupulous customer but places more reliance on trade references, says Jane Lyon, managing director. But bank references do offer a number of advantages: They are often the only way of checking up on the newly-started business or the small, unincorporated business which has yet to attract the attention of the credit reference agencies. If the bank manager has good contacts with his customer, he may have more up-to-date information than a credit reference agency which will only update its files on smaller companies relatively infrequently. They are either free or relatively cheap. TSB charges a Pounds 6 fee (plus VAT) to inquirers; Barclays Pounds 6.50; and Lloyds Pounds 7. However businesses which make extensive use of bank references can run up sizeable bills. Star Cargo makes between 100 and 300 inquiries a week and spent Pounds 10,000 in a recent quarter. Bank references owe much of their continuing popularity to the limitations of the alternative methods. Trade references are preferred by many companies but they, too, are subject to manipulation. A company will only suggest referees which it knows will give a favourable report. A back-up telephone call can, however, fill in gaps and probe any inconsistencies. Credit rating agencies provide a comprehensive service with a frequently exhaustive wealth of assessments of company performance. But despite the protestations of the agencies that they update their files regularly, many businesses suspect that much of their information, based on accounts filed at Companies House, is out of date. A credit agency reference is also more expensive than a bank reference. Dun &amp; Bradstreet says a one-off request for information would cost Pounds 45 plus VAT, though the average cost to a subscriber would be nearer Pounds 25. D&amp;B does however also operate a more basic telephone inquiry line known as Dunsvoice which costs Pounds 8 per call. Despite the more thorough and impartial reports provided by the credit rating agencies, the bank reference has retained a role. It provides a cheap and speedy check on customers but should not be relied on as the only source of information.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BANK-SPEAK: WHAT THE REFERENCES REALLY MEAN  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banks' terms  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Undoubted'                       Highest praise.

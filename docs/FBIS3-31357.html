The official said Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo  Crvenkovski had informed North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  secretary-general Manfred Woerner by letter of Skopje's  intention to join the partnership and participate in it actively.    The partnership, announced by NATO last month, provides for  military cooperation and aid especially for former communist  countries in eastern Europe, with the possibility of full  membership later.    Observers here said the partnership could lead to Macedonia  providing U.S. and NATO bases on its soil.</p>

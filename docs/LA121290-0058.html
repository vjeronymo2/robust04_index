			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CHAMBER GROUP OFFERS MESSIAEN 'QUARTET'  </P> <P> Olivier Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time" is music that makes massive  demands on performers, both technical and spiritual. A successful performance  requires not only a foursome of virtuosos, but believers as well.  </P> <P> Monday night in Gindi Auditorium at the University of Judaism, the Los Angeles  Philharmonic Chamber Music Society presented the work with a capable ensemble  of Philharmonic musicians bravely attempting the nearly impossible.  </P> <P> Without undue effortfulness, the group -- violinist Camille Avellano, cellist  Barry Gold, clarinetist David Howard, pianist Gloria Cheng -- successfully  hurdled the work's technical obstacles. But its mystical elements remained  elusive.  </P> <P> The players brought considerable expressivity to most of the piece -- this was  not a cold run-through -- yet, nevertheless, it fell short. The performance was  typified by the group's traversal of "Danse de la fureur," its unison  syncopated lines played with jazzy precision but missing the quality of "huge  blocks of livid fury or ice-like frenzy" the composer seeks.  </P> <P> Gold offered the cello solo movement in one sweeping arch with an intriguingly  varied vibrato, but his playing never reached the extatique heights called for  in the score. Howard created expectancy in his movement, then denied it. Cheng  pounded powerfully, and remained earthbound. This was a respectable, clearly  laid out performance, just not an overwhelming one.  </P> <P> On the first half of the program, violinists Elizabeth Baker and Mitchell  Newman, violist Meredith Snow and cellist Gloria Lum performed Debussy's String  Quartet. Again, the ensemble impressed most apparently from a technical  standpoint: Taut phrasing, rhythmic exactness and unanimity of purpose  characterized the reading. And though the performance emerged restrained  emotionally, it seemed not entirely unsuited to the music -- a valid approach,  if not the approach. TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris opens new account in high spirits ATTENTION focused even more firmly on today's Bundesbank meeting, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS started the new account in high spirits with a 1.7 per cent rise in the CAC-40 index, up 35.91 to 2,159.31. Turnover remained solid at FFr3.9bn. The last trading account had seen very heavy turnover, with a daily average of FFr4.3bn, swelling to a record FFr11.5bn on July 31, the day after the crisis in the ERM was triggered. During the August account the CAC-40 index gained 6.5 per cent. Societe Generale was one of the most active stocks, assisted by its successful placing of 1.8m shares in Alcatel Cable, which crossed the market in early trading at FFr600 a share. The placing was equivalent to about 4 per cent of Alcatel Alsthom's holding in the company, now around 77 per cent. SocGen closed up FFr17 at FFr642, Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr13 to FFr735 and Alcatel Cable lost FFr13 to FFr606. Havas, up FFr12.40 at FFr467.20, attracted attention on reports that it might raise its stake in Canal Plus, the television group, whose shares advanced FFr4 to FFr1,267, but off the day's high of FFr1,284. Euro Disney remained in the news with suggestions in the US that a new investor might come forward. The theme park's shares gained FFr1.50 to FFr57.50. FRANKFURT firmed as favourable inflation data from two west German states lifted the domestic bond market, and enhanced interest rate hopes. The DAX index rose 20.09 to 1,917.78, as turnover rose from DM6.2bn to DM6.6bn. Among blue chips, MAN, the truckmaker and engineering group, rose DM10.50 to DM332 after a two-day fall of DM9.50 on poor half-year results earlier this week. Mr Nigel Longley, an institutional adviser with Commerzbank, said that some traders were taking the view that all of the bad news was out of the way. Daimler gained DM9.30 to DM731.80 on the additional 14,000 job cuts at Mercedes, analysts reworking 1994 earnings forecasts ahead of the 1993 half-year results. Meanwhile, Commerzbank showed a relative fall, unchanged at DM315.50 following a warning by Moody's late on Tuesday that it was reviewing the large German bank for a possible downgrade on its debt rating. AMSTERDAM noted some positive rises in most internationals, helped by Wall Street's record close on Tuesday. The CBS Tendency index put on 1.2 at 129.0. The publishing sector again featured, with Wolters Kluwer, popular since its good first half profits on Tuesday, adding Fl 1.50 to Fl 100.50, up some 25 per cent this year. Gist Brocades, the biotechnology group, built on Tuesday's advance after releasing satisfactory first half figures, the shares rising Fl 1.60 to Fl 49.20. Pakhoed, the storage and transport group which is due to release first half figures today, was quoted 30 cents higher at Fl 44.10. MADRID gained from an extended rally in the bond market, and on interest rate hopes as the general index, 3.97 higher at 297.81, registered its second consecutive high for the year. Turnover shot up from Pta24.7bn to Pta34.5bn. Interest rate-sensitive companies, such as banks and electricity utilities, were among the main winners, Argentaria putting on Pta130 to Pta6,000 and Endesa Pta170 to Pta5,360. ZURICH saw foreign buying in blue chips as the SMI index closed 30.0 higher at 2,502.4. Nestle benefited with a SFr17 rise to SFr1,117. In banks, SBC rose SFr9 to SFr497 ahead of next week's results; and a higher dollar lent support to pharmaceuticals, where Ciba-Geigy certificates put on SFr9 to SFr707. MILAN remained fairly strong with foreign activity noted particularly in the banking sector, as well as in some other stocks which have underperformed the market recently. The Comit index finished up 1.57 at 617.25, although more than two hours was lost due to a technical failure in the electronic dealing system. Among the banks, Mediobanca was one of the day's best performers, putting on L553 or 3 per cent to L17,965. OSLO featured a 5 per cent gain in shipping stocks as the All-share index rose 10.35 to 568.9. HELSINKI saw an 11.4 per cent drop in the bank shares index, and profit-taking was blamed as the Hex index fell 34.7, or 2.4 per cent to 1,416.0.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 25                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1305.71    1306.81    1306.82    1307.25 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1383.39    1383.98    1385.08    1386.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1308.09    1308.97    1309.33    1310.93 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1389.02    1387.33    1386.37    1385.62  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 24    Aug 23    Aug 20    Aug 19    Aug 18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1296.82   1291.83   1297.31   1304.07   1303.09 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1375.46   1374.00   1380.12   1385.51   1387.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1311.19; 200 - 1389.35 Low/day: 100 - 1305.66  200 - 1382.80.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

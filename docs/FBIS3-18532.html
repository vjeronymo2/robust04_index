			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Eugenio Scalfari: "The Inflation Party"] </F>   [Text] The American economy is well on its way to recovery,  and this is a good thing for all industrial countries. The U.S.  GDP is growing at the rate of 3 percent per year, but in the  last quarter of 1993 the rate of increase rose to 7.50 percent  -- a record for at least the past 10 years. Exports,  investments, and consumer spending, especially of cars and  durable goods, are rising; and moreover the real estate sector  -- which is the driving force behind the entire American economy  -- has made a dramatic recovery, with a growth of 31 percent in  the last quarter of the year.    In other words, there is a boom reminiscent of the Reagan  era, but achieved by means of an economic policy that is the  exact opposite of Reagan's. This fact deserves to be pondered  by the grandsons of the old cowboy who became U.S. President,  rewarded the prosperous America, and bequeathed to the world the  longest and toughest recession ever since the great crisis of  1929.    As we said, the U.S. economic recovery is a tonic to the  entire world: The dollar is rising, and so too is the tendency  of American consumers to purchase foreign products, to invest  abroad, and to travel abroad. In this way the market mechanisms  gradually tend to distribute wealth also to countries distant  from the stimulus center; and thus the U.S. locomotive is  starting to pull along the cars of the long and varied  international train.    But this positive process is by no means automatic, much  less  universal. Some of the cars have had their brakes applied or  are applying them, others are falling apart, and still others  are actually out of service, lying abandoned on sidings which  they are very likely incapable of leaving in order to join the  train of recovery. All the Third World countries, including the  once flourishing oil producers, lie abandoned on these sidings.    Their bargaining power is now a distant memory, the rise of  the dollar is proportionate to the fall in the price of crude;  the Gulf War sealed the demise of the cartel of great Arab oil  producers.    Nevertheless, this is the Third World's special area. In  other very extensive areas -- the Maghreb, Black Africa, a large  part of India and Southeast Asia, and almost the whole of Latin  America -- the wind of recovery is not felt even as a light  breeze. The cloak of poverty, hunger, and starvation is  combined with very high birth rates and is driving increasing  masses of poor toward the wealthy metropolises. There no cars  rejoin powerful locomotives; there is only despair and  subhumanity; the market is a meaningless word, and hope is only  a chimera.    Among the stationary cars, which will get going again sooner  or later and perhaps return to being locomotives themselves, the  two most deserving of attention are Japan and Germany. A  thorough examination of them would be beyond the scope of these  observations, and has in any case been carried out several times  in this paper. However, there is one important factor in part  shared by these two major economic powers that explains their  present crisis: In both the mechanism of accumulation has broken  down. So this is no mere passing crisis but something  different, more profound, more structural.    In Japan what has broken down is the model of development in  which enterprises constituted not only the locomotive of  production but also the social and cultural locomotive. There  has been a breakdown in entrepreneurial monolithism,  monoculture, the Japanization of Japan (if I may be permitted to  use the term). The picture of workers arriving at the factory  singing the national anthem and performing martial gymnastics is  now a memory; another distant memory is the submissiveness of  the trade unions, and yet another is the close associations of  the industrial groups, both among themselves and with the major  banking groups.    In other words, Japanese capitalism is becoming  Americanized,  nor could it have been otherwise; but it is thus losing part of  its influence, while its accumulation mechanism is growing  weaker. Japanese protectionism still stands, but American  pressure is becoming increasingly vigorous, and sooner or later  some breaches will be opened.    Meanwhile, the Japanese power is marking time and watching  the reawakening of the Chinese giant with an interest not  without apprehension. At the start of the third millennium,  this part of the planet will witness events that we cannot now  even imagine.    To talk about Germany entails talking about Europe, that is,  about home.    Here, too, development has broken down as a result not only  of short-term causes but also of structural causes. There are  three such causes: Germany has found its own developing area in  the east Laender, and the encounter has been traumatic at times;  the government has been either unwilling or unable to meet the  costs of unification by physically drawing revenue from a share  of the income of the west Laender and the more prosperous  classes; the power of the banks has compensated for this by  keeping real interest rates high.    These three social and political factors have combined  with the world recession that has penalized German exports and  caused internal liquidity to increase. In order to absorb it,  or at least to contain it, the Bundesbank is again turning  toward a more restrictive credit policy, after some, albeit  timid, signs of recovery in recent months.    All this is coinciding with the very recent rise in American  interest rates. The immediate effect has been apparent in the  past few days in all the world's financial markets: Shares are  falling, yield from bonds is rising, and savers are again  preferring short-term rather than long-term investments, thus  worsening the conditions on which governments can secure credit  from the capital market.    The American recovery is a good thing for everyone, as I  said  at the beginning. Nevertheless, there are some countries which,  for various reasons, are slow to join that locomotive. However,  in order to preserve its recovery without feeding inflation, the  United States is raising the cost of money, with a domino  effect. Those lagging behind do not yet enjoy the benefits of  the economic situation but immediately feel the pinch of more  expensive money.    In this quandary, within this pincer, so to speak, some  problems are also being experienced with the lira exchange rate,  the prices of government stock, and the cost of the public debt.  For the present these are not real phenomena but, rather,  expectations: Italian savers expect that the yield on their  bonds will rise and that the cost of the public debt again will  rise after a long period of decline. Hence the weakness of  foreign exchange and of 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year treasury  bonds.    There is no cause for excessive alarm; these are at present  smoke signals, and no more; the pre-electoral situation is  exaggerating their extent.    The promise to reduce fiscal pressure, for instance, comes  at  a most inopportune time, as is amply demonstrated by our  foregoing analysis. For that matter, the governor of the Bank  of Italy, with the authority that he enjoys by virtue of that  position, reached the same conclusions just the other day. It  is true that [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi immediately  accused him of being a conservative. What a reversal: Now the  leader of the conservatives is labeling himself a progressive  compared to someone who deems his promise of tax reductions  demagogic!    Of course, the burden of taxation could be reduced somewhat  if spending were to be further contained and the deficit were to  be confined to the projected 144 trillion lire. However, this  presupposes that the cost of the public debt will not rise  again. Will this happen? The recent events that we have  recalled raise serious doubts in this regard.    As though this were not enough, the right's economic program  envisages various production incentives (in the automobile and  housing sectors) and larger spending allocations for several  ministries, starting with Justice and Defense. Last, we learned  yesterday that the entire center-right bloc is in favor of the  proposal made by the pope and [President] Scalfaro for major  state subsidies for private -- that is, Catholic -- schools.    To sum up: Greater expenditure, lower taxation, a presumable  increase in the cost of the public debt; if this is the economic  program of the right, the sole possible consequence is an  increase in the deficit, further increasing the debt.    In fact what lies behind this program is simply a renewed  rise in inflation, a result greatly desired by all those who  have major debts with the banks, but greatly feared by all  citizens who have loaned the state part of their savings.    These home-grown proponents of economic deregulation hate  the  state, but want to continue using it as a cash cow whenever  their own vested interests are at stake. Now they even want it  to subsidize church schools. But did they not say, "less state,  more market?" Does this watchword not apply to education?    As for tax pressure, it will remain the same, but the  distribution of its burden on the various sectors will change.  We already know that the program of the "pole for freedoms"  includes the abolition of the minimum tax and 30 percent income  tax for all. Yesterday we published a very eloquent table that  highlights the effects of this proposed reform: Those earning  up to 80 million lire a year will pay more, and those earning  more than 100 million lire a year will pay less.    Gentlemen, you could not have been clearer. Long live  freedom, don Giovanni sings. His own freedom, that is, of  course; already owning a fortune in Spain, he evidently wants  much more.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Michael R. Deland, regional administrator in Boston for the Environmental  Protection Agency, will be nominated as chairman of the President's Council on  Environmental Quality, the White House announced. The selection of Deland, a  47-year-old lawyer who has gained a reputation as a strong enforcer of  environmental laws, brought praise from several environmental groups. The  three-member council was established in 1970 to advise the President on  environmental matters and has few statutory powers. "Mike Deland is a  first-rate environmentalist, and I think he's an outstanding choice," said Jay  Hair, head of the National Wildlife Federation.  </P></p>

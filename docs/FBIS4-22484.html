			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Academician Leonid Abalkin, director of the </F> Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, under  the rubric "Position": "Far-Fetched Dilemma: Solutions to  Problems Are Found Outside of Its Framework"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Trap </H5>   The search for ways out of the most profound crisis in which  our country has found itself is proceeding within the framework  of a certain set of views, widespread notions, and stereotypes.  At present, the following dilemma which has been offered to our  society (and grasped by it) is the foremost among them: Either  we support production and employment, unavoidably slipping into  the quagmire of destructive hyperinflation, or rein in inflation  at the price of a further decline in production, the emergence  of mass unemployment, and impoverishment of the population.    Interminable and unproductive debate has begun about which  is  better and which is worse. Even respectable politicians,  bankers, scientists, and journalists have fallen into this trap.  This topic has turned out to be particularly attractive for  amateurs since it allows them to engage in discussing the most  complex socioeconomic problems on a kind of equal footing.    Actually, the dilemma mentioned is far-fetched. In this  instance, references to the fact that this situation is  described in many "standard" macroeconomics textbooks do not  help. They do not help because an analysis of the mutual linkage  between production, investment, and employment, on one hand, and  the rate of inflation, on the other hand, which is outlined in  these textbooks always amounts to an utterly theoretical pattern  or abstract model. The conclusions drawn in the process have  value only within the framework of rigid restrictions: the  existence of so-called perfect competition, the absence of  monopolies of any kind, complete liberalization of prices,  absolute noninterference by the state in economic processes.    This methodological technique might be quite useful for the  purposes of instruction in the basics of macroeconomics;  however, it is unacceptable for working out a real economic  policy. Life is always more complex than bookish models, and if  it were not so, life would be simply boring.    Poor knowledge of the economic reality of Russia, the  leading  trends and driving forces of scientific-technical progress,  structural shifts in production, and sociocultural factors of  economic growth are the primary reasons for many poorly  thought-out decisions which have brought on the current crisis  in the country. Attaching hopes to bookish wisdom gives rise to  a claim of one's recommendations being universal. Unfortunately,  we have to admit that the level and complexity of Russian  problems have turned out to be greater by an order of magnitude  than the professional potential and competence of a majority of  Western experts and advisers. No reasonable solution to our  problems exists within the framework of the aforementioned  dilemma. In both cases, the finale is the same--universal  destruction and chaos. The way out is to break free from the  trap and develop and carry out a well-conceived, realistic, and  effective program of action.    It is important in principle to find and activate  noninflationary factors for stimulating investment, production,  and employment which would amount to the practical refutation of  the dilemma in question and, at the same time, prove it to be  far-fetched.    Here is one more introductory remark. Miracles do not happen  in real life. As the saying goes, one cannot go to bed in an  economy that is badly sick and wake up to a completely healthy  economy in the morning. Anticrisis programs should always take  into account the time factor, be guided by strategic thinking,  and be designed to be at least two to three moves ahead rather  than just one. Individual actions, for example, infusions of  financing to eliminate "bottlenecks," may entail unfavorable  consequences in the short term (growth of the budget deficit),  but in the very near future may result in perceptibly curing the  economy and replenishing the state treasury. On the contrary,  instantaneous advantages produced, for example, by an increase  in the tax rate will in a very short time result in an  unavoidable fall in budget revenues and bring about a further  deterioration of the financial situation.    Incidentally, statesmanlike wisdom is found in the ability  to  subordinate tactical decisions to strategic objectives, to steer  the course of events instead of responding to them, and to  engage in fire prevention rather than firefighting.  <H5>  Inflation </H5>   In monetarist concepts, inflation is viewed as an isolated  phenomenon, separate from its linkage to the structure of  production, the existing system of economic mutual relations,  and processes occurring at the microlevel. Growth of money  supply in circulation is considered to be the only cause of  inflation, and therefore containment of this supply is  considered to be the only way to fight it. All means are good to  this end: depreciation of the deposits of the population, late  payment of wages, cutting budgetary appropriations for social  and other programs, sky-high interest rates on credit, and so on.    All objections by opponents are rejected out of hand by  referring to the same dilemma: Inflation cannot be stopped  without the contraction of investment, cutbacks in production,  mass unemployment, and reductions in the incomes of the  population.    However, as has already been said, this is a far-fetched  dilemma. Under our conditions, the nature and causes of  inflation are much more complex, and so are the methods for  reining it in. Along with monetary demand--an important factor,  but not the only one and at present not even the dominant  one--causes such as the growth of costs, the high level of  monopolization in the economy, disruption of the existing system  of economic relations with consumers being rigidly tied to their  suppliers for considerations of technology, and the  criminalization of economic relations are at work in this  instance. Thus, some specialists estimate that no liberalization  has actually occurred in the trade sector: The distribution of  merchandise resources and price setting are controlled by the  criminal structures more firmly than was the case in the time of  the administrative-command system.    It is not consequences but rather causes that should be  fought. Inflation will not be overcome, even by way of primitive  price "freezes," without these causes being eliminated; it might  merely be driven deeper (which is largely the cause for the  nonpayments crisis that has broken out).    Many scenarios for solving the problems exist outside the  framework of the monetarist dilemma. One such scenario was  proposed in a joint report of the RAN [Russian Academy of  Sciences] Division of Economics and the Reform Foundation. Its  objectives were to normalize all aspects of the process of  reproduction, set fixed prices for a limited assortment of raw  material resources and railway tariffs for a period of time,  perfect financial policy (including tax policy), and use a  reconciliation procedure for regulating the ratio of prices to  wages.    Such efforts should be made in several stages. According to  calculations of the RAN Institute of National Economic  Projections made with the use of relevant models, the rate of  inflation can be reduced to 8-10 percent a month as early as the  first stage, and at the second stage, as a result of taking the  entire complex of measures, to 3-5 percent per month. The  discrepancy in these numbers which has been the subject of much  debate recently is not due to the subjective aspect of the  approach but to the completeness and sequence of implementation  of the program of inflation control measures.    To my mind, the fundamental difference (and advantage) of  this program is found in the fact that it can be carried out  without a fall in production and investment activity. In other  words, the program is called upon to overcome the stereotype  according to which a further recession is considered to be the  unavoidable payment for reining in inflation.    As we revisit the issue of restricting demand and,  primarily,  reducing budget appropriations, we must stress that we have  reached the critical threshold in this area. It will no longer  suffice to say that we would have to cut through living flesh.  To cross this threshold would mean to experience all the horrors  and consequences of an economic catastrophe.    Perhaps there is only one item in which reductions are  possible and feasible; it is expenditures for maintaining the  immensely swollen government apparatus. This is not at all about  resource savings which may turn out to be not all that  significant in and of themselves. Something else is more  important. According to the well-known Parkinson's law, the  growing apparatus generates work for itself, complicates the  decisionmaking procedure, boosts red tape and bureaucratic  practices many times over, and spawns corruption (especially  under our conditions). Cutbacks and streamlining in the  government apparatus produce a tremendous economic effect by  developing initiative and enterprise in all elements of the  economy.    There has been much talk about subsidies for agriculture,  too, which "ruin the budget and merely spur on inflation."  Indeed, it is well known that any reasonable idea may be  perverted, and that in incapable hands all means are used to  hinder rather than further the end.    A contract system is the most reasonable and  noninflationary--which is particularly important--way to support  the rural areas and saturate the consumer market. It ensures the  delivery of resources to federal and regional stocks on the  basis of compliance with price parities, guarantees the recovery  of appropriations for the acquisition of agricultural machinery,  fuel, and mineral fertilizer, provides stable "rules of the  game," and builds the confidence of the rural population in the  government.    It is easy to imagine what awaits us in the fall if such  confidence is not restored. The peasants simply will not sell  grain to the state. It will be impossible to put the squeeze on  them by any hard or soft financing measures: On a  self-sufficient farm, the peasant will feed himself with meat  and milk, potatoes and vegetables. Meanwhile, there is no leeway  associated with import purchases of grain and foodstuffs. A  situation greatly reminiscent of the year 1927 may emerge.  <H5>  Investment </H5>   Of course, we cannot count on a sharp increase in  investment,  given the tremendous decline in the gross domestic product (by  about 40 percent of the precrisis level). Nonetheless, it is  quite realistic to enliven investment activities very shortly  and augment the influx of capital investment into the national  economy. This may be done on a noninflationary basis.    First of all, we should add selective (customized) support  for priority spheres and production facilities to the quite  stringent financial and credit policy. This is about  concentrating the limited investment resources on pursuits in  which they are capable of relieving social tensions and, most  importantly, producing significant results quickly. The  so-called multiplier effect works in this instance: Relatively  small resources produce results that exceed the initial  investment many times over. For example, resources are  concentrated on housing construction (out of the funds of the  population and enterprises, the federal and local budgets, and  easy credit). This immediately boosts the demand for cement and  bricks, products of wood processing, the output of glass and  sheet iron. Their production expands (after all, the capacity is  idle!), and the demand for the products of companion industries  appears.    To select appropriate priorities and concentrate resources  for them--this is what the real state regulation of the economy  and the conduct of an active structural policy are all about.  This maneuver would be implemented within the framework of  existing financial resources, without resorting to the  additional emission of currency or increasing the burden on the  budget.    Perhaps the largest, stable, and, once again,  noninflationary  source of investment is associated with privatization (provided  that we forget about its voucher mode as we would a nightmare).  The Russian state, the components of the Federation, and  municipal structures have quite expensive property. They would  resolve to relinquish some of their property to others--at its  real price. As a result of the effected operation, they would  have the same resources, which we would call "capital," but in  monetary rather than tangible form. They would be able to  allocate these resources at their discretion for the  construction of health-maintenance centers or maternity wards,  schools or university laboratories, housing construction, and  telephone installation in the settlement.    Once again, it is important to stress that investment funds  would be obtained on a noninflationary basis; they would not  require emission or budget subsidies. Only a reasonable  redistribution of resources would occur which would ensure the  mutual reconciliation of the processes of privatization,  structural changes, and a pickup in investment activities.    The solution appears to be surprisingly simple and  immediately evident--provided of course that we give up the  extremely ideological desire to deprive the state of its  economic might and influence (at any price). In this instance,  it is very important to avoid the transient urge to blow away  and send down the drain capital assets created by the labors of  several generations.    Creating conditions that make it possible to shift the  interests of both the economic agents and the population from  current expenditures to long-term investments also is one of key  issues in creating a favorable investment climate in our  country. In particular, this presupposes the protection of  amortization allowances against possible depreciation, tax  exemption for profits earmarked for investment, and the creation  of specialized investment accounts and banks.    It is quite important to divert a proportion of the monetary  income of the population from current spending to savings, and  not in the form of the increment of cash balances but in forms  that make it possible to use savings for investment purposes. In  this matter, restoration of confidence in the banking system is  a key issue. This is not easy to achieve following the serious  mistakes that were allowed to occur. However, it is extremely  naive to count on success without the restoration of such  confidence.    Special-purpose savings for the construction of housing,  certainly with reliable state guarantees, could be very  promising. The need for housing is exceptionally high;  meanwhile, the commissioning of residential buildings (in  millions of square meters) dropped from 62.6 in 1985 and 61.7 in  1990 to 41.8 in 1993 (in 1992 it was 41.5 million square meters).    Diverting the demand to housing could reduce pressure on the  consumer market, reduce shortages in certain commodity groups,  and thus become an important inflation-control factor.    In a word, a number of serious proposals exist which make it  possible, contrary to popular stereotypes, to combine  inflation-control measures with support for production and  stimuli for investment activities.  <H5>  Nonpayments </H5>   The course of economic policy which was monetarist in nature  and was lopsidedly geared toward restricting monetary demand in  every way possible brought about a profound distortion of the  entire system of financial relations. The liberalization of  prices accompanied by the actual freezing of the working capital  of enterprises deprived the latter of an opportunity to make  timely payments for products purchased. No improvement in the  system of settlements, which is important in its own right, can  improve the situation.    Therefore, profound and completely antimarket disproportions  have developed in the economy both between the ratios of prices  and the working capital of enterprises, and between capital  benefits and the current stream of material and financial  resources. The following data testify to this eloquently. The  fixed assets of all sectors of the national economy and all  forms of ownership came, after their reappraisal as of 1 July  1992, to 41.3 trillion rubles [R]. The gross domestic product  (in current prices) came to R162.3 trillion in 1993. The  national wealth which has been accumulated over decades ended up  coming to one-quarter of the yearly product!    However, this is not yet all. Prices for goods and services  keep growing, whereas the price of fixed capital is strictly  fixed and held under the strictest administrative control. Not  one enterprise (whatever its form of ownership) is entitled to  reappraise the cost of its fixed assets. This is regarded as an  understatement of profits and tax evasion. The movement of goods  and services, on one hand, and the movement of fixed capital, on  the other hand, ended up severed. Enterprises are deprived of  the opportunity to maintain even direct reproduction. These are  the in-depth roots of the nonpayments crisis!    To a considerable degree, nonpayments were also provoked by  the direct actions of the government, more precisely, the  Ministry of Finance. As of the end of 1993, the volume of  past-due accounts receivable came to R18 trillion, of which the  debt of the budget to the agrarian sector, enterprises of the  defense complex, and establishments financed from the budget  accounted for R7.8 trillion. At times, altogether paradoxical  situations emerge: The Ministry of Finance does not pay for the  products of the Southern Urals Gold Combine. Could it be that  the ministry does not need them, or that there is no demand for  them?    Once again, we have to say that it is impossible to rectify  the situation overnight. Painstaking efforts will be needed to  restore the distorted financial system, eliminate existing  disproportions, and fine-tune an effective settlement mechanism.  <H5>  Employment </H5>   Finally, about the last point of the dilemma in  question--the  allegedly inevitable growth of unemployment as the price for  reining in inflation. In this matter, the already mentioned  arguments prevail without a serious generalization of world  experience and an analysis of Russian reality. "Experts" usually  refer to the Phillips curve.    However, before moving on directly to the problems of  employment, we would like to dwell on related and equally acute  issues. An analysis by scientists from the RAN Institute of  Economics indicates that the purely numerical data on the growth  of unemployment conceal more profound and alarming trends. At  issue are loss of occupational prestige, the mass  disqualification of labor, and an abrupt decline in incentives  to master knowledge and skills. The impact of such tendencies  over any length of time poses the unavoidable threat of the  destruction of not only the economic but also the labor  potential of the country. Meanwhile, it is precisely the labor  potential of the country that should, in the long run, become a  guarantee of the real success of economic reform--an improvement  in the standard and quality of living of Russian citizens.    At present, discourse to the effect that if people want to  work and know how, unemployment is not a threat to them sounds  hypocritical. Appeals to ethics in the course of discussing the  problems of unemployment are generally quite dubious. Under our  conditions, they are just politically irresponsible. After all,  presently the most gifted and talented workers, engineers,  designers, and scientists, those who are just priceless, who not  only know how but want to work, are left without jobs as a  result of the cataclysmic crisis and the stoppage of  enterprises. An economic model which is not in a position to use  the richest labor potential, in a way the "gold reserve" of the  nation, is flawed in its very foundation. It is a shame for the  country and for ourselves.    Let us move on to employment issues proper. The already  described measures aimed at stimulating production and  investment activities are capable of substantially boosting  demand for labor, and then without using inflationary factors.  We should add to this the potential of cooperatives and various  forms of self-employment of the population, including the  establishment of small enterprises at which the owner and the  employee are frequently one and the same (a tailor, car  repairman, manufacturer of craft products, and so on).    As a rule, the creation of new jobs in this sphere does not  require significant investment of any consequence. At the same  time, an opportunity will appear to add considerable amounts of  goods and services on the consumer market which is, in terms of  its character, an inflation-controlling step.    What is needed from the government and municipal organs? It  is not additional money and subsidies but merely  cooperation--the simplification of procedures for opening such  enterprises, tax exemptions for them (if the newly formed cells  of self-employment did not emerge, the unemployed would be  paying no taxes!), the provision of vacant premises for them,  and so on.    The experience of organizing so-called "public works" which  are well known in the practice of the world and have proven  themselves in the implementation of anticrisis programs needs to  be analyzed in particular.    In summation, we would like to discuss opportunities for  supporting low-income strata of the population without  increasing the budget deficit or amplifying the inflationary  spiral.    As is known, in recent years the population has been  markedly  stratified in terms of income level. The incomes of the most  affluent 10 percent exceeded the incomes of the least affluent  10 percent by a factor of 4.5 in 1991. In 1992 this ratio came  to as much 7.5-8, and in 1993, as much as 11. When this ratio  exceeds 10:1, a society enters a stage conducive to the  development of acute social conflicts.    So, if a progressive tax on the incomes of the most affluent  is established at the rate of, say, 10 percent of their income  (which would hardly be too burdensome), this will make it  possible to increase the incomes of the least affluent by a  factor of two! This will not require the printing of a single  additional ruble. How to perform such an operation is an issue  of political will and professional technique.    At the same time, creating conditions for the people to be  able to work and make money is the main way to fight poverty  rather than increasing the number of wards of the state. This  can only be done if socioeconomic policy is aimed at  resuscitating production, at shaping a new type of economic  behavior with the plank of self-support for individuals and  families.    Therefore, the dilemma in question does not stand up to  criticism on any of its elements. The time has come to learn the  lessons of the bitter experience of recent years, to change the  strategic planks of economic policy, and to reject the  stereotypes and dogmas that form its foundation.</p>

Jones Construction Co. said  that it has been paid just more than $61 million on costs of almost $75 million  to build the library, police station and a set of outdoor courtyards.  </P> <P> The firm blamed the city for extensive delays and changes that eventually drove  the total cost of the Civic Center to an estimated $120 million, more than  twice original projections.  </P> <P> Earlier in December, the city filed its own claim for $8 million from Jones,  charging fraud, negligence and breach of contract on the part of the general  contractor.  </P> <P> The two sides are talking with a mediator to try to resolve their dispute,  which is expected to take years before it gets to court.  </P></p>

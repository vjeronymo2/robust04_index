			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Letter: Dynamic economies pinning futures on 'old-fashioned' coal Sir, As chief executive of the international industry association for one of the world's great growth industries, with coal producer members from 14 countries, I am repeatedly surprised at hearing British ministers and others referring to coal as being regarded worldwide as an old-fashioned fuel. Where do they get their information? Who do they listen to? World production of hard coal has grown from less than 2,800m tonnes in 1980 to more than 3,500m tonnes in 1992. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe forecast is for world hard coal demand to rise to 4,300m tonnes by the year 2010. Some forecasts predict that by then coal will once again take precedence over oil as the largest single source of commercially traded energy. Many developing countries see coal as the most readily available and plentiful fuel for the generation of the increased electricity that accompanies the earliest stages of an improved standard of living. It is perhaps even more significant that the world's most dynamic economies around the Pacific Rim all plan to increase the use of coal. Official plans for Japan, Korea, and Taiwan all forecast a continuing growth in the use of coal for power generation. The latest forecast by Japan's Electric Power Development Company sees coal's share of Japan's energy mix doubling over the next decade as 26 new coal-fired power stations come on stream. Steam coal demand for electricity generation in Japan is seen as rising from 31m tonnes in 1992 to around 74m tonnes annually by the year 2002. Few countries are more environmentally conscious than Japan. Huge investments continue to be made in coal-fired power stations using the technologies already available to ensure that coal can be burnt more efficiently and in an environmentally acceptable way. Across the world economies with a good track record in backing winners are backing coal. It would appear that almost every country with prospects for significant economic growth sees coal as a prime fuel to generate the electricity without which no country can provide the improving standard of living that their people expect.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A news conference was held in the government  press center this morning, at which Defense Minister Janez Jansa  spoke of the views of the Defense Ministry toward some current  issues that are part of responsibility of the Defense Ministry.  Robert Skerjanc reports:    [Begin Skerjanc recording] First Minister Jansa touched upon  the question why Slovenia still has not joined the Partnership  for Peace. As the main reason, he stated foot-dragging in  parliament's acceptance of clear-cut decisions about drawing  closer to NATO.    As the second issue, the minister touched upon yesterday's  decision by NATO [regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina]. He assessed it  as the first serious measure referring to the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, he warned here that the entire  affair can turn into a failed attempt at sorting out the matters  in this region or into a threat that the Serbs will, in time,  skillfully water down. He also pointed at the need to protect  the direct vicinity, because we can also expect some retaliation  in case of international intervention. [passage omitted]    As a penultimate matter, the minister touched upon, as he  said, the biggest international scandal, that is, articles in  some papers that claimed that, because of the allegedly too-good  relations with the Defense Ministry, the head of the U.S.  liaison group, Lieutenant (Leach), and U.S. Ambassador Wendt had  to leave Slovenia. He again warned that such writing is harmful  for the international reputation of Slovenia as well as the  cooperation of the Slovene Defense Ministry with the U.S.  Defense Ministry.

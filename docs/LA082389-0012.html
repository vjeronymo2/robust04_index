			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHERS WITH MICKEY LELAND  </P> <P> The death of Congressman Mickey Leland of Houston is a bitter pill to swallow.  A fellow Houstonian, I watched with pride and love as he spared nothing in his  service to humanity, even, it turns out, his own life. Mickey Leland filled  Barbara Jordan's shoes when she moved on. Now, who will fill his?  </P> <P> CHRISTINE K. McGILL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

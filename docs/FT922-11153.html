			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Malaysia calls for cash to protect environment DR MAHATHIR Mohammed, the Malaysian prime minister, declared yesterday that the industrialised world's fear of global environmental damage had given poor countries new leverage to demand assistance for the development of their economies. Opening a conference of more than 50 developing countries, aimed at forging a common position for the Earth Summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June, Dr Mahathir insisted, in a typically combative speech, that the North would have to transfer money and technology to the South if developing nations were to protect the environment. 'It is the rich who must be prepared to sacrifice their progress in the interest of our development,' he said. 'The negotiations to prepare for Rio reflect the continuing attempt by the South to bring the North to the table to overcome over four decades of neglect on the growth and development of the South. 'Fear by the North of environmental degradation provides the South the leverage that did not exist before. It is fully justified for us to approach it this way.' Dr Mahathir's statement could provoke charges of ecological blackmail from his opponents. However, he announced simultaneously an undertaking by the Malaysian government to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the country's land area shall remain under permanent forest cover (although that appears to include plantations and is compared with 70 per cent today). He also challenged his audience of Third World ministers and western observers to adopt 'an initiative for the greening of the world' that would increase global tree cover to 30 per cent by 2000 from the current 27.6 per cent. 'All nations must set national greening targets and those which have no suitable land must contribute adequate funds to developing countries with available land,' he said. Malaysia's confrontational stance - one minister this week accused environmental pressure groups in the West of terrorism and likened them to the Nazis - has failed to win the wholehearted support of other developing countries. Among the industrialised countries, the US has emerged as the most reluctant to commit itself to environmental targets. Yesterday, Mr Robert Ryan, who is overseeing US government preparations for the summit, told a news conference that 'consumer sovereignty' was a very important principle. 'We are not going to tell people what they can or can't consume,' he said, declining to explain why the US government should control consumption for national health or environmental reasons, but not to help the global environment. Other rich countries were more conciliatory, admitting that they had mismanaged their own natural resources and agreeing to give developing countries more say in the Global Environment Facility.</p>

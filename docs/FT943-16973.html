			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Observer: They're off] Why did Hong Kong's legislative council cram its deliberations on governor Chris Patten's democracy proposals between the start of Wednesday and the ungodly hours of Thursday morning, when matters wound up at 4.50am? Patten wanted the session to span two days. To his annoyance - he must be getting annoyed at the frequency with which he is annoyed these days  - he was overruled by John Swain, LegCo president. Swain had an urgent appointment elsewhere. He had to be at Britain's Sandown Park for today's big race - the Pounds 80,000 Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club Trophy.</p>

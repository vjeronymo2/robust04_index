			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER BART SIMPSON: 'UNDERACHIEVER AND PROUD OF IT'  </P> <P> As a teacher in an alternative high school diploma program for high-risk young  people (dropouts and potential dropouts), I think Bart is one of the best  things that has come along. The main reasons are this:  </P> <P> 1.  </P> <P> There is less graffiti writing and more Bart doodling! One constant part of  working in programs like this is keeping the classroom graffiti free.  </P> <P> 2. All ethnic groups relate to Bart. It is important to have images that all  students can relate to -- especially in terms of color, race and creed. Believe  it or not, Bart being a cartoon character is more powerful than Bill Cosby in  that whites, Latinos, Asians, Samoans -- all young males seem to relate to the  character.  </P> <P> 3. We, the adults in their lives, need to have clues on the "culture" of being  young -- especially since so many of us have forgotten it.  </P> <P> High school students must dream, daydream, doodle, be understood, have  something that connects them to each other over race lines and to us over age  lines. Seeing students come to class in clean, brightly colored Bart T-shirts  and doodling with Bart cartoons is wonderful!  </P> <P> The following is the writing of one 16-year-old black male in my class (a rough  draft -- please look at the content). This young man is a particular fan of  Bart.  </P> <P> MARY M. BRADLEY,  </P> <P> Coordinator, Learning Center  </P> <P> San Pedro Wilmington Skills Center  </P></p>

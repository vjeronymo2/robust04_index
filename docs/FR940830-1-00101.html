			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress amended the household definition for several reasons. According to the legislative history cited below, the current household definition was too ``convoluted,'' thereby making it ``needlessly complex and error-prone.'' In addition, the current household definition did not recognize that more and more families and individuals must share housing because of high housing costs or unemployment. The legislative history further states that the change in household definition would remove the burden imposed on relatives who ``double up'' but still purchase food and prepare meals separately. (House Report No. 111, 103rd Congress, lst session (199), p.34). Congress also prohibited minor children who are under the parental control of an adult household member from establishing a separate household. This prohibition prevents minor children from being treated as separate households when they are in the care of adults, whether or not legal adoption has taken place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is planning to retain the current language regarding the rule that, with a few exceptions, persons who live together and purchase food and prepare meals together are one household. The Department is proposing to revise the exceptions which require some related individuals to be included in the same household even if they purchase food and prepare meals separately. Under the proposal, spouses who live together must be considered one household. Natural, adopted, and stepchildren and other children under 18 years of age who are under the parental control of a member of the household, other than a parent, must be included in the same household as the parent or other person with parental control even if they purchase food and prepare meals separately unless the child is living with his or her own children or is married and living with his or her spouse. In addition, children ages 18, 19, 20, and 21 who are natural, adopted, or stepchildren must be included in the same household as the parent even if they purchase food and prepare meals separately, unless the child is living with his or her children or is married and living with his or her spouse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Food Stamp Program Policy Memo 3&hyph;93&hyph;6 dated March 26, 1993, children under parental control for food stamp eligibility purposes are ``minors who are dependents_financial or otherwise_of the household as opposed to independent units.'' This definition was intended to transcend State laws which vary widely on parental control. The Department is proposing to amend this definition to specify that children who are married and living with their spouse are not under parental control and, further, that children who are living with children of their own are not under parental control. This will provide the same treatment for children under 18 living with an adult other than a parent that is provided for natural, adopted and stepchildren; i.e., they may be a separate household if they are living with their children or married and living with their spouse and they purchase and prepare their meals separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2) (i)(B) through (D) accordingly. The Department is also proposing two conforming amendments. The first proposed conforming amendment would amend 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(ii) to include a reference to 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(i)(C). The second proposed amendment would amend 7 CFR 273.10(f)(2), which mandates certification periods of up to six months for households meeting the parent/child or siblings provision of 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(i)(C) and (D). The Department proposes to remove this section because this requirement was removed from the Food Stamp Act when the household definition was changed. The Department is proposing no change to paragraph 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(i)(A) regarding the grouping of spouses since the rule is unaffected by the Leland Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility of Children of Parents Participating in Drug or Alcohol Treatment Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 3(i) of the Food Stamp Act, food stamp benefits are authorized for narcotic addicts or alcoholics who live under the supervision of a private non-profit institution for the purpose of regular participation in a drug or alcoholic treatment program. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.1(f)(2) (i) and (ii) permit residents of alcohol or drug treatment centers to apply as a one-person household and be certified for food stamps through the use of an authorized representative who is an employee of and designated by the publicly operated community mental health center or the private non-profit organization or institution that is administering the treatment and rehabilitation program. According to the Act at section 3(i) and 7 CFR 273.1(e), spouses and children living with residents of alcohol or drug treatment centers are not eligible if the center provides the majority of their meals. If the center does not provide the majority of their meals, the spouses and children may qualify for food stamps as a separate household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the implementation of this regulation, there have been changes in some drug and alcohol treatment centers' policy regarding addicts and their children. Previously, addicts with children were required to leave them with family or friends, or place them in foster care since children were not permitted to remain with their parents during treatment. Now, several residential treatment programs permit addicts with children to live as a family unit while the parents participate in treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While some residential treatment programs accept addicts and their children, the Food Stamp Act did not authorize benefits for these children even though their parents were eligible for food stamps when the center provided the majority of their meals. In the past, the Department received several waiver requests from State agencies to add children who live with their parent(s) while the parent(s) is (are) a resident(s) of an alcohol or drug treatment center to the parent's food stamp household. But the provisions of the Food Stamp Act did not permit the Department to waive the regulations for these children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

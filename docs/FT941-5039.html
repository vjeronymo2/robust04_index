			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (8): Demand has recently risen sharply - Recruitment into the profession 'Communication skills are probably the greatest asset a credit manager can have,' says Mrs Ann Stutz, recruitment service manager at the Institute of Credit Management. The ICM is the professional body concerned with the credit management function, with membership of the institute recognised by employers as proof of professional knowledge and competence in credit work. The institute's recruitment bureau, which has been running for 25 years, is one of the institute's commercial arms and offers a complete recruitment package covering all levels of personnel, from credit clerk to board appointments. The service offers standard or executive search facilities. In the first instance fees are only charged on successful placement. In the second, a fee structure is devised to meet the specific needs of the assignment. 'Employers use the service because of our specialised knowledge of the credit function,' says Mrs Stutz. 'In addition we are often required to act as a reference point to both employers and employees on salary and benefit related queries.' Mrs Stutz declines to disclose the numbers of people on the bureau's recruitment books, or annual placement rates, but says that demand for credit managers fell during the recession but has risen sharply in recent months, with a 50 per cent increase on the lowest point. Most of her clients are the bigger companies, but she says many smaller companies are now hiring in-house credit managers because of the need for improved cash-flow. Traditionally, smaller companies have used debt collection agencies, which may ask for a percentage of the recovered debts. However, if a small company's business is complex and specialist, or has substantial sales abroad, an in-house credit controller is probably the preferred option. Mrs Stutz says: 'It is clear that more enlightened employers have come to realise that efficient credit management can hold the key to greater liquidity. In fact, for the smaller company, it can often make the difference between weathering the recession or financial failure.' So what constitutes the ideal credit controller? Mrs Stutz says that there are three main types of people who are needed in what can be a very demanding job. Analytical people who can gather data on customers, make recommendations or take decisions and explain them to others. Outgoing people who can establish friendly relationships with customers and sales staff to improve the flow of payments. Methodical people who can process payments and handle information rapidly and accurately. It is useful, she says, for a trained credit manager to have specialist knowledge of financial and strategic planning, legal procedures and insolvency law. So where do credit controllers work? 'Almost anywhere,'says Mrs Stutz. She adds that every form of trading company needs a credit department, making sure that the companies it sold to, pay within the agreed time limit. This was 'trade' or commercial credit. If credit was granted overseas, it was described as 'export' credit. Companies enabling individuals to purchase goods by installments were in the world of consumer credit. Moreover, there were companies whose main business was credit - they included finance and hire purchase companies, credit card companies, banks, credit insurance companies and credit reference bureaux. Then there were jobs in companies such as collection agencies, which recovered overdue accounts, and with accountants specialising in insolvency matters. Mrs Stutz says that the days are gone when the credit function is solely about getting paid. The modern credit controller is involved in assessing the risk of doing business with a customer. It is no longer acceptable for sales or marketing personnel, keen for orders and commissions, to pay lip service to a customer's credit worthiness and ability to pay on time. She says that, in the past, too many companies set inappropriate credit terms, or allowed customers to take unofficial extended credit. Too often, a company would use the credit function as a mopping up exercise when things went wrong. The necessity for legal action was often the result of failure on the part of the company to support efficient credit procedure and allocate adequate human resources. 'Wiser companies,' she says, have learnt that it should only be used as a useful adjunct to credit management skills, not instead of them. Mr Ted Brown, vice chairman of the IPM, is head of credit control at Britvic, the soft drinks division of Bass, the brewing and hotel group. His department works in tandem with the company's sales team, checking out all new customers and keeping in regular contact with existing ones. 'We want to supply our products to any customer who wants them, but we have to check on their ability to pay and their willingness to pay within agreed terms,' says Mr Brown. Every account is given a credit vetting and a credit line, which can be adjusted depending on circumstances. The task is large and complex. Britvic has more than 10,000 accounts owing between Pounds 40m and Pounds 60m at any one time, depending on the time of the year. Customers range from tiny corner shops to the big supermarket chains. The department employs 70 people. Proof of its increased efficiency shows in the fact that during the past four years it has reduced the average time customers take to pay from 60 days to 40 days. In this it has been assisted by a new computer system that can provide on-line information of customers' debts. Sometimes all attempts to collect debts fail and there are customers against whom legal action has to be taken. 'If we have to do that, I feel we have failed,' says Mr Brown. 'It means communication has broken down.'</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Union deal secures mini-car for Germany Mercedes-Benz is to build its revolutionary mini-car in Germany after reaching a deal with the workforce which will reduce the company's labour costs by DM200m (Pounds 80m) a year, according to Mr Helmut Werner, chairman. Mercedes, mainstay of the loss-making Daimler-Benz group, will spend DM500m fitting out its new plant at Rastatt in south-west Germany. Production of the so-called A-Class, the company's first venture into the small car market, will start in 1997. A year later, when there will be capacity to produce 200,000 cars a year, the plant will employ around 3,000. At present, 1,300 put together fewer than 200 E-Class executive saloons a day. After a late-night deal with the Mercedes workers' councils, Mr Werner presented the decision as evidence of how well the German system of co-determination functioned. Other potential sites - in Britain, France and the Czech Republic - 'had such great cost advantages over Germany that a decision for Rastatt on economic considerations seemed almost impossible,' he declared. And yet labour and management pulled off a near miracle. Quite how was not spelt out, but details include union acceptance of modest pay cuts and smaller bonuses for all workers, shorter working weeks for some, and Saturday working without overtime pay in a trade-off for concessions to ease the pain of planned job cuts. Daimler is in the process of cutting 51,000 jobs group-wide. The cost-saving scheme resembles an agreement at Adam Opel, the local General Motors subsidiary which ensured that its plant at Kaiserslautern was chosen to manufacture a new diesel engine. Together with the wage cuts associated with the planned introduction of Volkswagen's 'four-day week', the deals add substance to the view that motor manufacturers, at least, have come to grips with the inflexible working practices and excessive wage costs blamed for most of the structural problems plaguing German industry. Daimler, which yesterday reported a nine-month loss of DM2bn, under newly adopted US accounting principles, is feeling the need for change more than most. But it is also feeling other pressures. It has announced the closure of six Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) sites and a radical shake-out at its lame-duck AEG subsidiary. In relative terms its job-cutting is no more rigorous than the hundreds of other economy drives. Its global workforce is still around 375,000. But as Germany's largest industrial concern, it tends to be the focus for the frustrations of manufacturing workers nationwide. After announcing several investments in vehicle manufacture outside Germany, if the group had also 'exported' the A-Class car jobs it would probably have unleashed new waves of protest within Mercedes. In light of its New York Stock Exchange listing and the impending public offering of part of Deutsche Bank's Daimler stake, the group's efforts to gain credibility in the world's largest capital market would scarcely be helped by further hue and cry. But whatever the political considerations, Rastatt was always the preferred choice. Mr Werner Niefer, Mr Werner's late predecessor, proclaimed it 'simply the most up-to-date automotive factory in the world'.</p>

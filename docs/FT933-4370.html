			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Protest over return of electricians is defused A WALK-OUT by 11 unions from the floor of congress to protestover the planned return of the electricians to the TUC was narrowly averted yesterday after the intervention of Mr John Monks, the new TUC general secretary. The union leaders involved agreed to wait for the outcome of a special TUC general council meeting on the issue, to take place this morning, before deciding on their next move. But the issue has become embarrassing to the TUC, which is trying to look to the future. The 11 unions - including the TGWU general union, the Ucatt construction union and the GPMU print union - remain dissatisfied with the peace formula agreed last week by the general council to allow the electricians to return to the TUC, after six years' absence, as a section of the recently merged AEEU engineering and electrical union. The TUC general purposes committee had rejected the unions' motion for an emergency debate on the subject. The unions had called for a reassessment of the electricians' reaffiliation issue, to be undertaken not later than January 31 of next year. After finishing his first keynote speech, Mr Monks had to leave the platform and spend an hour persuading the unions not to go ahead with their walk-out. With television cameras outside the meeting room's glass door, Mr Monks had to use all his conciliatory skills to head off trouble which would have tarnished his inaugural address. The 11 unions want the AEEU's unconditional guarantee to abide by TUC rules, its acceptance of TUC dispute committee awards, and an end to the AEEU recruiting members in parts of the construction industry.</p>

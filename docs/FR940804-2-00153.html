			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The transaction reporting pilot program will make it possible to provide pricing reports to all market participants and to the public. The availability of this information is expected to support market integrity, increase investor confidence, improve pricing efficiency and increase liquidity in the market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of the Act, since it would apply equally to all brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In May 1993 the Board published a notice explaining its plan to collect inter-dealer transaction data by using information required for automated comparison, clearance and settlement. The notice set forth the proposed method of collection inter-dealer transaction data and of publishing it. The Board received four comments of which two supported the proposed pilot program and made suggestions for expansion. The remaining two commenters suggested certain modifications of the daily report format and the selection criteria for reported issues without expressing general support or opposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sample Format for Daily Report. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter noted that the reporting of transaction data by the Board should include a statement stating that prices change with market conditions and that prices for individual transactions may depend upon factors such as size of transaction, interest rate, maturity date, and call features. Another commenter stated that the daily report should note that the data represents transactions that have been submitted for comparison. The Board agrees that statements similar to those requested by the commenters should be included on or with the daily reports to help clarify the meaning of the data to the general public and has decided to include such statements on the daily report. The Board also plans to ask recipients of the daily report who intend to publish it for a general audience also to include such statements in their publications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Average Price Calculation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested widening the band used for average price calculation to include more price information. In contrast, another commenter suggested narrowing the band to exclude some trades that might be considered ``odd lots'' (certain zero-coupon bond trades reported by NSCC on the basis of maturity value). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board believes that it is appropriate to use the band from $100,000 to $1 million for average price calculations for initial production of the daily report. Once the program goes into operation and feedback is received from data users, it will be possible to judge how well the ``average price'' concept actually works in practice. As experience is gained, the price band concept will be reviewed to determine whether it is serving its intended purpose of indicating a ``typical'' inter-dealer market price. The pilot program's computer system will be designed to enable the parameters of the price band to be changed easily and quickly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compilations of Data. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter urged the Board to provide compilations of transaction data ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a month of data on a computer disk) to facilitate study of the data by academics. The Board has decided not to make such compilations available at the beginning of the pilot program, but may do so in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Information on Daily Reports. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that the Board publish individual transaction data (CUSIP number, description, par value, price) for each transaction, without regard to whether a security is being frequently traded on a specific day. This commenter believes that, by limiting reporting to individual maturities of an issue that are trading frequently, the program would withhold information that, in the aggregate, would be useful. For example, the commenter believes that the general price levels for prerefunded securities could be extracted from aggregate transaction data on prerefunded securities, even when no one prerefunded security is trading frequently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board believes that reporting an isolated transaction in a security does not necessarily provide a reliable indicator of ``market price'' and might be misleading to an observer not familiar with the market. Nevertheless, after the pilot program begins operation and experience is obtained, the Board will review the use of the daily report and consider expanding the information included to accommodate requests from information users and the industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the MSRB consents, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested people are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. People making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the Board's principal offices. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;9 and should be submitted by August 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / The Long View: Troubled by bubbles HERE'S a number to jolt every saver and every marketing manager of a retail deposit-taking institution: 1 3/4 per cent. It happens to be the new official discount rate set by the Bank of Japan last Tuesday, but might it also be the kind of pensioner-panicking short-term interest rate ruling in other important countries in the next year or two? Figures this week from two of Britain's leading savings sectors show that the wind continues to blow powerfully in favour of longer-term institutions. Unit trusts pulled in a net Pounds 980m of funds in August, taking the aggregate above Pounds 6bn after eight months of 1993. But the poor old building societies lost Pounds 132m from savings accounts in August, as investors drifted away from what they see as stingy interest rates; the societies have added only Pounds 2.4bn so far this year (although this ignores another Pounds 5bn of accrued interest added to accounts). The banks have been able to exploit the malaise of the building societies by issuing bonds and gathering medium-term wholesale deposits, while eagerly promoting fixed rate mortgages. Abbey National, the bank that dares not speak its classification, has pushed its share of the mortgage market up to 23 per cent while mighty Halifax has been squeezed down to 15 per cent where it is waiting grumpily for the wind to back into a more favourable direction. But will that happen soon? The freespending British government is happy to swim with the tide. This week the IMF ticked the UK off for running too big a public sector deficit, but the government shrugged and announced another Pounds 3.25bn gilt-edged issue for next Wednesday. At the beginning of 1993 it looked as though there might be problems in financing a borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn-odd. I did not share those fears, at least for the current year, but against the fortuitous background of a global bull market in bonds it is proving even more of a doddle than I expected. Very low short-term rates in the two biggest investment markets, the US and Japan, are fundamental to keeping this bull market going. The UK's own short-term rates are still relatively high, against this background, at 6 per cent and if the building societies are under competitive pressure now they must be prepared for something even worse. In the first half of 1993 British investment institutions, especially the life assurance companies, pumped almost Pounds 9bn into gilts, and foreigners put in nearly Pounds 7bn. For the first time in years the life companies and unit trusts are selling large volumes of income products based on investment in bonds. The shift from short-term to long-term markets is also evident on the borrowing side, where British companies are financing themselves through the stock and bond markets and shunning the banks. In the late 1980s industrial and commercial companies were increasing their indebtedness to banks at anything up to Pounds 34bn a year, but in the first half of 1993 they repaid Pounds 7bn of bank loans while obtaining Pounds 18bn of finance from other sources. These changes should not be seen as a temporary or cyclical adjustment but as part of a permanent return to normality. There was a grotesque growth of short-term institutions in the 1970s and 1980s, when, over 20 years, building society deposits (including Abbey National) grew nearly fourfold in real terms. Historically, those must be viewed as freak conditions. This is not to say that short-term interest rates will never rise again, but in the very long run they have tended to fall within a range of 2 to 7 per cent and that should again be a reasonable expectation. If savers are already responding vigorously to the downwards shift in short-term interest rates, the attitude of borrowers is more mixed. Big, creditworthy companies are refinancing themselves, but other kinds of debtors are not so well placed. Many are still overborrowed (the ratio of personal sector debt to income is still only slightly lower than at the peak) and business confidence remains muted. The big danger of sharp cuts in interest rates is that financial bubbles may be created. In a recession bank credit flows initially not into productive industry and services (where there is excess capacity) but into various kinds of financial assets. This is a big concern in the US and Japan, and would be in the UK too if interest rates were to fall to 3 or 4 per cent. At low interest rates the cost of financing speculative positions can be trivial in relation to the expected capital gains. We glimpsed the disruptive power of speculative flows in this year's mini-bubble in the gold bullion market. But that episode also taught a lesson in risk awareness, the natural restraining factor in speculative markets. Some argue that a bubble has developed in the US Treasury bond market, and it is hard to see how all the short-term positions propping up that market can be unwound without some kind of uncomfortable hiatus. In Japan the authorities half-deflated the bubbles in real estate and the stock market but do not want to finish the job because the banking system would disappear as the bubbles finally popped. In the UK the main risk is of a sudden resurgence in the housing market. Millions of home owners would love a re-run of past inflationary house price booms, if only to rescue themselves from the consequences of the collapse of the last one. Many lenders appear to be almost as irresponsible as ever, and too many newspapers are ever-eager to pump up a new house price bubble. I do not think it will happen, but at some stage, long before interest rates get to 1 3/4 per cent, the government may need to dismantle the remaining tax incentives for home owners. That could be counted on to drive a good many more than four Tory backbenchers barmy.

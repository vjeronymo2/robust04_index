			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> A 'MOTOWN' HISTORY LESSON  </P> <P> OK, so Motown's not the first to lie about its age.  </P> <P> "Motown 30: What's Goin' On," which was taped Monday at the Pantages Theatre  for a CBS special, was designed as a successor to Motown's spectacular 25th  anniversary special . . . which took place in 1983.  </P> <P> The producers of the show can be forgiven for the fib, which links it to the  1983 special. That event was both a television and Motown landmark, highlighted  by electrifying performances by Michael Jackson, moonwalking his way through  "Billie Jean" in what turned out to be a key step in his rise to the top, and  Marvin Gaye, capping his triumphant commercial and artistic comeback.  </P> <P> But by recalling "Motown 25," Monday's show evoked a standard it could not  possibly live up to. There was no Michael this time, and no Marvin, who was  shot and killed by his father in 1984.  </P> <P> Few moments in Monday's concert, which will be televised on Nov. 25, even  hinted at that spectacle. What could have been a peak -- a touchingly  understated tribute to ailing singer Mary Wells by Stevie Wonder, Smokey  Robinson and Gladys Knight -- fell a bit flat.  </P> <P> And if the producers failed at math, they get straight A's in history.  </P> <P> "I remember watching 'The Mickey Mouse Club' or 'American Bandstand' and not  seeing one black person," said Suzanne dePasse, president of Gordy/dePasse  Productions and the show's executive producer, during a Monday afternoon  rehearsal. "We went from practically invisible to dominating performances in  every art, and that's the reason for this show."  </P> <P> On that count, the show, a black-tie affair benefiting the Brotherhood Crusade,  succeeded as both entertainment and education, with humor pushing aside self-  righteousness, pride winning over smugness and talent speaking for itself.  </P> <P> The event centered on Motown music and artists, including Wonder, Robinson and  Knight, but also featured a wide spectrum of performers, including  singer-dancer Debbie Allen, rappers Queen Latifah and Heavy D &amp; the Boyz,  actress-comedienne Whoopi Goldberg (masquerading as Diana Ross) and "Phantom of  the Opera" star Robert Guillaume.  </P> <P> Many of the veterans remembered during the show how, like dePasse, they  struggled to find black role models in the arts when they were growing up,  while the younger performers expressed their appreciation for the  groundbreaking done in the past. In fact, the most thrilling moments may have  been the Jackson (Miss.) State University marching band opening the show with  dynamic versions of several Motown hits, and the Soul Children of Chicago's  uplifting gospel numbers.  </P> <P> A typical point was made by Damon and Keenan Ivory Wayans introducing a segment  about television. Noting that 30 years ago TV Guide ran an article titled "What  Does the Negro Want From TV?" Damon ad libbed a little from his script, saying,  "He wants the same thing in 1990: to be on it . . . and get paid!"  </P> <P> Television provided as much of an anchor for the show as music, with  actor-director Robert Townsend ("Hollywood Shuffle") starring in a series of  skits dealing with black television: Nat King Cole's 15-minute weekly show in  1957, Bill Cosby in "I Spy" in 1968, "Soul Train" in 1972. For 1983, it was the  "Motown 25" special itself, leading into a live re-creation of the  Temptations-Four Tops medley from that show.  </P> <P> As much fun as that medley was, it made the point that in 1983 Motown had a  sense of renewal. In 1990, it's mostly memories. Even Motown's current teen  group the Boys, in an energetic, accomplished spot, belabored its debt to and  worship of the Jackson 5.  </P> <P> And in seven years, when they do "Motown 35," nothing from this show will be  looked back on like the Michael and Marvin moments from the past.  </P></p>

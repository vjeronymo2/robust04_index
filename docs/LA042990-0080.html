			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE EARLY GARBO  </P> <P> The day after Greta Garbo's death (April 15) I came across a batch of Garbo  photographs covering 1926 to 1932. One brought back memories of an evening at  the old 60 Club, before it became the Mayfair.  </P> <P> The 60 had a membership of most of the stars and industry personalities and was  regarded as veddy veddy.  </P> <P> One of those present was famed actor John Gilbert, who had a nondescript young  woman with him. Some knew her, but as many others were doubtful . . . "some  foreign actress out at Metro."  </P> <P> She didn't speak much and didn't dance with Gilbert, who was trying to talk her  into getting up on the floor with him.  </P> <P> I noticed too that she was clad in what was undoubtedly the drabbest dress in  the ballroom.  </P> <P> I learned later that she didn't own a gown and had borrowed one from the Metro  studio wardrobe department. Later too I learned that she was still grieving  over the death of her Swedish mentor -- Mauritz Stiller, who had brought her to  Hollywood -- and only reluctantly had she consented to Gilbert's pleas to join  him.  </P> <P> Nobody there -- in what amounted to a phantasmagoria of beauty and glamour --  could visualize that this ugly duckling would in time be one of the most famous  women in the world.  </P> <P> WHITNEY WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

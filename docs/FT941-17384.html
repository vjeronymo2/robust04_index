			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Chinese, Russian cities in link-up A Chinese city and a Russian one have agreed to build a cross-border free economic and trade zone, Reuter reports from Beijing. In the first such venture between the two countries, Heihe in China's northeastern province of Heilongjiang and its neighbour Blagoveshchensk in the Russian Far East will set up the zone from either end of a pontoon bridge to be built over the river separating them. The zone, 10 sq km of land from each country, is expected to become a transit centre for goods and passengers.</p>

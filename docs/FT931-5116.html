			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Management: Family fun at the AGM Directors who dread annual meetings might learn something from NFC. The transport and logistics group has a strong tradition of employee share ownership. Following its 1982 sale by the UK government to a management-led buyout, about 90 per cent of the company's 33,000 employees are shareholders. As a result, the annual meeting has become as much a chance to inform and motivate employees as to reappoint the auditors. This year's event, held last Sunday in Nottingham and attended by more than 1,000 shareholders, had the air of a friendly reunion rather than a business meeting. Shareholders travelling by car or in a group by coach had their petrol costs refunded. A creche was provided for young families and everyone was given a packed lunch. At the end of the meeting, after rousing speeches and congratulations to the management, shareholders were given questionnaires asking how the annual event could be improved. The meeting is also a forum to discuss future strategy. NFC's 1989 stock-market flotation, its diversification overseas and the appointment of a shareholder director are all issues which have been aired in previous years. This time one shareholder highlighted the plight of a former NFC employee fallen on hard times. James Watson, NFC's chairman, said that the NFC charitable foundation would look into the case, and was rewarded with a long round of applause. Organising such large-scale events is not cheap; NFC spent about Pounds 65,000 on this year's meeting. For the future, Watson wants to attract even more shareholders and believes other companies would benefit from following NFC's lead. 'Our shareholders do feel they have a role in the business, and I would like to see other companies going that way, however they are owned,' he said.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana plan under fire from both sides - Producers' fears about the EC's quota proposals THE EUROPEAN Community's proposals for banana imports when its single market comes into operation next year, which have been condemned by Latin American producers, have also come under from attack the traditional producers whose preferential access the EC apparently wants to ensure. Countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group, the traditional suppliers to the community, say the latest EC proposals are unacceptable because they will limit the expansion of exports. The community is proposing a quota of 2m tonnes per year for Latin American exporters, and the ACP group says it will be left with preferential access for 620,000 tonnes a year. 'This figure takes no account of the substantial investments made in the ACP countries to improve production and shipping nor for any share in for the ACP in the growth of EC consumption,' said a statement from the Caribbean Banana Exporters' Association. The Union of Banana Exporting Countries, a grouping of Latin American exporters, had earlier attacked the community's proposals, saying that they violated the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade. The group said the proposals would cost them millions of dollars in lost income and lead to higher prices for the fruit in Europe, causing reduced consumption. Mr Marshall Hall, managing director of the Jamaica Banana Exporters Association, said the ACP producers feared a cap on their access to the European market. The ACP group was also concerned about the sourcing of additional fruit that might be needed by the community. 'The proposed level for the ACP group is based on 1990 production, but there has been significant production increase since,' Mr Hall said. 'By 1994, for example, based on current plans, the Caribbean producers will be increasing the quantity of available export fruit. Belize will double its to 100,000 tonnes per year, Suriname will move from 40,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes, Jamaica from 70,000 tonnes to 120,000 tonnes and the Windward Islands from 280,000 tonnes to 300,000 tonnes.' The ACP producers have also asked for more information on the form and quantity of aid which the European Community is proposing for its own producers. 'The European Community's assurance to guarantee revenue levels in keeping with its obligations under the Lome Convention must now be delivered by the market,' the Caribbean Banana Exporters' Association said. 'It would be most regrettable if ACP banana producers had to rely on deficiency payments for their income.'</p>

The demonstrators, heeding a call by the Muslim  fundamentalist-dominated student union at Cairo University,  waved black flags and carried coffins draped in Palestinian  flags.    Leaflets distributed by demonstrators called for "holy war"  in support of the Palestinians, and said the "Muslim holy places  in Palestine should be put under the protection of a  fundamentalist state, such as Jordan."    They urged Egypt, the only Arab country to have a peace  treaty with Israel, to break diplomatic relations with the  Jewish state.    The campus was ringed by security forces to prevent any  violence directed at the Israeli Embassy, only two kilometers  (1.2 miles) away.    The Israeli Army said a lone settler, Barukh Goldstein,  carried out the slaughter at the mosque in the West Bank town of  Hebron Friday.</p>

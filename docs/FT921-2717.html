			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report SILVER futures were lower at midday on Comex and analysts were predicting further falls. They said that high supplies had undermined sentiment. Comex warehouse silver stocks have reached a record 283,725,234 ounces, besting the peak set on March 6. Nymex PLATINUM futures remained lower at midsession amid expectations that South Africa's whites would approve the referendum on political reform, analysts said. That would greatly decrease chances of civil strife and a disruption of output and exports from South Africa, the major platinum producer. Market perceptions of slackening Japanese demand for platinum also weighed on sentiment. On the LME three-month COPPER bounced off downside support around Dollars 2,220 a tonne again, and pushed up in afternoon trading, albeit in thin volume, to challenge the highs of the current trading band. News that February US housing starts rose by 9.3 per cent was particularly supportive. Three-month copper traded last at Dollars 2,239. LEAD was aided by news that Nuova Samin's Porto Vesme lead smelter will be closed for 25 days for routine maintainance. TIN closed higher despite talk of fresh arrivals of quality Brazilian metal.

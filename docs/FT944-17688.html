			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Danish unemployment falls Denmark's unemployment rate in August fell to 12.2 per cent of the workforce compared with 12.5 per cent in July, according to figures released yesterday by Danmarks Statistik, the Danish national statistics agency. The figure was in line with market expectations which predicted a drop in unemployment levels on the back of a general improvement in the economy and the introduction of new government training schemes. Total Danish retail sales for July and August rose 4 per cent compared with a year earlier. Industrial production, meanwhile, was up 11 per cent in August on last year. Unemployment in the European Union was unchanged at 10.7 per cent, or about 17.2m, in August compared with a year ago, the European Commission's statistical office Eurostat said yesterday. Spain had the highest unemployment rate: 21.8 per cent.</p>

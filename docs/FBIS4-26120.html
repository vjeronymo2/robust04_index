			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin cancelled his scheduled meeting today with visiting  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet because he has to deal  with some "urgent problems," a high-ranking Kremlin official  said.    The official said that "there are no politics behind the  cancelled meeting," according to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY.    The Russian president "has to solve urgent problems which  have accumulated during the three days of his absence from  Moscow," the official explained.    He said that the meeting was planned only in a preliminary  way, adding that "as far as the Russian-Vietnamese documents are  signed at the level and upon mutual agreement of the prime  ministers of both countries, Boris Yeltsin, who has been absent  from Moscow for three days, is busy with urgent state affairs  today." [sentence as received]    Yeltsin spent three days touring the Russian Far East and  returned to Moscow on Thursday.</p>

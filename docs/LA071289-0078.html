			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A group of Azerbaijanis were ambushed, apparently by Armenians, and two were  shot and killed as ethnic strife flared again in the troubled southern Soviet  region of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Soviet news agency Tass reported. A third  Azerbaijani was seriously injured in the attack near the village of Kirkidzhan.  In a separate incident, soldiers trying to clear roads around Stepanakert, the  main city of Nagorno-Karabakh, were pelted by stones and shot at with hunting  rifles, and 19 suffered injuries, Tass said. Nagorno-Karabakh is predominantly  Armenian and Christian, although it is located within the predominantly Muslim  republic of Azerbaijan.  </P></p>

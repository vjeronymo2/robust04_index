			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: De La Rue/Portals All credit to De La Rue for walking away from a hostile bid for Portals. The logic of combining banknote paper-making and security printing was never compelling, especially at the kind of heady multiple De La Rue would have had to pay for control. The risk of upsetting Portals other customers weighed against the benefits of pooling technology. It is a measure of investors' scepticism that De La Rue's shares fell by 10 per cent once the market caught scent of the talks. Yesterday the stock rose by 1.5 per cent against a falling market. Wider stock market wobbles must have been a mixed blessing. Since De La Rue has a large cash pile, falling share prices generally work in its favour. But the equity component of a bid for Portals would have been more difficult to arrange. That may have added to the pragmatic arguments for pulling back from the brink. An unsuccessful hostile bid would also have soured the commercial relationship between the two sides. One can only hope co-operation can be achieved without the rigmarole of a takeover. De La Rue can take some comfort from its participation in Camelot's successful bid for the national lottery. While the lottery should boost earnings, though, the company's Pounds 11m equity investment in Camelot will barely dent its Pounds 250m cash pile. Still, De La Rue's recovery since 1990 has been built on efforts to narrow the focus of the group. That record remains intact.</p>

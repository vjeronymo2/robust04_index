A Defense Department official has been assigned the task of  determining how Third World nuclear installations can be  targeted for U.S. air strikes.    It is known that -- following China -- India, Pakistan, and  now North Korea are Third World countries that have been the  topic of international media discussion regarding their nuclear  strength. India officially detonated a nuclear bomb in 1974,  becoming a de facto member of the international nuclear club,  but the United States has not paid much "attention" to India's  nuclear program since then. On the other hand, when Pakistan  achieved the capability to enrich uranium during the last  decade, the United States started raising objections to  Pakistan's nuclear program. It adopted a policy of  "overlooking" Pakistan's nuclear program, though, because of  Islamabad's courageous stand during the "Afghan war." After the  end of the Afghan war in 1990 and the disintegration of the  erstwhile Soviet Union as a superpower, however, Washington  declared Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program a "weapons-oriented  program" and stopped all military and economic aid to Islamabad.  This aid has still not been resumed. The Pakistani people will  be rightly concerned about this talk of targeting nuclear  installations in Third World countries.    There have been serious differences between the U.S. and  Pakistani stands on Pakistan's nuclear program. In the opinion  of the Pakistani people and several governments, the U.S.  Administration -- under the influence of the Israeli and Indian  lobbies -- has refused to accept the "peaceful" nature of  Pakistan's nuclear program. This is the case even though  Islamabad has given assurances at the international level that  it will not build and has not built any nuclear weapons, despite  having the ability to do so. Washington's stand, however, is  that Islamabad is making nuclear weapons and that it should roll  back its nuclear program.    The U.S. Government is putting its entire emphasis on making  Pakistan "abandon" its nuclear program and sign the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT. In response, the Pakistani  Government has always adopted the stand that it is ready to sign  the NPT provided that India -- which is a major nuclear power in  this region -- signs the treaty first. It is regrettable that  the United States views Pakistan's nuclear program in the  perspective of its wider global priorities; this is why it has  only been pressuring Islamabad to sign the NPT.    Some changes in this situation have recently become  discernible in the wake of remarks in certain U.S. circles,  especially by Ms. Robin Raphel, chief of U.S. South Asia Bureau  [title as published]. Washington now appears to understand  Islamabad's view better than before.    Lynne Davis, the U.S. under secretary of state for  international security, has said that as far as nuclear  proliferation is concerned, Washington will adopt an evenhanded  approach to both India and Pakistan. Nevertheless, we should  not indulge in any wishful thinking in the wake of statements by  Ms. Robin Raphel and Lynne Davis, nor should we start to think  that the U.S. Government's stand has completely changed and is  now tilting in favor of Pakistan. In fact, the U.S.  Government's basic stand -- the basic objective of U.S. policy  -- is to have South Asia declared a nuclear-free zone. This  element in the U.S. attitude is favorable to Pakistan, because  Washington will no longer view Islamabad in isolation from the  South Asian perspective on the nuclear issue; rather, it will  view Pakistan's nuclear program from an overall perspective.    In view of continued U.S. pressure on Pakistan's nuclear  program, we consider Washington's new attitude a welcome shift.  Yet we must express our regret that Pakistan is still the  victim of discriminatory laws, such as the Pressler Amendment,  intended to make Pakistan the target of "vindictive actions."  Even though India detonated a nuclear device in 1974 and has  subsequently built nuclear weapons, the United States does not  think it is necessary to take any "action" against New Delhi,  which continues to receive all sorts of U.S. assistance. We  would also like to tell our U.S. friends that the imposition  against Pakistan of such discriminatory laws as the Pressler  Amendment has not helped -- nor will it help in the future -- to  rid South Asia of nuclear weapons. The sooner the U.S.  Government and its policymakers understand this fact the better,  because U.S. policy objectives cannot be achieved by making  Pakistan the target of "discriminatory laws."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Feb 24 (AFP) -- The ceasefire between  Bosnian Croat and Moslem forces could mean the return of basic  services such as water supplies in the besieged Moslem areas of  Mostar, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said Thursday [24  February].    The UNHCR is also planning to reestablish its permanent  office in the city, after moving it to Medjugorje last year when  fighting between HVO [Croatian Defense Council] Croat forces and  the Moslem-led Bosnian government army made the place too  dangerous, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond told AFP.    The office, staffed by five foreigners and about 20 local  people, should be set up in the Croat-controlled west of Mostar,  and "we would hope to have access to the east," said Redmond.    The eastern Moslem enclave has been under constant Croat  fire  for the last 10 months and the UNHCR's information chief Sylvana  Foa recently described the situation there as "worse than  Sarajevo ... 55,000 people live there like rats, without water,  electricity or sanitation," she said.    In Rome, the foreign ministry announced Thursday that the  first humanitarian aid convoy since the weekend's Sarajevo  ceasefire had arrived at Mostar. Four trucks, escorted by the  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), arrived Wednesday with some 30  tonnes of food, clothing and medicine, it said.    Redmond said the ceasefire, due to take effect Friday noon  (1100 GMT), was "a good sign" which could "change a lot for the  drivers who risk their lives under the shelling and snipers  (...) allow setting up a water purification unit taken there  last week and be of great help for the mobile hospital."    According to UNPROFOR, about 48 people died from Croat  shelling during the week of February 11 to 19 alone.</p>

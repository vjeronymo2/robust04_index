			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GETTING PROP. 103 ON THE ROAD  </P> <P> More than a year ago California voters approved Proposition 103, hoping to  reduce skyrocketing auto insurance rates. They have yet to see a difference in  their bills, but now they have a glimmer of hope. The controversial initiative  will finally take effect under new rules announced last week by Insurance  Commissioner Roxani Gillespie.  </P> <P> Consider Proposition 103's rocky first year: For various reasons implementing  it was delayed, whether out of legal considerations or political ones.  Immediately after it passed, the insurance industry challenged the initiative  in court. Then in May the state Supreme Court addressed the question of whether  Proposition 103 was constitutional: Yes, it is, as long insurance companies can  still get a "fair rate of return" on their business.  </P> <P> Other delays were more problematic. Gillespie insisted that she needed detailed  hearings and studies to define a fair rate of return before she could put the  complex initiative to work. With more than 700 companies licensed to sell auto  insurance in California, this process dragged on too long for the taste of most  consumers. This made Gillespie pretty unpopular and accounts for her recent  decision to not seek another term in her post when the insurance commissioner's  job becomes elective next year. But at least Gillespie can put Proposition 103  to work without worrying about political consequences.  </P> <P> At first glance, her new regulations governing the setting of automobile rates  just may work for consumers, at least for big-city motorists with good driving  records. Gillespie ordered the elimination of territorial redlining, a system  that sets rates according to where a driver lives. Insurance companies still  can use territory-related factors, such as population density and the number of  accidents that occur in a given area, but only if they can statistically  justify those factors. And no such factor can be given more weight in setting  auto rates than an individual motorist's driving and safety record, as  Proposition 103 stipulates. Analysts have warned that insurers will compensate  for lower rates in big cities like Los Angeles by charging higher rates for all  drivers, even good ones, in rural areas and smaller cities like Fresno. To  prevent that, Gillespie has also ordered insurers to not raise their good  drivers' rates higher than the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index.  </P> <P> So it appears that Gillespie, a former insurance executive who has been  criticized for favoring the industry, is now tilting towards the consumer. Her  new rules may not result in the 20% rate rollback mandated in Proposition 103.  Each insurance company's rates will be lowered, or raised, depending on what  its fair rate of return is. But even if the initiative proves not to be the  panacea it was billed to be, it is still a step towards creating a regulatory  structure in California that can keep insurance rates under control.  </P> <P> Some insurance companies are likely to challenge Gillespie's new regulations in  court and that is their right. But the industry must not forget that the reason  Proposition 103 passed, despite the expensive political campaign waged against  it, was that consumers are desperate to see auto insurance rates cut. In some  inner-city areas, according to one recent study, a family could pay more in one  year for automobile insurance than for food.  </P> <P> Rather than continuing to pick nits in Proposition 103, the industry would be  better advised to join Gillespie and the consumer groups that have been  cooperating with the Department of Insurance to plan and implement the  additional steps that must still be taken to improve California's auto  insurance system. They include a no-fault law like New York's, a better vehicle  registration system that would require motorists to prove they have auto  insurance before they can register a car and a no-frills auto liability policy  that even poor drivers could afford. Proposition 103 is on its way, but the  road toward full reform is still a long one.  </P></p>

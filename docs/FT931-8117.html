			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Markets: President hits the big players where it hurts - Wall Street IF PRESIDENT Clinton is looking to the US bond market for an endorsement of his plan for the nation's economic revival, he is looking in the wrong place. Stung this week by the stock markets' negative reaction to the announcement of widespread tax increases in his first budget, several times the President turned to the treasury market for comfort. He argued that surging bond prices proved that at least some people in the financial world understood the implications of his attempt to alter radically the direction of US economic policy. Unfortunately, the bond market's analysis of how the Clinton fiscal package will affect the economy is poles apart from the president's own thinking on the matter. Treasury prices have risen sharply this week - sending the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond down to below 7.1 per cent, the lowest level in the issue's 16-year history - because fixed-income investors believe the mixture of big tax increases, spending cuts and selective government 'investments' will do more to hinder, not help, the economic recovery. Such a prospect appeals to the bond market because anything that slows economic growth also slows the rate of inflation, which is good news for investors with assets like government securities that earn a fixed rate of return. True, bond prices also rose this week because investors were pleasantly surprised by Clinton's tough stance on cutting the deficit, and because of speculation that the government will cut future issues of the long bond in an attempt to reduce the cost of financing the federal deficit. These, however, were side issues. Ultimately, the bond market gave the Clinton package the thumbs up because it felt the impact of its contents would be thumbs down for the economy. Stock market investors agreed, which is why the Dow has fallen 4 per cent from the all-time high it reached just two weeks ago; why the Standard &amp; Poor's has dropped 3.5 per cent from its record high; and why the Nasdaq composite of secondary stocks has tumbled 6.5 per cent from its recent peak. Of course, there was a personal element to Wall Street's chagrin. Most of the brokers, market-makers and institutional money managers who make up the big players in today's equity markets will be among those hardest hit by the planned increases in personal income tax. The firms which employ them will also suffer from many of the new measures, including higher corporate taxes, lower deductibles on business entertainment expenses, a possible tax on securities transactions, and the elimination of deductions on 'excessive' (Clinton's word - not Wall Street's) pay packets. Investors also were unhappy about what the president did not include in his fiscal package: namely, more spending cuts. The stock markets always adopt a conservative approach to economic policy and, like Clinton's Republican critics on Capitol Hill, they believe the best way to cut the deficit is to reduce spending, not raise taxes. While the president did announce a range of spending cuts, they did not go far enough for the markets' liking. Although everyone's attention this week was focused on economic policy, there were technical factors at work that contributed to the declines in stock prices. Early this month, all the main market indices posted record highs, with the Dow advancing more than 120 points in just three days. At the time, the surge was put down to rising confidence in the economic outlook but, to many observers, the new highs looked unsustainable. The markets, as analysts love to say, were looking 'frothy' - driven too much by speculative buying and bandwagon jumping, and not enough by economic or earnings fundamentals. Typically, sudden increases in share prices can be difficult to retain. Often, they are followed quickly by equally sharp declines as investors take the opportunity to book some fast profits. Clinton's tax proposals, first outlined on Monday night, provided the perfect excuse for this week's profit-taking. So where are share prices headed now? In all likelihood, nowhere fast. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve and keeper of the markets' faith, told Congress yesterday that while the economy was gaining momentum, the outlook for growth was fraught with 'considerable uncertainty' because of the changes in fiscal policy. So, while the president spends the next weeks, and probably months, haggling with Congress over his budget plan, the stock markets are likely to tread water at least until the next flood of quarterly corporate earnings - which means, not until spring.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "Ws": "Interim Stocktaking of Russian </F> Withdrawal"]    [Text] Berlin, 25 Jan -- Colonel-General Burlakov,  commander in chief of the Western Group of Russian Forces, has  spoken out for a continued close military cooperation between  Russia and Germany after the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Germany. Burlakov, who is expecting the Bundeswehr chief of  staff, General Naumann at the Western Group of Russian Forces  headquarters at Wuensdorf south of Berlin this Thursday [27  January], said in Berlin that such cooperation could include  joint field exercises.    Taking stock of the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Germany, Burlakov once again severely criticized the delays that  have occurred in the housing program for soldiers returning from  Germany. From the families of soldiers that returned home  between 1990 and 1993, 40 to 45 percent are without apartments.  The chief of staff blamed both the Russian Defense Ministry and  the German side for the slow realization of the housing program.  He accused the Defense Ministry, which did not decide on new  locations in Russia until after the withdrawal had begun, of bad  planning and mismanagement at the building sites and the German  Economics Ministry of insufficient control of the German  companies carrying out the building work. He said that some of  these companies were lagging up to 10 months behind schedule.  The part of the housing project funded by Germany with 7.8  billion marks, is to provide 25,000 apartments by the time of  the final withdrawal on 31 August. The part funded by the  Russian Defense Ministry has to complete some 22,000 apartments.  While the withdrawal of troops is on schedule, he doubts that  the housing program will be completed on time, Burlakov said.    He said that of 546,000 former Soviet troops stationed in  Germany up to mid-1990, only 68,000 had remained by 1 January  this year. To date, 90 percent of war materiel and ammunition  have been withdrawn. In this connection, Burlakov denied German  reports saying that Russian statistics are missing some 81,000  tonnes of ammunition that seem to have disappeared. Over the  past years, the Western Group has conducted an intensive  training program, during which a great quantity of ammunition  was fired. Besides, the supreme commander said, not a single  Russian bullet, bomb, nor shell will remain in Germany after the  withdrawal.    The Russian commander in chief is concerned about the  increasing number of crimes committed around the Russian  garrisons. While a total of 277 unlawful acts were reported in  1991, the figure had risen to 1,038 in 1992, and to 1,277 in  1993. In 1992, 816 of these offenses were committed by  "immigrants," 389 by German citizens; the rest of the offenders  could not be clearly established. By "immigrants" Burlakov  means people from the former Soviet Union's successor states --  including soldiers stationed here before -- who conducted their  dark dealings near the Russian barracks, often organized in  gangs. According to Burlakov, 23 Russian soldiers were killed  in attacks over the past years. On the other hand, Russian  soldiers committed 72 crimes since 1990, involving five deaths.    The colonel-general expressly rejected allegations that  Russian forces are involved in liquor and cigarette trafficking.  He said these are isolated cases and are severely punished by  the military authorities. Close investigations into the Western  Group by the Russian Public Prosecutor and other authorities  have shown that the allegation of corruption and a reference to  Mafia-like structures are unfounded. Yet, offenses by  individual members of the Western Group cannot be denied. In  this connection, Burlakov confirmed that the 10,000 sports  rifles that were seized in mid-January had been brought to  Germany illegally by a Russian company in aircraft belonging to  the Western Group via the Sperenberg air base to be passed to a  Hamburg company.    The supreme commander has already some specific ideas about  the way to mark the farewell of Russian forces from German soil  -- which after all means finally putting an end to World War II.  Since the Germans do not want a joint farewell ceremony for the  Russians and the French, British, and American forces, the  Russians are now planning a joint function with the Germans on a  state level. President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl have already  been in contact over this matter. Colonel-General Burlakov, who  wants to leave Germany as the last Russian soldier on 31 August,  is thinking of celebrations in two stages. In the time between  1 and 10 May, a "week of remembrance" should be held, with  commemoration services honoring soldiers killed, not only in  Germany, but also in Russia, if possible. In early August, an  event should take place at the Soviet memorial in Berlin's  Treptow Park with Yeltsin and Kohl attending, street festivals,  and a meeting of veterans. The Russian side is now waiting for  the German reply to these suggestions, said Burlakov.</p>

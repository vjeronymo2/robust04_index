			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / International Company News: IMI expects to float more than 40% of shares Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), the second big bank on the Italian government's privatisation list, expects to float more than 40 per cent of its shares, well above original expectations. The higher total, which contrasts with earlier estimates that only up to 20 per cent of IMI's shares might be sold, suggests the Treasury could raise more than L2,500bn (Dollars 1.5bn), based on informal valuations. Further details are likely after a special IMI board meeting on Wednesday to approve the draft prospectus for the flotation, due in February. The pricing will not be revealed until next month, but IMI has already indicated its shares will be sold for between L9,800 and L11,000 each, with a one-for-10 bonus issue for domestic retail investors who hold the stock for three years. By contrast with Credito Italiano, Italy's seventh biggest bank, which was privatised this month, the IMI deal will be targeted principally at institutional investors, especially abroad. IMI last week said between 60m and 120m shares would be sold to Italian retail investors, representing between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of its share capital. According to one senior executive, the domestic retail tranche will represent only about half the shares to be privatised. This implies that the overall deal could involve up to 40 per cent of IMI's capital. That would be a compromise between the original plan to float no more than 20 per cent of IMI, which specialises in long-term corporate lending and fund management, and later suggestions that the Treasury should dispose of its entire stake, rather than sell the shares in tranches. The banker said the IMI deal might be brought forward slightly to enable the government to privatise Banca Commerciale Italiana, the big Milan based bank, before new general elections, expected in March. BCI had been due to be sold in early April, but the Treasury's advisers have pressed for an acceleration to late February to avoid being overshadowed by the elections and to benefit from the bandwagon effect of privatisation after the Credito Italiano float. About 100,000 applications for Credito Italiano shares were turned down due to oversubscription. The banker denied IMI might swap places with the better known BCI in the privatisation queue in order to maximise revenues for the Treasury. Any more than a marginal change in the schedule would cause uncertainty in international markets and could prove counter productive, he argued.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'OZ' ITEMS FAIL TO SELL AT AUCTION  </P> <P> Five figurines believed to be the original prototypes for characters in the  1939 MGM film "The Wizard of Oz" failed to draw a minimum bid Thursday at an  auction at Christie's in New York, according to the statues' owner, Lidia  Penge.  </P> <P> Penge, 30, of Dana Point had hoped to net at least $10,000 for the Dorothy, Tin  Man, Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow and Professor Marvel figurines that she  discovered six years ago in a warehouse inherited from her mother, MGM child  actress Jackie Horner. But, Penge said Friday, no one would bid more than  $5,000 and no sale was transacted.  </P> <P> According to "Oz" specialist Rhys Thomas, who was called in by Christie's to  authenticate the figurines, the one-of-a-kind, hand-painted plaster models were  made by MGM artists sometime between May and October of 1938 and were given to  Jackie Horner by producer Louis B. Mayer's secretary.  </P> <P> Penge, who works as an accountant in Laguna Niguel, decided to place the  statues on the auction block last September after hearing about a pair of "Oz"  ruby slippers that netted $165,000 at auction in June, 1988. She hoped that  interest in the statues would be especially high this year, given the publicity  surrounding the film's 50th anniversary.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] President of the Republic of Croatia  Franjo Tudjman today ended his three-day state visit to Romania.  Following his arrival at Zagreb airport President Tudjman made a  brief public statement. Branko Merlin reports.    [Merlin] After the ceremonial welcome and meeting  high-ranking Croatian officials who welcomed the president and  the members of our delegation at the airport, President Tudjman  described his visit to Romania as follows:    [Begin Tudjman recording] It was a very interesting. Above  all, we have become familiar with friendly Romania. We have  established personal contacts with the highest-ranking  representatives of Romania's state and political life. It is  crucial, however, that we made advances in our bilateral  relations. It seems to me that it is of equal importance, if not  of greater importance, that we agreed on some joint initiatives  in paving the way for resolving the international crisis in this  part of Europe, in the course of which Romania can play an  important role, given its relations with Belgrade. This was a  very fruitful visit. [end recording]    [Merlin] Prompted by the press, President Tudjman also  reflected on his meeting with representatives of a small  Croatian community in Romania. He is particularly satisfied  with the fact that 12 young Croatians from Romania are already  going to school in Zagreb. [passage omitted]    [Presenter] Assessing the results of his visit, the Croatian  president said that the two state delegations have agreed on the  most important problems. In this context he singled out a  solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and restoring  peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the continuation of  forging friendly relations and cooperation between Croatia and  Romania in all spheres -- political, economic and cultural --  something that was initiated as early as the time of President  Iliescu's visit to Croatia, President Tudjman said. He also  pointed out that Romania, as the most important country in south  east Europe, could secure an important role in resolving the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia on the strength of its good  relations with Belgrade as well as its own interest in peace and  stability in the region.    In reply to a question asking under what circumstances  Croatia would accept the lifting of sanctions against the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, President Tudjman said that the  precondition for lifting the sanctions is the restoration of  peace in Bosnia- Herzegovina and the return of Croatia's  UNPROFOR-protected occupied territories under Croatian  sovereignty.    President Tudjman expressed support for NATO's ultimatum to  the Bosnian Serbs, regarding it as the resolute stand of Europe  and the U.S. regarding the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We hope  that air strikes will not take place and that this ultimatum  will be an incentive for all three sides to restore peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina through negotiations, he added.    Speaking about Croatia's relations with Serbia, while  replying to a correspondent of POLITIKA of Belgrade, the  Croatian president stressed that Croatia was striving to improve  mutual relations, something that is also borne out by a recently  signed declaration on the normalization of Croatian-Serbian  relations. The precondition for true normalization is an end to  Belgrade's aid to the rebel Serbs in Croatia's occupied  territories.    As far as Croatia is concerned, President Tudjman said,  Croatia is ready to guarantee its Serbs local self-government in  the counties where Serbs are in the majority in Croatia and  cultural autonomy in whole Croatia. He stressed that it was  high time for the Croatians and Serbians to normalize their  relations. In this respect he also stressed that this ought to  be done on the basis of mutual recognition between the two  states. This would result in some sort of Scandinavization of  the Balkans and peace and stability in the region, he said.    Romanian President Iliescu regarded the Croatian President's  visit as very important for better bilateral relations between  the two countries. Good relations between Croatia and Romania  are an important element of stability in the entire region, he  added. President Iliescu lent support to the declaration on the  normalization of Serbian-Croatian relations as an important step  towards resolving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and as a  precondition for an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Pacification of Sarajevo on the basis of action by the  international community is an important contribution to the  establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Iliescu  went on to say. To secure peace at last in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  he added -- since it can only be secured through negotiations --  it is necessary that there is a political will on all three  sides.</p>

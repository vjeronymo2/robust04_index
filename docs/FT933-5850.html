			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Severfield-Reeve swings back into the black A BETTER balance between demand and supply for structural steel helped Severfield-Reeve report a turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 398,000 to profits of Pounds 210,000 for the six months to June 30 and to pay its first dividend in two years. Earnings per share were 1.22p (losses of 2.65p) and the interim dividend is 0.25p. On current trading, directors believe they will recommend a final dividend. Mr John Reeve, chairman of the USM-quoted steel group, warned trading conditions remained tough, but added: 'Over the last two or three years, we have seen upwards of 150 companies ceasing trading or going into receivership in our sector. We are seeing far more of a balance between supply and demand which reduces pressure on margins.' He said demand had increased slightly on last year's 800,000 tonnes, compared with 1.4m tonnes in 1989. Turnover improved to Pounds 9.32m (Pounds 8.66m), mainly reflecting a price increase from Pounds 630 to Pounds 700 per tonne of steel, in turn largely a function of price increases by British Steel. The company said there were some volume gains. Gearing fell to 43 per cent (55 per cent) and has halved since the December year end. The fall followed a Pounds 1.55m spring rights issue which diluted directors' holdings from 70 per cent to 46 per cent. The company generated cash of about Pounds 200,000. Net interest charges increased to Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 173,000) reflecting higher overdraft rates. The company has orders worth Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4m) with further tenders outstanding. It plans to export to the Far East and the Middle East. Within the last two weeks it secured the contract for a headquarters building for Scotland's Daily Record newspaper, worth Pounds 1.8m. In August, the company spent Pounds 400,000 on 'nearly new' computer numeric controlled plant at an estimated 25 per cent of market prices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos Mauricio Molina  Fonseca has said that even though the UN rapporteur on Human  Rights (Pedro Micken) never visited the country, he had to study  the Salvadoran human rights situation very closely. It seems  that poor coordination between (Micken) and the Salvadoran  Foreign Ministry prevented his visit to the country. However,  Molina Fonseca has said that disregard for human rights in the  country is a matter of concern for everyone.    [Begin Molina recording] I believe the human rights  situation  concerns all of us. We are going through very delicate times.  It is a time for much thought. Many deaths are being reported.  Bodies are constantly being found, and, unfortunately, these  crimes are not being properly investigated. [end recording]    With regard to the murder of Crescencio Diaz by U.S. soldier  Michael Lopez, the ombudsman said investigations are underway to  find out what happened.    [Begin Molina recording] What should worry us is finding out  how Major Lopez got out of the country. That is what the  Salvadoran people should find out. We have opened a file on  this case and we have requested information from the Foreign  Ministry, immigration, the judge hearing the case, and the  National Police director. We want to find out who is  responsible for this. [end recording]    Molina Fonseca also addressed the Goteras Jail massacre and  said that he is very worried because the Justice Ministry has  yet to issue a report on the case and establish responsibilities.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Chargeurs warns of difficult year CHARGEURS, the French textiles-to-media group, reported nearly doubled profits for last year but warned that 1993 would be 'very difficult', writes William Dawkins in Paris. Net profits rose from FFr366m (Dollars 66m) in 1991 to FFr724m, but this was helped by a FFr410m capital gain from the sale of Chargeurs' 12.9 per cent in UTA to Air France. The result implies an earnings fall from the first to the second half of the year. Chargeurs reported a FFr712m net profit in the first six months of 1992, up from FFr404m in the same period of 1991. Stripping out exceptional items, amortisation costs and contributions from disposals, last year's profits rose on a comparable basis from FFr246m to FFr365m.</p>

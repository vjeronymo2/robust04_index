			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/ADB: "Navy Soon To Have Four </F> Ultramodern Minesweepers"]    [Text] Brussels, 2 Jun (BELGA) -- On Thursday [2 June], the  Belgian Navy provided a glimpse of what to expect from the new  ultramodern coastal minesweepers (KMV), four of which it intends  to acquire in the next few years.    The study stage is now completed, the military weekly VOX  reports in its latest edition. The contractual stage has now  begun with an invitation to tender published a couple of weeks  ago and addressed to shipyards able to build these vessels, a  naval spokesman told BELGA.    These four vessels will replace about 30 existing  minesweepers of two types, built about 40 years ago: The MSO's  [Minesweeper, Ocean], such as the Breydel type dispatched to the  Persian Gulf in 1988 during the Iranian-Iraqi war and the MSE's  built of wood. The Navy originally planned to buy 10 of these  minesweepers, but this figure was reduced to four following the  Army restructuring decided by the government in January 1993.    VOX reports that the four new KMV's, like the existing  tripartite minesweepers, will be fitted with a hull of composite  materials (glass fibre and resin) which sharply reduces the  emission of sound waves and the magnetic field in the water.  These two characteristics are particularly important for a  vessel required to operate in close proximity to mines detonated  by sound waves or magnetic force.    They will also be fitted with a totally new sweeping system,  which will allow it to very precisely imitate the sound wave or  magnetic force of a vessel targeted by the mines.    The Navy reports that these new minesweepers can also be  used  for fishing control missions, combating sea pollution, and  surveying the sea bed and objects lying on it.    These new minesweepers will be weigh around 650 tons and  will  measure about 50 meters long and 10.5 meters wide. Their speed  is estimated at 15 knots (about 27 km) per hour, VOX reports.    Thanks to the advanced automation of equipment, the future  minesweepers will need a crew of just 27. Existing minesweepers  have a crew of 76.    The purchase of these new coastal minesweepers is one of the  principal elements in the national defense investment plan for  the medium term as adopted in July 1993, to which 12.6 billion  Belgian francs have been allocated.    By the terms of the invitation to tender, the construction  of  these four new vessels will be the subject of a freely  negotiated contract. A prototype will first be built and  delivered before production of three "standard" vessels.    The first minesweeper should be ready by 1998. The three  others could be launched by the beginning of the next century.    The Navy reports that this minesweeping program is now a  purely national program, following the withdrawal of the  Netherlands, which had helped fund the feasibility study.  Portugal had observer status within the Belgo-Netherlands  working party which drew up the specifications for these new  vessels.</p>

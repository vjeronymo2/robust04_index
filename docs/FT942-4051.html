			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/C&amp;G The resilience of Lloyds Bank's shares since Wednesday's High Court ruling on its bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester suggests the market still believes the deal will eventually go ahead. A similar signal comes from the performance of C&amp;G's permanent interest bearing shares or PIBs. Their yield premium over 15-year gilts has barely moved since Wednesday night's ruling. Yet there is much at stake if the judge's negative verdict is upheld. Under the deal as proposed, PIB holders stand to benefit not only from the bonus paid to investors in C&amp;G, but also from the relative improvement in the status of their investment. Since building societies have no equity shares in issue, their PIBs, which are irredeemable, stand pretty much at the bottom of the pecking order in the event of a liquidation. Once ownership of the society is transferred to a bank with an equity share capital, the relative ranking improves. Moreover with interest then being paid gross, as is normal on subordinated debt, the paper would have new appeal to overseas investors. Such thoughts saw the yield on C&amp;G's PIBs move 40 basis points closer to that on gilts in the immediate aftermath of the original announcement. If the deal were blocked that gain would be reversed. Moreover the repercussions would be felt elsewhere in the PIBs market where spreads, particularly on issues by smaller societies, have narrowed in anticipation of a broader industry restructuring. Doubtless there is money waiting to snap up UK building societies, including some accumulated by Irish societies anxious to expand in the UK. But it is unlikely to be spent if Lloyds and C&amp;G cannot find a way round the judge's ruling.</p>

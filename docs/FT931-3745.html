			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: London equities close 37 points lower Nervousness over political developments in Russia and Hong Kong caused the already depressed London stock market to take a turn for the worse in mid-afternoon when the FT-SE 100 index dipped to within five points of the 2,900 mark. However, there was no significant selling pressure and the market staged a comfortable rally in late dealings. The final loss of 37.5 left the Footsie at 2,915.9. In New York, stocks tumbled for a second day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 29.18 points down at 3,427.82.

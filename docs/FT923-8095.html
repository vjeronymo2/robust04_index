			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Croats and Serbs want Bosnia made UN protectorate CROAT and Serb leaders yesterday called for Bosnia-Hercegovina to be made a United Nations protectorate, challenging the republic's right to exist as an independent state. The proposal, made by Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, and supported by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, confirms persistent reports that Croat and Serb leaders, despite their own mutual hostility, are conspiring to carve up Bosnia. 'Croatia and Serbia want to take away all power from the legitimate government of Bosnia so as to divide the republic among each other,' a western diplomat said. Bosnia's Serbs, backed by the former Yugoslav federal army, control more than 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, while Croatia now controls a swathe of territory in Hercegovina, in the west of the former Yugoslav republic. A resolution authorising 'all measures necessary' to deliver humanitarian aid to Sarajevo and 'other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina' - UN shorthand for potential use of force - is expected to be passed today by a big majority in the Security Council. Last night Russia joined the US, Britain, France and Belgium in sponsoring the resolution. China is likely to abstain. A second resolution, under the same sponsorship, would have the Security Council strongly condemning the practice of 'ethnic cleansing', in which tens of thousands of Moslems have been forced out of the republic. UN diplomats in New York said they would continue to oppose attempts by Croatia and Serbia to divide Bosnia - populated by Moslems, Serbs and Croats  -into ethnically-based cantons. But they conceded that the Serb policy of 'ethnic cleansing' would make it easier for Croatia and Serbia to annex parts of Bosnia 'over time'. 'We are talking about the breaking up of a state,' a UN diplomat said. 'We cannot endorse it. The question is if we can stop it.' UN protectorate status might not necessarily facilitate the restoration of Bosnia's original ethnic make-up or the return of the refugees. The diplomat said Croatia was doing 'exactly what Serbia is doing'. Both republics had 'grabbed land. Both are accusing Moslems of setting up an Islamic fundamentalist state in Bosnia. Both are blaming the Moslems for obstructing any so-called peace talks'. This is because Croatia and Serbia have nearly achieved what they wanted from the war in Bosnia and are now in a position to sue for peace, he said. Mr Tudjman, who yesterday was sworn in as president after his Croatian Democratic Union was swept into power in last month's elections, said: 'In Bosnia-Hercegovina, there are tendencies to create an Islamic state in Europe . . . this is a world problem, and both Europe and the UN will have to deal with it.' Mr Tudjman added that he was 'not personally disinclined' to make Bosnia a UN protectorate 'in order to reach an end to the war'. Yesterday, Mr Karadzic asked the UN to place the northern city of Bihac  - which Serbs have been attacking - under a protectorate. He had suggested last month that the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, besieged by Serbian forces since April, also be placed under a UN protectorate. In an announcement possibly aimed at thwarting international military action against Serbian forces, Mr Milan Panic, the prime minister of Yugoslavia - comprising Serbia and Montenegro - said in Ankara that Bosnia would be granted recognition. But he did not give a date. Serb forces switch prisoners, Page 2</p>

The Pakistani announcement in Islamabad  puzzled many here, and more so its logic given by that country's  Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan. Islamabad alleged that the  Indian Government had gone back on its commitment to lease the  Jinnah House for the use of the Consulate General and refused to  facilitate the acquisition of suitable premises for the  Consulate General. It also accused the government of  Maharashtra of making it difficult for the Consulate General to  carry out its assigned functions. On their very face, these  charges look flimsy and unconvincing. For example, India is on  record of having rejected Pakistan's plea for the use of Jinnah  House as long as 1983 when General Zia approached New Delhi with  this request. Subsequently, India gave no impression that it was  not firm on its rejection of the Pakistani request. India was  also not obliged to find a place for Pakistan in Bombay.  Pakistan knew it and yet it made the Jinnah House and its  failure to find a suitable place for its Consulate General as an  excuse for winding up its work in Bombay.    Pakistan seems to have perfected the art of accusing others  of the sins which it itself commits. India's High Commission in  Islamabad and its Consulate General in Karachi worked under all  kinds of trying conditions. In May 1992, a senior diplomat, Mr.  Rajesh Mittal, was abducted and tortured by Pakistani  intelligence agencies. It was such an awful incident that even  Amnesty International deplored it. Before that, the wife of an  attache was abducted while shopping and questioned about the  activities of her husband and other staff members of the High  Commission. In Karachi, the Indian staff was kept under  constant intimidation. Those Pakistani Sindhis and Muhajirs who  visited the consulate were branded as Indian agents. In August  1992, the two countries signed an agreement on the code of  conduct for treatment of diplomatic, consular personnel in the  two countries. They reaffirmed their commitment to the Vienna  Convention of 1962 on diplomatic relations and the Vienna  Convention of 1963 on consular relations. However, as the year  1992 came to a close, Pakistan gave this accord its own  interpretation and asked India to curtail the strength of its  staff in Karachi to less than one-third, that is, from 68 to 20.  The Pakistani order mainly hurt the Muhajir community in Sindh.  Muhajirs are refugees from India. They still have family ties  in India. The Indian Consulate was issuing 700 visas a day to  them to visit their relatives. The community which has been  suffering political deprivations and discriminations because  mainly of their language, Urdu, will now be denied the facility  to meet relatives in India.    Pakistan's sudden decision to close the consulate in Bombay  came at a time when India, after the Geneva episode, was trying  to create conditions for the restart of efforts to normalize  relations with this important neighbor. This desire has  received a setback. There could have been two reasons why  Pakistan chose to close down its consulate at this time. First,  because of its domestic compulsion, the government of Ms.  Benazir Bhutto was trying to preempt the reopening of  India-Pakistan dialogue on normalization of relations. Ms.  Bhutto finds herself in an acutely embarrassing situation after  the loss of face in Geneva. She calls it her victory, but the  opposition remains unconvinced, especially in view of all the  claims before the withdrawal of Pakistan's resolutions from the  United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva that a large  number of commission members were willing to vote for the  resolution. At present, Ms. Bhutto's government will find it  difficult to restart negotiations with India.    The second reason may be Pakistani intelligence agencies'  strategy to keep the Muhajirs from meeting their relations in  India. Muhajirs have been the special target of the military  operations in Sindh, which began in May 1992. A section of the  Urdu press feels no compunction in accusing the Muhajirs of  being anti-Pakistan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 March (XINHUA) -- As cameras flashed,  sending dazzling lights, Deputy Rong Yiren spoke with exuberant  emotions: "This year's people's congress is particularly  meaningful to me." The highly venerated vice president of the  state revealed some of his "personal history" to fellow  deputies: "The National People's Congress [NPC] has been  established for 40 years, and I have also served for 40 years as  a people's deputy since Premier Zhou Enlai invited me to Beijing  to attend the congress for the first time. It is safe to say  that I am a witness to New China's socialist democracy and legal  construction."    Rong Yiren made these emotional remarks when he, with  President Jiang Zemin, joined the Shanghai NPC delegation's  discussion of the government work report on the afternoon of 11  March. He recalled: "Democracy and the legal system have  steadily developed since the founding of New China. The  development was interrupted for a while during the 10-year  turmoil. However, since the end of the `Cultural Revolution,'  our democracy has continued to improve and develop, and our  legal system has been steadily enhanced and strengthened. Our  democracy is compatible with our national conditions. We must  unswervingly adhere to the path of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics."    The senior NPC deputy earnestly remarked: "China is still a  developing country, and its national strength is still not  strong enough. Everyone should work hard to build up the  country and improve the people's livelihood. However, some  developments merit our attention -- developments such as  excessive extravagance and waste, refusal to stress the spirit  of plain living and hard struggle in economic construction, and  the principle of building the country through thrift and  diligence."    At the beginning of reform and opening up, Rong Yiren,  entrusted by central leading comrades, founded the China  International Trust and Investment Corporation. The company,  which took the lead in linking China with the international  economy, helped acquire a good image for China's opening up and  raised large sums of money for its socialist construction. He  said yesterday: "China has 1.2 billion people. If everyone  saves 10 yuan, there will be 12 billion yuan. The reason that  today some countries dare to criticize us and interfere in our  internal affairs is, to put it bluntly, we are still not rich  and powerful. We must work with one heart and one mind and make  arduous efforts to make China strong and prosperous."    His forceful words were received with thunderous applause  from Jiang Zemin and other deputies from Shanghai. The applause  symbolized their respect and approval.</p>

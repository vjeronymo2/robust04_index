			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Leading Article: A questionable comeback BLESSED BY 47 per cent of the vote in Sunday's Greek elections, Mr Andreas Papandreou has achieved one of the most spectacular comebacks in postwar European politics. Unless he shows more wisdom than during his prime ministership in 1981-89, his return could prove uncomfortable, costly and divisive - for Greece and its Community partners. What counts most against the 74-year-old leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement is not age and poor health. Konrad Adenauer was only a year younger when he became West German chancellor in 1949, and Ronald Reagan was four years older when he left office in 1989. The chief reason for scepticism about Greece's prime minister-elect lies in his 1980s track record of economic mismanagement. Mr Papandreou's policies were the main reason why - in contrast to Spanish and Portuguese experience - Greece during the 1980s suffered a fall in prosperity compared with the EC average. Mr Papandreou has toned down his left-wing radicalism. Yet it is not clear that he has drawn the necessary lessons from his previous period in power. Mr Papandreou has profited from the unpopularity of austerity measures taken by his successor, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, to correct his own legacy of high public sector debts and deficits. But during the election campaign he showered voters with self-contradictory pledges to avoid new taxes while promising full employment and low inflation. At the same time, he ducked the urgent question of how to modernise Greece's uncompetitive industry and inefficient public administration. Now that he has won, Mr Papandreou will have to set priorities. The most urgent is to fill holes in the budget caused by recession, tax evasion, and delays in the privatisation programme, which he has pledged to end. This year's budget deficit is projected at 13 per cent of gross domestic product, 3 points higher than targeted. Inflation, at an underlying rate of 13.5 per cent, is grotesquely out of line with EC levels. In foreign policy, too, there is reason for disquiet. In less than three months, Greece takes over the presidency of the Community at a crucial time in negotiations on enlarging EC membership. Greece's refusal to allow formal EC recognition of neighbouring Macedonia has already irked its partners. Mr Papandreou has taken a much more nationalist line over Macedonia than Mr Mitsotakis, whose relative moderation added to his electoral problems. Difficulties in establishing a coherent Community policy on the Balkans will increase if Mr Papandreou maintains opposition to UN-sponsored talks with the former Yugoslav province. Greece's blocking of EC aid to Macedonia under the Community's eastern European Phare programme is particularly misplaced. Annual transfers from the EC make up 5 per cent of Greek GDP. Formal EC monitoring of the Greek economy, put into place in 1991 after the granting of a Community loan, has now lapsed. Mr Papandreou's campaign promises suggest that Greece is likely to remain heavily dependent upon external finance, including that provided under Community structural funds. These disbursements should be made conditional upon Greece meeting appropriate economic targets. The Community is rightly setting exacting standards for the eastern and central European countries queueing to join. Greece, as an established member, should expect no less rigour.</p>

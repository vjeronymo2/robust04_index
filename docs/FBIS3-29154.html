			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- A senior leader of the  main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Tuesday [15  February] slammed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for not  holding talks with the United States on the yen's surge against  the U.S. dollar.    "I cannot believe the premier and the foreign minister have  not strongly conveyed Japan's stance on the yen's appreciation,"  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told a news conference. "If  Japan-U.S. relations are really mature, they should have talked  about how to deal with the yen's surge" with the U.S. side when  they visited Washington last week, Mori added.    The U.S. currency dropped sharply against the yen in Tokyo  on  Tuesday, closing at 102.02 yen, down 3.67 yen from Monday's  close.    The dollar has been under intense downward pressure against  the yen since Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed  last Friday to strike a deal on a new framework to reduce  Japan's huge trade surplus and increase the share of imports in  its markets.</p>

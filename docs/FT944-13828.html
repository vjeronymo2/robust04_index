			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Management: Competition keeps the wheels rolling - Charles Batchelor continues a series on public services with a look at Plymouth Citybus Waiting alongside Plymouth Citybus' smart red, grey and white buses in the city's Royal Parade are a couple of plain grey buses which provide the city's park-and-ride service. 'You can see that livery was decided by a committee,' says Brian Fisher, managing director of Citybus, ruefully. Subsidised by the local authority but operated by Citybus, the park-and-ride fleet does indeed sport a livery chosen by the city council. But the colour of these buses apart, Fisher says he has a relaxed relationship with the town hall, following the hiving-off of its bus operations into a separate company nearly seven years ago. Fisher and his three-man team of senior managers are widely regarded in the bus industry as running one of the best-managed companies still in municipal ownership. They have improved the frequency and quality of services and converted a public subsidy into a healthy profit. Before the 1985 Transport Act forced councils to establish separately managed bus companies, Plymouth City Transport received an annual subsidy of Pounds 400,000. Losses continued for the first three years after separation but the company has since achieved steadily rising profits reaching Pounds 1.28m on turnover of Pounds 9.6m in 1993. As well as achieving a healthy profit and loss account, the company improved the quality of services after carrying out a review of fares, service frequency and passenger numbers. Minibuses replaced most of the expensive, cumbersome double deckers to provide a faster, more frequent service to outlying housing estates. Passenger numbers rose, but not sufficiently to meet the nationally negotiated wage levels Plymouth Citybus inherited. An attempt to force down costs by reducing holidays and overtime payments led to a drivers' strike, but after 10 days the strikers backed down and accepted the terms. While Citybus' vehicles were off the road, Western National, a rival operator, applied to run on its routes. A nine-month bus war ensued before the two companies called a truce. The bus war was undeniably a setback, but Fisher, who is 48, says it was also a period of rapid learning. He joined the buses at the age of 18 after a brief spell of working for a road haulage company. During his career he has spent time on local government management courses, though most of his experience has been acquired 'as I went along. A lot of it is common sense, balancing income and costs'. The financial management of a bus company is certainly helped by its positive cash flow - you don't buy bus tickets on credit. But the strategy adopted by Fisher and his senior managers has several elements. They are: To rid buses of their reputation as a downmarket means of transport. Plymouth Citybus has invested heavily in new vehicles and insists on a smart dress code for its drivers. To improve the frequency and reliability of its service 'so that passengers can throw away the timetable'. Many outlying parts of Plymouth now have up to seven services an hour. To tighten management controls. Under the council, accounts took three months to prepare. Now the board receives a weekly report on bus availability, staff sickness, wages costs and the like. Monthly management accounts are available within five working days of the month end. To make use of facilities needed to support the bus operations to earn outside revenues. Citybus has successfully bid for maintenance work from the Ministry of Defence, British Rail and Devon County Council. These contracts bring in Pounds 700,000 of turnover. To expand profitable sidelines of the main bus business. It has increased its coach tour activities five-fold since independence and now generates turnover of Pounds 1m. To improve relations with staff. Brian Vincent, a driver and the employee representative on the board, confirms a change from the council days when managers appeared intent on distancing themselves from the workforce. Yet discipline has been tightened. Competition from private companies may have provided the spur for municipally owned operators to improve standards - but even so industry observers agree that Plymouth Citybus has achieved a remarkable transformation.</p>

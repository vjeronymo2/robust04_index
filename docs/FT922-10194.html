			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Watchdog rejects change on council swaps THE Audit Commission, the government's public expenditure watchdog, has rejected calls for a change in the powers of councils that would allow them to enter into interest-rate swap contracts. A Bank of England committee had urged the change in response to widespread concern in the City after the law Lords ruled last year in a case involving Hammersmith and Fulham in London that councils did not have the authority to enter into such transactions. The ruling left 80 banks facing losses totalling Pounds 560m on interest-rate swap transactions with 130 councils in England and Wales. The commission says, in its response to a consultation paper issued by the Bank's legal risk review committee in February, that it would prefer the government to spell out on a case-by-case basis the types of transaction open to councils. The committee under Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, argued that the ultra vires doctrine - the rule that transactions outside the capacity of one of the parties involved are void - was unfair and led to uncertainty. The committee argued that poll-tax payers were adequately protected by provisions about authorisation and ostensible authority. Abolishing the doctrine would place those dealing with councils in the same position as those dealing with limited-liability companies. The commission says, however, that there are important differences between councils and companies, and that poll-tax payers need the protection offered by the doctrine. It says the Alexander committee's proposal would 'largely remove the risk from parties dealing with local authorities and transfer it to local taxpayers who are unable to to take any steps to protect themselves from the sort of situation which arose at Hammersmith and Fulham and elsewhere in relation to swaps'. Elimination of the ultra vires option would put pressure on auditors to use powers of judicial review or to issue a prohibition on suspect transactions, the commission adds. The result might be a fresh spate of creative-accounting schemes of doubtful legality and prudence. 'Some London councils are still paying a heavy price for having entered into such schemes in the 1980s,' it says. The commission proposes clarification of the law where areas of uncertainty arise.</p>

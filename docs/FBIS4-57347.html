			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonardo Attuch: "Ricupero the Thinker"] </F>   [Text] The differences between the new minister of finance,  Ambassador Rubens Ricupero, and his predecessor, Fernando  Henrique Cardoso, go beyond the difference existing between the  discreet government official and the smiling candidate. Unlike  the former minister, who asked that everything he ever wrote be  forgotten--although Cardoso claims he never said it and several  others claim they heard him say it--Ricupero takes pride in his  literary production.    Whereas Cardoso throws his books on the bonfire, the  ambassador distributes his works, even those not yet  unpublished, and pleads with the newspapers to discuss ideas,  concepts, and projects instead of trivial intrigues. Ricupero  complains: "They have already tried to plant news items about  me."    Despite having to administer the most delicate phase of the  program--the building of a new currency, which is when the plan  actually begins, according to Delfim Netto--Ricupero still finds  time to devote himself to the study of parallel issues having to  do with the future of the Brazilian economy. Some of his  favorite topics are the rigidity of the labor market, the  straitjacket that the state is in because of mandated  expenditures, trade relations between underdeveloped countries  and the First World, and, lastly, social security reform.    There are similarities, however, between Ricupero and  Cardoso. Since Ricupero took over from Cardoso at the beginning  of the month, both men have continued--or would like to  continue--to be what they were before. Even as minister of  finance, Ricupero has not stopped his classes ("it's therapy"),  his masses at the Sao Bento Monastery, or his daily duties. Even  as a senator, Cardoso sees himself in the role of minister of  finance, with an eye on the success of the stabilization plan  and the succession. "Everyone knows that the plan is mine," he  said shortly after stepping down as minister. Seen from another  angle, there are no differences between the two at all. Both are  expected to vote for the same candidate in the presidential  elections in October and November.  <H5>  New Ideas Are Always Welcome </H5>   One of Minister Ricupero's bedside books is that by  economist  Jose Pastore of the University of Sao Paulo, who compares social  security taxes in Brazil with those in the rest of the world.  For every cruzeiro that a businessman pays a worker, 81 centavos  have to be sent to the government for programs concerned with  assistance, insurance, guarantee funds, retirement, and so on.  According to Pastore, Brazil "is a country with high social  security taxes and low wages."    Ricupero supports deregulation of the labor market as a  means  of stimulating employment. "The results of that rigidity are an  informal economy and under-the-counter dealings," he says.  Pastore says that for the businessman, it is more advantageous  to convert social security taxes into wages than to keep them as  fixed costs payable to the government.    The director of the Interunion Department for Statistics and  Socioeconomic Studies (Dieese), Sergio Mendonca, does not trust  deregulation. "No one can guarantee that social security taxes  would be transferred to the worker," he says. But Mendonca  admits that the state services received by the public in  exchange for those taxes is of extremely poor quality and  subject to corruption.    In his book, Pastore shows that social security taxes are  higher in Brazil than in any European country. The only one that  comes close is France.  <H5>  Reputation as `Lunatic' Does Not Worry Him </H5>   Minister of Finance Rubens Ricupero will soon publish one of  his latest books in Chile. Completed in March, it deals with the  international system of trade. The title talks about  "disagreements resulting from unrequited love," with the author  criticizing the fact that trade in the underdeveloped world has  been liberalized with no corresponding move by the rich  countries. Ricupero attacks "the righteous indignation of the  preachers of free trade, who reserve their holy anger for  industrial subsidies while ignoring agricultural subsidies."    Ricupero also attacks the less transparent obstacles that  have been replacing tariff barriers. They constitute so-called  nontariff protectionism, in which quotas or obstacles of an  ecological nature--such as the "green stamp"--and so on are  adopted. But the minister does not limit his remarks to a  Manichaean and Third-Worldist opposition between North and  South. According to him, confrontation over liberalization has  occurred many times between the United States and the European  Community or, occasionally, Japan and other developed nations.  Since Brazil's trade is diversified, Ricupero supports a general  opening up of foreign markets.    The ambassador also cultivates the reputation as a "lunatic"  which he has among some ministers, especially military  ministers, because of his habit of expatiating on loftier  subjects. But he describes himself as pragmatic and as a  follower of the ethic of responsibility proposed by Max Weber,  which says that the results of one's acts are more important  than one's intentions. For that reason, Ricupero has been  intransigent--as he himself admits--on the issue of the minimum  wage. Considering all the ideas that Ricupero delves into,  Camoes might have written: "such a big project for such a short  life." Ricupero has less than nine months ahead of him in the  Ministry of Finance.  <H5>  One Complaint: the State's Straitjacket </H5>   During his visit to Congress on Wednesday, Ambassador  Ricupero complained about the straitjacketing of the state. "I  am a minister of finance with control over 7 percent of the  budget; the rest is the prisoner of mandated expenditures."  Ricupero has been influenced by his friend, Deputy Jose Serra  (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Sao Paulo), who in  Congress is one of the main opponents of compulsory transfers.    Transfers to states and municipalities rose from 11.8  percent  of the Union's revenues in 1983 to 18.8 percent 10 years later.  In 1992, nearly half of the social security budget was committed  in the form of mandated expenditures. The 1988 Constitution also  requires that 18 percent of total tax collections be spent on  education. In the labors of Hercules involved in the economic  plan, one of the most difficult problems was the blockage of  funds, which instead of going to mayors and governors, had to be  transferred to the Emergency Social Fund.    Serra uses the argument that mandated expenditures prevent  the government from being flexible enough to alter priorities in  spending, the result being a harmful effect on the tax system.  "The Union tends to increase taxes typical of monetary policy,  which are not transferred to the states and municipalities, in  order to increase its revenues," the deputy says. Serra also  says that one mandated expenditure leads to another because each  sector is trying to defend itself. The Ministry of Health is  demanding that 30 percent of the social security revenues be  given to it. The government's goal under the Unified Health  System (SUS) is to transfer income and expenditure related to  hospital care to the state and municipal governments.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CHASE THRILLER RUNNING ON ALL CYLINDERS;  </P> <P> DADDY BY LOUP DURAND (VILLARD BOOKS: $18.95; 377 PP.)  </P> <P> "To write a thriller," the late John Braine once proposed, "you begin with  improbability. . . . The hero must always be in danger. He must at least once  be helpless in the hands of the enemy, and he must escape."  </P> <P> Loup Durand follows this formula slavishly. "Daddy," a major best seller in  France and throughout Europe, not only begins with improbability but remains  consistently improbable, even absurd, throughout. In doing so, it makes one  consider the entire question of genre writing. For one would expect that any  book so formulaic would lie there lifeless, inert, at best a book you keep  reading for its plot while you berate yourself for surrendering to such obvious  claptrap.  </P> <P> Instead, this book is alive and vibrant, compelling in its suspense, rich in  character and incident. Set in Europe during World War II, the story is put  into motion when an elderly banker, who has funneled hundreds of millions of  dollars out of Germany for Jews and others, is caught and tortured by the  Nazis. He leaps from a window to his death before he discloses the immensely  complex series of secret access codes, which alone would allow the Nazis to  reach those funds. Only his granddaughter, Maria, knows the codes, and she has  taught them to her only son, the genius Thomas, who holds them all in his head.  </P> <P> The Nazis want that information and set up a fiendishly effective team to track  it down. Essentially, the book is a manhunt, although the "men" being hunted  are, first the lovely Maria who has lived a remarkably independent life and who  is loved and protected by many people, most notably a team of preternaturally  capable Spanish bodyguards; and later her son, Thomas, an 11-year-old boy of  inhuman intelligence and perspicacity and yet -- in perhaps the major victory  for Durand's writing skill -- immensely likable. If we did not care for this  boy Thomas, if we did not ache for him when he watches his mother die in  flames, if we did not feel his unwillingness to attach himself to others when  he has seen so many who've been kind to him killed, if we did not feel his  darknesses and his hatreds and his fears, there would be no book.  </P> <P> Obviously, we have to suspend disbelief here. This boy with his "rat's  instinct," his "frightening abnormal lucidity," has the ability to outthink,  outplan, outfox, an immensely resourceful adversary, the epicene Nazi genius  Laemmle whose obsession with the boy becomes pathological. They play chess  against each other, real chess when Thomas is Laemmle's captive, figurative  chess across the map of Europe when he is on the run. Chess becomes a leitmotiv  throughout the story.  </P> <P> Much the weakest element in the book is the man who turns out to be Thomas'  real father, a playboy Rockefeller-type from America, who has never known of  Thomas' existence. David Quartermain is totally apolitical, a man of no  commitments, completely uninterested in the family international banking  business (which turns out to have continuing important connections with Nazi  Germany throughout the war). Ultimately, David responds to Maria's summoning  him to Europe and becomes Dick Daring, performing astonishing feats of bravery,  skill and planning. It's as difficult to believe most of this as it is to  accept that a man of obvious intelligence and wealth in 1942 would not know why  France was bisected into occupied and Vichy-controlled sectors, or what a  "Petainist" was. Quartermain seems almost a Frenchman's view of the noble  savage, ignorant but instinctively in touch with the good and the true.  </P> <P> The great success of "Daddy" is in Durand's teeming imagination. An abundance  of plot, of imagination, of incident, lends a richness to the book's texture --  no minimalism here -- yet never buries the main narrative thrust -- the chase.  Along the road of life, we meet dozens of characters who are individually  delineated -- Nazis brutal and cynical, brilliant and dense, French chevaliers  and graspers, ordinary people fearful or singularly brave, (although there  certainly seem to be more Resistance heroes per hectare than history, as Marcel  Ophuls has pitilessly revealed it, really produced). This is not genre fiction  as high art, in the Le Carre mode, but it is commercial fiction of great skill  and energy.  </P> <P> A word about the translation from the French by J. Maxwell Brownjohn: It is  seamless and idiomatic, without a single clumsy construction. It's a remarkable  achievement to sustain a breakneck narrative pace and never once sound as if  the book was written in anything other than English.  </P></p>

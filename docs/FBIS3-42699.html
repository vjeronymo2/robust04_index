Fiscal Policy Does Not Extend to Capital Investments"]    [Text]  <H5>  Edicts. </H5>   By an edict of President Boris Yeltsin new rates for taxing  legal entities have been set for 1994. The heaviest one now, the  profit tax (which accounts for almost half of the budget  incomes), may amount to a maximum of 35 percent for enterprises.  And within the framework of the policy proclaimed by the  government for division of authority between the Center and the  territories with increased independence for the regions, the  profit tax has been divided into two independent "channels": 13  percent is to go into the federal budget, and the local  authorities (depending on whether they want to support  production or augment the local budget for social purposes) may  decide to vary their rate within the range of from 0 to 25  percent.    The commercial banks and insurance companies which, as  distinct from the enterprises, paid income tax but not profit  tax last year will now be "like everyone else": The tax has been  set for them at the level of 30 percent. Naturally the regional  authorities will need time to analyze the situation and  determine the amount of the local profit tax. Therefore the  edict will introduce a uniform tax rate of 22 percent for all of  Russia until they make their decisions.    In addition to the 20-percent value-added tax that existed  last year, a special tax will be introduced in the amount of 3  percent for supporting the most important branches of the  economy. This returns us to the stormy discussions of last year  between the former Supreme Soviet and the government. The  latter, trying somehow to cope with the populism of the people's  deputies, who inflated the expenditure part of the budget,  submitted to parliament an initiative for a 7-percent tax in  addition to the value-added tax, of which 4 percent went for the  support of the agro-industrial complex and 3 percent--the coal  miners. Parliament cut down this proposal, which was backed by  the unpopular Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov. It seems that  there will be no opponents of the special tax this year.    In line with its declaration of the shift of emphasis "from  the monetary to the structural-investment policy," it is also  necessary to consider the points of the edict concerning  exemption from taxation of profit used for financing capital  investments for production and nonproduction purposes and also  repayment of bank credit used for these purposes.    Small enterprises, if they are operating in the sphere of  production and processing of agricultural products or the output  of consumer goods or medical equipment, and also if they are  building housing, will receive tax holidays as they did before:  during the first two years of their creation they are exempted  from profit tax. In exactly the same way, goods imported into  Russia as contributions to the authorized capital of enterprises  with foreign investments will for a year after it is registered  again be exempted from the value-added tax.    Analysis of the edict shows that the fiscal component of  taxation has been increased in it. In addition to the  aforementioned 3-percent tax for financing support of priority  branches and the new 1-percent transportation tax collected from  the wage fund of the enterprises, the overall amount of the  profit tax has been increased to a maximum of 35 percent as  compared to 32 percent last year. This can be explained by the  considerable difficulties being experienced by the republic  budget. While in 1992 incomes made up 29 percent of the GNP, in  1993 they dropped to 24 percent. This was a reflection not only  of the reduction of the value-added tax from 28 to 20 percent,  but also the deterioration of the situation with respect to tax  collection.</p>

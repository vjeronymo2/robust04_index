			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Russia draws up short-list for central bank chairman FOUR candidates are being considered for what must be one of the most uncomfortable seats at the top in Russia: the post of central bank chairman. The choice is likely to be made within the next two weeks. Mr Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the parliamentary commission which will examine the candidates, said yesterday the four were Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the former chairman of the Soviet central bank; one of his deputies, Mr Valerian Kulikov; Mr Boris Fyodorov, the radical former Russian finance minister; and Mr Yakov Dubinetsky, chairman of one of Russia's state-owned banks, Promstroibank. His revelations came as Mr Gyorgy Matiukhin, the thick-skinned central bank chairman who announced he was quitting on Monday, angrily accused parliament of looking for 'somebody who would bow either to the president or the parliamentary speaker'. 'I'm not that kind of man,' he said in an angry defence of his record in parliament yeshe ascribed in part to 'shattered nerves', came just as the government had come to accept him as the lesser of possible evils for his stubborn defence of a relatively strict monetary policy. The key job has become vacant at a critical time for the future course of market reforms launched in January by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister. Six months on, it is not clear how hard either President Yeltsin or Mr Gaidar - having given up so much ground to opponents of radical reform  - will fight for a candidate of their choice. Even when the job was not vacant, the government had been pushing for Mr Fyodorov, who is now working for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London, to take the job. Mr Fyodorov, who resigned from an earlier Yeltsin administration, in December 1990, on the grounds that the Russian leader was not serious about market reforms, was also rumoured in the corridors of parliament yesterday to be President Yeltsin's favourite. But Mr Pochinok appeared yesterday to damn him with faint praise. 'Fyodorov is part of a new wave, very talented, but with less experience. He lacks contacts inside the country and is somewhat withdrawn from domestic affairs,' he said last night. Mr Fyodorov will be pressing for full independence to run a tight financial policy - which may not go down well with parliament despite its claims that all it wants is 'more information'. Mr Pochinok praised Mr Gerashchenko, for his international and domestic stature, but said he had the disadvantage of being burdened by his past as Soviet central bank chairman (including alleged support for the August coup)  -unlike his deputy, Mr Kulikov. The World Bank has agreed a Dollars 400m (Pounds 222m) loan to Romania to help the country restructure its economy and continue with reforms, the Romanian government said yesterday, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. Japan also intends to lend a further Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m, it said.</p>

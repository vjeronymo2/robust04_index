			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Autumn lull in European turnover Last summer's boost to bourse turnover, as traders and investors ignored the traditional European holiday season, was replaced by an autumn lull in September; but the hiatus was temporary, and more apparent than real. September turnover figures for the top eight European bourses, put together by NatWest Securities, fell by 10.1 per cent from the August level after previous month-by-month gains of 20.3, 20.8, and 4.4 per cent. However, says Mr James Cornish, European market strategist at NatWest, this leaves September well ahead of the 1993 average, and there are other indications that the setback was not serious: first, turnover on Seaq International, London's screen-based trading system for international equities, fell by 15.7 per cent on the month for the seven continental markets, suggesting a relative reluctance to sell on the part of international investors; and secondly, since the military success of the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin on October 4, European markets have recovered and volumes have picked up. The general lesson of the fall of turnover figures in September and their subsequent rise, says Mr Cornish, seems to be that there has been no international rush to sell, and that there is still considerable interest in buying. There were winners on the month, where doing business was concerned. Belgium's equity market fell by 1.3 per cent in September, but turnover rose by 34.8 per cent to a figure well above even the recent record level in March. Mr Sebastian Scotney, at Dillon Read, says that investors picked out Belgium as a 1993 laggard market at the end of September. There was also speculation that, at some stage, there could be a unilateral devaluation of the Belgian franc. Among individual stocks and sectors, there was some quite heavy turnover in retailers, and Delhaize in particular; while disappointing interim reports from cyclicals, including Bekhaert, provoked considerable selling from disappointed existing holders and reciprocal buying from those who believe that cyclicals are ready to be bought for European economic recovery. The other winner was France which, in spite of a 4.6 per cent fall in the CAC-40 index, saw its turnover up 4.2 per cent on August, and by 14.6 per cent on the average of the previous three months. Mr Cornish says that the imminence of the BNP privatisation encouraged the market; presumably some institutions sold to make space for the new scrip which was coming up. Of the fallers, the Netherlands was down by a fifth as interest turned to bigger markets, or those with more volatile currencies. The Swiss dropped 19.2 per cent on the suggestion that this bull market had run its course, and Germany by 18.4 per cent before the beginnings of an October upturn.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse           Jun      Jul     Aug       Sep       US                 1993     1993    1993      1993    Dollars bn  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium        50.65    59.86   64.52     86.99       2.47 France        154.32   151.18  176.99    184.37      32.40 Germany       131.80   188.75  184.40    150.42      91.95 Italy       30,864.8 35,687.2  47,394  44,009.6      27.72 Netherlands    16.90    21.60   23.60     18.90      10.31 Spain         844.84   806.04  959.64    825.61       6.27 Switzerland    24.80    26.90   24.50     19.80      13.86 UK             41.86    45.99   50.90     49.82      74.65  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

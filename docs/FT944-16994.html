			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Leaders accused of stifling debate The Charter Movement, a Conservative splinter group, has strongly attacked the organisation of this year's conference in Bournemouth, accusing the party leadership of making a determined effort to stifle debate. Amid signs that Tory activists are divided over a large number of issues this year - including privatisation of the Post Office and the possibility of tax cuts - the movement said that the Tory leadership had shown 'feebleness' and 'failure' in the motions it had chosen for the conference. The movement told delegates in a newsletter published yesterday: 'Do not enter the conference hall burdened by commonsense. It is intended to be a judgment-free zone.' According to Charter the conference organisers have avoided debating a number of issues this week which are of considerable interest to the grassroots of the party. 'Forty-two constituencies have submitted a motion on identity cards,' the movement says. 'But these have been completely ignored. It is clearly a subject of intense interest, but this is no criterion when it comes to deciding the conference agenda.' Charter says that the subjects for this year's balloted motion - due to be debated on Friday - have been carefully restricted. The movement says that just 98 motions out of the 1,160 submitted by constituency associations will be thrown into the ballot, and that these will be restricted to just six subject headings. It said yesterday: 'The Conservative party has become incapable of deciding issues of debate. For so long, its conference organisers have striven to eliminate the possibility of more than one point of view being expressed.'</p>

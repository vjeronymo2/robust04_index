			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 15 March  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS </H5>   1. Merciful Nature of Islam    2. Foreign Invasions Linked to Muslims' Weakness and  Division    3. No Separation of the Sexes in Islam    4. Freedom of Opinion in Islam    5. Islam in Singapore    6. Muslims in Cambodia    7. Veiled Students in France Prevented From Entering  Schools    8. Banning of Satellite Dishes in Saudi Arabia  <H5>  MERCIFUL NATURE OF ISLAM </H5>   On page seven, the newspaper carries a 1,000-word article by  Grand Shaykh of al-Azhar Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq entitled  "Islam is a Religion of Mercy." Jad-al-Haq confines himself to  religious issues to stress the merciful nature of Islam. He  cites several sayings by the Prophet Muhammad on this topic.  <H5>  FOREIGN INVASIONS LINKED TO MUSLIMS' WEAKNESS AND DIVISION </H5>   Also on page seven, the newspaper features a 900-word  article  by Islamic writer Dr. Muhammad 'Amarah. He maintains there is  an "organic link" between foreign threats and invasions and the  Muslims' weakness and backwardness. He says all foreign  invasions of Muslim lands took place when the Muslims were weak  and divided. To substantiate his views, he cites the Crusades  1096-1291, the Tatar invasion of Baghdad in 1258, and the French  campaign in Egypt under Napoleon Bonaparte between 1769 and 1805.  <H5>  NO SEPARATION OF THE SEXES IN ISLAM </H5>   On pages eight and nine, Shaykh Ahmad Abu-al-'Ala' answers  readers' questions on several religious issues. In answer to a  question by a female student on Islam's ruling regarding  coeducational schools and colleges, he says that "Islam does not  call for the complete separation of the two sexes" but has asked  the people to be modest in their dressing so as not to encourage  adultery. He adds that Islam allows men and women to meet in  mosques. Therefore, if this is allowed in places of worship, it  is also allowed in colleges and schools provided that it does  not lead to fornication.  <H5>  FREEDOM OF OPINION IN ISLAM </H5>   On page nine, the newspaper carries an 800-word article by  Hamid Isma'il entitled "Freedom of Opinion in Islam." He says  "Islam has guaranteed freedom of thought and expression."  However, he notes that Islam has recommended that this freedom  be exercised in its "correct framework," which "builds and does  not destroy," "does not insult religious and moral values," and  "does not undermine national unity or expose society to  dangers." The writer says Islam calls for freedom of opinion in  social, political, and economic issues on which views may  differ. However, as regards religious issues that are clearly  defined in written texts, there is no room for different  opinions. For instance, when Islam says alcohol is banned or a  thief's hand must be chopped off, there is no room for a  divergent opinion.  <H5>  ISLAM IN SINGAPORE </H5>   On page 20, the newspaper carries a 600-word report on Islam  in Singapore. The report notes that Muslims constitute 15.5  percent of Singapore's 3 million inhabitants. It adds that over  500 people convert to Islam annually.  <H5>  MUSLIMS IN CAMBODIA </H5>   On page 20, the newspaper carries a 150-word report on the  plight of Muslims in Cambodia. The report says the Khmer Rouge  killed 65,000 Muslims in Cambodia during its reign. The Khmer  Rouge persecuted non-Communists, especially Muslims whose  numbers, because of emigration, have shrunk from 800,000 to  200,000.  <H5>  VEILED STUDENTS IN FRANCE PREVENTED FROM ENTERING SCHOOLS </H5>   Citing the Islamic AL-ISLAH magazine, which is published in  France, the newspaper in a 150-word report on page 21 says that  over 200 female French-Muslim students are prevented from  entering their classes because they wear veils. The report also  noted that France's Muslims are facing a problem because the  French interior minister has prevented nonresident Muslim  preachers from participating in the religious enlightenment of  the Muslims.  <H5>  BANNING OF SATELLITE DISHES IN SAUDI ARABIA </H5>   On page 21, the newspaper notes in a 100-word report that  the  Saudi Government has decided to ban the importation of satellite  dishes or their local manufacture. It notes that the Saudi  Information Ministry will be in charge of receiving satellite  television programs and will transmit them to viewers through a  cable system in "a way conforming with religious and social  values."</p>

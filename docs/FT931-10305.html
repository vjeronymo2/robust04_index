			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Letter: Leyland-Daf symptomatic of a wider economic threat to UK Sir, Most of the debate concerning Leyland-Daf has foc-used on the specific problems of the European truck industry. The expected job losses, however, are part of a wider trend that will have serious implications for the long-term future of British industry. The UK has been the most important target country for cross-border mergers and acquisitions in Europe. Between 1985 and 1991, foreign companies made a total of 1,189 UK acquisitions valued in excess of Pounds 54bn. This accounts for almost half of the total value of all cross-border deals in Europe in the same period. Many of the UK's largest companies have passed into foreign ownership through being acquired. As well as Leyland-Daf, these include Beecham (SmithKline), Rowntree (Nestle), STC (Northern Telecom), Jaguar (Ford), Pearl Group (Australian Mutual), Midland Bank (Hongkong and Shanghai). Of equal importance has been the large number of small and medium-sized UK companies (SMEs) becoming foreign-owned. More than 40 per cent of the total number of deals have involved acquisitions of Pounds 1m or less. The wave of foreign takeovers raises important issues concerning the impact on the UK economy. 'Greenfield' foreign direct investment in the UK has generally been welcomed as making a positive contribution to the economy (eg technology transfer, increased exports, employment creation, improved international competitiveness, etc). The economic impact of foreign acquisitions in the UK is less clear. Negative effects may be employment losses following post-acquisition rationalisation; reduced local linkages; reduced exports as a consequence of changing plant status; and the transfer of certain head office functions (for example, R&amp;D and marketing) out of the UK to the new parent company. Leyland-Daf may be the first of many similar cases to emerge over the next few years. The full effects of any merger or acquisition will normally take between three and five years to work through. Thus, given the boom in foreign takeovers in the UK during the late 1980s and 1990s, it will only be over the next few years that the full effects of these will become clear. Big UK losses can be expected across a range of sectors as a consequence of post-acquisition rationalisation and consolidation. A new era of foreign multinational-British labour conflict may be approaching, reminiscent of the plant closure battles of the 1970s.

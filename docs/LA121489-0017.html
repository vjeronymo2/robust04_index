			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO PLANS TO SUE L.A. OVER SEWAGE PLANT  </P> <P> El Segundo city officials said Wednesday they will file a lawsuit against the  city of Los Angeles alleging that its sprawling Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant  is a public nuisance.  </P> <P> At a special meeting Tuesday night, City Council members voted unanimously to  begin collecting affidavits from residents to back up the city's contention  that the plant poses serious health and safety problems.  </P> <P> At the same time, Los Angeles, under federal court order, is updating and  expanding the plant.  </P> <P> "We're proceeding to go to court, period," said Councilman Jim Clutter.  "Frankly, we have gotten tired of trying to work with them."  </P> <P> El Segundo officials said it could take 30 to 60 days to prepare the lawsuit.  The only thing that would prevent their taking legal action would be if Los  Angeles solves the odor, noise and other problems caused by Hyperion that have  long plagued El Segundo residents, they said.  </P> <P> "We are confident, from everything we know, this lawsuit can be successful and  will be of benefit to citizens being touched by bad health and odor problems,"  El Segundo City Atty. Leland Dolley said.  </P> <P> Said Councilman Scot Dannen: "David wouldn't be willing to go up against  Goliath" unless he had thought he would win.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Engineer Robert Hori said some of the foul smells will  disappear as the court-ordered expansion now under way at the plant continues.  He said he did not know what effect a lawsuit would have on the expansion work.  </P> <P> If a suit is filed, "I think our attorneys would have to look at it," he said.  </P> <P> Sam Furuta, a Hyperion engineer who attended the Tuesday night meeting,  acknowledged that there have been longstanding odor problems at the plant.  However, he said, Hyperion officials have been trying to reduce them.  </P> <P> For years El Segundo and Los Angeles have had a rocky relationship because of  complaints from residents about the plant.  </P> <P> El Segundo homeowners living on the bluffs above the plant maintain that  despite Hyperion's promises, the odors have actually grown worse.  </P> <P> Last year, some homeowners on the bluffs alleged that their homes had been  damaged by constant vibrations caused by construction crews operating  bulldozers in the expansion project. More than 20 property owners subsequently  filed claims against Hyperion. Los Angeles has settled at least seven of those  claims.  </P> <P> And last month, more than 200 residents took to the streets to protest  Hyperion's proposal to build a row of 105-foot-tall sewage treatment tanks at  the plant. The tanks, known as digesters, would block ocean views and breezes  and drive down property values, the residents contend.  </P> <P> Hori has emphasized that a final decision on whether to build the giant  digesters has not been reached.  </P> <P> Some residents who live near Hyperion were quick to support the lawsuit. "I  think it's great. I think it's about time," said Sandi Teleso, who lives about  500 feet from the plant. "We have been totally disregarded by the city of L.A."  </P> <P> Hyperion officials, attempting to improve relations with residents, have rented  an office in downtown El Segundo and hired an ombudsman to assist them in  handling complaints.  </P> <P> Besides authorizing collection of the affidavits, council members instructed  the city's staff to meet with the Environmental Protection Agency to determine  what changes can be made in Hyperion's construction to minimize the impact of  the work on El Segundo residents.  </P></p>

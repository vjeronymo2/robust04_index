			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 15 June TASS -- Kirghizian [Kyrgyzstan]  President Asker Akayev has issued a decree on "measures to  regulate migration processes from the Republic of Kirghizia"  today in his bid to stop or at least beat down the wave of the  Russian-speaking population's migration from the Republic.    The document demands to make Russian an official language  together with the Kirghiz language in areas predominantly  populated by Russian-speaking people. According to the head of  state's instructions, it is necessary to do it in all vital  branches of the country's economy, where the use of achievements  of science and technology is linked with the use of the Russian  language, such as public health, mathematics and technical  sciences.    The decree instructs the government to extend the transition  timetable set for the use of the national language in business  correspondence, and secure a just representation of the  Russian-speaking population in state structures from the highest  to the lowest rung.    The Foreign Ministry has been instructed to coordinate a  simplified procedure of receiving the Russian and regaining the  Kirgiz citizenship with corresponding departments of the Russian  federation.    This document concludes with a decisive demand from the law  enforcement bodies to intensify combatting all kinds of  manifestations of nationalism.    Among noteworthy "achievements" of documents, decisions and  decrees issued during the past few years are either their slow  implementation or their existence only on paper. For example,  the preceding decree on the change over to the use of the  Kirghiz language in business correspondence has almost been  neglected.    The latest decree, which runs counter to the Constitution  adopted on 5 May 1993, might become a restraining factor for the  migration, and unite the opposition. More so, because almost  all structures of power have become multi-national during the  past three years. Decisive reshuffles of the personnel, as  demanded by the presidential decree, may be sabotaged and  eventually undermine Kirghizia's economy which is already living  through a deep crisis.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERING PORCELAIN OF MEDIEVAL MEISSEN  </P> <P> To Germans East or West and porcelain lovers the world over, Meissen china is  incomparable.  </P> <P> Meissen is a pretty medieval town of narrow lanes, quiet corners and  courtyards. It lies deep in East Germany, tucked between the sunny vineyards of  the Elbe River about 25 miles northwest of Dresden.  </P> <P> The gray, ponderous building in the heart of the city may look stodgy, but  inside it's a different story.  </P> <P> The Meissen Porcelain Museum is a palace of shiny parquet floors; crystal  chandeliers; ceiling frescoes; arched windows and doorways; intricate moldings;  wide, graceful staircases, and marble columns trimmed in gold.  </P> <P> Bright, airy and elegant, this is the perfect setting for precious porcelain:  dazzling goblets, figurines, clocks, chess sets, tiles, urns, animal  sculptures, chandeliers, wall hangings and lots of cups, saucers and plates.  </P> <P> Masterfully crafted, some appear as delicate as wildflowers softly hued in the  colors of spring meadows. Others -- big, bold and brilliant white -- flaunt the  beauty of a queen wrapped in ermine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Infinite Styles  </P> <P> Styles are baroque, rococo, classical and abstract, color variations are  infinite and designs are in the thousands. Add picturesque ornamentation. Make  it the world's hardest china and you begin to grasp the fascination this  porcelain holds for its admirers.  </P> <P> Meissen porcelain is said to be tough, but drop it and it still shatters.  Astonishingly, many priceless museum pieces are not locked behind protective  glass, such as you would see in the United States.  </P> <P> Enormous vases and sculptures -- like a peacock, court jester or giant vulture  -- stand nonchalantly in the open, perched on wooden blocks.  </P> <P> As I leaned over a huge vase delicately painted with a profusion of butterflies  and flowers, I expected to hear the all-too-familiar verboten (forbidden) from  a nearby museum guard.  </P> <P> But not one verboten, not a single "do not touch."  </P> <P> Hordes of porcelain lovers move freely throughout the museum close enough to  brush the irreplaceable china.  </P> <P> Scattered tables are beautifully draped and elegantly set. If there were  chairs, it would be hard to resist sitting down for coffee and kuchen, or  better, a 10-course banquet.  </P> <P>  Only one table setting is roped off. It showcases a stunning, snow-white  2,000-piece china set created by the great 18th-Century master, Johann Joachim  Kaendler.  </P> <P> Not only do you breathe in this precious porcelain, but artisans create East  Germany's coveted export right before your eyes. On the ground floor are five  demonstration halls. Tours are in German.  </P> <P> If you don't speak the language, the guide offers a drawer jammed with tape  recordings in Japanese, Hungarian, Arabic, Turkish, Korean, French, Russian,  Chinese, Finnish and English.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Starts With Basics  </P> <P> The first hall demonstrates the basics: a brief history of porcelain and a  simple explanation of the materials and processes involved.  </P> <P> In the other halls, artisans demonstrate their amazing skills. Each piece is  made by hand -- from start to finish.  </P> <P> As you watch, the recording will explain what each artisan is doing and why.  One molds vases and plates on a potter's wheel. The next deftly attaches  flowers, leaves, hats or boots to a figurine.  </P> <P> Another paints Meissen's most famous design -- the cobalt-blue onion pattern --  as another creates multicolored flowers. Meissen makes 180 basic colors in  formulas as secret today as when they were first developed.  </P> <P> This most famous china came to be through greed. In the early 1700s, hundreds  of alchemists vied to discover a formula for transforming base metals into  gold. One such alchemist was Johann Friedrich Boettger, a Berlin pharmacist of  old Prussia.  </P> <P> Just as the King of Prussia got wind of Boettger's talent, the young man fled  to Saxony. The Prussian king asked the Elector of Saxony and King of Poland,  Augustus the Strong, to extradite Boettger. Augustus refused. Always short of  cash, he prayed the alchemist might make gold for him.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Saxon Court was spending large sums importing Chinese and  Japanese porcelain -- in those days, an ultimate display of wealth and  authority.  </P> <P> When the alchemist failed to create gold, a prominent physicist convinced  Augustus that what Boettger really should do was uncover the secret of fine  porcelain.  </P> <P> In 1709 Boettger proudly announced: "I've made white gold!" To guard this  priceless discovery of a European hard-paste, August chose Albrechtsburg Castle  in Meissen as the place where "white gold" should be produced.  </P> <P> High on a hill above the town's rooftops, the Gothic castle afforded a  commanding view of the Elbe River Valley and all who approached it.  </P> <P> In 1720 artist and chemist Johann Hoeroldt arrived in Meissen to join Boettger.  His goal: to develop paints that would surpass the colors of the Far East. With  white gold and its lovely secret-formula paints in production, only one  ingredient was lacking -- design.  </P> <P> Enter artist Johann Joachim Kaendler. In 1731 Kaendler, who would become one of  the greatest porcelain designers of all time, joined the Meissen family.  </P> <P> Until then, Asian designs had been copied. Under his superb direction, however,  Meissen porcelain took on a distinctly European and contemporary style. German  porcelain began to enjoy international fame.  </P> <P> After visiting the Meissen showrooms, explore the medieval market square,  stroll along the winding cobbled streets of the old city or stop to sip Meissen  wine.  </P> <P> For a splendid view, go to the castle with its adjacent cathedral. It has no  car access, but lots of steps lead up not far from the market square.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Unusual Staircase  </P> <P> The castle is noted for its unusual cylindrical wooden staircase and an  exhibition centering on the years it held alchemist Boettger captive.  </P> <P> Most important, before you leave the city, visit the small Meissen china store  on the main square.  </P> <P> Inside this exclusive and expensive store my German friends, avid porcelain  connoisseurs, assured me that I would find a beautiful plate at a good price.  </P> <P> "The secret," they explained, "is to turn over a plate and look at the  trademark. Two scratches through the blue-crossed swords means a second. Sehr  gut -- a markdown!"  </P> <P> By then I had accrued an enormous respect for the white gold. With shimmers of  excitement I chose an exquisitely painted plate trimmed in gold.  </P> <P> Picking out a piece of Meissen was like selecting a diamond . . . I knew it  would be forever.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Meissen is about a half-hour drive west of Dresden. Visas are required for the  German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Not all travel agencies, however,  are familiar with the procedure.  </P> <P> The German Democratic Republic Embassy, Washington, D.C., recommends contacting  Kaven Travel Service, 1160 N.

If you plan to stay in hotels, allow three  weeks for visa application processing. If you'll be staying with relatives or  friends, allow two months.  </P> <P> Kaven charges a $25 handling fee for processing visa applications that require  hotel accommodations. The cost per person per night at an East German hotel is  $70 to $200, depending on the class of hotel and its location.  </P> <P> All hotel accommodations must be prepaid.

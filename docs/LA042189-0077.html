			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATES LEAD TO ARREST OF KILLING SUSPECT  </P> <P> Sandra Sandor of Lake Elsinore said she first learned that a murder suspect was  sleeping in her home when she turned on the radio Thursday morning.  </P> <P> The broadcast described the car and gave the license plate number of murder  victim Denise Duerr, 21, of Garden Grove. Authorities had found Duerr's body  near the Orange County-Riverside County line on Wednesday afternoon. She had  been missing for two days.  </P> <P> The radio reported that her car, with its personalized license plate CEEYA 3,  still had not been recovered.  </P> <P> Sandor remembered the unusual plates on the car that her husband's stepson,  Cameron Seaholm, had driven to her Riverside County home when he showed up  Monday for an unannounced visit.  </P> <P> "I had noticed those license plates on the car he (Seaholm) was driving,"  Sandor said. "And when I heard the report on the radio this morning (Thursday),  I went outside and checked the plates again.  </P> <P> "Then I got my daughter, Kathy, into my bedroom, locked the door and called  911," she said.  </P> <P> Riverside County sheriff's deputies arrived and arrested Seaholm, 22, on  suspicion of murdering Duerr, with whom he had been friendly in high school.  </P> <P> According to Sandor's daughter, Kathy Harrison, 29, Seaholm was calm and quiet  during his three-day visit with them in Lake Elsinore. "He acted quite like the  gentleman," Harrison said.  </P> <P> Harrison said Seaholm was asleep on a living room sofa in Sandor's home on  Thursday morning when Sandor heard the radio newscast about the missing car. He  was still asleep when sheriff's deputies arrived and arrested him, Harrison  said.  </P> <P> Details of the alleged murder of Duerr were not immediately available from  police.  </P> <P> Duerr was last seen as she left her Garden Grove home in her Pontiac Fiero on  Monday morning, headed to her job in Orange, about 15 minutes away by freeway.  She never showed up for work.  </P> <P> Her body was discovered in a ditch late Wednesday afternoon by a man walking  his dog on a remote road in the Santa Ana Mountains. Authorities Thursday  declined to give the cause of death.  </P></p>

When discussing the "government work report," Tibet's  deputies to the National People's Congress [NPC] cited a series  of figures familiarly.    The region's gross domestic product amounted to more than  3.2  billion yuan, a growth of 9.6 percent over the previous year.  The region reaped bumper agricultural harvests for six  consecutive years, with a record 1993 grain harvest of 620,000  tonnes. Rural enterprises turned out more than 100 million yuan  worth of products, up 14.9 percent over 1992. Export trade  volume surpassed $100 million, up 55.4 percent. The per capita  income of farmers and herdsmen was 30 yuan more than in the  previous year...[ellipses as received]    These figures clearly record the track of Tibet's  development, showing the solid steps taken in the advance toward  modernization.    Some deputies said: Modern industry was nonexistent in old  Tibet. Today, it boasts a dozen industries, ranging from  electric power, coal, and chemicals to machinery. Its power  generating capacity has exceeded 170,000 kw.    On the daily-improving infrastructure of the region, Deputy  Gyainzim talked about the first day Medog county gained access  to a highway, as well as the progress of highway construction in  Tibet as a whole. According to him, a highway network now  covers all the 74 cities, prefectures, and counties in Tibet.    A communications network embracing wireless, wire, air  control, and satellite communications with Lhasa as its center  has begun to take shape. Satellite ground stations have been  built in most areas. International program-controlled telephone  switches connected with the world network are now available to  some counties and cities. As a result, it is no longer a pipe  dream for peasants and herdsmen in out-lying areas to watch  television. A number of airports, including the Gonggar  International Airport and the Bangda Airport, are either under  construction or have been completed and put into operation.    With the steady increase of grain output, the long history  of  food shortages in Tibet has come to an end. At present, the  percentage of marketable agricultural and animal husbandry  products has exceeded 23 percent. The clothing, food, housing,  and transportation conditions of the more than two million  people in Tibet have improved remarkably. Television sets,  washing machines, stereo equipment, and other durable consumer  goods can be found in ordinary peasant and herdsmens' homes.  Some are even able to afford cellular phones. Urban residents  here are as well-dressed as those in the interior and coastal  regions.    Tibet's educational facilities have been built from scratch.  There are now more than 3,000 schools of various categories in  the region. Medical care facilities are available in all  peasants' and herdsmen's settlements [dian 7820]. There are 30  cultural organizations in the region. Scientists in Tibet have  scored more than 1,000 scientific research achievements, of  which 288 have won national or autonomous regional awards. Last  year the region received 23,000 tourists from Hong Kong, Macao,  Taiwan, and foreign countries, and earned $9 million in foreign  exchange from tourism.    According to the deputies, reform and development have  benefited the two million people in Tibet.    Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the autonomous region said:  Tibet's progress today is completely due to the great support  given by the party, government, and people of all nationalities  across the country, as well as reform and opening up. It is  also inseparable from the hard work done by the united people of  all nationalities in Tibet.    The deputies said: The huge state investment and vigorous  support provided by other parts of the country have added  vitality to Tibet's economic development. Reform and opening up  have enabled Tibet to free itself from a closed status, and  become a channel for China's export goods and technology to the  South Asia subcontinent.    Under the new situation in which the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure is being accelerated, Tibet  is seeking greater development. By 1997, Tibet's gross domestic  product and regional income are expected to reach 4.8 billion  yuan and 3.68 billion yuan, respectively.    Development is the last word. Deputy Pingcuo said: "Only  development means maximum human rights. Only when Tibet  achieves development can its stability have a reliable  foundation."</p>

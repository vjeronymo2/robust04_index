			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 2 (CNS)--Mayor of Guangzhou, Mr. Li  Ziliu, told the press yesterday that real estate in the capital  of Guangdong Province was developing in a healthy way and there  was much room for foreign investment in this sector. Mr. Li  said he hoped that foreign investors would not slow their pace  of investment in this industry.    Mr. Li pointed out that the real estate market in the city  last year, owing to the macro control and adjustment as well as  the implementation of the value added tax, had seen a slump for  a certain time, but its transactions had not suffered from a big  fluctuation with the floor area of newly completed commodity  housing for the year being put at 3.7 million square metres, 50  percent up over the year before and that of its sales exceeding  2 million square metres, earning RMB [Renminbi] 4.8 billion,  over 60 percent up.    The mayor said that development of the real estate industry  in the city last year was on the whole good and healthy and,  being situated near Hong Kong and Macao, office buildings,  factory buildings and residential blocks in Guangzhou all were  in great demand and the city was considered a keen place for  making investment in this industry by both domestic and foreign  businessmen. In addition, with the raising of the living  standard, residents' purchasing ability for residential property  would also be enhanced, offering powerful support to the  development of this industry.    Mr. Li pointed out that Guangzhou would develop into an  international megalopolis within 15 years and its urban area  would be enlarged by 2.7 times. The city would launch a number  of construction projects including transformation of the old  urban area, underground railways projects and residential  building projects and legislation on the real estate industry in  the city had been improving, creating good conditions for  foreign investment in this sector there.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR'S NEW COACH WILL FACE OLD FRIENDS WHEN SEAHAWKS OPEN SEASON AT SANTA  MONICA  </P> <P> Harbor (1-0) travels to Santa Monica (1-0) for Saturday's 7:30 p.m. Western  State Conference opener, but Don Weems will feel at home on the Corsairs'  field.  </P> <P> The Seahawks' new football coach was an assistant at the school for 11 years  and he looks forward to playing against old friends.  </P> <P> "Of the three full-time coaches there," Weems said, "I worked with two and I  was on the committee that hired them. It will be good to go back."  </P> <P> It won't be easy for the Seahawks to be competitive with No. 12 Santa Monica.  The Corsairs trounced Chaffey 33-3 two weeks ago and they're bigger, faster and  more experienced than Harbor.  </P> <P> The Seahawks, who defeated Victor Valley 27-6 in last week's opener, should  find Santa Monica's tough offensive line difficult.  </P> <P> Defensively the Seahawks have the potential to do that. They were impressive  against Victor Valley and should be much the same against Santa Monica.  Freshman quarterback Glenn Baham will again run Harbor's short-pass oriented  offense.  </P> <P> El Camino (1-0) is anxious to face Orange Coast (1-0) on Saturday at 7 p.m. in  a Mission Conference opener at El Camino. The Warriors have been off for two  weeks after defeating Antelope Valley 38-17 and they're hungry to compete.  </P> <P> "We're real excited about this game," said El Camino Coach John Featherstone.  "We really haven't been tested yet and this will be it." Orange Coast opened  its season with last week's 32-14 victory over Rio Hondo. Last year the Pirates  finished at the bottom of the Mission Conference central division (4-6), but  Coach Bill Workman expects 10 returning starters to improve that mark.  </P> <P> The Pirates start Greg Angelovic at quarterback. He completed 13 of 19 passes  for 163 yards and one touchdown last week. Tailback Mike Vaez will also help  move the ball. The freshman gained 102 yards on 22 carries against Rio Hondo.  </P> <P> The Warriors' offense, led by quarterback Frank Dolce, finished with 379 total  yards against Antelope Valley while their powerful defense limited the  Marauders to 186 yards.  </P> <P> L.A. Southwest (1-0) is looking for its second victory in Saturday's 1 p.m. WSC  opener at West L.A. (0-1) and the Cougars should get it since their opponent is  no powerhouse.  </P> <P> The Oilers kept last year's streak alive with a 21-3 loss to Victor Valley two  weeks ago. Last season they failed to win a game and ended at the bottom of the  WSC with an 0-10 mark.  </P> <P> Southwest kicked off its season with a 17-16 win over Rio Hondo two weeks ago.  The Cougars' defense, led by Pierce College transfer Chris Mims, played the  biggest role in that victory.  </P> <P> Craig Manigo will start again at quarterback for the Cougars. The Leuzinger  High freshman passed for 164 yards and two touchdowns against Rio Hondo.  </P></p>

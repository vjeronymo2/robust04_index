			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD WAR II MINORITY STUDENTS  </P> <P> I am writing to applaud the effort to obtain justice on the part of Hayao  Shishino and the other Japanese Americans from Los Angeles High School who were  denied diplomas in 1942 (Part A, Oct. 25). It is shocking that they were  prevented from graduating then, but no less sickening was the way that Japanese  Americans in general were deprived of their rights.  </P> <P> As a fellow alumnus (Los Angeles High, winter, 1943), I can recall the sorrow  that many of us felt, some time after Pearl Harbor, when classmates and their  families were being sent off to a camp for no other reason than that of ethnic  prejudice, not felt, for example, toward Americans of German or Italian  ancestry.  </P> <P> Those of us who were Jews (and we did know what was happening in Germany), were  perhaps particularly sensitive to their plight, but felt helpless to do  anything. I remember with great sadness the weeping of embarrassment of many of  us.  </P> <P> Several years ago, when I was invited to lecture in Japan, I was pleased to  mention some of my classmates by name (Yuki Mishima, Kimiko Naruse, Ruby Okubo,  Louise Yamazaki), in the land of their ancestry, and to ask their forgiveness  for what my/our country had done to them.  </P> <P> It is a source of satisfaction and healing for me to know that our government  now recognizes our error and has agreed to rectify it. It is equally rewarding  to see Shishino and the others standing up for their rights with both dignity  and forbearance.  </P> <P> J. MARVIN SPIEGELMAN  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date of Management Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The specific management measures that will be used to achieve the necessary reduction in fishing effort include the following: A moratorium on most new entrants into the scallop fishery; allocations of days-at-sea (DAS) that vessels may fish for scallops based on three vessel groups (Full-time, Part-time, and Occasional); a requirement to purchase and install a VTS unit for Full-time and Part-time vessels and a call-in system for Occasional vessels to monitor DAS; permits for vessel operators and dealers; an open access scallop permit for vessels landing no more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or no more than 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops per trip; limitations on upgrading of vessel size and engine horsepower; a prohibition on acquiring more than a 5 percent ownership interest in the total number of limited access scallop vessels; mandatory reporting for permitted vessels and dealers; crew-size limits; maximum dredge and trawl sweep size restrictions; minimum ring and mesh size restrictions; framework measures to adjust the effort control and other measures; a minimum shell height restriction; and an annual option for vessels in the Part-time or Occasional category to fish in the next higher vessel group if they use only one dredge no more than 10.5 feet (3.2 m) in width and their crew complement (including the operator) is five or less. The preamble to the proposed rule described the management measures and their rationale, which are not repeated here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS is implementing the measures in the Amendment and proposed rule as of March 1, 1994, in order to provide opportunity for the industry to convert to 31/4 inch rings and acquire and install VTS units; and because of the administrative burden imposed on the NMFS by these collective measures,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> implementation of a VTS; the need to issue thousands of new permits for operators, dealers and vessels; the need to establish an appeal process for vessel owners who feel their DAS allocation is in error and/or for vessels that do not qualify; and the need to establish details of the recordkeeping and reporting requirements required under &sect;650.7 and the DAS monitoring set forth in &sect;650.25. While the VTS is being put in place and the initial problems with that new system are being worked out, a call-in procedure will be used to implement the DAS allocations. Existing regulations, including the meat count measure, will remain in effect until March 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 1, 1994, the effective date of these regulations, all scallop vessel owners and operators and all scallop dealers must have an appropriate permit, as specified under &sect;&sect;650.4, 650.5, and 650.6 in order to participate in the fishery. In order to ensure being issued a permit, if eligible, by that date all owners, operators, and dealers should apply for a permit as soon as possible. Application forms are available now and NMFS will attempt to mail such forms to all known scallop vessel owners and operators and scallop dealers as soon as possible. Applications will be processed as received. Early application,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  one filed before February 1, 1994, will help assure that the permit is issued by March 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As provided in &sect;650.26(a)(3), until any VTS vendor is approved and the system is available, all permitted vessels fishing under the DAS program must comply with the call-in notification provisions of &sect;650.26(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and Responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS received comments on the proposed rule from one member of the Congress of the United States, five fishing industry associations, and eight individuals. All of the comments were carefully considered during the formulation of the final rule. Specific comments are discussed and responded to below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A member of Congress of the United States and an individual opposed the allocation of DAS because it takes Virginia, North Carolina, and New Jersey fishermen longer to reach their fishing grounds than it takes New England fishermen. These individuals offered days fished or a total allowable catch as an alternative. The commenters stated that the DAS rule gives a distinct advantage to one area over another, whereas, days fished provides a level playing field for all scallopers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council analyzed the days fished system before deciding on the DAS program, using the NMFS weighout database, and determined that DAS is a fair reflection of a vessel's historical time at sea because it takes into consideration the number of days a vessel spent traveling to and from the fishing grounds. The Council also determined the database could not accurately show actual days fishing. However, the final rule includes a measure that would allow the adoption of a days-fished system through a regulatory amendment, if data become available to support such a system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two industry associations requested an extension of the comment period to October 28, 1993, because the proposed rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 2, 1993, and their associations did not receive a copy of the rule until the third week in September 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Good economic news leaves equities mixed Wall Street US share prices were mixed yesterday as Wall Street struggled to shrug off a setback in the bond market and focus instead on evidence of improving economic conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.15 at 3,683.95, but the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.11 easier at 461.79. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite lost 0.66 at 460.03, but the Nasdaq composite gained 2.85 at 754.39 after reversing an earlier downward trend. NYSE volume was 286m shares. The uncertain mood which has dominated Wall Street recently was underscored by investors' jittery reaction to the first in a series of economic reports this week which are expected to indicate robust growth during the final three months of the year. Stock prices dipped immediately after the release of the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence, which surged to 71.2 this month, compared with a consensus forecast of about 60. Separately, the index of business activity by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago showed one of the biggest monthly gains in the survey's 25-year history. The fresh data served to exacerbate anxieties among bond traders, who fear the economy's gathering strength could be a signal of higher inflation. In late trading the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue had fallen nearly a point to 99 9/32 , yielding 6.298 per cent. But the mood on Wall Street was not as bleak as in the bond market, and equity prices began to inch higher as the morning progressed. By early afternoon the Dow Industrial index was up nearly 20 points, before slipping to leave a more modest gain at the close. With crude oil prices firming after hitting a three-year low on Monday, energy shares regained lost ground. Exxon was Dollars 1 better at Dollars 62 3/4 and Amoco gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 53 1/2 . Atlantic Richfield, up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 103 3/4 , and Mobil, Dollars 1 1/8 firmer at Dollars 76 1/8 , were given an extra lift when investment analysts raised ratings on the issues. By contrast, transport companies, which are the heaviest users of petroleum products, gave back some of their recent gains. AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 66 7/8 and Delta shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 . On the Nasdaq, Dell Computer advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 27 1/8 after better than expected earnings for the third quarter. Technology Solutions added Dollars 1 at Dollars 9 after its directors approved a stock repurchase plan. Canada Toronto showed no clear trend in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index, after Monday's drop, closed 9.9 ahead at 4,180.2, but falls led rises by 423 to 383 after volume of 57.6m shares valued at CDollars 709.8m. Golds and conglomerates rose 1.55 and 1.33 per cent respectively.</p>

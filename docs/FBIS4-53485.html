			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 18 (YONHAP) -- The Information Ministry  on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of permitting  around-the-clock broadcasting by domestic cable TV networks of  Cable News Network (CNN) programs. The ministry thus denied  some reports that the government was studying the possibility of  allowing CNN programs to be broadcast all day in Korea through  domestic cable TV.    So Chong-hwan, director-general of the ministry's broadcast  bureau, said the issue will not be discussed any longer as the  present laws do not allow all-day broadcast.    "It is a matter to be discussed only after domestic cable TV  takes root," said suh, referring to a government decision  adopted at a meeting of officials from the Economic Planning  Board and other government agencies related with trade talks  with the United States on May 11.    He stressed that all-day relaying of CNN broadcast cannot be  permitted under any circumstances as "it is feared to cause  serious cultural problems. TV viewers will be made to understand  international issues through American points of view. The  broadcast, if permitted, will adversely affect the development  of the domestic cable TV," he said.</p>

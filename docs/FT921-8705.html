			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Quebec shelves hydro scheme Quebec's energy ministry and Hydro-Quebec have confirmed that the CDollars 13bn Great Whale hydro-electric project in the north of the province may be delayed indefinitely because of a campaign by the Cree Indians, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Ms Lise Bacon, Quebec's energy minister, said Hydro-Quebec was considering speeding up alternative projects further south and on the St Lawrence North Shore, together offering nearly as much power as Great Whale's 3,000mw in the far north.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: MeesPierson sets up fund to invest in German groups MeesPierson, the Dutch investment bank which is part of the ABN-Amro banking group, is to launch a DM150m private equity fund which will invest mainly in 'mittelstand' or medium-sized German companies. The fund is to be run by Mr Onno Hogerzeil and Mr Christopher Peisch, two fund managers who joined the Dutch institution earlier this year after running the European investment activities of a buy-out fund for Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. It will invest in small to medium-size companies throughout northern Europe, although it will concentrate on Germany. The fund will take majority stakes in companies. The two managers claim that Germany today offers parallels with the US in the early 1980s, when the US economy went through significant corporate restructuring in the aftermath of recession, providing 'many highly profitable private equity investment opportunities'. The opportunities are expected to arise as Germany's big industrial conglomerates sell off non-core businesses. 'The recession has led to a noticeable change in German companies' attitudes,' observed Mr Hogerzeil, who said that large companies had abandoned their traditional reluctances to dispose of subsidiaries. 'Mittelstand' companies are also undercapitalised in relation to their larger competitors, and MeesPierson hopes that a buy-out fund will offer an alternative to bank finance as companies seek fresh capital to finance new investment. They claim there is a growing pool of German managers willing to undertake buy-outs or buy-ins, still unfamiliar transactions in Germany. According to Mr Volkert Klaucke, managing partner of MeesPierson in Germany, the fund is two-thirds placed with institutions, predominantly Dutch pension funds. The fund will aim for a gross annual yield of 30 per cent. Although there are dozens of venture capital companies in Germany, there are only a handful of funds which specialise in buy-ins and buy-outs.</p>

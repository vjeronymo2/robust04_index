			<p>BFN     [Text] Police believe the missing Russian diplomat, third  secretary Igor Makeev, is still alive but his whereabouts is a  mystery.    A high-level police officer, who requested anonymity, said  yesterday after he was told of Mr. Makeev's disappearance that  several police units had launched a search for him.    He was last seen leaving Ocean Apartment in Soi Saladaeng  off  Silom Road on March 22.    The Institute of Forensic Medicine confirmed that Mr. Makeev  was not on the list of dead sent to the Police Hospital.    Since Mr. Makeev was also responsible for looking after  Russian women in Thailand, the police went to bars and  nightclubs in Soi Sawatdi off Sukhumwit Road but found no traces  of the Russian.    The police are awaiting confirmation from the Immigration  Police Bureau as to whether or not Mr. Makeev has left Thailand.</p>

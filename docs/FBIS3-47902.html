During the revolutionary movement, he established an  unforgettably fine model practice in the history of the struggle  of the courageous people. From that period, he devoted himself  to the tasks against colonialism and imperialism for the sake of  national independence. Comrade Phoumi Vongvichit always honestly  adhered to his ideal of patriotism and [word indistinct]. This  was shown during the highly responsible performance of his  duties throughout the period when a new life for Laos was being  created and the party and state were being built, as well as in  other activities. The passing away of Comrade Phoumi Vongvichit  means the Lao People's Revolutionary Party has lost an honest  and virtuous senior citizen. It is also the loss of an intimate  friend for the communists and people of Cuba. However, we are  confident that the comrades who participated in the past  struggles with him and the determined and courageous Lao people  will carry on his tasks, to which he devoted himself throughout  his life.    Through the comrades, we convey our deepest sorrow to the  Party Central Committee, the government, and the people of Laos,  as well as to his relatives and family.</p>

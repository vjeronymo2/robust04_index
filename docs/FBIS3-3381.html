The university was originally named the Central Institute of  Nationalities. Last November, the State Education Commission  approved a name-change to the Central University of  Nationalities.    Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and general secretary of the  Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, inscribed the  nameplate for the university.    At the ceremony, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing unveiled the  nameplate.    He said that the development of educational services for  minority nationalities is important to the revitalization of  minority nationalities and the ethnic people's autonomous  regions and prefectures.    He said that the central university has played a very  important role in cultivation of high- and mid-level officials  and technical know-how in minority nationalities inhabited areas.    He urged the university to make a new start and turn itself  into a university with its unique characteristics so as to  contribute to higher education among minority nationalities.    Set up in Beijing in 1950, the university now has over 20  departments and 30 research institutes with more than 100  disciplines.    By the end of last year, more than 30,000 had graduated from  the university.    Among those who attended the ceremony were Vice-Chairmen of  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress  Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe and Tomur Dawamat,  Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and  State Councillor and Minister in Change of State Nationalities  Affairs Commission Ismail Amat.</p>

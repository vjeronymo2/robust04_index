			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carmen del Riego: "Roca Criticizes as Dangerous </F> Falsehood the Assertion That There Are Secret Agreements"]    [Text] Madrid -- Miquel Roca, CiU [Convergence and Union]  spokesman in the Congress [of Deputies], yesterday rejected the  accusation by the People's Party and United Left concerning the  existence of secret and unacknowledged agreements between Felipe  Gonzalez and Jordi Pujol, and emphasized the "public  formulation" of the agreements between CiU and the government,  since they have all manifested themselves in debates and votes  in parliament. "No agreement resulting from our talks with the  government has been unknown to the house," he said, "and they  have been absolutely open and public in the past and will be so  in future. To say the contrary is politically legitimate from  the sectarian or partisan viewpoint, but is a dangerous  falsehood, because it arouses old passions and apprehensions and  is dangerous for coexistence in our country." With this  assertion, Roca justified his group's opposition to Gonzalez'  appearing in order to explain the meeting with Pujol:  "Political talks are not subject to parliamentary oversight,"  he said.    The CiU spokesman also expressed his conviction that in the  demand for Gonzalez' appearance "there was no desire for  clarity, because they have it, since there is nothing opaque or  confused. Whether it is so clear that it annoys them to know  that we do not share their strategy is another matter."    Miquel Roca also made it clear that at the meeting between  Gonzalez and Pujol, "the agreement is that two people said what  is well known: That we are not in favor of bringing forward the  election, which would be frivolous from the viewpoint of the  general interest and the Spanish economy; the agreement that the  economic policy must be intensified and that progress must be  made in the implementation of autonomy, which is a little-worked  field. That is, it was examined how progress is to be made on  the coinciding aims and how it can be guaranteed that they  coincide, so that stability will be maintained."    In the CiU spokesman's opinion, the only thing is that in  Spain there is "apart from the government's strategy, a strategy  of dissolving the Cortes, which is the People's Party strategy;  another of replacing the prime minister, which is United Left's  strategy; and ours, which is to cause the country to do well,  and we espouse it. Nobody will be able to show us a single  instance of our doing what we do in accordance with partisan or  territorially limited interests." And he stressed that the  agreements reached on autonomy policy "have been extended to all  the autonomous communities, and the benefit reaches them all."    The next aim in cooperation with the government is the  budgets for 1995, "because we are not going to support just any  budget." He emphasized that when the 1994 budget came about,  "the economic scope for maneuver was very narrow." It is a  scope that "is fortunately widening now," since the economic  outlook for 1995 is different, with an increase in GDP, and a  June that will be good, with an increase in Social Security  contributors and reduction of unemployment, and this, in his  opinion, "enables us to be bolder" and tackle "more  courageously" some reforms that could not be tackled earlier,  such as company tax. However, Roca left open the possibility of  dialogue with the People's Party, because "we are not by  definition far from reaching agreements with those who wish to  agree."    Roca also denied that an agreement or pact between the PSOE  [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and United Left in Andalusia  could have repercussions on CiU's support for the government.  "We have no objection to United Left's playing a stabilizing  role in Andalusia. On the contrary, we want a stable government  that will ensure the greatest possible well-being for the  Andalusians and the surmounting of their problems. However, if  the terms set have an impact on Spain's overall economic policy  aims, that would be a problem."</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Hopes fade for UK-Italian helicopter purchase - Aerospace HOPES were fading yesterday in the UK and Canadian aerospace industries over the fate of a CDollars 5.8bn (Pounds 2.85bn) Canadian order for helicopters from a UK-Italian consortium. Mr Jean Chretien, the leader of the triumphant Liberal party, promised during his campaign that an incoming Liberal government's first acts would include cancelling the order for the EH-101 helicopters, which was placed in October 1992 by the outgoing Progressive Conservative government. Westland, the UK partner in the EH101, said yesterday that it would 'wait and see' how Mr Chretien acted. But it is clearly bracing itself for the loss of the order, which would cut Pounds 400m off its Pounds 1.9bn order book. The original order was for 35 sea patrol helicopters and 15 search and rescue variants. However, a cut to 43 in total was mooted as part of the government's budget reduction programme. The main contractors for the helicopter are EH Industries, a joint venture between the UK's Westland Group and Agusta of Italy, and Paramax, a Canadian company controlled by Unisys of the US. EH Industries would have supplied the basic aircraft, while on-board systems would be provided by Paramax. Opponents of the deal argue that such a large order for essentially defence aircraft used, for example, in submarine hunting, was inappropriate to a post-cold war defence policy. The deal's supporters argue that the Canadian forces urgently need to replace their ageing fleet of Sea King and Labrador helicopters.</p>

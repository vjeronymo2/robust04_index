			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From Herman Allan Padgett's "Radio Column" segment] </F>   [Text] Since yesterday there have been commentaries on the  news that the military sector of the executive branch plans to  denounce the reciprocal military assistance agreement that our  country signed with the United States several years ago. Two  protocols were added to it, but as far as we know, the National  Congress of Honduras never ratified them.    Before we say anything else, we must point out that this is  not the Armed Forces' prerogative. The president of the Republic  is the leader of our foreign policy; he should establish the  country's policy, which should then be implemented by the  foreign relations minister. The sovereign National Congress has  the power to approve or reject international treaties and  agreements.    We do not know if President Reina is interested in seeing  the  end of military aid to our country and the departure of U.S.  troops and U.S. advisers and military observers in our Armed  Forces and the police.    President Reina was interviewed on the presence of U.S.  troops at Palmerola, but he did not give any direct answers. You  might even say he purposefully evaded that question, which leads  us to think that--at least at the time that he was asked the  question--he had neither considered the issue nor established  any criteria for it.    Hondurans grows less interested in military matters every  day, so they would not miss U.S. military aid. One could  predict, however, that the Washington administration would have  a negative reaction toward other issues in which Honduras is  certainly interested.    Although U.S. aid to Honduras, the rest of Latin America,  and  the world has decreased in the past few years, it is still  significant in relative terms. We must say that all U.S. aid to  our countries is given under very strict conditions. In our  particular case, we would dare say that we have never felt more  dependent or more colonized by the United States than in the  past 15 days.    This peaceful colonization of Honduras by the United States  has been felt more strongly since the collapse of the Berlin  Wall and the unexpected fall of Soviet imperialism. There is  virtually no aspect of national life for which the United States  has not established guidelines for us; in fact, it even demands  specific behavior from us.    Following the military assistance treaty that brought the  Nicaraguan contras here and forced the Honduran Government to  lease our territory--with all the ominous consequences that we  are still suffering--the agents of Washington have infiltrated  every institution in order to direct their policies, programs,  and objectives.    The pretext has been to supervise the correct use of funds  granted by Washington to those institutions and programs. Thus  the report drafted by two aides of Senator Helms is untrue and  humiliating. There has been an attempt to pass this report off  as coming from the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The  report reflects the U.S. complaint that Honduras denies justice  to U.S. citizens, who are supposedly the subject of unlawful  expropriations.    In the next few days we will talk a little more about the  report drafted by two of Sen. Helms's employees, who came here  and also visited Nicaragua, although they did not do any on-site  investigations. They went back with data, gossip, and  speculation that interested parties in Honduras reportedly  provided them during their visit to our territory.    It was nothing serious or concrete, but it was indeed  harmful  and slanderous to Honduras' international image. Based on those  alleged expropriations, none of which has been specifically  brought before our country's judicial branch or based on legal  grounds, the threat of cutting all aid to Honduras is being made  again. In fact, authorities and citizens of Islas de la Bahia  have already had their U.S. visas revoked as punishment for  defending our country's island possessions from the illegal  ambitions of U.S. citizens.    In short, if it were not for the military agreement, other  kinds of aid would be used to subject Honduras and its  government to the constant humiliation that constitutes an open  assault on our national sovereignty. We cannot defend ourselves  adequately because we are a small, poor, and weak country.    On top of this report drafted by Sen. Helms's staff, there  are a number of complaints about alleged acts of corruption  committed with the aid granted by Washington. If such acts of  corruption have indeed been committed, this corruption would  have necessarily involved the complicity of U.S. agents who are  present in every government office and program to supervise  expenditures and the management of the money.    By virtue of the operational funds granted by U.S. AID, AID  personnel are in the judicial branch, the Public Health  Ministry, the police, the Comptroller General's Office, and the  Council of Private Enterprise, and it even has its hands in the  labor movement under the pretext of conducting training.    We do not yet know the basic reasons behind the Honduran  military's plan to reject the military agreement, given that  U.S. officials have served as some sort of demigods to our men  in uniform. They were constantly present and worshipped by all  units at countless ceremonies and parties.    We do know, however, that Pentagon and CIA relations with  Honduran servicemen have not fared well during the tenure of  Ambassador Crescencio Arcos. Arcos had frequent and notorious  confrontations with our military hierarchy. Arcos planted the  seed here for a systematic campaign against the Honduran Armed  Forces.    Crescencio Arcos coined the phrase--or, perhaps, he  plagiarized--that in Honduras justice only bites those who are  barefoot. His open meddling in Honduran domestic affairs clearly  proved that the United States has assumed worldwide leadership  and a hegemonical role to control not only the economies and  armies but also the day-to-day life in our countries.    There is imperial Caesarism in Washington following the  death  of ideological bipolarism--a death that was rung in by the  collapse of the Soviet Empire. Since then, clocks in Washington  have been used to set time for everyone else in the world, and  the peoples of the world, especially those in the Third World,  remain helpless because they can do nothing but lower their  heads in resignation or expose themselves to being beleaguered  by extreme economic reprisals, diplomatic isolation, and blatant  international ostracism.    We are poor because we are poor, and hunger--as our  grandparents used to say--is a poor adviser.</p>

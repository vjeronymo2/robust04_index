			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the press service of the Crimean  Ministry of Internal Affairs, 29 APCs arrived on Sunday at  Simferopol train station. After unloading, the APCs headed for  the territory of the Simferopol military school, escorted by  Crimean highway inspection officers.    Colonel Oleksandr Kostyukov, commander of the National Guard  brigade, confirmed in an interview for UKRINFORM that the APC's  did arrive. He said: However, they are not for the military  school but for our subunits. Their arrival accidentally  coincided with the developments in the wake of the decision by  the Crimean Supreme Council session to restore the Constitution  of 6 May 1993. In reality, it was part of a scheduled process  of equipping the brigade.</p>

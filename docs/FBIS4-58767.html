			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Taieb Mahjoub] </F>   [Text] Doha, 6 May (AFP)--Middle East disarmament talks  ended in deadlock here Thursday [5 May] with Arab and Israeli  delegates unable to agree on a statement of principles on arms  control, conference sources said.    The delegates agreed to re-submit a draft statement of  principles to their respective governments before returning to  more talks, the date and venue of which have still to be fixed,  according US representative Robert Einhorn.    The draft plan comprises both military and political  chapters, the latter rejected by Saudi Arabia.    "We categorically reject the political section of the  project, which is aimed at normalizing relations between Arab  states and Israel," Prince Turki bin-Muhammad al-Sa'ud, head of  the Saudi delegation, told AFP.    "Most Arab participants also rejected this part of the  text,"  Prince Turki said.    David Irvi, leader of the Israeli negotiating team, stressed  his government's commitment to the entire plan, including the  political chapter.    "The political section (of the accord) is necessary because  it offers a working framework for future meetings," he argued.    The draft statement drawn up at a meeting in Cairo in  January  proposed a number of confidence-bulding measures and the  creation of a zone where weapons of mass destruction would be  banned.    Prince Turki said the statement should cover "only military  questions, including the elimination of weapons of mass  destruction."    Ivri said he did not understand Saudi Arabia's objections.  The kingdom had rejected a US proposal to hold another meeting  in June in Vienna, judging that date too close, he added.    Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jabbir Al Thani sounded an  optimistic note. "We hope to achieve better results in the  future, making progress in line with the continuation in the  peace process in the Middle East," he said.    The delegates approved in principle the creation of a crisis  prevention centre in Qatar, as well as a telecommunications  centre and a databank.    Switzerland and Finland offered to welcome delegates from  the  region for visits to arms control sites and military training in  the two countries.    Israel also offered a similar visit to one of its military  sites, but the suggestion was turned down by Saudi Arabia.    "We will not take part in any activities in Israel and we  will not host any of the multilateral negotiations," declared  Prince Turki.    The meeting here -- marking the first time Israeli officials  had travelled to Qatar -- was part of a multilateral negotiating  process on Middle Eastern regional issues that parallels  bilateral Arab-Israeli talks on purely political disputes.    The talks were launched an international Middle East peace  conference arranged in Madrid in October 1991 by the United  States and the former Soviet Union.    Other multinational committees are focusing on economic  issues, water sharing, the environment and refugees.</p>

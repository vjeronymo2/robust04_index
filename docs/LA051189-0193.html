			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CASA AMONG THE WINNERS ON DERBY DAY  </P> <P> It was Sunday Silence's day, but at local Kentucky Derby outposts, it played  more like Saturday Hullabaloo.  </P> <P> At Remick's restaurant in Irvine, party guest Jan Smith squealed, "I won! I  won! I won! How did that happen?" (All that for the first of five pre-Derby  races -- taped races, mind you, from Santa Anita -- run a month ago.)  </P> <P> The Derby Day party at Remick's was hosted by the local chapter of  Court-Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a privately funded,  volunteer-staffed agency that provides specially trained adult advocates for  abused and neglected children.  </P> <P> The benefit drew 210 guests at $75 each and raised more than $50,000 in net  proceeds, including money bid on auction items, underwriting and donations.  That amount represents nearly half of CASA's annual budget, according to event  chairman Fred Port.  </P> <P> Port and his committee nixed mint juleps ("because they taste really gross,"  explained one committee member), but otherwise held a traditional line, filling  the airy restaurant with bushels of flowers and fixings for a Southern feast.  </P> <P> A banjo-and-clarinet duo worked Dixie melodies as guests sipped mimosas, bid on  silent auction items and feasted from buffet tables loaded with baked ham,  roast turkey, biscuits and gravy, strawberries and cream, "Derby cheese"  (grits, cheddar and cayenne pepper) and Kentucky bourbon balls.  </P> <P> At one dining room table papered with racing forms, Dennis Leibel and pals Fred  Sher and Dave Smith sipped champagne and placed bets with CASA funny money.  </P> <P> When a photographer swooped in for a shot, Leibel, sporting "Upsand Downs"  suspenders, flashed a smile and flicked a CASA grand.  </P> <P> His wife Susan, executive director of CASA, just rolled her eyes. "This is my  husband's track personality," she said with a sigh.  </P> <P> Across town: "Dress up and lose money for a good cause" was how Beverly  Thompson summed up the Balboa Bay Club's Derby Day bash.  </P> <P> Thompson was a vision in polka dots, topped with a hat the size of a saddle --  a modern note in the mixed-bag, dress-up benefit for two local children's  causes, the Orange County Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation and Childhelp,  U.S.A.  </P> <P> More than 400 guests paid $50 each to enjoy a program similar to the one at  Remick's -- taped races and the live broadcast from Churchill Downs,  funny-money betting, auction bidding, buffet lunch. But many in the crowd at  BBC's seventh annual "Run for the Children" dressed thematically. The question  was: what theme?  </P> <P> There were a number of Rhett and Scarlett manques (Tara was in Georgia, not the  Bluegrass state), as well as half a dozen generically hoop-skirted  antebellumites. Suzy Sutton was a standout in a homemade red velvet and white  lace creation, complete with lacy pantaloons.  </P> <P> Event chairwoman Joan Richardson was outfitted as a jockey, and joked as she  raced between chairwomanly duties, "Me? A jockey? In the last 2 days of setting  up this party, I've eaten so many doughnuts, I don't think I'd get past the  weigh-in room."  </P> <P> Tom Matthey wore white knickers and spats because, well, "I collect antique  cars and these go with the cars."  </P> <P> Matt Schafnitz wore a silk tie with a fishing motif, "which just shows how  confused I am," he said.  </P> <P> Proceeds, not yet tallied, were expected to be $70,000, according to BBC social  director Linda Essig.  </P></p>

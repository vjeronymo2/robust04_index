			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> D. The Secretary's Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Secretary has carefully reviewed the plan submitted by the SEA. Based upon that review, the Secretary has determined that the conditions under section 459 of GEPA have been met. In particular, with respect to correcting the practices that led to the audit determination, the SEA has demonstrated that its system of internal controls has been greatly strengthened and that recently adopted policies and procedures governing the distribution of grant funds should prevent recurrence of the fraudulent activities that precipitated this case. Arizona has also criminally prosecuted the former Deputy Superintendent as well as the principal vendor involved in the scheme to misappropriate Chapter 2 funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This determination is based upon the best information available to the Secretary at the present time. If this information is not accurate or complete, the Secretary is not precluded from taking appropriate administrative action. In finding that the conditions of section 459 of GEPA have been met, the Secretary makes no determination concerning any pending audit recommendations or final audit determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 --> E.

The grantback award would be in the amount of $438,750, which is 75 percent of the Chapter 2 funds recovered by the Department as a result of the audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> F.

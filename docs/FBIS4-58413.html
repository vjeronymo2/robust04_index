			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--A responsible Jordanian source has stressed  Jordan's rejection of any agreement with Lloyds Register that  encroaches on Jordan's sovereignty over its territory and its  right to inspect incoming ships.    In statements to the press, the source said that Jordan  insists on not giving Lloyds Register the right to inspect ships  and that this international company's duty is to carry out  inspections at the docks in the Port of al-'Aqabah and to allow  or disallow any imported goods into the country.    The source noted that the cost of the inspections, which  could reach $3 million dollars per year, is not Jordan's  responsibility. This is because the inspection procedure was not  imposed by Jordan but by the United Nations, which, therefore,  should cover the inspection costs. However, an agreement on  this issue could be reached later.    The source said that Jordan rejects the stationing of  international forces to supervise the work of the international  company and also rejects the presence of international observers  at the Port of al-'Aqabah. Some international sources have  called for this in order to secure direct international  supervision over the inspection operations. According to them,  these operations are being conducted by a civil rather than an  international authority and an international presence alongside  this civilian authority is required.    Diplomatic sources in Amman said that inspections at the  Port  of al-'Aqabah's docks will create many problems for Jordan.  These sources believe that inspections at the Port of  al-'Aqabah will not take place because the United Nations cannot  totally delegate UN Security Council duties to an international  company.    These sources noted that, during the press conference with  His Majesty King Husayn after agreeing to delegate Lloyds  Register to carry out the inspections, U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher reiterated twice that through this agreement,  the embargo on Iraq will become more effective.    The sources added that the U.S. secretary meant that the  inspections that were carried out at sea, sometimes in a random  and inaccurate manner, will now be carried out at the docks of  the port and cover each and every piece of imported goods under  UN supervision, which would require the stationing of an  international force at the port or at least one international  officer or observer with permanent residency in Jordanian  territory.    The sources said that the Jordanian-U.S. agreement does not  seem practical and that it will reignite Jordanian-U.S.  differences once implementation begins.</p>

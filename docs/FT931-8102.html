			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Sell-out for BES issue INVESTORS continued to put tax-shelter money into the business expansion scheme this week. Johnson Fry's N&amp;P Multiple Choice Growth scheme, which raised money to rent out properties repossessed by the National &amp; Provincial building society, raised Pounds 50m within 36 hours of opening and is now sold out. The company intends to follow up with an identical scheme for the Bradford &amp; Bingley building society. This will involve non-recourse loans being offered at the rates of 74p per Pounds 1 invested after six months, 78.31p after one year, 87.71p after two years and 98.24p after three years. There is no fixed repayment price after five years. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000 with a maximum of Pounds 25,000. Close Brothers' BESSA Bristol and West scheme is likely to close on Monday. Its target subscription is Pounds 45m. Another non-recourse loan scheme, St Annes Residences, sponsored by Neill Clerk, will raise money for St Anne's College, Oxford. The six-month loan, underwritten by Barclays, is 73.5p per Pounds 1.00 invested. Several advisers, such as Nick Mercer of Hill Martin, are nervous about the non-recourse loan schemes. They point out that these offers are on favourable terms for the banks. Although the annualised returns on a non-recourse loan look attractive (Johnson Fry quotes 49.93 per cent over six months), over five years a higher return should be available by leaving the money in a BES company. Neill Clerk has launched three unusual offerings. Airways III will buy accommodation for the British Airways Housing Association. The association has placed money on deposit so that, after five years, it aims to pay Pounds 1.17 for every Pounds 1 paid now. Uncapped Growth is a hybrid, with an undertaking from a property developer to pay Pounds 1.25 per Pounds 1.00 after five years, although this does not have a full bank guarantee. There is no limit on the upside. Reversionary Gains IV will buy home reversions from the elderly and aim for a profit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Dunkel Proposals and Us"] </F>   [Text] The attitude of the central government about the  dunkel Draft is vague and makes one suspicious. Commerce  Minister Pranab Mukherji's statement last Friday in the House  implied that the government was all but ready to approve the  Dunkel Draft. The government is aware that prices of drugs will  increase when we join Gatt and the farmers' use of seeds will  also be effected. The seeds patented by foreign companies will  become instrumental in exploiting the farmers. There has been a  demand for one or two years to hold a national debate to direct  the Indian government's attitude toward Gatt. This controversial  issue was also discussed in the Parliament a couple of times,  and proposals were also made to have a joint parliamentary  committee study the Gatt proposals. However, the central  government did not pay much attention to these questions of  national importance. The government never presented the real  picture associated with the Dunkel proposals in front of the  people.    It is natural to ask whether patenting the seeds can be  practical. It is said that Indian people will not be able to use  leaves, fruit, and skin of the neem tree like in the past as its  various uses will have been patented in the United States of  America and those patent laws will be imposed on India also. The  question arises: Why should U.S. laws be imposed in India? It  would be unfortunate to increase prices of drugs and the result  of this increase can be very serious. The question of state  governments' rights were also raised in the Parliament. The  Indian Constitution allows some rights to states and the central  government cannot pass laws in those areas. If the Dunkel draft  is approved, international laws will be imposed in those  specific areas. Keeping in mind India's weak economic condition,  it is not a secret how little involved India will be in making  international laws.    India was the leader of developing countries during Indira  Gandhi's rule. Even during Rajiv Gandhi's government, India  refused to bow down, and other developing countries looked at  India with hope. However, India gradually lost its right to lead  the developing nations due to the ambiguous attitude that it  adopted during the governments of V.P. Singh and the prime  ministers that followed him. This resulted in the cancellation  of the summit meeting of Group-15 and expression of helplessness  by our commerce minister in the Parliament. The government may  be helpless but if the new Gatt agreement results in creating  additional problems for the people, these problems will find  their own solutions!</p>

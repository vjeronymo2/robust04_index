			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Riyadh, 1 May (SPA) -- His Royal Highness Prince  Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the interior minister, made a press  statement following the graduation ceremony of the 23rd batch of  university officers. After congratulating the new graduates, he  said: "I hope they they will be at the level of our  expectations, and be true security men and represent security in  the Kingdom to the best of their abilities -- this security that  stems first and foremost from our religion, and from our total  respect for the citizen and the resident in the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia." [passage omitted]    Regarding a question on preparations for marches like the  Iranian march or for matters that go against the teachings of  religions, the interior minister said: "In any case, I have  heard such talk and read such reports. The Iranians have said  that they will carry out such acts, and we say no, they will not  be allowed to do so. Pilgrimage has its particular rites  enjoyed by every Muslim. As for this matter, they know very well  that it will not happen. They have been informed of this  decision, and such acts will not be allowed to happen."    Responding to a question on reports carried by the Iranian  media stating that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is trying to  obstruct the march of the Iranian pilgrims; and how does his  royal highness perceive the motives behind such campaigns, he  said: "Are we really interested in words, or are we interested  in reality? Let us talk about reality and see what is  happening; it is reality that determines such matters."    Answering a question on the organizational aspect of  pilgrims  in the Kingdom, be they Saudis or residents, his royal highness  indicated that the organization is always carried out by the  Ministry of Pilgrimage and it always strives to organize these  matters.

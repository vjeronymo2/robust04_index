The Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq  (SAIRI), in a statement received here by AFP, said the religious  leaders had either been executed or killed during clashes  between the PUK and the rival pro-Iranian Kurdistan Islamic  League (KIL).    SAIRI also charged that several mosques in northern Iraq had  been badly hit during the fighting.    "SAIRI strongly condemns such acts and calls for an  immediate  ceasefire and negotiations," the statement said.    Kurdish sources said at least 72 people had been killed and  250 wounded in clashes between the PUK and KIL since last week,  mostly in Irbil and al-Sulaymaniyah, which lies close to the  Iranian border.    The PUK flushed out KIL fighters from their military bases  on  Monday.    PUK leader Jalal Talabani told AFP on Tuesday that the KIL  had surrendered their weapons.    Meanwhile, SAIRI said an Islamic delegation representing  groups opposed to the Iraqi government would soon leave Syria  for northern Iraq to mediate between the rival Kurdish factions.    The delegation met with Talabani in Damascus Tuesday to  discuss the situation in northern Iraq, it said.    They asked Talabani to declare an immediate ceasefire and  called for information on the fate of the KIL leader, Shaykh  'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, according to SAIRI.</p>

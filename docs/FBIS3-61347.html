I Served  15 Years For It'"]    [Text] We met with Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the  Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, immediately following a  session of the Presidium. The third in the past week, and not,  by all accounts, the last, since the question of the Crimean  Tatars' participation in the presidential elections has yet to  be decided. The appeal to the people to boycott these elections  has been suspended, meanwhile.    [Pronina] Mustafa-aga, on New Year's Eve you met with Leonid  Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, and on 2 January the Mejlis  announced a boycott of the elections for president of Crimea,  although the Congress of the Crimean Tatar People had adopted a  directly opposite decision. Is there some connection here?    [Dzhemilev] You do not have it quite right. The question of  elections to the Supreme Soviet, where we are allocated a  particular quota, for which I voted myself and called on others  to do likewise, was considered separately at the assembly at  that time. As were, separately, the presidential elections. As  far as the latter are concerned, I have been opposed from the  very outset since I am convinced that neither the Crimean Tatars  nor people of other nationalities are, if it is viewed  realistically, interested in the institution of a presidency in  Crimea.    The presidency is only for a particular group of people,  which aspire to the creation of a strong power for the solution  primarily of their own problems. I pointed out in my report at  the assembly that the Presidential Election Act was adopted by  the Supreme Soviet of Crimea, which we did not elect, and on the  basis of a constitution which we consider unacceptable for  ourselves and which entirely ignores our legitimate sovereign  rights. But at the same time, considering the alignment of  political forces that is shaping up (there is a great evil and a  somewhat lesser evil, which is mirrored in the fact that people  wholly of the Zhirinovskiy level are straining after power on  the peninsula), we are allowing of the possibility of use of the  votes of Crimean Tatars in the election of the least of all the  evils. The assembly's decision was, therefore, a compromise.    Although there was mention of the unacceptability of the  institution of a presidency in principle, the final decision on  participation in the elections was at the same time left to the  Mejlis. We are prepared to support the candidate who  honestly declares the indivisibility of the evolved borders,  that is, allows no mention even of a reconsideration of the  question of the current territories of Ukraine and Russia and  the affiliation of Crimea, inasmuch as our people see their  self-determination in a national-territorial autonomy within the  framework of Ukraine. He must be a candidate who will at  least state that he sees the strengthening and restoration of  Crimea's statehood on the basis of respect for the Crimean Tatar  people's right to self-determination on their territory.    [Pronina] Judging by the decision of the Mejlis, none of the  present presidential candidates as yet meets these requirements?    [Dzhemilev] We have had discussions with many politicians,  with candidates for the office of president included. I should  say, incidentally, that as of late everyone has greatly loved  the Crimean Tatars, and even Leonid Grach, the candidate of the  Communist Party, sent his people to us, via whom he promised the  positions of deputies in all the rayon soviet executive  committees if the Crimean Tatars vote for him. So it was that,  having analyzed all the election programs and having assured  itself that not one of our conditions is observed in them, the  decision not to take part in the elections was made after stormy  debate at the Mejlis Presidium session on 2 January.    But I had a meeting, which took place after the decision of  the Mejlis, with Nikolay Bagrov, and some of our comrades  believe that we should take part in the elections for all that.  Because there is a real danger that instead of Nikolay Bagrov,  whom they consider the lesser evil, real extremists could come  to power. It is these members of the Mejlis who are insisting  that the decision be reconsidered. After two days of stormy  debate, a decision to boycott the elections was adopted all the  same. But on 5 January 12 members of the Mejlis submitted to me,  in accordance with the standing orders, a petition requesting  the convening of a new session and a conclusive decision on the  matter on 8 January and for the appeal to the people to be  suspended meanwhile.    [Pronina] So Nikolay Bagrov's candidacy was, for all that,  preferable to the others?    [Dzhemilev] Yes. All the other candidates, including,  unfortunately, Ivan Yermakov, who declares that he would lift  the moratorium on a referendum on Crimea's independence, could  by their actions create an explosive situation on the peninsula  before which the Dniester region and Karabakh could seem like  just a game. And when barricades have to be built, a solution of  the problems of the Crimean Tatars would go by the board.    [Pronina] Mustafa-aga, I would like to return to the start  of  our conversation--your meeting with L. Kravchuk.    [Dzhemilev] I was forced to tell him that I know what  democracy is. I served 15 years for it, but a democracy where  presidential candidates raise the question of a change in the  current borders and a violation of the country's constitution I  do not understand and do not accept. A self-respecting state  should not be treating this with such nonchalance.    I spoke in great detail about the most difficult situation  in  which our people have found themselves and about the fact that  the assistance which Ukraine allocates from its sparse budget  should be more specific. All the monies that have been allocated  us thus far have ended up with the Administration of Crimea.  They have been used to create a parasitic managerial machinery.  We have dozens of examples of this money being stolen and used  for purposes having nothing in common with the return of the  Crimean Tatars.    Ukraine has allocated us 240 billion karbovantsy for capital  construction in 1994. I asked L. Kravchuk to ensure that this  money be channeled directly into the national bank which we have  organized in order that we might purchase building materials  with it and distribute them to people. A commission with the  participation of representatives of the Administration of Crimea  and the Mejlis, which would monitor its expenditure, should be  created. Some 300-400 homes could, via trusts, be built with the  amount allocated, and if the funds are distributed directly to  the individual builders, we could resolve the housing problem  for 30,000 families. Leonid Makarovich agreed with this and  promised to render us every assistance here.    The president and I also discussed the enlistment of the  help  of other countries. Primarily Turkey, whose government is not  indifferent to the lives of a kindred people. Prior to my  meeting with Kravchuk I had an interview with the Turkish  ambassador. He said that the matter could be resolved only with  the participation of an official delegation of Ukraine, in which  there should necessarily be representatives of the Mejlis. He  promised to draw up a program indicating whom we should meet and  how the questions of assistance should be decided, but on one  condition--that the resources allocated go directly to the  Mejlis, not the Administration of Crimea. L. Kravchuk agreed  with this also, and such a visit will soon take place, I believe.</p>

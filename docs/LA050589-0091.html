			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH DENIES RECIPROCAL ROLE WITH HONDURAS  </P> <P> President Bush, challenging evidence presented in the trial of former Lt. Col.  Oliver L. North, denied Thursday that he took part in any Ronald Reagan  Administration effort in 1985 to offer U.S. aid to Honduras in direct exchange  for that country's assistance to Nicaragua's Contras.  </P> <P> "The word of the President of the United States, George Bush, is there was no  quid pro quo," the President declared in his first public response to evidence  presented at the North trial.  </P> <P> "There has been much needless, mindless speculation about my word of honor --  and I've answered it, now, definitively," he added.  </P> <P> Bush not only denied that he personally discussed a quid pro quo with  then-Honduran President Roberto Suazo Cordova when they met in Honduras in  1985, but he said that there was no such agreement between the two governments  "as far as I know, to my knowledge."  </P> <P> So sweeping and categorical was Bush's denial that it appeared likely to  escalate the controversy over his alleged involvement in the deal.  </P> <P> Among the documents presented at the North trial was a 1985 memo signed by  then-President Reagan approving the quid pro quo. A subsequent memo discussing  the reciprocal deal carried a hand-written notation by John M. Poindexter, then  Reagan's national security adviser, saying that "we want VP (Bush) to also  discuss this matter with Suazo."  </P> <P> "It's not easy to reconcile those documents with the President's statement,"  said Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), former chairman of the House Iran-Contra  investigating committee.  </P> <P> Since the memos were made public during the North trial, Bush has been dogged  by questions about whether he complied with Poindexter's wishes when he  traveled to Honduras later in the year.  </P> <P> Sharp questions also have been asked in Congress about why the Reagan  Administration failed to provide these documents to the investigating  committees. Until Thursday, Bush had refused to answer any questions on grounds  that his response might affect the North trial.  </P> <P> But once it was learned that the North jury had reached a verdict, Bush  appeared eager to answer, discussing the matter with reporters while bidding  goodby to Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney at the diplomatic entrance of  the White House. In fact, he made his statement a few minutes before the North  verdict was announced.  </P> <P> Specifically, Bush denied that the subject of a quid pro quo was mentioned at  his meeting with Suazo. "The records of that meeting demonstrate that there was  no quid pro quo," he said. ". . . No implication, no quid pro quo, direct or  indirect, from me to the President of Honduras on that visit."  </P> <P> Indeed, there is no independent evidence that Bush brought up the quid pro quo  at the meeting, even though Poindexter clearly wanted the vice president to do  so. Then-U.S. Ambassador to Honduras John D. Negroponte, who attended the  meeting, has said that no such deal was discussed.  </P> <P> But the President did not confine his remarks to the meeting and members of  Congress seemed most surprised by his statement that he had no knowledge of a  quid pro quo. Not only do the memos suggest that Bush was informed of Reagan's  decision to press for such a deal but congressional investigators long have  assumed that such an arrangement existed, since Honduras received expedited  economic aid from the United States in 1985 after agreeing to continue  assisting the Contras.  </P> <P> In 1985, after Congress cut off direct U.S. aid to the Contras, Honduran  officials made no secret of their desire for more economic aid from Washington  in exchange for the risk they were taking by providing sanctuary to the Contras  along their common border with Nicaragua.  </P> <P> A top investigator for the Iran-Contra committees, who declined to be  identified by name, suggested that Bush's categorical denial was based on a  narrow definition of what constitutes a quid pro quo between two countries. He  suggested that Bush may be defining U.S. aid to Honduras as an "incentive"  instead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Often Draws Distinction  </P> <P> "One person's quid pro quo is another person's normal diplomacy," he noted.  "The government has often drawn a distinction between 'incentives' and quid pro  quos."  </P> <P> Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are currently investigating  why the congressional Iran-Contra panels never received many of the documents  pertaining to the Honduran deal. Bush pledged to cooperate with this inquiry  "in every way requested."  </P> <P> The President said that he already had told the congressional investigators to  contact A.B. Culvahouse, who was Reagan's White House counsel during the 1987  Iran-Contra investigation, and added: "Hopefully, they can resolve it between  themselves."  </P> <P> "I am going to insist that the congressional committees . . . be briefed fully  on the confidential cables that bring up every fact of that meeting," Bush  added.  </P> <P> Hamilton said that Congress has a responsibility to pursue an explanation  because the lesson of the Iran-Contra scandal is that the White House cannot be  trusted to volunteer the full truth.  </P></p>

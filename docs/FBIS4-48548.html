			<p>BFN     [Text] In light of the grave and dangerous situation  created by the large numbers of dead bodies which have been  floating in Lake Victoria from River Kagera as a result of the  conflict in Rwanda, the Uganda Government has declared part of  Masaka, Rakai, and Kalangala to be a disaster area.    The government statement issued in Kampala this morning  says:  The government has undertaken and will continue to carry out  measures to combat the effect of this disaster. It says the  extent and scope of the measures will be announced from time to  time by the relevant organs of government. The statement said,  Uganda Government is extremely concerned about the large numbers  of dead bodies which have been floating in Lake Victoria from  River Kagera as a result of the tragic conflict in Rwanda.    Sources estimate the number of dead bodies washed ashore  into  various parts of Masaka, Rakai, and Kalangala Districts to be  around 10,000, while other sources estimate the number to be as  high as four times that figure. The statement adds that the  government has noted with appreciation the efforts already put  in by various individuals and institutions such as the World  Lutheran Federation and the U.S. Agency for International  Development, to combat the effect of the disaster.    Given the magnitude of the problem however, the statement  adds that the government wishes to appeal to the international  community to supplement the efforts of the Ugandans in order to  arrest the situation. The government also calls upon the  warring factions in Rwanda to observe the fundamental rules of  civilized conduct by giving their dead a proper burial in their  country instead of dumping them into Kagera River. The Uganda  Government, the statement concludes, expects that agents of the  UN system, currently deployed in Rwanda, will impress this upon  the authorities concerned.    [Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania External Service in English at  0400 GMT on 22 May in a similar report adds: "More than 600  bodies of Rwandans washed into the Uganda side of Lake Victoria  were buried in two mass graves in Uganda this week. The  state-run daily NEW VISION reported that the dead victims of  ethnic massacres and fighting between government troops and  rebels in the past six weeks were buried on on 18 May at Kyebe,  about 210 km southwest of Kampala.]    ["NEW VISION said authorities were still trying to drag out  more bodies from the lake and the Kagera River which flows into  Uganda and forms the border between Tanzania and Rwanda.]    ["Ugandan authorities earlier issued a warning against  drinking unboiled water or eating fish from Lake Victoria, the  world's largest freshwater lake."]</p>

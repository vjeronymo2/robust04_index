			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESCUERS OF THE WRONGED SOUL;  </P> <P> THE SEVERED SOUL A PSYCHOANALYST'S HEROIC BATTLE TO HEAL THE MIND OF A  SCHIZOPHRENIC BY DR. HERBERT STREAN AND LUCY FREEMAN (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS:  $18.95; 302 PP.; 0-312-03930-1);  </P> <P> THE UNTOUCHED KEY TRACING CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IN CREATIVITY AND DESTRUCTIVENESS BY  ALICE MILLER (DOUBLEDAY: $17.95; 208 PP.; 0-385-26763-0)  </P> <P> With something like a thousand books a week being published in this country,  readers are threatened with drowning in an indiscriminate sea of detective  novels, cookbooks, Baedekers, self-help manuals, romances, celebrity  biographies. . . . If publishers could refrain from glutting the market with  everything they can lay their hands on in even one genre -- "pop psych" books  like "The Severed Soul," say -- literary standards might be salvaged and vast  tracts of woodland preserved to protect us from global warming and overheated  imaginations alike.  </P> <P> Herbert Strean lost my sympathies in the first chapter of "The Severed Soul,"  co-authored with Lucy Freeman. (The exact nature of Freeman's contribution to  the book is not made clear, but in view of the implausible dialogue, hackneyed  imagery and disjointed syntax, it can't have been literary.)  </P> <P> I bore up as Strean catalogued the tasteful accouterments of his office  overlooking Central Park and even as he platitudinized that "all patients  should make sure their analyst is qualified." But then, having agreed to accept  for psychoanalysis Nancy, the "paranoid woman" who has been "raving" in his  office, Strean reflects: "This is . . . a powerful challenge, like trying to  make par on a long and winding hole where you cannot see the green as you tee  off." Poor Nancy, I thought, "caught in a cross current of the wish to kill and  the fear of being killed," with a guide who views the human dilemma in terms of  a golf match.  </P> <P> As his self-aggrandizing subtitle suggests, Strean envisions himself charging  into the psychoanalytic fray on his white electric cart to rescue a fair damsel  in distress. Whether a battleground is an appropriate site for healing is  questionable, although Nancy's distress certainly is not. Having lost her  mother to cancer when she was 6 and grown up a kind of shadow-wife to her cold  but seductive father, she is suicidally depressed and convinced that the  principal of the school where she teaches hates her enough to poison her soup.  </P> <P> She is far more privileged, however, than the schizophrenics I know. The  daughter of a prominent gynecologist and the wife of an advertising executive,  she readily agrees to "pay over several hundred dollars to lie on the couch 45  minutes four times a week," 11 months a year, for more than five years.  Stretched out there in her "fashionable dark blue silk dress," free-associating  articulately, she'd make a striking contrast to toothless, smelly D, who is  given to pitching cigarettes and paper towels around the restroom of the  neighborhood center she frequents.  </P> <P> Throughout her analysis, Nancy continues to hold a teaching job, unlike M,  another schizophrenic of my acquaintance, who is too preoccupied ducking death  rays from the television screen to keep track of a two-way conversation, much  less a roomful of ebullient second-graders. But then, people like D and M  aren't likely to wander into an office on Central Park West.  </P> <P> Thus, Nancy doesn't seem like the most representative choice for the purpose  Strean puts her to: a model for his generalizations about the proper treatment  of all schizophrenic patients. His heart seems in the right place, however, as  he argues that by listening to and accepting Nancy's utterances, acknowledging  her strengths as well as her weaknesses, and seeing himself and Nancy as more  similar than different, he serves her better than the doctors who have  previously locked her up, drugged her and given her both insulin and  electric-shock treatments. And fortunately, during analysis Nancy does appear  to achieve the self-forgiveness and self-control she needs to function  responsibly in the world without unbearable pain.  </P> <P> The tale of this transformation lacks tension, however, since we never see  Nancy in her world but only hear, at second hand, her not very distinctive  voice within Strean's book-lined walls. Such is the nature of psychoanalysis,  "the talking cure," and although analyst and patient may perceive the process  as intensely dramatic, Strean never quite brings it alive for the  reader/dropper/voyeur.  </P> <P> On the contrary, since the same issues arise repeatedly and provoke similar  reflections each time, the effect is static. On returning to Nancy after one  summer vacation, for instance, Strean reports his feelings in almost precisely  the same words he used the year before, right down to the threat he recalls his  mother making: "Herby, do what I say or you'll be in deep trouble!" "Oh dear,  poor Herby," a reader is likely to sigh at this point, "he doesn't seem to be  making much progress at all."  </P> <P> A self-confessed "compulsive workhorse," Strean once asked his own analyst:  "You mean if I don't write a book a year, you'll still respect me?" He confides  that this year's book, "as I realized while writing it, is my way of holding on  to the memory of Nancy." For a complex of reasons, then, Strean felt compelled  to write "The Severed Soul." You need not, however, feel similarly compelled to  read it.  </P> <P> Instead, if you enjoy the psychoanalytic method, you might try Alice Miller's  slender book of essays, "The Untouched Key." Miller's premise resembles  Strean's: that trauma experienced in childhood, if not permitted free  expression, will cause potentially deadly psychic pain. Rather than presenting  a case study, however, Miller takes the more characteristically European  approach of textual analysis.  </P> <P> In the light of what biographical material she can find ("biographers are  seldom interested in their subjects' childhood," she notes), she reads the work  of a variety of literary and artistic figures in terms of their early traumatic  experiences. Her subjects include painters Pablo Picasso, Kathe Kollwitz and  Chaim Soutine, comedian Buster Keaton, and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.  Crucial to the individual's ability to turn painful experiences to creative  rather than destructive ends, she finds, is the presence of "a sympathetic and  helpful witness who confirmed the child's perceptions, thus making it possible  for him to recognize that he had been wronged."  </P> <P> The consequences of a child's feelings of powerlessness and guilt that most  concern Miller are not individual but social. The repression of those feelings,  in order to preserve "the illusion of a strong and wise and benevolent father,"  leads to quiescence in the face of the evils perpetuated by society's  "fathers," that is, those in positions of power, who are intent on waging war.  </P> <P> Through a rereading of the myth of Abraham and Isaac, Miller urges "children"  to question these figures and reject their destructive behaviors: "The new  Isaac -- with his questions, with his awareness, with his refusal to let  himself be killed -- not only saves his own life but also saves his father from  the fate of becoming the unthinking murderer of his child."  </P> <P> The pieces in "The Untouched Key" are too sketchy to be fully satisfying, but  they stimulate the reader to thicken their texture with her own reflections.  It's refreshing to be released from the couch, from the office, from the need  to make par on that tricky fourth hole, into a world that depends on our  psychological and thus our moral health for its saving.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Sheik Chic: Edward VIII gave up his throne to marry Wallis Simpson 53 years  ago, but the Windsor romantic legend has come alive again at their Bois de  Boulogne mansion. The wrought-iron gates of the final, favorite residence of  the pair were thrown open recently for a high tea given by Egyptian tycoon  Mohammed Al Fayed, who spent $8 million on renovations, with the blessings of  the villa's official owner, the city of Paris. One of the villa's first  visitors was actress Joan Collins, who asked Al Fayed if he planned to use the  mansion for his own parties. "I will, indeed," he said, adding he plans to keep  it staffed and open to small group visits by special request.  </P> <P> * Beltway, Bah Humbug: John Fairchild, publisher of W and Women's Wear Daily,  doesn't want anything resembling a Washington politician or political wife on  the cover of his publications. "The kiss of death is Washington," he told the  Washington Post. How about First Lady Barbara Bush, a woman said to be much  admired and something of a trend setter? "Absolutely no interest in it," he  said.  </P> <P> * Hostile Reactions: Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa urged Israelis to  forgive the Nazis for killing 6 million Jews during World War II and condemned  the Jewish state for oppressing Palestinians. Tutu, on a Christmas pilgrimage  to the Holy Land, said he would keep criticizing Israel's occupation of the  West Bank and Gaza Strip even if it meant others accused him of being an  anti-Semite and worse. Vandals wrote "Tutu is a Nazi" on the wall of the  Israeli Religious Affairs Ministry before the Nobel Prize-winning cleric met  minister Zevulun Hammer there Tuesday. Graffiti containing racial slurs about  Tutu were scrawled Monday on the wall of St. George's Anglican Church in East  Jerusalem where he celebrated Christmas Mass.  </P> <P> * Royal rap: Viscountess Althorp, Princess Diana's sister-in-law, has some  choice words about London's tabloid journalists, some of whom have published  photographs of the lady kissing an old flame. The journalists are "Evil, evil  people," she says, adding, "I don't know how they go home to their wives and  children and talk about their day with a clear conscience."  </P></p>

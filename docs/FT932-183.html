			<p>930630 FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs to lobby on African debt AN all-party group of MPs was launched yesterday to campaign for agreement among the Group of Seven industrialised nations on new measures to help reduce African debt. It is calling for the Tokyo G7 summit to approve a significant write-off of Africa's debt as a first step in a longer-term debt relief package. The group is led by Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the foreign affairs committee; Mr Michael Meacher, shadow overseas development minister, and Sir David Steel, Liberal Democrat foreign spokesman.</p>

The letter, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, said: "In  the name of freedom of democracy I writing to you to ask about  the fate of the Libyan citizen Mansur al-Kikhya, my husband and  the father of my children and a respectable man who was abducted  from Egyptian territory. I understand from your recent speech  that you are seeking to find him because he is a human rights  case." She went on: "Three months have elapsed and we do not  know who committed this ugly crime. Maybe cowardly elements  did, and I am certain that your hands will reach them and that  you will punish these cowardly people."    She also pointed out that Libya "does not wish to lose a  free  and noble man who believes in nothing except right, peace, and  dialogue..., and I am certain that you will find him and return  him free to his children and home.... You will find him  anywhere, inside or outside Libya...it does not matter...what  matters is for him to come back to his children, who have not  stopped crying." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Risk and Reward: High-tech path to holy grail may lead up a blind alley IN obscure corners of the investment world in the US and the UK, the first products of a new generation of investment technology are being put to the test. Experience seems to have been mixed, in spite of the claims of enthusiasts. Even the experts disagree on whether the latest thinking is leading down a blind alley, or whether it will open the way to the holy grail of investment management - higher returns without higher risks. The latest products revolve around so-called 'non-linear' methods of analysing economic and financial data. Traditional statistical methods - the sort of procedures underpinning most quantitative investment models, which attempt to predict movements in financial markets based on historical data - have several flaws. Perhaps the most serious is that the relationship between market prices, and the factors that determine them, changes over time. The only sure thing is that what happened before will not happen the same way again. Theories and techniques developed in branches of science far removed from the financial markets are now being brought into play. To orthodox capital market thinkers, they are based on a heresy: that market prices do not follow a 'random walk', where it is impossible to tell from the last price what the next one will be. The approaches being used include the use of 'neural networks' (networks of computer processing units whose interaction is meant to replicate the learning process of the human brain) and 'genetic algorithms' (a method of generating better hypotheses about how markets work by starting with a wide range of assumptions and using them to 'evolve' new and better views). Chaos theory - which holds that it is often possible to identify short-term patterns in apparently random data - is also being put to work. The first products of this thinking are finding their way out of academia and research labs and into investment management and trading houses. The UK's Department of Trade and Industry last month agreed to fund a Pounds 1m 'club' aimed at finding financial market applications for work on neural networks being undertaken at University College, London. Several investment houses, including County NatWest Investment Management, have shown an interest. Citibank in London has been investigating the use of such methods for foreign exchange trading since the late 1980s. Mr Paul Refenes of UCL says a New England insurance company using a fixed-income fund management model since late last year has outperformed the JP Morgan world government bond index by a factor of two. The Prediction Company in Santa Fe is typical of the new rash of hopefuls. Formed by experts from the physical sciences less than two years ago, it has received backing from O'Connor, the Chicago-based derivatives firm, to develop new investment management approaches. The question posed by each of these is the same: is there a pattern or structure to movements in financial markets that can be isolated and used as the basis for investment or trading? Mr Ben Peters of PanAgora, a Boston-based asset management company, claims stock markets move in clear cycles - four years in the US and Japan, two and a half in the UK and six in Germany. Foreign exchange markets, though, are closer to the 'random walk', though with certain biases reflecting central bank steering of rates. 'It is still an open question whether the structure in financial data is caused by chaos or some other underlying factor,' says Mr Norman Packard of The Prediction Company, which has concentrated on foreign exchange and futures markets. Ironically, the current generation of technical trading models may give the 'rocket scientists' something to feed off. Markets where technical trading plays a large part, such as the futures markets, might show a clearer structure than others, says Mr Packard. The same could be true of indexation and active quantitative investment management.</p>

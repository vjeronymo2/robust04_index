			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of 19 March RENMIN RIBAO Editorial: "Maintaining </F> Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy Economic Development"]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- The basic principle for  the work of the whole party and country this year is, using  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as guidance,  to thoroughly carry out the guidelines set by the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee; to quicken the step of building a socialist  market economic system; to maintain sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development; to preserve political stability;  and to promote progress in all social sectors. Party committees  and governments at all levels should take their local reality  into consideration; study the situation well; unify their  thinking, steps, and action; and thoroughly carry out this  guiding principle in a positive manner.    The current economic situation is good -- all localities  have  placed great importance on agricultural production, they started  early and have paid great attention to it, and all measures  taken have been quite effective. Industrial production has  continued to grow rapidly and efficiency has improved to some  degree; the state's key construction projects have been carried  out smoothly; the consumer products market has been brisk and  active; and people's lives have continued to improve. However,  some difficulties and relatively conspicuous contradictions  still exist in economic work -- agriculture's relative  efficiency has dropped; the peasants' income remains to be  increased; the scale of fixed asset investment is still larger  than desired; the efficiency of some large and medium  state-owned enterprises is poor; and the industrial structure is  not completely rational. It should be said that, following high  economic growth in the last two years, constraints caused by the  "bottleneck" and pressure of inflation have increased, and the  entire economic climate is uneasy.    This year is a very crucial one for development and reform.  We are advancing reform of the economic system amid rapid  economic development, and need to maintain a high economic  growth while accelerating the process of transforming the  system. In particular, it is not easy to properly organize and  implement the various major reform measures that have been  initiated for the purpose of building a socialist market  economic system, because these measures involve many sectors and  industries. To do this, we must shore up our conviction that we  can defeat all difficulties; keep cool heads; judge the hour and  size up the situation; grasp the overall situation of reform,  development, and stability; and properly handle the dialectical  relationships between sustainment, rapidity, and healthiness  while developing the economy.    China has achieved good results in sustaining its economic  development and this has drawn worldwide attention. Practice  proves the fundamental reason why we have been able to sustain  our economic development is that we have used reform and opening  up as a powerful driving force for development, that we have  followed the socialist market economic law in doing practical  work, and we have prevented drastic ups and downs. This year  China's reform centers on establishing a new system and a series  of major reform measures have been launched. Properly  organizing and implementing these measures will inject a  powerful driving force to the further, sustained development of  the economy. Of course, reform and development are a very  complicated systems project -- it takes courage and prudence as  well. This demands we properly handle the relationships between  various contradictions; and we take positive, cautious, and  appropriate action in designing strategy, in making use of  opportunities, in grasping the rhythm, and in devising specific  steps and measures. Only by doing so can we avoid sharp twists  and turns, and drastic ups and downs. Currently, leading cadres  at all levels should properly use the materialist dialectical  viewpoint to analyze the situation, handle problems, prevent  ideological one-sidedness and one-sidedness in understanding  things, and prevent mistakes, especially big mistakes, in making  decisions.    The economy should develop more rapidly -- this is a wish  of people across the country as well as a pressing demand posed  by the international and domestic situations. What we mean by  rapidity is rapidity with efficiency. We do not mean to  maintain the high growth simply by increasing investment,  expanding the investment scale, launching new projects, and  expanding [wai yan, 1120 1693] development. Experience proves  that speed without efficiency and that does not conform to  economic law is not real speed. This kind of speed not only  cannot yield the results of rapid development, on the contrary,  it will increase our burden and eventually impede rapid economic  development. The macroeconomic regulation and control measures  timely adopted by the central authorities last year have  effectively solved the prominent contradictions and problems  cropping up in the course of development; have forcefully  rectified the financial order; checked the real estate fever,  development-zone fever, and excessive growth in investment; and  stabilized the economy and supported the state's key  construction projects, thereby alleviating problems in some  areas and making new improvements to the economic development  climate. But, the trend of launching new projects regardless of  whether conditions permit or not is still quite strong in some  localities. For this reason, we should continue to strengthen  and improve macroeconomic regulation and control to prevent the  recurrence of inflation. In preparing this year's development  plans, all localities should proceed from reality, take the  overall situation into consideration, be scientific, keep cool  headed, be realistic, set development objectives according to  actual needs and feasibility, and must not blindly compare  themselves with each other. They should shift their minds from  pursuing speed to paying attention to real development; and  place the center of their economic work on deepening reform,  transforming mechanisms, improving the industrial structure,  strengthening management, promoting technological progress, and  increasing productivity. This has extremely great significance  for our future economic development.    Whether the economy can develop rapidly and in a sustained  manner primarily depends on whether it can develop in a healthy  manner. Healthy economic development requires a comparatively  coordinated and rational industrial structure, and a set of  economic functioning mechanisms that can maintain  highly-efficient economic operations. This year we still need to  pay attention to improving the industrial structure. We should  further consolidate and strengthen the role of agriculture as  the foundation of the national economy, increase agricultural  investment, ensure a good agricultural harvest this year, and  increase the peasant's income. We should continue to seriously  implement the "Regulations Governing the Transformation of  Operating Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,"  properly manage large and medium state-owned enterprises, take  various measures to increase enterprises' vitality, and properly  organize the experimental work on building a modern enterprise  system. We should guide enterprises to forcefully open up  international and domestic markets, timely adjust product mix  according to market demand, and provide active support to the  production of readily marketable products. We should continue  to step up the construction of infrastructural facilities,  ensure the state's key construction projects, and gradually  alleviate constraint caused by the "bottlenecks." Construction  of infrastructural facilities also needs to be carried out  according to the importance and urgency of a project, and to the  resources available; we should make the best use of our limited  financial and material resources. We should strengthen and  improve macroeconomic regulation and control, and strive to  maintain a basic balance between total supply and total demand.  Improving the industrial structure is fundamental work that  involves many sectors and industries, so we must take the  overall situation into consideration. We should consider the  nation's overall situation in deciding the priority and  importance of a project. At the same time, by deepening reform,  we should further straighten out the relationships between  various sectors and truly solve problems concerning the economic  system and economic functioning mechanisms. Of course, by  healthy development we do not mean there should be no faults at  all; what we demand is that we should prevent major problems  from occurring, and should discover problems and take effective  measures to solve them as soon as they begin to surface.    Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, broadening the  scope of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining  stability -- this is the general work of the whole party and  country this year. Work in all areas should be subordinated to  and serve this goal. Judging from the situation early this year,  the situation on the economic front is good. We should continue  to maintain the work style of being modest and cautious, and of  guarding against arrogance and rashness; we should keep our cool  heads and work in a down-to-earth manner; we should meticulously  organize our work and work diligently to ensure the economy  develops rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner; we  should endeavor to do this year's economic work better than we  did last year's.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Republic of Tatarstan Statute: "On Procedure and Terms for </F> Privatization of State- and Municipally-Owned Housing in the  Republic of Tatarstan"]    [Text] 1. This Statute establishes unified regulations  throughout the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan with  regard to privatization of housing in state-owned and  municipally-owned housing holdings, terms for the payment of  compensation in the form of an additional amount of individual  privatization deposits to citizens of the Republic of Tatarstan  who have substandard living conditions, as well as the  fundamental principles for payment of expenditures for the  maintenance and repair of housing that has undergone  privatization.    2. The fundamental principles governing privatization of  state-owned and municipally-owned housing are:    -- acceptance of housing ownership on a voluntary basis;    -- free transfer to citizens of housing occupied by them in  state-owned (or municipally-owned) housing units, regardless of  the total amount of living space or the commercial value of the  housing;    -- preservation of the key elements of the previous system  for the use, repair and maintenance of privatized housing;    -- payment of compensation in the form of an additional  amount of individual privatization deposits to citizens of the  Republic of Tatarstan who do not have housing or have housing  conditions that are below the average level achieved in this  republic (16.2 sq. meters of total living space per capita),  regardless of the form of housing ownership.    Every citizen of the Republic of Tatarstan living in housing  that is not slated for privatization or who has living  conditions below the average level of housing provision in the  republic (16.2 sq. meters per capita) has a right to receive  compensation in the form of additional means of payment, usable  for purposes of privatization.    A citizen has the right to receive compensation once,  regardless of the form of ownership of the housing occupied by  that citizen.    Compensation will be provided in the following amounts:    -- for citizens without housing (renters in privately-owned  buildings and buildings belonging to housing construction  cooperatives; persons subletting in state-owned and communal  housing with no other residence permit): R40,000 [rubles] in  individual privatization accounts (deposits);    -- citizens without housing who are living in specialized  buildings (in buildings belonging to the Republic of Tatarstan  Ministry of Social Security, the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry  of Health or the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Internal  Affairs, and who have no permanent residence permit outside  those institutions): R40,000 in individual privatization  accounts (deposits);    -- citizens with no housing who are living in dormitories  (with the exception of seasonal and temporary workers and  individuals working under temporary contracts, as well as  citizens who are resident in connection with study): R40,000  rubles in individual privatization accounts (deposits);    -- citizens living in housing classified (according to  legally established procedure) as hazardous and dilapidated:  R40,000 in individual privatization accounts (deposits);    -- citizens living in closed military settlements and in  official housing: R30,000 in individual privatization accounts  (deposits);    -- citizens with less than 5 sq. meters of living space  (inclusive) per person: R30,000 in individual privatization  accounts (deposits);    -- citizens with between 5 and 10 sq. meters of living space  (inclusive) per person: R20,000 in individual privatization  accounts (deposits);    -- citizens with between 10 and 16.2 sq. meters of living  space (inclusive) per person: R10,000 in individual  privatization accounts (deposits).    Every citizen of the Republic of Tatarstan living in a  building belonging to a housing construction cooperative has a  right to receive compensation in the form of additional  privatization payments in the amount of R10,000 in individual  privatization accounts (deposits).    3. The right to privatization of housing in state-owned and  municipally-owned buildings belongs to the citizens who are  permanently registered in those buildings, including citizens  who are temporarily absent but have retained a legal right to  the housing in question.    Citizens who have reserved housing have a right to the  privatization of housing at their place of reservation.    4. Housing may be privatized only with the written consent  of  all the adult citizens living in the housing in question.  Privatized housing becomes the joint property of all the  citizens living in it, including minors.    Minor citizens must be listed among housing owners.    In the event that citizens move to other state-owned (or  municipally-owned) housing for the purpose of improving their  living conditions in accordance with current legislation and  have taken up residence in that housing on the basis of a lease,  the citizens in question have a right to privatization of the  housing previously occupied by them.    A housing privatization contract may be dissolved with the  mutual consent of the parties to the contract, or in the event  of a dispute, by a court on the basis of a suit filed by one of  the parties.    Any citizen who dissolves a housing privatization act  through  legally established procedure retains the right to free  privatization of the housing in a state-owned (or  municipally-owned) building which that citizen occupies under  the terms of a housing lease.    5. Housing units in buildings in need of capital repairs are  to be privatized on the usual terms.    6. Housing which is in a hazardous state or is located in  dormitories, specialized buildings or in buildings at closed  military settlements may not be privatized.    Local soviets of people's deputies, in conjunction with  enterprises, institutions and organizations and with  consideration for the opinion of trade unions (as expressed by  appropriate bodies thereof) or, in the absence of such, the  opinion of workers' direct representatives who have been  properly elected and authorized in accordance with the laws of  the Republic of Tatarstan, shall determine the portion (list) of  official housing that is not subject to privatization.    Privatization of housing (apartments) in buildings which are  historical or cultural monuments must be carried out in  accordance with the "Statute on Procedure and Terms for  Privatization of Buildings Which Are Historical or Cultural  Monuments."    7. Housing in communal apartments may be privatized with the  consent of all tenants. In such cases rooms occupied by tenants  become the property of their residents, but kitchens, hallways,  bathrooms, etc. remain common property.    8. As a rule, interviews with citizens and the preparation  and issuance of documents establishing property rights are to be  carried out by housing maintenance enterprises and their  subordinate units (susequently to be referred to as HMEs),  ministerial (departmental) enterprises, organizations and  institutions which have state-owned housing on their books, and  HMEs under local soviets of people's deputies which own  municipal housing.    Special centers (agencies, bureaus) for the privatization of  state-owned and municipally-owned housing may be established to  perform work connected with document processing relative to  housing privatization in cities (or rayons).    9. Local soviets of people's deputies shall establish  regional commissions to oversee and organize housing  privatization processes.    A housing privatization commission operates pursuant to the  "Statute on Commissions for the Privatization of State and  Municipal Housing," as approved by the Republic of Tatarstan  State Committee for State Property Management.    10. During the preparatory period, i.e. prior to enactment  of  the law, HME specialists shall fill out a draft "Contract on the  Transfer of Housing to Citizens" for each housing unit that may  be privatized.    This draft contract is to be signed and registered by the  head of the city (or rayon) administration, and also be  registered with technical inventory agencies.    Upon completion of this preparatory work, HMEs shall inform  each area's population of the business hours and location of the  office that will conduct interviews with citizens.    11. Citizens must submit to the appropriate HME an  application for privatization of a housing unit signed by all  the adult citizens who live together in that unit.    In view of the fact that every citizen has a right to  acquire  a housing unit in a state- or municipally-owned building free of  charge as part of the privatization process only one time, in  the event of changes of residence a document must be attached to  the application certifying that the housing unit previously  occupied by the citizens in question has not been privatized.    12. A specialist will verify the correctness of the  application form and correlate the information inidicated  therein with corresponding information contained in the  previously prepared draft contract. If no comments are to be  made, one copy of the completed contract will be issued to the  applicant. A second copy of the contract will remain with the  HME, and a third will be sent to technical inventory agencies so  that they can maintain state-mandated records of housing  according to established procedure.    13. In cases of discrepancies between information provided  by  the applicant and information contained in the draft contract,  documents pertaining to privatization of the housing unit in  question shall be handed over to a regional commission for  consideration and resolution. In such cases decisions on housing  privatization matters must be made not later than one month from  the date the documents are submitted to the HME.    14. Payments for processing of documents pertaining to the  transfer of housing ownership will be made by citizens at a  single rate equal to 0.4 times the minimum wage.    15. In the event that a citizen's rights are violated in  connection with housing privatization matters, that citizen has  a right to appeal to a housing privatization commission or to a  court.    16. Rules for record keeping regarding citizens, including  those living in privatized housing units who require improvement  of their living conditions, as well as assignment of housing  units in the Republic of Tatarstan, shall be governed by current  legislation.    17. Owners of privatized housing units in buildings that are  state-owned or municipally-owned constitute building users with  regard to physical plant and common areas, and owners joined  together in societies or other associations constitute co-owners  in proportion to the area of the building occupied by them.    18. Maintenance and repair of privatized housing units  (apartments), buildings which contain privatized housing units  (apartments), and entirely privatized residential buildings are  to be performed in compliance with existing regulations and  standards governing housing use and repair.    19. State HMEs retain their obligations with regard to the  maintenance and ongoing and capital repairs of privatized  housing units (apartments) and buildings containing privatized  housing units (apartments) which were serviced by them prior to  the start of privatization.    20. Owners of housing units (apartments) in a multi-unit  apartment building are required to share common expenditures for  the maintenance and repair of the structure (residential  building), its physical plant and areas adjacent to the building  in accordance with the "Contract on Transfer of a Housing Unit  to Citizen Ownership."    21. For the purpose of efficient maintenance, servicing and  repair of privatized housing, owners may form societies or other  associations operating on the basis of bylaws.    22. Prior to the formation of a society of apartment owners  (co-owners of a building), relations between apartment owners  and the HME that administers the multi-unit apartment building  in question with regard to servicing and repair of the building,  adjacent areas and privatized apartments shall be based on a  contract covering services to the building, adjacent areas and  privatized apartments.    Under that contract the HME pledges to perform a number of  jobs in connection with the maintenance and ongoing and capital  repair of the building and adjacent areas in accordance with the  requirements of the "Regulations for Housing Use and Maintenance  of Housing and Adjoining Areas" on the terms specified for  state-owned and municipally-owned housing, and also:    -- conduct preventive inspections of plumbing fixtures in  apartments twice annually;    -- repair plumbing fixtures at the request of the apartment  owner using the owner's materials or in exchange for additional  payment, if the HME supplies materials.    The property owner is required to make monthly payments for  the HME's services and for municipal services equivalent to the  payments (rent and payment for municipal services) as  established for renters in state-owned and municipally-owned  housing.    A schedule of monthly payments for building maintenance,  municipal services and other services to the apartment owner  must be attached to the contract.    23. Owners of privatized housing units are required to pay a  tax in accordance with current tax legislation.    24. A society of apartment owners is a co-owner of a  multi-unit apartment building, and the terms of this  co-ownership must be set forth in a "Contract on Joint Ownership  of Housing and Share Participation in Its Maintenance."    The entity on the balance sheet of which the building is  listed and other legal persons that are co-owners of the  building are required to conclude the aforementioned contract.    25. When concluding a "Contract on Joint Ownership of  Housing  and Share Participation in Its Maintenance" an HME may, by  decision of the building's co-owners, delegate to the society a  portion of its rights and obligations with regard to maintenance  and repair of the building and adjoining areas.    The society may act as customer when contracts are concluded  with contractors for municipal services, ensure participation in  all expenditures connected with property maintenance and repair  commensurate to each co-owner's share of ownership, ensure  timely payment of funds set aside for those purposes, represent  the co-owners' interests before state and other institutions,  etc.    26. After all the apartments in a multi-unit apartment  building have been privatized, the apartment building, with the  exception of attached or adjoining non-dwelling structures, may  be transferred to the ownership of the citizens who have joined  together to form a society. Only in that case may the building  be transferred from the balance sheet of the HME to that of the  society.    Transfer of ownership of an apartment building is to be  performed by the entity on the balance sheet of which the  building is listed by agreement with the owner or a body  authorized by the owner, in accordance with current legislation.    27. Relations between the client -- the society of apartment  owners -- and the contractor -- the HME or other organization  that repairs or maintains the building and adjoining areas --  are to be established on a contractual basis.    28. Communications networks inside apartments, physical  plant  and other facilities are not subject to privatization.    29. The owners of privatized housing units are responsible  for their maintenance and repair in accordance with current  legislation.    30. Monitoring of the condition and timely repair of  privatized housing is to be carried out by local soviets of  people's deputies.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Companies to test electronic filing of tax returns A sample group of up to 1,000 UK companies will from today have their corporation tax returns filed directly to the Inland Revenue by computer link. The scheme aims to replace costly letters and telephone calls and to bring closer the goal of direct filing from accountants, companies and home-based personal computers. If the pilot exercise succeeds, a national system of electronic filing may be available for all the 1m corporation tax returns made in a year. In 1996 the Revenue plans to try the system on its new self-assessment personal tax forms. Up to 5m taxpayers may be using the so-called Electronic Lodgement Service through accountants by 2001. The Big Six accountancy firms, acting as agents for clients, have joined the project. The Revenue, which is under government pressure to cut costs, sees large savings in the scheme, with the aim of eventually eliminating routine paper tax correspondence. Accountants and other agents envisage fewer immediate benefits, and are pressing the Revenue to introduce a flat-rate payment to those filing electronically. They are also unhappy with the costs of the pilot project, which initially has to be run in tandem with the existing paper-based system. The voluntary project, running until March 1995, aims to test the technology and see whether accountants, software houses and the Revenue can work together. From today, tax returns from the sample companies will be filed via modem from the accountants through a message 'gateway' at the Revenue's offices in Basingstoke. The electronic version of the tax return will be the one used by the Revenue  -not the paper backup. The software is being provided by Taxsoft and Data Sciences. Details, Page 8</p>

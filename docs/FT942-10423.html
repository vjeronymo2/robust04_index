			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Germans give credit warning Several leading German economic research institutes yesterday warned against any further credits to Russia, saying economic collapse there was accelerating, Reuter reports from Bonn. Three leading think-tanks said in a report commissioned by the German government that despite some progress the Russian reform process was not working. Far-reaching structural changes in the country's economy were needed, they said. 'Given the causes of the acceleration of the economic slowdown it appears ill advised at the moment to put new financial means at Russia's disposal,' said the report, from Berlin's DIW, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and the Halle institute. They said a complete collapse of industrial production in Russia was possible and that mass unemployment was inevitable. They advised the Russian government to scrap its current credit system and to reduce subsidies. They recommended a 'realistic wage policy and the closing of resource-wasting, loss-making businesses'. Germany has supplied more than half of all western aid to the former Soviet Union but has recently refused to give more export credits until Russia improves its investor and trade protection laws. Separately, however, the eastern Europe committee of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) said it expected a further improvement in trade between Russia and Germany if Moscow continued to invest in key sectors of industry. It said German imports from Russia had totalled DM10.7bn (Pounds 4.2bn) in 1993 and imports to Russia were DM11.4bn. 'Against the background of the unfavourable economic developments in Russia in 1993 - a fall in GDP of 12 per cent, a 16 per cent decline in industrial production, inflation rates of 800 to 1,000 per cent - this development is encouraging,' the BDI said. Declines in petrochemical, oil and gas production in Russia had not shown up strongly so far in trade figures with Germany.</p>

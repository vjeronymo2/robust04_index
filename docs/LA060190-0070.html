			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL SPEEDS UP GROWTH-CONTROL PLAN  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council on Thursday set in motion a complex scheme designed  to rush a council-endorsed growth-control plan into effect shortly before Nov.  7, when San Diegans will probably vote on a competing growth-control plan  prepared by the San Diego 2000 committee.  </P> <P> The city's still-evolving growth plan, already more than a year in the making,  would limit new development until the city solves its huge deficiency in roads,  parks, sewers, jails, police stations, libraries and other public services.  </P> <P> The council Thursday ordered the city staff to speed development of a plan to  manage traffic congestion and a capital-facilities master plan that would serve  as the cornerstone of the growth-control plan. Drafts of those documents were  recently submitted to the council by Robert Freilich, an attorney who advises  the city on growth-related issues.  </P> <P> Acting on a motion by Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, the council ordered the  city staff to develop those documents on a "fast track" so they can be  incorporated into emergency ordinances on July 11.  </P> <P> Freilich argued that the emergency ordinances are appropriate because,  throughout California, residents are being assaulted by increased pollution and  traffic generated by unrestrained growth.  </P> <P> The emergency ordinances planned for July would be followed in September by  still more ordinances and General Plan changes that would be needed to have  most of the growth-control plan in place before the November election.  </P> <P> The council opted for a fast-track approach so council members can, in effect,  campaign for the city's proposal and against the San Diego 2000 initiative.  </P> <P> "I want ours in place so we can go out and say (the city plan) is the best,"  Mayor Maureen O'Connor said Thursday.  </P> <P> The council's action drew praise from Peter Navarro, founder of Prevent Los  Angelization Now, a group supporting growth control as necessary to ensure that  the public infrastructure exists for the city to grow.  </P> <P> Navarro and other slow-growth advocates Thursday described the San Diego 2000  growth-control initiative as ineffective.  </P> <P> But Construction Industry Federation spokesman Tom Sheffer on Thursday  described the council's plan as "a formula for economic destruction . . . new  developments would not be able to go forward."  </P> <P> Although the council Thursday addressed key elements of its control plan, it  once again failed to say how it would pay for infrastructure costs estimated at  nearly $2 billion. Council members indicated that they would tackle the tough  question of how to pay the city's share of those costs before July 11.  </P> <P> Opponents of the city plan have argued that the city will never raise the money  needed to pay for its share of needed improvements. Without the city's  contribution, construction will grind to a halt, critics predict.  </P> <P> In a series of rapid votes Thursday, council members took preliminary steps to  place the competing growth-control plan developed by San Diego 2000 on the Nov.  7 ballot.  </P> <P> The San Diego 2000 committee, which includes developers and civic leaders,  earlier this month gathered enough signatures to place the initiative on the  Nov. 7 ballot. However, the council also has the option of refusing to place  the initiative on the ballot, which could spark a court battle.  </P> <P> Council also voted against placing on the November ballot a growth-control  initiative developed by PLAN. But Navarro predicted that the council will  reverse course and place his group's initiative on the November ballot as an  "insurance policy" that would help to defeat the San Diego 2000 initiative.  </P> <P> Thursday's flurry of votes occurred shortly after Councilman Wes Pratt urged  council members to "get off the dime on this. . . . we've been jockeying around  playing dueling initiatives. . . . Let's either vote something up or vote  something down."  </P> <P> Under the plan adopted Thursday, the council would enact emergency ordinances  to set in motion changes in the city's General Plan. In September, the council  would augment those emergency measures with ordinances and General Plan changes  to further flesh out the plan.  </P></p>

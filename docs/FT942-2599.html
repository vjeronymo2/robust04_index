			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wainhomes beats float forecast with Pounds 6.2m Wainhomes, the Chester-based house-builder which came to the market in the spring, beat its flotation forecast with pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.22m, compared with Pounds 5.29m, during the 12 months to the end of March. Turnover rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 69.4m (Pounds 56.8m). The pre-tax figure was struck after lower interest charges of Pounds 866,000 (Pounds 1.17m). Earnings per share also rose by 22 per cent, from 7.9p to 9.6p. Stock market sentiment has turned against housebuilders since the company floated at 170p. Yesterday the shares fell 1p to 134p. Wainhomes sold a record 965 homes last year, 22 per cent more than in 1992-93. Due to increased land costs and reduced selling prices, margins declined slightly during the 12 months, the company said. The number of housing plots it controlled for development rose over the year by more than 700 to 3,102. Mr Smith said: 'The strong demand experienced at the beginning of 1994 has continued into the new financial year and consequently our cumulative sales to mid-June are 46 per cent ahead of the comparative period last year.'</p>

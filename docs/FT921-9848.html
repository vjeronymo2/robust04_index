			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Letter: Justified guide? Sir, What is all this 'teenager's guide' nonsense? I see that Michael Prowse's latest doom-laden missive from the US ('. . . guide to the budget', February 3) is headed in the manner of Samuel Brittan's habitual shorthand. Is it policy to be condescending? Is it - fellow City readers - even justified? Andrew Shouler, economist, Industrial Bank of Japan, Bucklersbury House, Walbrook, London EC4N 8BR</p>

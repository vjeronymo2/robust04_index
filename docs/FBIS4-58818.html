			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Badar Bakhus al-Fighali from Paris] </F>   [Text] Western diplomatic sources have received a secret  report indicating that the United States has donated $100  million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).  UNRWA will use this money to buy land in 'Akkar and northern  al-Biqa' and build modern camps for Palestinian refugees to  replace the camps destroyed during the Lebanese civil war and  other camps which will be dismantled in the southern areas close  to the Lebanese-Israeli border.    According to reliable sources within UNRWA, the U.S. plan,  whose implementation has actually begun in Lebanon, aims to  settle the Palestinians living in Lebanon since 1948 and for  which there is no hope of returning to their original homes.    Diplomatic reports circulating in Paris last week indicated  that Israel is trying to persuade Jordan to settle the  Palestinian refugees in the Jordan Valley. This Israeli policy  is incorporated in a booklet prepared by Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres containing his concept of the future of  joint cooperation between Jordan and Israel. This booklet was  scheduled to be distributed to the multilateral talks on water  that were held in the Sultanate of Oman recently.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Money Markets: Markets slumber THE MONEY markets languished in a post-bank holiday mood yesterday, scarcely moving in exceptionally thin levels of trading. 'It is very difficult to get people motivated,' said one dealer. 'We need a jump lead to get the dealers back on track.' The June sterling contract traded just over 9,000 lots during the day in a four-tick range, 'barely giving a living to the jobbers', as one analyst put it. Yesterday's low volumes contrasted sharply with the frenzied activity after the election when around 9,000 lots were moving easily in the first half-hour of trading. 'I think there has also been a realisation that we are at or around fair value in the cash and futures markets,' said Mr Nick Parsons of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, explaining the lethargy in the market. The contract hovered around 89.78 after opening at 89.76. Rates at the long end firmed slightly as expectations for base rate cuts receded. Recent economic data has suggested that inflation is proving more stubborn than expected. 'The producer prices index, the retail prices index and average earnings have all shown that inflation hasn't been clubbed to death,' said one analyst. With the political imperative to cut rates removed and much talk of an Easter 'boomlet' as shoppers took to the high streets, base rates of 10.5 per cent look likely to be around for some time yet. One year money firmed slightly to 10 5/16 - 3/16 per cent from Thursday's close of 10 1/4 - 1/8 per cent. The key three-month interbank rate remained steady at 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent. The overnight rate moved up during the day, touching 11-10 3/4 per cent at one stage, as the Bank of England revised its initial forecast liquidity shortage from flat, to Pounds 500m in the late afternoon. The Bank did not operate in the morning, but late assistance of Pounds 270m took its day's operations to Pounds 361m. Earlier in the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 91m of Band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The overnight rate closed at 10 5/8 - 3/8 per cent. In Germany, call money rates were steady to slightly firmer at 9.60/70 per cent, compared with 9.60/65 per cent on Thursday. Traders said reserves were holding up well.</p>

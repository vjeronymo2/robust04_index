"The PDG calls on the government to restore order, guarantee  the security of persons and property, and throw full light on  the recent riots so that all the authors are made to answer  before the law for their acts," stated the party's deputy  secretary general and spokesman, Rene N'demezo Obiang at a news  conference. According to him, "apart from soldiers and  strangers, victims of the recent violence were essentially PDG  activists and supporters."    The official casualty report on the four days' clashes  between groups of demonstrators and security forces in several  residential districts in Libreville and Oyem, the opposition  stronghold in the north of the country, lists nine dead,  including two soldiers; six seriously wounded; five persons  kidnapped and later released; about 50 burned vehicles, and over  a hundred shops and street stalls ransacked.    One of the victims is Jean Kamga-Komo, a local PDG official  in Libreville. "The PDG wants the authors of the cowardly  murder of our comrade to be identified and punished in  accordance with the law," Mr. N'Demezo stressed.    The government has accused opposition parties, especially  Father Paul Mba Abessole's National Lumberjacks Rally of  "politically recuperating" and capitalizing on the general  strike launched by the Gabonese Free Trade Unions Confederation  to call for salary increases following the devaluation.    Defense Minister Martin-Fedele Magnaga said "certain  opposition party leaders recruit, train, and arm militias" and  have "overrun the capital with people that loot and go on the  rampage."    Questioned on possible self-defense measures by supporters  in  the event of renewed disturbances, the PDG spokesman stressed  that his party did not want "a kind of Lebanization of the  country with "independent armed troops who take the law into  their own hands."    The party's main position is to ask government to enforce  law  and order, he further stated, "but we cannot continue to leave  our supporters to be sacrificed as victims...and if government  does not do anything about the situation, we will have no other  choice but to create private militias as in Lebanon. But we do  not want it to come to that," the spokesman said.</p>

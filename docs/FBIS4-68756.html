			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Panov and N. Preobrazhenska: "Be </F> Careful--Don't Eat `Kovboy!'"]    [Text] The Zelenyy Svit [Green Earth] association had  appealed to the General Procuracy of Ukraine as early as 1992  with the request to verify the facts of gross violations of  legislation for the purchase and use of pesticides in  agriculture.    The General Procuracy took up this issue and ascertained  significant violations of the law, as well as financial abuses  on the part of some officials. It was thus determined that  Ukrahrokhim, the Radykap plant and the Ukrayina AG had been  buying up hundreds of tonnes of pesticides in various countries  whose use is prohibited in those same countries. The IkrDITOKS  Institute, or more precisely its leaders, who should have been  standing guard against the penetration of poisonous mixtures  into Ukraine, gave permission for their use.    It has been established that the damages to the state as a  result of the actions of these individuals are valued at 18  million dollars. Seven criminal cases have been filed based on  these crimes. Investigation is now underway, but a question has  arisen here: how can it be that we, ordinary mortals, are using  pesticide products that are poisonous abroad? Not an easy  question, the more so as the people affiliated with it are  continuing their dirty work.    A governmental commission was created by request of the  procuracy that was to halt the use of unsafe mixtures and punish  the guilty officials, but this has not happened. Director M.  Motuzynskyy and his assistants A. Podrushnyak, A. Bolotnyy and  S. Omelchuk, removed from their positions at UkrDITOKS on the  recommendation of the General Procuracy, were asked to be  experts at the State Chemical Commission of the Cabinet of  Ministers--that is, the chief judges of their own criminal  actions.    The head of that state commission himself, V. Petrunyak,  authorized the bringing of the unregistered mixtures into  Ukraine. The chief sanitary physician of Ukraine, V.  Mariyevskyy, who signed the authorization for the use in  agriculture of a whole series of mixtures that are not safe for  people, holds a senior position in the Ministry of Health to  this day.    Carcinogenic, mutagenic and allergenic pesticides that are  not even registered in the producing countries are being shipped  into Ukraine with the blessing of high persons even today. And  one can imagine what is being hidden on the farms if in the  capital oblast alone--in Boryspilskyy rayon--mixtures without  even names were being produced. The kolkhozes in Obukhivskyy  Rayon have been using Kovboy and Satis mixtures, which are not  listed among those permitted. In Vasylkivskiyy rayon, clear of  radionuclides, they are polluting their fields to a significant  extent with pesticides, while in Poliskyy the Ahroindustriya  Scientific-Research Center is offering farms the unregistered  Kovboy. Wherever you look, we are thus being polluted, robbed  and poisoned--and no supervisor is being brought to liability.    The Ukrainian Zelenyy Svit ecological association has  appealed to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine with the request  for the immediate removal from their posts of the people who are  promoting the poisoning of the already quite polluted Ukrainian  lands through their unprincipled and criminal actions.    Zelenyy Svit is also appealing to the citizens of Ukraine:  people, be careful! Demand complete documentation for pesticides  and herbicides, and certificates for their use in agriculture.  Demand, from monitoring bodies of stores and markets, guarantees  of the quality of agricultural products. Do not permit the  poisoning of yourself and your children.</p>

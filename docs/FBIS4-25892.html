			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yun He: "Farm-Machine Sales Dive, Losses Pile Up"] </F>   [Text] China's farm machinery industry is suffering record  operational losses, according to the Ministry of Machinery  Industry.    So far this year manufacturers of farm machinery have lost  more than 106 million yuan ($12.2 million) because of slow sales.    Officials with the ministry's information and statistics  bureau said that during the first five months of this year the  industry's output was valued at more than 17.3 billion yuan ($2  billion) or 34.5 percent of the year's target of 50 billion yuan  ($5.75 billion).    However, they added, the production growth was 13.1 percent  less than the same period last year.    At the same time, sales have fallen 24.6 per cent from a  year  earlier.    The ministry's analysts say the industry's products simply  are not competitive.    Because the prices of farm machines have risen under the  government's new tax system, farmers prefer to fix up their old  machines or even do farmwork by hand.    Sales of the industry's mainstay products -- such as large  and medium-sized tractors, engines, combine harvesters and water  pumps -- have all dropped from last year. The worst hit are  combine harvesters, whose sales have fallen by half.    Government officials have started to show signs of worry  that  the slow sales may hinder agricultural production this year.    Although some machines are already too expensive for  farmers,  some manufacturers want to raise prices even further. They  argue that higher prices are justified by higher costs, chiefly  more expensive production materials and greater tax burdens.    The high price of diesel oil is another reason farmers are  not buying machinery. A ton of oil now costs more than 1,453  yuan ($167), up 365 yuan ($42) from last year.    In Jilin Province, one of the country's major grain  producers, so many farmers are doing their work manually that  the amount of farmland ploughed by machine has shrunk to 1.2  million hectares, 27.7 per cent less than in 1991.    There is an exception to the dismal market, however. The  Ministry of Machinery Industry says that factories in Shanxi  Province are selling 45.2 percent more farm machinery than last  year. The reason is simple: They are concentrating their  production on the simple and inexpensive two-wheel tractors,  which are very popular among Shanxi's farmers.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (5): City with a high IQ - Nancy NANCY is a city with far more self-confidence than the surrounding region of Lorraine. This is not surprising. It was always going to be easier for this city of services, with its three universities, 45,000 students and long cultural tradition, to adjust to a post-industrial future than Lorraine, hit by the triple decline of coal, steel and textiles. Nancy, too, naturally thinks of itself not just on a regional but also a European scale. Many of the bewildering number of institutions in the city have 'European' attached to them, (as in the city's 'European university pole' or 'European enterprise and innovation centre'); or 'international', as in 'International Water Centre'. It is as if the city believes that whatever it is doing should automatically be of significance to the wider world. If this sounds as though Nancy is getting above its station, it should be remembered that it did once occupy a rather high station as an independent principality which only joined France in the mid 18th century. Its last ruler was Stanislas Leszczynski (1737-66) who, after losing the throne of Poland in yet another division of that country, accepted Lorraine's invitation to come and rule it - near to his daughter, who was married to Louis XV. He then used his own money, and his son-in-law's, to great effect by creating the Place Stanislas and the rest of the rococo heart of Nancy. A century later Lorraine was split into two; Metz and the eastern part were annexed by Germany from 1870 to 1919, and Nancy was left very much on the front line as the standard-bearer of French revanchism. Baron Bernard Guerrier de Dumast, a vice-president of the Greater Nancy Development Agency (ADUAN) and scion of one of Mancy's oldest families, describes the legacy of this chequered history. 'First, it made Nancy a far more Latin city than its neighbours, even to the point of making it more Florentine than French, a city of intrigue still which harks back to the time of a prince, a court and courtiers. 'Second, and more positively, it is a city with a capital spirit. Metz became Lorraine's military and administrative capital, but Nancy remains its cultural and even economic centre, harbouring no fewer than 450 regional headquarters of private companies and public authorities. 'Third, Nancy, like Lorraine, has been squeezed over the centuries between the Holy Roman and German empires on the one hand, and France on the other, and thus invaded a lot. But it has left it undeniably a European city.' Today's 'prince' of Nancy is its mayor, Mr Andre Rossinot, a former doctor who is now also the minister for France's large civil service in the Balladur government (see profile). Mr Rossinot has no doubts about his city's place in the European sun. With the eastward extension of the TGV (train a grande vitesse) from Paris to Nancy, Strasbourg and eventually points in Germany, he says, 'We will no longer be a frontier zone leading nowhere, but at the heart of the Moselle-Rhine basin.,' The mayor does not rate the TGV as a miracle cure, but simply 'as one of the criteria by which companies will now judge where to invest.' However, as a result of the Balladur government's latest plan, Nancy is scheduled to get its TGV link with Paris several years before Strasbourg - a fact which Nancy's developers hope to exploit. Even without the TGV Nancy is not suffering unduly. To the extent that the city has problems, these stem from the decline of industry on its periphery. To the north and south west, it has the former steel-making basins of Pompey and Neuves Maisons. In Dombasle, to the south east, it has the chemical plants of Solvay and Rhone-Poulenc, which are in better shape. In all, the periphery still provides 12,000 industrial jobs. But, as Mr Gerard Rongeot, director-general of ADUAN, says, industry provides only 10 per cent of private sector employment for greater Nancy's 350,000 population, while services account for 70-80 per cent, with the construction sector filling the rest. Unemployment is a little more than one percentage point below the national average (10.4 per cent as against 11.7). There are several reasons for this. According to its secretary-general, Mr Jean-Luc Robaux, St Gobain's Pont a Mousson pipe-making division has laid off none of the 2,000 workers it employs full time in the town of that name. At the same time, however, the Pont a Mousson executive remains rather pessimistic about worldwide over-capacity in iron pipe-making. Mr Robaux lauds the 'long-standing savoir-faire' of Pont a Mousson iron-forgers. If so, it is hard to see why the French company would want, or need, to continue making anything as basic as the cast iron manhole covers which, Mr Robaux complains, are coming in large and cheap quantities from eastern Europe. Some local banks have done their bit, as Mr Bernard Yoncourt, president of SNVB, explains. To the charge that banks are letting new or small companies go under in the present recession, Mr Yoncourt retorts that not only is SNVB still lending to one in three of every small and medium sized company in its catchment area (the Seine-Marne, the Champagne Ardennes and Lorraine regions), but its venture capital fund invested FFr50m in new companies last year. But the most important influence is the economic stability provided by Nancy's outsize academic population - 45,000 students act as a steady 'employer' of some 5,000 people to teach them, and perhaps as many again to house, feed, transport and entertain them - and the technological hope for the future represented by the numerous government and university laboratories, and the 15 grandes ecoles for engineers and managers, clustered in and around the city. Local politicians, businessmen and university leaders have joined together in an effort to try to put all this pure research to commercial use. This has helped to create new businesses (see accompanying article) and to preserve existing industry. Mr Henri Begorre, mayor of the Nancy suburb of Maxeville and the politician responsible for dealing with all the universities in the city, estimates that the universities have been very important to the survival of the local subsidiaries of Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, and of SGS-Thomson, the semi-conductor maker which has now sold its Maxeville plant to a Hong Kong group. In stepping in to help business, Nancy's academia is returning past favours from locally-established business. Solvay, for example, helped to found Nancy's ecole de chimie. By the high standards of eastern France, Nancy has attracted a reasonable but not spectacular amount of foreign investment. Notable among investors are Kimberly-Clark of the US, making Kleenex; Ferruzzi, in food; Clarion of Japan, in car radios; Bauer of Germany, in electric motors. Nancy is choosy. 'We don't want bounty-hunters, because we have not got big bounties (in the form of EC, national or regional investment incentives) to offer,' says Mr Begorre. 'What we want are companies with the right strategies,' he says. He gives an example: a Nancy university invention in anti-adhesives, better known as non-stick materials, which has applications not only in the kitchen but also in reducing friction in motors. 'One of the bidders is a company called Tefal, which obviously needs to sort out its marketing image with Teflon of the US if it is to be competitive with other possible exploiters' of the university invention. This is typical of the slightly know-all attitude of many of Nancy's leaders. But, then, some of them do know a lot. Nancy is a city with a high average IQ.</p>

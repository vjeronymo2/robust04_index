			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / HK laws wait on Chinese talks again BRITAIN and China have agreed the principles for talks about Hong Kong's political future but there remain a 'few points of disagreement', Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, told the colony's legislature yesterday. Mr Patten told the 60-strong Legislative Council (LegCo) that he had decided to defer the introduction of his legislation - which provides for a more democratic electoral system in Hong Kong - for a fourth time in an effort to secure 'productive talks' with the Chinese government. He said that the community would expect him to go 'the extra mile' if, by so doing, he helped ensure the talks proceeded. But Mr Patten said that he could not defer his legislation indefinitely. His address, which had been billed as an attempt to rebuild support among his followers, did little to quell their disquiet about the course of action he has decided upon. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, the main group of elected politicians in LegCo, said the governor had failed to say when his legislation would be tabled. In a swipe at Mr Patten, he said 'the general impression is that the governor will do his best to defer'. As for the prospect of negotiations, Mr Lee added: 'The track record of the British negotiating team is not very encouraging; every time they sit down with the Chinese government they end up on their knees.' The sticking points to talks are China's objection to Hong Kong government officials as part of the UK negotiating team. China also wants to keep the timetable for talks secret. Mr Patten told LegCo that the UK had told China nearly a month ago about the composition of its team - which includes two senior Hong Kong government officials. The British government does not recognise China's right to dictate whom it can field in negotiations with Beijing. It seems unlikely that talks could proceed without China's withdrawal of these preconditions. Mr Patten went out of his way to appear cautious on the prospect of talks. He underlined the difficulty of the task facing Britain and China if the two sides do agree to negotiations. He said he hoped they would produce a result which met his principles of being 'open, fair and acceptable' to the people of Hong Kong. 'But,' he said, 'these are very difficult matters. . . and I hope that we can approach them in a spirit of realism.' Although the government expects China to agree to talks, it has not been encouraged by China's attitude to date. The government appears prepared to break off negotiations if they believe Beijing is simply stalling.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ART NOTEBOOK: ARTISTS SHAPIRO, APPLE CLOSE OUT SMARTS FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Arts Council's 1989 performance art festival concludes with  two more events next Saturday and Aug. 12, with performances by local artists  Elisha Shapiro and Jacki Apple. Admission is free.  </P> <P> SMARTS' program, which consists of six site-specific performance pieces, will  continue to be held at the Ocean Park performance platforms, designed by  sculptor Joyce Kohl. The platforms are adjacent to the Santa Monica Promenade,  just north of where Ocean Park Boulevard meets the beach.  </P> <P> On Aug. 5, Shapiro, who presented himself as a 1988 presidential candidate  under his own Nihilist Party, will be giving an art performance of unspecified  content. Before the performance, he will hold a press conference announcing the  first Nihilism Expo that he is planning for the Los Angeles area in August,  1990.  </P> <P> Shapiro will also identify several local artists who plan to perform at or  build pavilions for the Expo. Pavilions, he said, will include the Hall of  Traffic, the Hall of Crime and Nihilists from Many Lands.  </P> <P> The Expo is not without precedent. Shapiro held a Nihilist Olympics  concurrently with Los Angeles' 1984 Summer Olympics, with contestants battling  for medals in traffic maneuvering and smashing sculpture with sledgehammers.  </P> <P> "I don't think L.A.'s seen anything like this Expo, and it's a shame," Shapiro  said. "There's Disneyland, Universal Studios and that Arts Festival thing, but  nothing for people outside of the mainstream."  </P> <P> Apple's piece, "fluctuations of the field," is a follow-up to "Palisade,"  another site-specific performance in the 1987 SMARTS Festival. It will be  presented Aug. 12.  </P> <P> "Fluctuations" will feature more than 30 artists, performers and musicians,  including members of the Death Valley Croquet Club. Also included will be  roller skaters, dancers, drummers from around the world, yo-yo artists and a  tuba player refereeing the croquet match.  </P> <P> The Shapiro and Apple events close out the 1989 SMARTS Festival, which also  receives financial support from the National State County Partnership and the  Cactus Foundation. It opened July 8 with a performance by "avant-garde lounge  singer" Weba Garretson. Successive Saturdays saw performances by Linda  Albertano and the Chicago performance art group X meets Y, as well as Joyce  Wexler-Ballard's "Line Down the Middle" and Tobi Redlich's "Rocky  </P> <P> Shore."  </P> <P> Admission to the Shapiro and Apple performances is free, and all events begin  at 3 p.m. Parking is available nearby, just south of where Barnard Way meets  Ocean Park Boulevard. For further information call (213) 936-1447.  </P> <P> MONTAGE &amp; COLLAGE: A major exhibition of 20th-Century photomontages and  photocollages opens at the Jan Turner Gallery this Friday, with a reception  from 5 to 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Photocollage, the physical juxtaposition of photos, and photomontage, the  manipulation of multiple images in the darkroom, was a major form of expression  for Dadaists and Surrealists of the 1920s.  </P> <P> "The Changing Picture 1920-1989" is a survey examining the development of these  art forms from the heyday of the Dadaists and Surrealists, through the mass  media influenced Pop Art movement of the 1960s, to the eclectic,  video-influenced artists of the present.  </P> <P> More than 40 artists are represented, including the Berlin Dadaists John  Heartfield and Hannah Houch; avant-garde Eastern Europeans such as Gustav  Klutsis and Mieczyslaw Berman; Deconstructivists the Starn Twins; Pop Art  trailblazer Roy Lichtenstein, and other modern artists, including John  Baldessari and David Hockney. The exhibit, curated by Craig Krull, continues  through Sept. 2.  </P> <P> Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles (213) 658-6080. Open Tuesday  through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.  </P></p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Fortnum &amp; Mason rings up improvement An improving trend at the Piccadilly store, a 47 per cent increase in exports and tight control over costs helped Fortnum &amp; Mason lift pre-tax profit by 3 per cent in the 12 months to January 25 1992. The profit was Pounds 2.12m (Pounds 2.06m) on sales of Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 24.8m). The current accounting period runs for 76 weeks to July 11 but in the 52 weeks to then it will be difficult to match the profit achieved in the comparable period, Mr Garry Weston, chairman, warned. Current trading in Piccadilly had improved over the weak performance of a year ago but exports had not maintained the strong growth of the previous year, he explained. Earnings per share were 327p (311p). There is a second interim dividend of 86p which makes 96p (90p) to date.</p>

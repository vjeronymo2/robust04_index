			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Surreal enough for Magritte? Almost certainly  -Jurek Martin finds the tournament has its fair share of the unexpected This World Cup is becoming too surreal for comfort. Let us simply try and count the ways in which what passes for normality in soccer has been transformed into something of an illusion. One, a team from the US, most of whose players are obscure - to put it mildly - and whose goalkeeper is more intent on an acting career, comes within 15 minutes of forcing Brazil into extra time. This was in no script written outside Hollywood. Of course, the US were out-played for much of the game by a team which, for half of it, were a man short. The Americans only managed one clear chance and no actual shot on goal, but nor did the Brazilians, Romario apart, threaten annihilation; and the tension of the moment showed on every Brazilian player's face - so much so that one of them, Leonardo, gave in to his nerves by planting his elbow in an American's face. Two, a game in Giants Stadium between Saudi Arabia and Morocco drew a crowd of 72,000. Think about it: two Arab teams playing in New Jersey, no less, and selling out the place. It would only have been understandable had it been played in Casablanca or Riyadh, with Bogart as referee and O'Toole and Omar Sharif working the lines. Equally amazing, Russia against Cameroon drew an even bigger crowd. Three, the poor Colombian who scores an own goal against the US gets murdered on his return home. Soccer may generate war, pestilence, famine and rioting, but players do not get knocked off by irate fans, even in Medellin (Cali, maybe, but not Medellin, now that its narcotics kingpin, Pablo Escobar - no relation to the unfortunate Andres - is no more). Four, Diego Maradona, captain of Argentina, is not apparently in disgrace for having failed a drugs test, thus fatally weakening a team that had begun to appear a favourite. There he was out in California doing TV reporting on the Argentina-Romania game and weeping on air as his team went down. Fallen idols are treated differently here. As Tony Kornheiser put it in the Washington Post: 'Do you see Doc Gooden (the Mets pitcher suspended last week for narcotics abuse) going to Cincinnati to sit in the booth with Ralph Kiner? Does this guy have no shame at all?' Americans can be remarkably tolerant of those they have been reared to revere. 'Say it ain't so, Joe', they all said after Shoeless Joe Jackson was charged with accepting bribes in the 1919 World Series. More recently, O J Simpson, the former gridiron great, lost no jobs after pleading guilty to wife-beating (a murder rap, however, has proved another matter). Five, the clog-laden Dutch are now rated a fast team by virtue of extinguishing Ireland. Even Jack Charlton, Ireland's manager, said so, so it must be true, though he might have been decently disguising the shortcomings of his own side. So shocked were crowds in The Hague - not exactly a city where passions normally run high - that they went on a looting spree instead of tending their tulips. Six, following the completion of the second-round games yesterday, Europe is in the ascendant, with seven out of the eight sides through to the quarter-finals. This was not supposed to be. No European side has ever won the World Cup on non-European soil. It can only reflect the mysterious chemistry linking European political disarray to performance on the soccer field. All the European sides, Germany excepted, were presumed to be cannon fodder for Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, and even for Nigeria. Now Romania, where chicken feet were a staple diet not so long ago, look as likely to succeed as anybody. Ceaucescu and his Securitate must be turning in their graves. Natural law may yet reassert itself if Brazil take it all, but it might be pointed out that even Brazil have managed only two goals in their last two matches. If anything, they are living on that most unnatural of Brazilian characteristics - defence. Exactly what Americans make of all this is anybody's guess. Yesterday, the Tuesday morning quarter-backs (normally they are the Monday morning quarter-backs, but Monday was a holiday) took pride in the US team but had their doubts that anything as bizarre as soccer could take deep root here. 'Was this the beginning of an era for American soccer - or the end of a delightful interlude?' asked George Vecsey in the New York Times. 'Will the US even be back in the next World Cup in four years in France?' The usually irreverent Kornheiser even turned semi-serious. 'As much as I've come to like the World Cup, I'm glad we don't treat it with the same fervour as other nations. All this talk about how 'soccer is a passion' and 'soccer is a religion' makes me nervous.' He also found it pretentious. 'One man I know, who has been salivating about the World Cup for years while attacking American sports as loutish, informed me (that) 'every play, every rush downfield is a short story in itself.' I'm watching 22 guys with hairy legs kick a ball around and he's seeing Carlos Castenada in a crossing pass.' In this Cup, Rene Magritte would be a more apt point of reference. There is a hole in the middle of the body of soccer through which bright blue skies can be seen. That must, somehow, be good. But explaining it is no joke.</p>

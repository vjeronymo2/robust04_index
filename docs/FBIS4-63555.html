			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Shavanda: "Do Not Worry: You Can </F> Squander Your Vouchers on Drinking"]    [Excerpt] A proverb says that wise people learn by others'  mistakes. The Belarusian Government considers itself to be  wise. We, they say, will observe our neighbors, estimate costs  and present the most rational program [for carrying out  privatization] to the Belarusian people.    However, many people have already realized that these words  are for those wretched people who continue to trust the  government. As do the sane people, they prefer analyzing a  performance. The official performance is as follows.    Official privatization began much later than unofficial  privatization. The unofficial privatization has been in  progress for over three years. For example, according to an  important official from the Ministry of Trade, all more or less  profitable enterprises dealing with public catering in Minsk  were already privatized in 1991-92. The same concerns  profitable enterprises in other sectors. The mechanism of  privatization is very simple: A joint stock enterprise is  organized, or an enterprise is leased by a working collective,  or a people's enterprise is established -- there are a lot of  versions. The absolute majority of stock is taken by the  initiators and their entourage. At a specified time, a group of  people declares that they have a controlling interest in an  enterprise. So, you understand what happens next.    Belarusian citizens can obtain vouchers beginning 1 April.  This means that various investment funds should have already  begun their operations, saying nothing about the implementation  of the legislative and executive mechanisms. As of today (early  May), 24 investment funds filed applications to receive licenses  for conducting operations with vouchers. However, none of them  has yet received a license. The Committee for Administration of  State Property has even not drafted a regulation regarding  licensing -- and you know why.    We also lack a mechanism for changing vouchers for stock. In  addition, an investment fund can buy only 10 percent of an  enterprise's stock. This is foreseen by the "Law on  Demonopolization and Privatization." There is no opportunity to  buy the entire stock of an enterprise.    Thus, The Committee for Administration of State Property has  found itself in a rather unusual situation. On the one hand, it  should fulfill promises given by Comrade Kebich regarding "fair  privatization." On the other hand, privatization has already  been carried out, the property has been divided, and there are  new owners. The chairman of the Control Chamber has already  spoken on this subject: He claimed that people can only hope  for leftovers from their masters' tables; nothing more is left.    Generally speaking, people are well aware of this: As of 15  April, only 2,123 certificates [sertyfikaty] (something like a  savings-bank book where the number of a person's vouchers is  registered) were issued. The cost of a voucher -- 25,000 rubles  -- does not change. At the same time, the Cabinet of Ministers  banned the auctioning of vouchers to protect them from complete  "devaluation." If an auction is conducted, people would see  that a voucher has a very low market price.    It is planned that the trade in vouchers will begin as early  as 1 July -- already after the presidential campaign. Until  this time, it is only possible to buy the vouchers, however,  nobody knows how to do it. How can any operations with vouchers  be conducted if auctions are banned and it is impossible to  estimate its price?    Belarusian businessmen consider that Valery Matsyushewski,  chairman of the Committee for Administration of State Property,  is an adversary of privatization. This is only partially true.  Enemy number one of privatization is at the top. Mr.  Matsyushewski only carries out his orders. [passage omitted]</p>

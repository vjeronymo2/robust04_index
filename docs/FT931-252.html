			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Trade News: ABB wins Dollars 300m power order ASEA Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, said it had won contracts to supply two 300MW combined heat and power generating plants in Guangdong province in southern China. The value of the two separate contracts was put at Dollars 300m (Pounds 211m), and ABB said it had responsibility for purchasing, installation and initial operation of the plants as well as for supplying components. ABB said both plants would include two 100MW gas turbines, a steam turbine and two heat recovery steam generators. The locations for the plants and identities of the customers were not revealed. The components would be manufacturered mainly in Switzerland and Germany. The first shipments would be made later this year and both plants would begin commercial operation in early 1995. The group said earlier this month that it planned to spend Dollars 1bn over the next five years to expand its presence in Asian markets. Mr Goran Lundberg, ABB director for power plants, said yesterday that China was 'one of the world's more promising markets for power generation'.</p>

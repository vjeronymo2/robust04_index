			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lionheart plunges back into the red Lionheart, the paintbrushes, housewares and retail merchandising equipment group, continued its roller-coaster ride through recession and recovery by plunging back into the red with losses of Pounds 840,000 for the first half of 1994. The outcome, struck after exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds 680,000, compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 518,000 at the previous interim stage and Pounds 1.77m for the full 1993 year. The group is passing its dividend (0.1p); it last did so after the 1992 full-year results - a loss of Pounds 870,000 - only a year after returning to the dividend list in 1991. Mr Paul Lever, chief executive, blamed the lack of economic upturn for the performance. Turnover fell 11 per cent to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 22.5m), with poor sales in bathroom products and housewares as domestic housing markets continued to languish. The slow upturn persuaded retailers to defer purchase of retail merchandising systems into the second half, but Lionheart now expects to meet its full-year budget in this sector. However, direct consumer spending on DIY products and housewares was unlikely to catch up, Mr Lever said. Lionheart, in which Newell, the US paintbrush manufacturer, has a 20 per cent stake, made a trading profit of Pounds 123,000 before interest and the exceptional charge. 'We have cut out some marketing functions we cannot afford at the moment and put a brake on product development,' Mr Lever said. 'Our payroll is now about 750, compared with more than 1,200 four years ago. On the bright side, we have invested more than Pounds 7m in plant and machinery over the last three years and expect to see continuing productivity gains in future.' The result had been largely discounted following a profits warning in August.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cost of restructuring Queens Moat debt jumps to Pounds 42m Queens Moat Houses, the struggling hotels group, yesterday added fuel to the controversy over hefty charges paid to banks and advisers by announcing that the costs of restructuring its Pounds 1.3bn borrowings would be Pounds 42m. Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said delays in concluding the refinancing talks had forced the group to increase its provisions for charges, including facility fees to banks, by Pounds 10m to Pounds 42m. The delays have further hit the group by leaving it with a Pounds 19.3m charge (Pounds 10.6m gain) for currency movements. Because of restricted banking arrangements in place while the discussions are under way Queens Moat is unable to hedge against its foreign debt. These factors helped to increase the pre-tax loss for the first half to July 3 by 56 per cent to Pounds 59m (Pounds 37.8m). Excluding exceptionals, the pre-tax loss fell from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 31.6m. The company is believed to be frustrated by the scale of fees paid to banks and advisers, both its own and those of the lenders. Mr Coppel said he had little choice, however. 'My first priority must be to restore value to shareholders and get this company restructured.' Queens Moat has been in restructuring talks for the last 18 months. While most of the company's 74 lenders have agreed restructuring proposals - which include a substantial debt-for-equity swap - a minority are objecting to the terms. Those resisting the proposals are believed to include lenders who came into Queens Moat through the secondary debt market. Mr Coppel said he was confident the group 'would get there in the end'. The provisions were made on the assumption that the lenders would all agree a refinancing by the end of the year. The long delays in completing a restructuring, which was originally expected by June, are not believed to be causing the lenders any great concern. One adviser has said that the improved trading position made an early resolution of the disagreements between lenders less urgent. Yesterday Queens Moat reported a 97 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 17.9m on sales 12 per cent ahead to Pounds 207m. The improvement in profits was partly because of a strong recovery in the UK hotels division, with operating profits up 54 per cent to Pounds 14.6m. Occupancy rates increased from 51 to 57 per cent, although room rates fell by more than 3 per cent. This was in line with QMH's strategy initially to chase volume and, when possible, push up rates. Continental Europe remained difficult, in spite of a turnround in Germany. Queens Moat raised Pounds 22m from disposals in the first half. About 14 more hotels are targeted for disposal. Net debt was Pounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Losses per share deepened to 7.2p (5p). There is no dividend.</p>

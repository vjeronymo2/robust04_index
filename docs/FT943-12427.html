			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Foreign buyers gear up for German privatisations - International offerings For years, the chance to get a significant slice of Germany's untold wealth of companies has been an impossible dream for international investors because of the labyrinthine cross-holdings and the stakes which are held by the country's biggest banks and companies or by the state. But the ever-stronger need for capital, which can no longer be met exclusively by Germany's banking sector or, in the government's case, by the bond market, is causing these corporate edifices to dismantle. 'The big companies and banks now realise that they have to move with the times and they are starting to use the equity market more fully to satisfy the requirements of capital,' says Mr John St John, director of equity capital markets at Kleinwort Benson in London. As far as the state is concerned, a considerable slug of its assets has already been sold off in recent years but more privatisations are expected in the next year. International investors are gearing up for a further tranche of shares in Lufthansa, the national airline, which is scheduled to come up for sale in early autumn. In May, the government approved plans for the progressive privatisation of Lufthansa and promised to reduce its stake in a first step from 51.4 to 38 per cent by not participating in a rights issue. Bankers forecast that Lufthansa will receive up to DM2bn of new capital from the operation. They also believe Lufthansa will not offer the shares to US investors, by way of a 144a offering, to limit the risk of excessive foreign ownership which could jeopardise its national flag carrier status. A second tranche to dispose of the entire state shareholding could be sold before the end of 1995. However, the government's long-awaited privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, Germany's telecommunications company, is expected to be a truly global affair with the 'book-building' process, internationally acknowledged as an efficient way of getting the best price by flushing out all potential buyers, playing a central role. Market valuations of the company range from DM60bn to DM100bn, which suggest that the sale of the first tranche of the shares could yield between DM15bn and DM20bn. But investors are likely to have to wait until late 1995 or even 1996 before the shares come up for sale. Meanwhile, the need for capital, either to plug holes in public finances or to pay for long-term social infrastructure programmes, is compelling the west German Lander (states) and cities to join in the privatisation drive. Ms Ingeborg Elisabeth Buhl at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt says that, although several Lander substantially reduced the number of their holdings in the 1980s, the value of their assets has risen appreciably in the last decade. 'Privatisation has enormous potential at Lander level,' says Ms Buhl, though she points out that state interests in shoring up regional industrial locations and jobs could slow this process. Nevertheless, there are overwhelming signs that the Lander now regard privatisation as the solution to their financial needs. Bavaria has already conducted several privatisations and the next on the agenda is the sale of its 33.8 per cent share in Rhein-Main-Donau, the company operating the canal linking Germany's two main rivers with the Danube. Meanwhile, Baden-Wurttemberg plans to sell off loss-making operations, including its world-famous spas. The wind of change is also blowing through the boardrooms of several of Germany's big conglomerates, which are seriously considering the sale of non-core businesses.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Birth of a hundred markets: Russian stock exchanges draw on popular trust RUSSIA'S first electronic trading-room opens for business next month in the headquarters of a former communist news agency in Moscow. As part of the chaotic birth of a securities market, the central bank and Finance Ministry will inaugurate trading here with an unprecedented issue of treasury bills. Meanwhile, the sale of some 6,500 state-owned enterprises this year as part of large-scale privatisation will generate a secondary share market. In anticipation of this, the country already has 106 'stock exchanges' or stock-trading departments attached to existing commodity exchanges. But while the commodity exchanges trade everything from cars to sugar, the stock exchanges have had little to trade apart from shares issued by new commercial banks and insurance companies. So far, just over Rbs8bn worth of shares have been made available in the privatisation process, compared to the total Rbs1,500bn which will be needed to honour all the privatisation vouchers distributed to Russia's 147m inhabitants. The vouchers can be exchanged for money or Rbs10,000 worth of shares at auctions, which started in December. But the rules for what is going to be a high-risk game are being made up along the way. Long-awaited securities legislation will emerge only at the end of the year, after the government and central bank submit a draft law to a parliament notoriously slow in adopting economic legislation. In the mean time, overworked officials are already having trouble enforcing makeshift instructions issued last year by the Finance Ministry. By opting for quantity over quality in offering companies for sale, the government is exposing small investors to considerable risks which are not always underlined in the advertising. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, argues that people have little to lose, as they received their voucher free of charge in the first place. 'The state is not promising people a happy life where they don't have to work any more. . . What we can guarantee to all is free choice and maximum information in helping them decide how to use their voucher.' In an attempt to spread the risks for ordinary people already wary of capitalism, the government has licensed some 300 investment funds, which will invest in a selection of enterprises for shareholders. But despite a ban on the use of vouchers for anything other than privatised enterprises or licensed investment funds, other types of companies are already competing for vouchers with ads that have gone unprosecuted. The first tears were shed in St Petersburg last week, when 350,000 people discovered they had been defrauded of their vouchers by unlicensed investment companies, which have since disappeared without a trace. Another obstacle to popular trust are debts contracted but not honoured by the country's previous Communist rulers. These include a 1990 cheque scheme promising peasants imported consumer goods in return for agricultural deliveries to the state. Vowing to make good old debts, the government has promised to issue hard-currency bonds, paying 3 per cent a year, to clients of Vneshekonombank, the state bank, which in 1991 froze billions of dollars belonging to Russian and foreign companies. There are few incentives for foreign investors to join the fray immediately. The first T-bill issue - described by one central bank official as 'the first step in the marketisation of the state debt' - will be for Russian banks only, with foreigners to be allowed in later. Despite Mr Chubais' desire to attract foreign investment, the purchase of shares in Russian companies remains virtually impossible for foreigners. He says this is because the central bank is still trying to introduce a special exchange rate to prevent foreigners from buying up assets on the cheap, thanks to a weak rouble. Some westerners complain that while there are legal ways to get round this requirement, the real problem is a lack of information on what companies are for sale. Although there has been only a trickle of foreign capital, there has been a flood of foreign advice, some of it crucial, some a waste of time and money. Mr Pyotr Lazarev, the bright 26-year-old who is the Finance Ministry's main expert on securities, says what is needed is 'concrete assistance for specific projects' such as that offered by US banking experts for the treasury bill issue. Training is particularly important, both for officials to supervise markets, and for dealers to operate on them. 'Unfortunately, we still have experts trying to teach us what stocks and bonds are when we already have a securities market,' he says. 'It may not be much by western standards but it is a lot given the cosmic speed at which things are developing in Russia.'</p>

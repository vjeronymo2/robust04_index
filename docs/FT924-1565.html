			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Sir Harry Solomon to step aside at Hillsdown Holdings SIR Harry Solomon, chairman, chief executive and co-founder of Hillsdown Holdings, the international food group, said yesterday he would step aside at next April's annual meeting. Sir John Nott, former UK defence secretary and a non-executive director of the group, will become executive chairman, and Mr David Newton, chief operating officer, will become chief executive. Sir Harry will stay as non-executive director. Sir Harry said that after 17 years running Hillsdown he decided it was time to go. He said he had been planning this for some time and that 'my responsibility has been to make sure there is a proper, orderly succession'. He said it was also time to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive. He said that at the age of 55, 'it's time for me to do other things'. He said he had no intention of selling any of his 5.3m shares. He had never had a contract with the company and would receive no compensation for leaving. Sir John said he had not wanted to be a non-executive chairman, and would be based at Hillsdown's head office. He said he did not expect to be involved in the day-to-day running of the business but would 'stand a bit further back from it than Harry'. He said there would be no strategic changes, but acknowledged 'the overriding need is to reverse the (downward) trend in earnings per share'. The group would continue with its rationalisation plans and the process of selling its non-food interests, he said. The company said that current trading was 'in line with expectations' although it was too early to forecast final demand for the important Christmas period. It reiterated the intention, stated in September, that the final dividend of 6.6p would be maintained, to give an unchanged total for the year of 8.8p. Also joining the board in January are Mr Keith Lillington, head of the UK and European canning and chilled food interests, Mr Michael Teacher, in charge of the non-food operations, and Mr Ray Mackie, from KPMG Peat Marwick, as corporate affairs director. Mr Anthony Brice will be replaced as non-executive director. London Stock Exchange, Page 38; Details, Page 22; Observer, Page 19</p>

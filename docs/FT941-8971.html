The board will have 10 practitioners, with 10 public-interest directors, including the chairman and the chief executive. The announcement on the board's composition settles one of the remaining questions before publication of the authority's prospectus next Monday, assuming that the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, gives approval today.

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Curbs on rogue traders planned The director-general of fair trading may be given more powers to deal with rogue traders, the government said yesterday. A consultation paper from the Department of Trade and Industry outlines proposals to speed up action against traders whose conduct is unfair or detrimental to consumers. The 1973 Fair Trading Act places the director-general under an obligation to act against unscrupulous traders. But the legislation is widely thought to be ineffective. The proposals to tighten the law have been put forward by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, after a review of legislation. Sir Bryan wants to change the requirement in the act that a trader must have 'persisted' in a course of conduct before action is taken against him, and to amend the procedures for gathering information or documentation when such action is contemplated. He has also called for the law to be extended to cover deceptive, misleading or oppressive conduct by traders, which may not in itself be unlawful. In place of his duty to seek assurances, Sir Bryan wants the power to issue warning notices to traders requiring that unfair conduct detrimental to consumers be discontinued. Sir Bryan welcomed the government's decision to consult on his proposals. He said: 'I have been concerned for some time that many instances of deceitful or oppressive behaviour cannot be tackled under my current powers. The victims of such behaviour are often vulnerable or elderly people.' Sir Bryan wants to stamp out such practices as using high-pressure techniques to sell burglar alarms. OFT investigations have revealed that salesmen prey on the fears of potential purchasers, submitting them to up to nine hours of high-pressure selling. The government said it recognised there were arguments for improving consumer protection. But it was concerned that the concepts of deceptive, misleading or oppressive behaviour might be unduly subjective as they would apply to conduct which was not unlawful.</p>

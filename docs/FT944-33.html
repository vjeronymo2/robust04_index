			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (11): How to choose your adviser - The terms 'independent' and 'expert' are not synonymous Before turning to the Yellow Pages, it is helpful to understand how the distribution channels operate for products governed by the Financial Services Act 1986. Essentially there are only two types of adviser. The first is limited to offering advice on the products of just one company; the second should search the market for the best product for your requirements. In practice, it is not so simple. Nor is it immediately obvious which type of adviser you are dealing with. Company representatives are authorised, under the act, to sell only the products of the company they represent. It is not the case that they are being obstructive if they refuse to discuss other providers' products; under the regulations this is simply not permitted. Direct-sales agents who work for, say, the ABC Life Assurance Company clearly fall into this category. Less easy to spot are the 'tied agents', which operate a separate business from the ABC Life Assurance but have a contract to sell only ABC personal pensions or endowments. Tied agents include many building societies and banks which, ironically, are still associated with independent advice in the mind of the public. If you buy from a direct-sales operation, you will not find out if your plan represents good value unless you get a second opinion from an independent adviser - not from another direct salesman. Also, consider how you want to pay for the advice. Many independent advisers are remunerated solely by sales commission paid by providers. There is no limit on commission levels. Your adviser might take the top rate available or discount part of the commission and reinvest it in the plan - all of which affects the final value of your fund. Some advisers, including the professional firms with a financial planning section - accountants, actuaries and solicitors, for example - work on a fee basis and reinvest all the commission. The fees-or-commission debate can be over-emphasised. If you want good advice, you will have to pay for it one way or another. Your main concern should be not 'how?', but 'how well?' and 'how much?'. The taxation of advice, rather absurdly, favours the commission route. Commission is deducted from your premiums, which benefit from tax relief; fees do not. VAT is charged on fees but not on commission. This is the reason why many fee-based advisers deduct their charges from the commission and reinvest the surplus, because it is cheaper for the client. Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, the private-client banking and asset management group, said: 'This double tax whammy severely prejudices the availability of good independent, fee-based advice. It encourages the continuation of the commission-driven remuneration system. Even with commission disclosure, will consumers get the best advice if their advisers are driven by the tax system to be paid only if their advice results in an insurance policy sale?' Fee-based advisers charge anything from Pounds 30 to Pounds 200 an hour, depending on whether you go to a local high-street adviser or a leading firm of consulting actuaries. If you want a personal pension and there are no complications (for example, if you also have access to a company scheme the adviser must check which option is in your best interests), you should expect to pay a minimum of Pounds 250 to Pounds 400 for the initial recommendation. Independent financial advisers vary in their competence. The terms 'independent' and 'expert' are not synonymous. There is no foolproof method of selecting a good independent adviser, but if you follow this checklist you should avoid the cowboys: How long has the firm been trading? New firms should be investigated thoroughly. Does it only offer pensions advice? If it covers every aspect of financial planning, it is important that it has the resources to do so. What are the qualifications of the pensions staff, and how senior are they? The minimum IFA qualification is the Financial Planning Certificate, but this is quite general. It would be more comforting if the firm had at least one qualified actuary who is an associate of the Pensions Management Institute. How many pensions clients does it have? (Can you get references?) What criteria does it use to select a pension provider? How does it assess a provider's performance, flexibility, charges and commercial viability? What research resources does it use? Advisers must have access to a comprehensive database that can rank pension plans according to performance, product flexibility and charges. How much will the advice cost per hour/case? You should also check with the Securities and Investments Board that the firm is authorised and registered with the appropriate regulator*. Finally, the post-January 1995 shake-out will not be limited to providers. Independent advisers, particularly the smaller non-specialist firms, face an uncertain future as they struggle to cope with the increased financial and regulatory burdens. Some will join forces, many will go to the wall. Small firms should not be avoided altogether, but extra care should be taken with your investigation. Further information If you are seeking a fee-based adviser, you could try the Money Management Register. To get a list of advisers phone 01179-769444 and give both your home and work address (advisers tend to be concentrated in towns and cities, not in rural areas). IFA Promotions, a trade organisation for both fee- and commission-based independent advisers, offers a free factsheet, Look at how your IFA is paid, together with a list of key questions to ask. Phone 01483 461-461. Callers will also be sent the names of three advisers near their work or home address (again, specify work address if you live in a rural area). * To contact the SIB central register, phone 0171 929-3652.</p>

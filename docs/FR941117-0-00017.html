			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the revisions to the proposed program amendment submitted by Arkansas, OSM reopened the public comment period in the September 29, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 49615; administrative record No. AR&hyph;525). The public comment period closed on October 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Director's Findings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds that the proposed program amendment submitted by Arkansas on March 31, 1993, and as revised by it on July 22, 1993, and August 26, 1994, is no less stringent than SMCRA, as amended. Thus, the Director approves the proposed amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Typographical Errors in Arkansas' Codification at Proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;104(11) and ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its August 26, 1994, proposed amendment, Arkansas submitted proposed revisions at paragraph (12) of ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;104 and paragraph (c) of ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503. However, in the published ACA, the language that Arkansas has proposed to revise occurs at paragraph (11) of ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;104 and paragraph (a) of ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503. In addition, in its proposed amendment as originally submitted on March 31, 1993, and subsequently revised on July 22, 1993, Arkansas submitted revisions at paragraph (a) of ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM concluded that these discrepancies occurred as a result of typographical errors and that Arkansas intended to propose revisions at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;104(11) and ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a) rather than at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;104(12) and ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(c) in its August 26, 1994, proposed amendment. For this reason, in findings Nos. 2 through 5 below and elsewhere throughout this document, OSM addresses Arkansas' proposed revisions at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;104(11) and ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM recommends that when Arkansas promulgates its proposed amendment as submitted on August 26, 1994, Arkansas correct these typographical errors and ensure that it promulgates the correct codification for the proposed revisions to the published ACA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;104(11), Definition of ``Small Operator'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Arkansas proposed revisions to ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;104(11), redefining ``small operator'' to mean <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> an operator whose probable annual production at all locations will not exceed 300,000 tons of coal per year. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although there is no counterpart definition in SMCRA, Arkansas' proposed definition is consistent with section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA, which identifies coal operations that qualify for SOAP as those where the probable total annual production at all locations of a coal surface mining operator will not exceed 300,000 tons. Therefore, the Director finds that proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;1&hyph;104(11) is no less stringent than section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA, and approves it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A) (i) through (vi), Permitting Activities Eligible for Payment Under SOAP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Arkansas proposed at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A) (i) through (vi) to expand those activities associated with the development of a surface coal mining and reclamation permit application that are eligible for funding under SOAP. As discussed below, Arkansas proposed at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A) (i) through (v) to provide funding under SOAP for certain permitting activities that are included by reference in the counterpart sections 507(c)(1) (A) through (E) of SMCRA. And, as discussed below, Arkansas proposed at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(vi) to provide funding under SOAP for certain permitting activities that are substantively identical to the permitting activities identified in the counterpart section 507(c)(1)(F) of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A), General requirements for activities eligible for funding under SOAP. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Arkansas proposed to revise ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A) to (1) add the requirement that the activities specified in proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A) (i) through (vi) must be performed by a qualified public or private laboratory or such other public or private qualified entity designated by Arkansas and (2) delete the language that limits the activities eligible for funding under SOAP to the determination of probable hydrologic consequences and preparation of the result of test borings and core samplings. The added requirement is substantively identical to the requirement concerning qualified laboratories or entities in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA. The deletion of the language concerning the activities that may be funded is consistent with Arkansas' proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A) (i) through (vi) and section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA, as amended by the Energy Policy Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed revisions of ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A) are no less stringent than the requirements of section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA, and approves them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(i), Determination of probable hydrologic consequences. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(i) that provides funding under SOAP for the costs of the determination of probable hydrologic consequences required by ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A), including the engineering analyses and designs necessary for the determination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Christiania Bank prepares issue NORWAY'S finance ministry yesterday cleared the way for state-owned Christiania Bank, Norway's second-biggest bank, to be partially privatised. The ministry also said it expected Den norske Bank, the biggest bank, to make a public offering of shares. Earlier this year, the ministry indicated that it would dispose of at least part of its shareholding. However, yesterday it said an issue of new shares, which would dilute the state's stake, was more likely. 'Christiania has now been given the clear signal to prepare a major issue of new shares which can take place either late this year or early next year,' the ministry said. Mr Ole Kristian Udnes, Christiania's chief financial officer, said he welcomed the state's decision to approve a public offering rather than a state sell-off. 'Our feeling is that the market is positive towards a share issue and various market players have expressed interest in Scandinavian bank shares in general,' Mr Udnes said. He added that Christiania hoped to disclose details of the offering on November 4, when the bank's third-quarter result is due to be published, or shortly afterwards. Domestic banking industry sources expected Christiania's issue to be launched in two steps to test market conditions. DnB, which is 69 per cent owned by the state, said that it hoped to disclose details of a possible share issue on October 26, when the bank will publish its third-quarter figures. However, DnB is not expected to launch a share offering until 1994 and it is likely to be smaller than Christiania's. Christiania Bank and DnB returned to profit in the first half after several successive years of losses. DnB then said it did not need to call on a NKr600m (Dollars 85.7m) state guarantee. On the Oslo bourse, DnB's A-shares yesterday closed NKr0.20 higher at NKr18.60.</p>

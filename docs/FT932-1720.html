			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (24): The never-ending quest for quality - Management / Charles Batchelor on why the new BS5750 standard is vital to commercial success IMPLEMENTING QUALITY THROUGH BS5750 (ISO 9000) by Peter Jackson and David Ashton Kogan Page Pounds 25, 226 pages WE MAY NOT know exactly what we mean by quality but few would argue with the premise that is a good thing. Britain, with the poor reputation many of its products acquired during in the 1960s and 1970s, is surely in need of it more than most. How can we explain, then, the controversy which has arisen over BS5750, a quality management standard which has been adopted by some 20,000 UK companies? (And overseas, in its international equivalent ISO9000, by several thousand more.) BS5750 has been criticised for being expensive, bureaucratic and not actually guaranteeing product or service quality. Small businesses in particular have complained that their large customers are using BS5750 as a crude mechanism for discriminating against suppliers. Large companies are increasingly demanding that all their suppliers meet BS5750 even if they have previously had no complaints about the quality of deliveries. Part of the problem is due to the inevitable pains of moving from the informal quality systems present in many small firms to the more formal procedures required by BS5750. There is also no doubt that the British Standards Institution could have done a better job of explaining the principles behind the standard. BSI and industry are familiar with narrow, industry-specific standards but 'horizontal' standards, covering issues such as quality and environmental management and relevant across a broad swathe of industry, are a relatively new idea. Implementing Quality does not directly tackle these broader questions, being more concerned with providing practical guidance to companies seeking to register for BS5750. But it inevitably touches on some of the issues which have been raised. There is often a substantial cost involved in obtaining and maintaining registration, but this will normally be exceeded many times by the benefits from holding on to existing customers and winning new ones, the authors state. Gearing up for BS5750 can result in 'culture shock' for businesses used to informal quality controls. The need to record business activities so that mistakes can be traced and corrected may increase the volume of paperwork, though not to an unacceptable degree. Increased formality has its advantages, argue the authors, respectively a manager who has introduced BS5750 and a consultant. Staff will be more willing to accept tighter controls if they know they are part of a coherent quality system and not just the result of managerial whim. Before describing in detail how to implement BS5750, this guide begins with a useful discussion of what is meant by quality. The conventional view is that it represents 'the best' and by implication the most expensive. In fact, quality should mean 'the meeting of customer requirements', whether this is for an expensive watch which enhances the wearer's prestige and lasts a lifetime or for an inexpensive one which keeps accurate time. Quality, in this sense, can be achieved by the many thousands of existing quality and service standards which have been devised over the years. Quality systems go beyond this to ensure that the process of manufacture or service delivery are carried out with maximum efficiency and minimum cost. In the past quality control has consisted of weeding out faulty products at the end of the production line. But this can be costly and in the case of many services - a restaurant meal, legal advice - impossible to check before the customer has discovered the fault. Quality systems, by contrast, analyse the process by which a product is made or service delivered, identify the correct methods and attempt to systematise them. Faulty procedures are detected and designed out of the system. An example quoted is of a company which had continual problems with a new plating machine. The consultants found that each new shift was re-adjusting the machine because operators had misunderstood their original operating instructions. A manual setting down the correct adjustment would have eliminated this sort of misunderstanding. For the businessman considering registering for BS5750 this book provides a valuable guide, clarifying the sometimes confusing detail of the standard. When BS5750 first came to prominence, business owners asked themselves whether they could afford to have it. Increasingly they are having to decide whether they can afford not to have it.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPRESSING SOME ROQ-SOLID POSITIONS  </P> <P> It doesn't take a genius to figure out why KROQ has been slipping in the  ratings. Reeb acknowledges the deejays' talkiness, but he neglects to mention  problems such as a skewed format that sounds like "New Wave Oldies" on the  weekend and "talk radio" during the week.  </P> <P> While in London recently, I heard some great music on the air and in the clubs  -- the kind of music that used to find its way onto KROQ in its "hip" days. Of  course, the present management would rather play the Rolling Stones than try  something new. It is unfortunate that the accountants and time salesmen who  make up most of L.A.'s radio station managements insist on copying each other.  </P> <P> BILL BAUER  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

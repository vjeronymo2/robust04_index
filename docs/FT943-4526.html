			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Overseas sales help Bluebird to Pounds 7.2m Bluebird Toys, maker of Polly Pocket and Mighty Max, more than trebled interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.99m to Pounds 7.19m and declared its first interim dividend. Turnover for the six months to June 30 increased from Pounds 23.7m to Pounds 40.7m. Overseas sales soared 84 per cent to Pounds 28.7m and UK sales improved by 49 per cent to Pounds 12m. Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, said he was particularly pleased with the UK performance, as the overall market had been flat. 'We have also improved our seasonality, which is magic in the toy industry,' he said. The volume of business in the first half rose by five percentage points to 40 per cent, helped by the increasing popularity of the group's ranges overseas. It now sells to 70 countries. The Polly Pocket range of miniature dolls, now in its fifth year, accounted for 57 per cent of turnover. The company, which graduated to the main market in July, expects to establish the range as a permanent brand. It is already listed as a core brand by Mattel, the US toy group, which is Bluebird's biggest overseas distributor. Sales of Mighty Max, a pocket toy based on a mild horror theme, were 40 per cent ahead in the UK in its second year. This week the BBC started to show a TV series, already broadcast in the US, based on the character. Mr Norman said the company was bringing out a new range next year, and had several other ranges in the long-term pipeline. 'We have a strong balance sheet, a lot of cash in the bank and an enhanced development programme.' Net interest payable fell from Pounds 591,000 to Pounds 198,000, and the company expects to be interest positive in the second half. Fully diluted earnings per share were 10.3p (3.7p), and aninterim dividend of 2p will be paid.</p>

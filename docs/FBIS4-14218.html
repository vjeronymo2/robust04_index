			<p>BFN     [Text] Brigadier General Doron Almog, the commander of the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in the Gaza Strip, met today with  Muhsin Abu-'Ayta, one of the senior Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] officials in the Gaza Strip. The meeting was also  attended by the adviser on Arab affairs at the Gaza Civil  Administration.    Several issues were raised at the meeting, including the  agreement between Fatah and Hamas and the latter's position  toward the Palestinian autonomy.    Brig. Gen. Almog stressed that the IDF would continue to  fight against Hamas while Abu-'Ayta, for his part, asserted that  the agreement between Hamas and Fatah was an internal agreement  which did not relate to political matters.</p>

After being stripped of the post of ambassador, Filkus was  expelled from the then ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) and entered the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (ADSR),  headed by the former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko.    Professor Rudolf Filkus was born on September 2, 1927 in  Bratislava. After graduating from the School of Economics he  worked for 20 years in the Economy Institute of the Slovak  Academy of Sciences, which he had to leave for political  reasons. In 1972-1989 he worked in the Price Research Institute  and the National Economy Central Institute. In 1990, after the  fall of communism in the country, he returned to the Economy  Institute.    From January to June 1990, Filkus was a deputy to the House  of the People of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, elected for  the Public Against Violence (VPN) movement. From August 1990 to  May 1991 he held the post of minister for economic strategy.  After the split of the VPN he joined the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and between July 1991 and March 1993  he chaired the HZDS Council. From June to December 1992 he was  an HZDS deputy to the Federal parliament's House of the People.  From July to December 1992 he was the first vice-premier of the  Czechoslovak Government, (proposed by the HZDS), and minister in  charge of the management of the Federal Inspection Ministry.    In March 1993 Filkus was appointed Slovak ambassador to  Austria. On August 24 he was dismissed from the post at the  initiative of then Premier Vladimir Meciar for what Meciar  called "repeated unloyal behavior toward the executive body of  state power". Filkus handed his resignation from the post to  President Michal Kovac on September 13, saying he did not want  to nourish the tension between Kovac and Meciar.    On September 22, the authorized HZDS district body decided  on  Filkus's expulsion from the movement. In November 1993 Filkus  entered the ADSR and soon became its deputy chairman.</p>

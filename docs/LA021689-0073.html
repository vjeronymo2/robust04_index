			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMOMA RESIDENTS, OFFICIALS SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO GANGS  </P> <P> Many people had war stories to share.  </P> <P> Eartha Vernon said her brother was killed in a gang shooting and her  South-Central Los Angeles neighborhood was an open supermarket for drugs.  </P> <P> Now, she said, a lot of the drug trade has moved to other areas -- partially  because her community banded together and pushed drug sellers out. Vernon, a  former Pomona resident, said the parents of gang members united to reclaim the  neighborhood. The parents became more aware of who gang members were, reported  drug dealings to authorities and refused to remain confined to their homes out  of fear.  </P> <P> Vernon is a member of Concerned Parents of South-Central Los Angeles, one of  several groups that attended a conference in Pomona last week on gangs.  Sponsored by the CPC Horizon Hospital in Pomona, the four-hour program included  representatives from the clergy, police, and probation, social service and  community agencies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not the Solution'  </P> <P> "Law enforcement has to take the lead in guiding the community, but we are not  the solution," said Pomona Police Chief Richard Tefank. "The solution is the  community and working together."  </P> <P> Tefank discussed the history of Pomona's traditional Latino gangs and the rise  of entrepreneurial black gangs that market cocaine. He cited several groups  that could work work together to fight gang violence, including parents, the  county corrections and probation departments, the judicial system and members  of the clergy.  </P> <P> "Individual people have to say, 'This is what I can do,' " Tefank said.  </P> <P> Police Capt. Jack Blair suggested that more churches focus on gang problems in  Pomona. "We have to understand how desperate (youngsters) are," Blair said.  "Most of the kids join them for protection. Many of them have no role models."  </P> <P> If there is someone to look up to, it is usually not a good influence, said Leo  Cortez of the Special Gangs Unit of the Los Angeles County Probation  Department.  </P> <P> "I talk to youngsters, 8- or 9-year-olds, and they are angry kids, like  robots," Cortez said. "Their parents and brothers tell them not to like the  other kids. A lot of the kids are being brainwashed since they were small."  </P> <P> Several Christian groups at the conference outlined programs and plans to keep  kids out of gangs.  </P> <P> Members of Teen Outreach, a Pomona Christian community group, and Victory  Outreach-Pomona Valley, a church and Christian service group, said they will  continue to counsel gang members. Sister Leticia Gomez, who heads Concerned  Parents of Pomona, suggested a community "love walk" down 12th Street -- the  domain of many Latino gang members. In the past year, Gomez has been working  with the Concerned Parents chapters of South-Central and East Los Angeles,  sharing their experiences with Pomona families.  </P> <P> Ted Burnett of Pomona Open Door, a nonprofit organization that offers alcohol,  drug and family counseling, said Pomona had a "fear of coming together" on the  gang problem.  </P> <P> "They (gangs) are well-organized, we are not," he said. "They have superseded  us by a couple of years. But we can catch up, we can make a move."  </P> <P> Vernon called the gang problems an epidemic. "I'm interested in the problem,"  she said while passing out Concerned Parents brochures, "I used to live here in  Pomona, so I know the problems."  </P></p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Lean years after the harvest: The Names' response to Lloyd's business plan Mr Ronnie Todd-Young was too busy yesterday afternoon to watch the countryside as he travelled by train to Chablis in northern France. As a member of Lloyd's, who underwrites just over Pounds 1m a year, he was meticulously reading the first business plan from the London insurance market. Like thousands of others, Mr Todd-Young was looking for signs of hope to counter the prospect of ever-increasing losses and demands for money which are forcing many Names - the individuals whose personal assets back the market - into financial hardship. Mr Todd-Young, 58 and semi-retired, combines his professional interest in wine with membership of Lloyd's. He is also an organiser for the Tunbridge Wells area of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the body which represents several thousand of the 19,642 active Names. After making steady profits during the early 1980s, he has now had three bad years as the market plunged into loss. 'I saw it as a way of making my capital work harder, and it paid for my children's education,' he says. 'Now I'm having to pay it all back.' During 1988 and 1989 when Lloyd's lost more than Pounds 2.5bn in total, Mr Todd-Young paid out about Pounds 100,000. This year, the market is bracing itself for a further record loss of more than Pounds 2.5bn for 1990 (Lloyd's reports its results three years in arrears). Mr Todd-Young is expecting another loss of more than Pounds 100,000. He managed to pay his 1988 and 1989 losses from cash. Now he has started selling shares. 'The old treasure box will be empty at the end of the year,' he says. After skimming the business plan, he said: 'The main shock was to see what the top management thought the global loss would be. For 1991 there will be another loss of over Pounds 1bn. It's rather bloody worrying. My concern is that it all seems to get worse. You lose confidence in what we're being told.' Faith in the competence of the market's professionals and managers is one of the main issues addressed in the 70-page business plan launched on Thursday by Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, and Mr David Rowland, its chairman. It contains a glimmer of hope for the most hard-hit Names. In his introduction to the report, Mr Rowland says Lloyd's is prepared to make 'a modest contribution' to a settlement of the legal disputes dogging the market if this is 'demonstrably to the net benefit of the Society as a whole'. Talks to achieve a deal will continue. There is rather better news for Names less badly affected. The plan will make it easier for those continuing to trade to pay any future losses. A scheme to isolate many billions of pounds in old liabilities from US asbestos and pollution claims should eventually allow the market to contain these problems. As a result, Names who are members of syndicates with 'open years' - where the uncertainty of future claims means syndicate managers are unable to close accounts - would be able to leave. For those who remain, radical reorganisation and cost-cutting offer the prospect of potentially attractive profits. But the reaction of Names has so far been muted. Lloyd's sense of realism is generally welcomed but views range from despair to subdued optimism. In West Sussex, news of the plan on Thursday's BBC Radio 4's Today programme did little to lighten the gloom surrounding Mr Richard Godden. In common with a sizeable group of other Names nearby, he was recruited to Lloyd's in the mid-1980s through the Gooda and Partners agency, whose owner, Mr Tony Gooda, lives in nearby Coneyhurst. The experience has been a grim one. Gooda &amp; Partners has gone out of business, and the Gooda Walker syndicates into which it placed many of its Names have lost nearly Pounds 1bn. Mr Godden faces losses of nearly Pounds 600,000, which he says he is unable to pay. What he finds most worrying is Lloyd's decision in the business plan to lift a moratorium on legal action against Names who are refusing to pay. 'I'm just waiting to be served with a writ in a week's time,' he says. 'The plan is all very well for people who are staying in. It is no good at all for those people who have been ruined. I think Lloyd's is certainly doing more, but it has an awful long way to go.' Mr Godden, a retired local magistrate, is taking legal action against his agents. 'The way we have been treated by some of these people was much worse than the people who come up before me,' he says. The business plan reassures Names that it will not issue 'blanket writs' against those who have not been able, or have refused, to meet demands for cash. But its moratorium on issuing individual writs - which Mr Middleton temporarily introduced two months after his appointment in September - will be lifted at the end of this month. That makes little difference to Mr Godden. He is a member of the 2,000-strong Gooda Walker Action Group, through which Names are suing their agents for negligence in the biggest legal action at the market. Writs have been served and the case will come to court in 1994. Mr Godden is also supporting a smaller case, backed by the Writs Response Group, another alliance of loss-making Names. 'Frankly, I'm fighting and resisting all I can,' he says. 'It is making life a perfect misery for people like me. The worst thing is that we've been tricked and deceived.' Ms Fernanda Herford, another Gooda Name, is similarly dismissive of the business plan - although she says she was braced for worse news. 'It is a damp squib, but I thought they'd ditch us more blatantly,' she says, referring to the failure to provide any rescue plan for hard-hit Names. 'I thought they would be more ruthless with us.' Ms Herford joined Lloyd's in 1978 and expects to lose nearly Pounds 800,000, nearly eight times the amount she needed to deposit with Lloyd's to underwrite. 'It is endless. I'm blown out of the water. I've ceased to care, I'm so over the top,' she says. Even her efforts to raise cash to meet claims have backfired. By selling shares to pay early losses of Pounds 200,000, she has been left with a big bill for capital gains tax. She has been earning an income by letting out rooms in her Chelsea home as bed and breakfast accommodation for tourists. At the same time, she has begun to campaign on behalf of other badly hit Names concentrated on the so-called 'spiral' syndicates - those which provided reinsurance against large-scale losses for other Lloyd's syndicates. 'If I knew then what I know now I wouldn't touch (Lloyd's) with a bargepole,' she says. That view is shared by Alexander and Jessie Munn, who joined Lloyd's in the mid-1980s. The couple is waiting to hear the details of the plan, although they heard the outline on the radio news. 'It sounds as though we have been set adrift,' says Mr Munn. '(Lloyd's) permeates your every day,' he says. 'It's difficult to get anything else done. You're told to pay up and shut up. But many people have paid everything they can pay. When I joined in 1986 I thought I was going into an honourable institution. I have discovered that I have become involved in a cesspit of dishonesty.' Mr Clive Francis is angrier still. He made his money in property development and lost it all on syndicates at Lloyd's - including those managed by the Gooda Walker and Pulbrook agencies. He has little time for the new business plan. 'After all the gestation of an elephant, it produced a mouse. This is Peter Middleton's mouse,' he says. 'The report is tantamount to admitting fraud, failure to regulate and incompetence in the past. But reformation without restitution will fail. I have been hearing calls for an extraordinary general meeting. People are saying we will just not accept being tossed overboard.' The reaction is not surprising from Names who feel embittered about their huge losses. But even Names less badly hit are cautious in their welcome for change. Mr Todd-Young, for example, is a member of a number of syndicates which have 'open years'. Although he approves of the business plan's proposal to set up a scheme to isolate many of these old liabilities, he is worried about the cost. Some Names could be asked to pay more money if Lloyd's finds their syndicates provided insufficient in reserves in the past. 'If we are asked to pay even more money, I'm not sure where it is going to come from,' says Mr Todd-Young. He is also worried about the impact of legal action on Names who are not involved at first-hand in litigation. 'The worst-hit Names are saying you have got to help us. I'm saying I haven't got any money to pay my own losses. I don't want to be accused of wanting to push the mortally wounded off the boat, but litigation is a big worry.' Rear-Admiral Nicholas Goodhart, who has retired to Craddock in Devon, says Lloyd's is doing the best that can reasonably be expected. He applauds the criticism of past mistakes and praises the market's intentions to reduce costs. 'Some of the agents have done a valuable job. But, by Jove, they have paid themselves for it,' he says. A Name since 1978, underwriting Pounds 750,000 a year, Rear-Admiral Goodhart has been hit by losses in 1988 and 1989, which have been aggravated because of his membership of the Feltrim syndicates - which, like Gooda Walker, specialised in 'spiral' reinsurance. 'Provided all the insiders don't take all the profits and leave all the losses to the Names there is no reason why they shouldn't be profitable,' he says. Even so he admits, 'I'd be better not to have joined. The losses have caused a certain amount of worry. Our horns have been drawn in.' Even the optimistic Names temper their reponse to the business plan with concern about the market's recent rgulatory and management failures. Sir Hugh Bidwell, the former Lord Mayor of London, and a Name at Lloyd's since 1986, is enthusiastic about the business plan, but says: 'So much of it is sheer common-sense. It unbelievable that Lloyd's has been allowed to operate without a central plan.' Sir Hugh, who has reduced his commitment to the market to Pounds 450,000 after suffering big losses in 1989 and 1990, says that he 'can't wait' to increase his participation again. Even so he warns: 'One shouldn't underestimate the problems. It is only the first rung on the ladder and it is a slippery ladder to climb.' MAIN AIMS OF THE LLOYD'S BUSINESS PLAN Names to get a 40 per cent pre-tax return 20 per cent pre-tax return for incorporated Names Cut cost base by at least Pounds 190m 'Ring-fence' to be created to protect new capital from old-year liabilities Continue negotiations to settle legal disputes More independent regulation Reduce managing agency fees Establish central unit to carry out member agents' administrative functions by 1994 Introduce Mapas (member agents pooling arrangements) to underwrite with 25 per cent deposit; Admit incorporated capital for 1994 Introduce 'high-liquidity Names' with liquid assets of Pounds 500,000 or more and 20 per cent deposit End restriction on Pounds 3m upper premium income limit Include US dollar securities as acceptable Names' deposit</p>

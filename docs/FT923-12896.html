			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Fujimori and military in awkward embrace: The problems and politics of the Peruvian president AN unprecedented 'ceremony of institutional unity', held last week by Peru's army top brass, has raised the first serious doubts about the solidity of armed forces backing for President Alberto Fujimori's de facto regime. The flamboyant event involved some 2,000 army officers from all over the country and seemed to have been intended to provoke similar demonstrations of unquestioning loyalty by navy, air force and police. So far these have failed to materialise. On the surface, the parade and speechifying were a robust response to an interview given in Europe by Mr Mario Vargas Llosa, the internationally renowned Peruvian novelist who was defeated by Mr Fujimori in the last presidential election. His suggestion that Latin America would be better off without its armed forces unleashed a hail of abuse from the Peruvian army's supreme commander, who accused him of 'sickly anti-militarism' and of 'being a Peruvian only by geographical accident'. Along the way, army support for Mr Fujimori's suspension of the constitution on April 5 was roundly reiterated. Mr Vargas Llosa carries no political weight in Peru today so one must look for the hidden agenda behind the attack. The show of unity, admit even sources close to Mr Fujimori, conceals a potentially damaging discontent in the ranks of Peru's ever-influential armed forces. Their first gripe is about money. Many enthusiastic but ingenuous officers expected immediate financial benefits from the money 'saved' through the disbanding of Congress. But pay levels remain low - generals take home less than the equivalent of Dollars 400 a month, even though Lima is now as expensive as New York - and unprecedented numbers of officers are leaving the services. Most US military assistance remains frozen because of congressional concern in Washington over human rights abuses. Prospects for salary improvements are poor. Mr Carlos Bolona, economy minister, reiterated last week that any public-sector pay rises possible under his stringent fiscal management would follow established priorities - security forces first, then education and health workers. The second concern, at least for the thinking and honest element among the military, is the lack of real progress against subversion and drug-trafficking, Mr Fujimori's double-edged justification for his dissolution of congress in April. 'The recent avalanche of detentions makes it appear there is a counter-subversive strategy,' said one high-ranking naval officer, 'but that's not so. There isn't the political will for it.' Reports from Peru's coca-growing zones, meanwhile, indicate that sectors of the army and police are still involved in 'protecting' drugs aircraft, collecting fees of between Dollars 3,000 and Dollars 5,000 per flight. A further cause for military unease is the continuing - for many, malevolent  -influence of a once-cashiered captain over the president. While Mr Fujimori insists that Mr Vladimiro Montesinos is simply his personal lawyer and one of a number of close advisers, top military and intelligence men attribute extensive powers to this shadowy figure they call 'the phantom of the palace'. Recent wrangling over promotions, where the hand of Mr Montesinos is said to rule, has left an after-taste of bitterness and suspicion with many high-ranking officers. 'We never get to talk directly with the president any more,' complains one. 'Montesinos just comes and gives us the latest news through a half-open door.' There are signs that, as Mr Fujimori draws closer to the military - he has virtually abandoned the government palace to live in the military Pentagonito (little Pentagon) in Lima - support from the de facto regime's other two pillars is starting to be eroded. One prominent entrepreneur, a regular member of the presidential entourage on a series of investment-seeking trips abroad last year, says: 'President Fujimori is becoming more and more isolated from the real world. His increasing authoritarianism is very perturbing.' The reality, however, is that, with international funding and overseas investor interest in abeyance until a return to democracy has been engineered, support from the business community is of little immediate interest to a pragmatic president. 'Peruvian businessmen have always prostituted themselves before who-ever's in power', said one close presidential adviser. 'For a while, they were the darlings - but not any more.' Support on the streets is, too, falling from its initial euphoric levels. A survey by the Lima-based Apoyo polling organisation in late-June showed popular approval for Mr Fujimori at 68 per cent, down eight points in little over two weeks. But the president continues his periodic tongue-lashing of the traditional parties and the media - tactics which usually push his ratings up a few points. News of the collapse of a series of financial institutions linked to the previous government has also been skilfully handled by the presidential psych-ops team to achieve maximum discredit for the opposition Apra party in particular and politicians in general. Diplomatic observers continue to wring their hands at the degree of improvisation which pervades every level of government activity. Hardly a decree is passed, a tax level fixed or an election date finalised than it is retracted within hours. 'The problem is,' explains a rueful presidential adviser, 'that Mr Fujimori knows what he wants but he doesn't know how to get there.'</p>

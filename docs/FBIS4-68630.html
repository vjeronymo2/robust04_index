			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Sotnyk, political scientist ("Intelekt" </F> Agency): "A Union for the Barefoot and the Naked: Some Thoughts  Regarding a Unified Economic Space on the Eve of the New Supreme  Council's First Session"]    [Text] Ukraine's integration into the CIS common market has  long ceased to be a purely economic problem.  Politics--particularly the matter of nationality--has moved to  the head of those items which are urgently important in this  matter. The southeastern part of Ukraine--the Russian-speaking  and Russified portion of our country--has put forth many, many  politicians and politicoes who with wearisome intrusiveness, and  almost daily, have been using the mass media to advise that  Ukraine should quickly join the CIS economic union. The more  ethnically homogeneous western part of Ukraine crosses itself  and draws back from such a prospect, regarding such a union as a  significant step toward the utter loss of independence. And this  is what is interesting: It is not only the obvious  pseudo-pragmatists of the Kuchma-Hrynyov type and not only the  directors of state enterprises who have declared themselves to  be supporters of unconditional integration (read: capitulation),  but also all the leaders of the communists and socialist, whose  positions--as demonstrated by the very recent elections to the  Supreme Council--are quite strong in the Donets Basin, as well  as in the Kharkov, Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk, and other regions....  Under pressure from these "formers," local "referendums" were  held in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts--posing the question of  Ukraine's full-blooded participation in the CIS. And a  predominant majority of the population answered "Yes" to this  question. Also obtaining support was the idea of according the  Russian language the status of a second state language in  Ukraine.    Here it seems that everything is understandable: The  "Russian-speaking population" fears total Ukrainianization  and--thereby--an infringement upon its own rights. Moreover, the  transparency of the borders ensures--as everybody knows--more  freedom in the movement of persons and goods, a factor which is  particularly urgent for the inhabitants of those territories  adjacent to Russia. The paradox lies in something else: The  communists and socialist, who regard Ukraine as some kind of  temporary, unreliable creation, yearn with all their hearts to  shelter themselves under the wing of Russia--a country which is  now headed by that fighter for a bright, capitalistic future,  that anti-communist No. 1--Boris Yeltsin.    This paradox requires a further, detailed, and profound  study  because it has certainly become clear nowadays that the  underestimation of the national or ethnic factor in politics  could lead to fatal errors, to a transformation of social  tension to national-social tension with all the consequences  which would stem from that.... Something else is likewise clear:  An active, openly shameless formation of a "fifth column" is now  taking place in Ukraine; Yu. Meshkov and his team have emerged  as the colossal stimulators of this process. By taking  absolutely provocatory steps with regard to Kiev, this  pocket-sized Crimean president is testing the strength of the  Ukrainian state every day, and he is disseminating an  anti-Ukrainian attitude. Moreover, by setting this attitude in  motion he is ready to undermine the Crimean Peninsula itself.  Sensing the utter impunity of his own actions, as well as the  utter incapacity of official Kiev to "put its foot down," he  will--perhaps--go as far as he desires. Furthermore, Yu. Meshkov  feels the moral support of the communist, Russian-speaking  leaders of the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, for whom  the "Meshkov experiment" in the Crimea is a model for further  actions. They will not even have to find their own model, but  simply follow--step by step--this little Crimean Napoleon until  Ukraine is smashed to smithereens and "subsequently rejoins the  great, mighty...," and so on and so forth.    The left-wingers marched into the elections under the  slogan:  "Restore the disrupted economic ties with Russia!" One candidate  for the office of deputy from Odessa waged his campaign under  the slogan: "For reunification with Russia, for independence  from anyone who attempts to block this." In order to make this  slogan more substantial, the left-wingers organized meetings in  work collectives and cobbled together some appropriate  resolutions. Amid the pressure of political passions their  slogans sounded like incantations, like a road map for leading  the country out of its economic crisis. They endeavored to  create the illusion among people that Yeltsin and Kravchuk were  about to sign an important document to renew the above-mentioned  ties, and that a new, happy life would begin on the morrow. A  short time ago I asked one such advocate of the "renewal" idea  to cite for me at least one document--a decree of the Supreme  Council, an edict of the president, or a decree of the Cabinet  of Ministers--which would prohibit the ministries or enterprises  from instituting and developing mutually advantageous ties with  any state whatsoever. That person merely shrugged his shoulders.  And what can be said in this regard? Certainly such documents  simply do not exist, but neither Yeltsin nor Kravchuk are to  blame for what happened. Ties were broken by themselves where it  made no economic sense to do so. And they will be renewed where  such a sense manifests itself again--without decrees or edicts.    There are innumerable speculations about Ukraine's  "anti-integrationist" position. All kinds of reproaches are  being poured down on the heads of the national-democrats, as if  they somehow do not want to come to an agreement on resuming  normal relations with the Russians. In point of fact, however,  everything seems both simpler and more complicated. Whereas  Belarus is being called Russia's warehouse, Ukraine is being  called its semi-finished goods annex. Only 15 percent of  Ukrainian industry is operating nowadays to produce finished  goods, i.e., end products. The decline in production within the  Russian Federation, along with the conversion process, has  temporarily jolted Ukraine's entire building and repair complex;  it cannot exist without Russian components. But Russia has lost  interest not only in Ukrainian repair facilities, but also in  its machinery, motor vehicles, coal, and metal. The energy  capacity of Ukraine's manufacturing facilities has been hit hard  by the sharp rise in prices for energy sources, which--in  turn--has led to a precipitous increase in production costs. And  nowadays even those products in which the Russian market is  interested cannot be sold there because they are from 30 to 50  percent more expensive than their foreign counterparts. Add to  this the galloping inflation, the crisis in non-payments, the  decline in trust in the karbovanets--and the picture becomes  relatively complete. In the economies of both Ukraine and Russia  the ball is controlled--first and foremost--by all the  crisis-type processes, and then by the ambitions of the  politicians.    Thus, with regard to the pace of reforms, Ukraine differs  significantly from Russia. Becoming more and more widespread is  an administrative game in accordance with which the ministries  in Kiev pretend that they are directing the enterprises, whereas  the enterprises pretend that they are turning out products.  Hidden unemployment is increasing. Wages are either not being  paid out at all, ot they are being paid in purely token amounts.  The growth of social tension has already produced its first  "eruptions." Meetings and demonstrations, as well as the  picketing of state institutions, have occurred in Kharkov,  Dnepropetrovsk, Lvov, and other Ukrainian cities. The state has  demonstrated its inability not only to adminster state industry,  but also to shore up an effective financial policy. Therefore,  many economists consider that help should come from the  collapsed privatization program. But this would be  extraordinarily difficult to do within the disrupted Ukrainian  political system--the uncertainty concerning the stances to be  taken by the newly elected parliament, the presence of what is  essentially a temporary government, and the decline in the  president's popularity....    The prospects for Ukraine to sign the documents on joining  the CIS economic union are likewise uncertain. Only one thing  can be said without ambiguity: The Belarusian variant will not  work in Ukraine, regardless of who is in power--the  right-wingers or the left-wingers. The key questions of the  union--inclusion within the ruble zone, the abandonment of our  own currency, the conversion of the National Bank of Ukraine  into a branch of the Moscow Bank, the elimination of customs  duties, and other such things--have now evoked an allergic  reaction not only among the national-democrats, but also in most  of our state's population. No less protest has been evoked by  the attempts to issue shares--along with Russia--for several  Ukrainian enterprises, first and foremost, on facilities in the  oil-and-gas complex. In the opinion of serious politicians  (unlike such persons as Kuchma), all these things threaten  Ukraine with a complete loss of sovereignty and its  transformation into one of the non-state provinces of the  federation. And steps in this direction could lead to unforeseen  consequences; they could place this country on the brink of a  civil war. And one will hardly find in Ukraine any political  force which would assume the responsibility for such a  precipitous historical step. Thus, "Meshkovism" has released  deep roots, dreams about some miraculous, communist-sausage  past, and gladdened the hearts of thousands of people in our  marginal country. It is one thing to be gladdened by dreams, but  quite a different matter to take up Kalashnikov automatic  firarms in order to put such dreams into real life. Leonid  Kuchma is the only person who thinks that he can thus "subdue"  Ukraine peacefully without sweeping it away. He is mistaken in  this because certainly the two years of independence were for us  not merely years of mistakes and disillusionments. A new type of  person--a Ukrainian citizen--has come to replace the faceless  owl.    Aside from national-political aspects, the problem of  sharing  a single economic space with Russia also has essentially  practical aspects. Some people are proposing that we integrate  ourselves into the economy of a state which--to put it  mildly--has not demonstrated itself to be a model of prosperity.  It has the same decline in production, the same non-payment  crisis, strikes by miners, along with gradual disintegration of  the oil-and-gas complex, electric-power engineering,  transportation.... What will happen to such an economic space?  What kind of economic union would that be? Perhaps, a union of  the barefoot and the naked.</p>

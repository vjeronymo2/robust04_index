			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (33): Cleaning up, slowing down - Korea / The vigorous anti-corruption campaign being pursued by the new president is likely to delay a full-scale recovery until next year THE ONCE-BOOMING South Korean economy is suffering its slowest period of growth since 1980. The GNP growth rate in 1993 is expected to fall below 5 per cent for a second consecutive year, making Korea one of the worst performers on the Asian mainland. Last year's sluggish economic growth rate of 4.8 per cent resulted from a tight monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation. But economists believe that Korea is on the road to recovery, having hit bottom in the last quarter of 1992 with a dismal growth rate of 2.8 per cent. The government since then has eased monetary controls. Growth has been gradually accelerating, with rates of 3.4 per cent and 4.2 per cent in the first and second quarters respectively. However, the vigorous anti-corruption campaign being pursued by the new president, Mr Kim Young-sam, is likely to delay a full-scale recovery until next year, when the growth rate is expected to exceed 6 per cent. In particular, the president's sudden decision in mid-August to ban the tax dodge of using false names for financial transactions has had an adverse impact on growth. The prohibition on false names strikes at the heart of the country's large underground economy, whose size is estimated to be 20 per cent of GNP. Although the underground economy deprived the government of needed tax revenues, it also played a constructive economic role by providing scarce capital for small businesses and supporting consumer spending. President Kim's programme to root out the underground economy will consequently cause economic disruption in the short-term by reducing domestic demand, which is already weak. Industrial investments have shrunk by 7.2 per cent during the past year after a long period of facility expansion since the mid-1980s that resulted in excess production capacity. The Kim government earlier this year tried to revive industrial investments by cutting interest rates, but to little avail. Sagging domestic consumer demand has convinced most companies that sizeable plant investments are not necessary immediately. Moreover, interest rates are climbing again, with the three-year bond rate reaching 14 per cent. Holders of false-name bank accounts largely financed the informal kerb market that is a main source of credit for small businesses, which have difficulty acquiring bank loans due to a lack of collateral. But the crackdown on false-name accounts has caused a drain of liquidity from the kerb market, resulting in a rising number of bankruptcies among small concerns. Big companies have also had difficulties in raising capital recently as the false-name ban has dampened activity on the bond market. Consumer spending is unlikely to be much help in boosting growth this year. Consumer confidence is weak as the unemployment rate rises to almost 3 per cent, a high figure for Korea. Although the government has succeeded in curbing wage growth in 1993 to around 11 per cent against an average annual rate of 16.4 per cent during the past six years, it also means that consumer purchasing power has shrunk. In addition, the government has been promoting an austerity campaign since 1991 in an attempt to persuade the public to work harder and spend less. The campaign has affected foreign goods in particular since the government regards them as being luxuries. The economic slowdown has had one beneficial effect in that it has curbed the inflation rate to around 5 per cent from a decade-long peak of 9.3 per cent in 1991. Price stability has been supported by weak consumer demand, lower wages and stagnant property prices. But even this achievement is under threat. The government is increasing the money supply to provide small companies with more capital and save them from possible bankruptcy. The one bright spot in Korea's economic picture is an export boom that has been caused by an almost 20 per cent fall of the Korean won against the Japanese yen since the beginning of the year. This has restored price competitiveness to Korean products, which have lost market share abroad in recent years as wages climbed to the highest level on the Asian mainland while productivity lagged behind. Korea has seen recent gains against Japanese competitors in the areas of cars, semiconductors, consumer electronics, shipbuilding, and iron and steel. The trade surplus is likely to post a slight surplus this year after four years of deficits. But the country is still in danger of falling behind foreign competitors, such as Japan and Taiwan, in the global export market, because it has done little to secure cheaper production bases abroad or building international marketing networks. Korea's total direct foreign investment of Dollars 4.9bn represents only 1.6 per cent of GNP, while Taiwan has invested more than 3.5 per cent of its GNP overseas. One reason for Korea's slow investment expansion abroad is that it has suffered current account deficits during most of the past two decades, which has depreciated the value of the Korean won and made it more expensive to invest overseas. Moreover, the government has encouraged companies to invest at home rather than abroad in order to boost economic growth.</p>

The agency's notice also banned  sales of "sets" of domestic rice and imported rice in separate  bags.    It noted the policy is to maintain fair supplies and to  avoid  any hoarding of domestic rice. If domestic rice only is  preferred and purchased, it will be completely consumed before  rice grown this year comes onto the markets, the notice said.    Blended rice will likely be put on the market as early as  next week despite much opposition from consumers and rice  sellers. Consumers say they want to have freedom of choice and  if domestic and imported rice have to be sold in a certain  proportion, then they want to have the rice in separate bags, so  they can cook it in different ways according to the rice type.    Rice sellers say, reflecting such consumers' voices, that  they want to sell separately. Some wholesalers said they also  want to sell "sets" of foreign and domestic rice instead of  blended rice.    The agency plans to organize meetings for consumers and  sellers in order to avoid further confusion, officials said.</p>

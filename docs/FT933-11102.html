			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / IMF approves dollars 98m Belarus credit The IMF has approved a Dollars 98m credit for Belarus under its systemic transformation facility, a new loan fund designed to help the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to make the leap to a market economy, writes George Graham in Washington. The IMF said the money will support an economic programme aiming to cut the monthly rate of inflation from 30 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the year and limit the fall in output to 15 per cent this year. Belarus follows Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Slovakia in drawing on the STF, which offers less strict conditionality than a traditional IMF standby credit agreement.</p>

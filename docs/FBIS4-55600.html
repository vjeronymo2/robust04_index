			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Czech Cabinet ministers held a meeting today.  Ales Hermanek reports.    [Hermanek] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Klaus expressed  his disappointment with regard to the progress of talks on  Russia's debts to the Czech Republic. He said that the  accommodating attitude the Russian prime minister demonstrated  with regard to this problem during Klaus's recent visit to  Russia had not been reflected in concrete deeds by Russian  Government officials. Because the deadline of 30 May, when the  methods of debt repayment were due to be resolved, is  threatened, Prime Minister Klaus plans to telephone Russian  Prime Minister Chernomyrdin on 18 May and agree on further and  more vigorous action with him.</p>

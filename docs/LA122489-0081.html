			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COSBY'S COMMENTS  </P> <P> Cosby complains because his daughter Erinn rejects his philosophy and the  strings attached to it, which include a magnanimous educational opportunity  that, evidently, his other four children readily accept. Apparently Bill's  university degrees haven't helped him much, because even parents in the poorest  straits intuitively give support and love to all their children -- even those  who stray from the mold.  </P> <P> FRANK L.

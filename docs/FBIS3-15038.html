			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Gurevich report: "Don't Believe Anyone But </F> President's Press Service and President Himself"]    [Text] The persistent speculation in the press about  Yeltsin's television appearance still remains only speculation.  It was not planned either for 28 February or 1 March (this  information was available to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS from the  president's press service as this issue was going to print).  The rumor about the appearance must have been raised by  journalists' speculation which presidential aides Baturin and  Satarov did not wish to deny, stating that it was "not far from  the truth." In principle, the above aides could have said  nothing at all because, as Yeltsin's press service officers  stated to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, all official communiques about  Yeltsin's addresses are supposed to come from it. Well, and --  certainly -- from the president himself.</p>

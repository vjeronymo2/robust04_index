			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The Blackmailing of Ion Iliescu"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] and  the Greater Romania Party [PRM] issued statements to the extent  that they are freezing the negotiations with the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] on forming a coalition of the  red pentagonal [five party ruling coalition of PDSR, PSM, PRM,  the Romanian National Unity Party-PUNR, and the Agrarian  Democratic Party of Romania-PDAR]. In a more explicit manner  (PSM) and a more discreet one (PRM), the two members of the  majority coalition let it be understood that they are ready to  question their further backing of the current government in  Parliament. Despite the fact that the two statements are issued  by different persons, they are quite similar. In fact, the  similarity is so striking, that it becomes obvious that we are  dealing here with a concerted action of the two parties, or  better said of the two outstanding Ceausescu apologists in the  respective political groupings: [PSM Vice President] Adrian  Paunescu for the PSM and [PRM President] Corneliu Vadim Tudor  for the PRM. Both texts are dominated by a lyrical style. In  this respect, they are not so much official statements, as  elegies. At least PRM's letter, through its size and sighs, is  reminiscent of Alecu Russo's "Song to Romania." As far as both  PSM and PRM are concerned, the two statements are a good  opportunity for a little demagoguery. In the case of PSM, it is  slightly more temperate. It is quite likely that the text  written by Adrian Paunescu was retouched by the pragmatic  politician Tudor Mohora [PSM vice president]. However, PSM's  letter reaches some unheard of peaks of electoral demagoguery.  The party leadership does not limit itself to stating that it is  freezing the negotiations with the PDSR; it also feels the need  to present, under signature, a picture of the current Romanian  society that smacks of the kind of proletarian cultism that even  Ana Pauker and Iosif Chisinevschi [post-World War II Stalinist  leaders of Romania] would have been ashamed of. The letter  talks about old people scavenging through garbage cans for food,  while the rich are dancing and partying at will. It is obvious  that the initiator and author of the letter forgets that the  paupers he weeps for include the peasants of Butimanu village,  whose land was taken away from them by Corneliu Vadim Tudor.  Likewise, Corneliu Vadim Tudor ignores the fact that he himself  is one of the newly rich, who are spending their time moving  from one binge to another. If it could talk, the rooms of  "Select" restaurant [patronized by PRM officials] would have a  lot to say in this respect.    The two statements also have the same goal in common. Both  the PSM and PRM criticize the PDSR and President Ion Iliescu  because the latter do not take steps against certain people who  are considered as deadly enemies of the two parties. From the  PSM letter we learn that an agreement has been reached with the  PSM to replace [Defense Minister] General Niculae Spiroiu. If  we take into account a previous article by Corneliu Vadim Tudor,  from which we learn that Adrian Paunescu has asked the minister  of national defense not to draft his son for military service,  we immediately realize why a whole party is trying so hard to  overthrow Niculae Spiroiu. The minister of national defense has  pissed off Adrian Paunescu because he did not agree to do the  PSM vice president this service. Something that Adrian Paunescu  was not prepared to tolerate, particularly since the minister of  defense during Ceausescu's reign had acceded to his request not  to draft him in the army. Mind you, this happened at a time  when even Nicu Ceausescu was forced to do his military service.  In its turn, PRM is very mad at Ion Iliescu because he did not  immediately order the arrest of Niculae Spiroiu, Petre Roman  [president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front],  Traian Basescu [former minister of transport and deputy of the  Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)], and Traian  Chebeleu [Ion Iliescu's spokesman]. Not because the latter were  guilty of something, but because they dared to contradict  Corneliu Vadim Tudor. We are obviously dealing here with an  ordinary attempt to blackmail Ion Iliescu. As I said, Adrian  Paunescu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor are behind the two statements.  Two profiteers of the Ceausescu regime, who in the previous  system have become accustomed to having all their absurd whims  satisfied, including the wishes to topple various public people  only because they had at one point had the temerity to stand up  to them. The two statements are a new proof of the huge  proportions to which certain Ceausescu apologists were blown up  in these trouble times.</p>

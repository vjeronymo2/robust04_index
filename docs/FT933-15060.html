			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Evered Bardon Evered Bardon had little choice but to raise fresh equity. Its debt was a burden even before sterling's devaluation inflated the cost of servicing dollar-denominated loans. Disposals were the obvious answer, but for the fact that its most saleable asset - the Civil &amp; Marine dredging business - was valued in the accounts Pounds 60m above current market value. For a company uncomfortably close to breaching its banking covenants, that write-down would have been too much to bear. Even after yesterday's Pounds 72m rights issue and assuming C&amp;M is now sold, Evered Bardon will be perhaps 45 per cent geared. Since it expects to leak cash again this year and be at best cash neutral next, debt might yet nose higher again. Having relaxed its covenants, there is little immediate danger from the banks. But neither has management an entirely free hand. That might not matter if it could promise a speedy profits recovery from the existing businesses. While the prospects in the US are encouraging, there is scope for disappointment in the UK - especially if the government's road building programme falls victim to the November Budget. On that basis, the rights issue looks more like a running repair rather than a thorough overhaul of the balance sheet. Evered Bardon's assets might be worth more to an owner with the financial muscle to solve its problems once and for all.</p>

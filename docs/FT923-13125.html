			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Doubts raised on IMF deal with Russians THE International Monetary Fund is likely to fail to conclude a standby agreement with Russia because of a continuing lack of monetary control by Moscow, international economists said yesterday. The economists, mostly American, in Moscow this week for talks with ministers, were told yesterday the budget deficit amounted to 20 per cent of gross national product. This is roughly the same deficit as that run by of the Soviet government last year before the collapse of the Union. At the same time, private forecasts by government officials point to Russia's inability to reduce significantly the deficit by the year end - despite a pledge to the IMF that the deficit, net of all foreign assistance or loans, will be brought down to 5 per cent by December. This commitment, together with a promise to bring down inflation to 9-10 per cent a month, was a condition of the granting of a first tranche of Dollars 1bn from the total proposed loan of Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.5bn). Economic policy makers in the west are discussing how western financial aid can be continued without an IMF 'seal of approval' on Russian economic reform. There remains strong political pressure in the west, though not in Japan, to help Russia financially. But until now, the official position has been that the IMF must take the lead. Mr John Williamson of the Institute of International Economics in Washington said that, given the figures on the deficit, 'the chances of the rest of the IMF loan going through are very slight. In fact I would think it was wrong of the IMF to lend money in face of what is now happening.' Prof Richard Cooper of Harvard University said: 'I think after hearing these figures it must be unlikely that you get an agreement now.' But Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, the senior government official in charge of negotiations with the IMF, said: 'I would agree it would be unlikely if these figures continued to be so bad. However, we have a good, tough budget and I think we can stick to it and get the figures we agreed with the IMF.' Mr Kagalovsky said the major problem was that of defining the 'rouble zone' of former Soviet republics which will continue to use the rouble, against those which decide to introduce their own currency. Mr Kagalovsky said: 'We would be happy to see any country stay in the rouble zone, but if they do they must follow the policy, produced in Moscow, by the (Russian) Central Bank'. In recent months, other republics, especially Ukraine, have created large amounts of new rouble credits for enterprises, which the Russian central bank must honour. Discussions on defining and disciplining the rouble zone are under way within the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Trustees silent on plan for gallery The trustees of the National Gallery of Scotland declined to comment last night after meeting to discuss a controversial plan to create a new gallery of Scottish art in Glasgow. This would entail closing the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. The plan has aroused considerable opposition. This week the government told the House of Lords that it had the final say on the issue, which could require legislation. It suggested that the trustees were 'putting the cart before the horse' in deciding to go ahead with the project and choosing its location without formally submitting its plans to the government. Before the meeting Mr Angus Grossart, chairman of the trustees, said they would be 'progressing' their formal submission.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Graseby to raise Dollars 25m via US flotation GRASEBY, the environmental monitoring and medical equipment company, yesterday said it will float its environmental business in the US on Nasdaq, raising about Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) but retaining control. The move is designed to strengthen the balance sheet by reducing debt, which will allow the group to finance further growth of its environmental and product monitoring and its medical businesses. The company also announced yesterday a sharp drop in profits before tax from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 1m for 1992, but the dividend is held at 10.9p, with a final of 7.6p. The company said that further development had been hampered not only by high debt, but also by the level of the above average dividend pay-out, a hangover from the days when Cambridge Electronics - Graseby before the name change - was rated as a yield stock. The newly floated company, Graseby Andersen, will not pay a dividend, putting some pressure on the parent to meet its dividend bill. Earnings per share fell from 8.7p to 1.3p, after an above - the - line Pounds 1.5m profit on the sale of properties and a loss of Pounds 5.8m on sale and disclosure of discontinued operations. This was in line with the new FRS 3 standard. Sales fell from Pounds 109.1m to Pounds 102.6m, and operating profit on continuing operations was Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 12.4m). Operationally the medical, instruments and environmental businesses performed well, but defence profits fell from Pounds 6m to Pounds 300,000. Graseby Andersen had sales of Dollars 39m and operating profits of Dollars 4.7m in 1992. It will be floated with Graseby Specac, the optical company. Mr John Jackson, Graseby chairman, said the flotation would solve the balance sheet problems and would also increase motivation for the US management. Graseby Andersen should benefit from changes to the US environmental programme once the Clinton administration settles down. Because of a lack of distributable reserves in the US, the former Tace businesses - broadly the Graseby Andersen business being floated - was not paying dividends to the group.</p>

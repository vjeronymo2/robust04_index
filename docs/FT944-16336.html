			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Portugal sets sights on China Portugal could export more transport, electrical and telecommunications equipment to China and could even receive an order to build ships for Beijing, Portuguese Trade and Tourism Minister, Mr Fernando Faria de Oliveira said yesterday. He added that there was potential for exports of railway carriages, electricity generating equipment, electrical and telecommunications cables and digital telephone exchanges. The minister also said China had expressed interest in building a toy factory in Portugal to get round European Union import quotas on Chinese toys. Portugal runs a heavy trade deficit with China, to which it has traditionally exported modest quantities of tomato paste and wood pulp.</p>

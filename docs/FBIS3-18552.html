			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara, Mar. 3 (A.A.) -- State minister and  government spokesman Yildirim Aktuna said today that the  decision of Parliament to remove the political immunity of seven  members of the Democracy Party (DEP) has eased the public  conscience.    In a written statement, Aktuna said the important thing at  this moment is to prevent certain DEP deputies from using their  immunity as a shield and to pave way for independent justice.    Parliament removed the immunity of six DEP members Wednesday  [3 March] and is set to remove the immunity of another three  today.    "The members of Parliament will certainly act in line with  the people's will," he said. "Certain DEP members had recently  intensified their actions against the unity of the country."    He added that a recent statement of Hatip Dicle, who  described the killing of five military cadets and the injuring  of 26 by a separatist terrorist organization as "a normal action  in war" had created deep resentment in society.    Aktuna added that the March 27 local polls will be conducted  in a safe atmosphere.    The DEP, which held 13 seats in the 450-seat Parliament  announced a week ago that it was withdrawing from the polls.</p>

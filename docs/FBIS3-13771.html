			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Zayn al-Ja'fari: "Slogans Will Not Help </F> Resolve the Arab-Israeli Conflict"]    [Text] One of the issues over which no one has any doubt,  even for one moment, is that every family in the Arab and  Islamic worlds was shocked at the bestial and inhuman massacre  of the Palestinian Muslims while they were performing their dawn  prayers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Undoubtedly, this  massacre also saddened us greatly. It made some voices in the  Arab world ask Egypt in particular to take violent measures in  response to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This request is  based on Egypt's status and importance in the Arab and Islamic  worlds. Some went as far as asking that the negotiations  between the Palestinians and Israelis be halted.    However, we wish to calmly clarify to those who made these  demands that by doing so, we would be serving the interests of  Israel itself. It would be better for them to ask the Arabs and  Muslims to exert greater efforts to rally the support of  international public opinion for the Arab cause and put pressure  on Israel to provide full protection for the defenseless  Palestinian people and the sacred Muslim and Christian shrines  in Palestine equally, especially in light of the Security  Council's hesitation to pass a resolution condemning this  massacre and confirming the need to protect the Palestinians.  These voices would fare better if they realize that exploiting  this massacre to thwart the peace process only serves to stir up  emotions, incite the masses, and repeat those slogans that  through experience have proven to lead to nothing except further  losses for the Arab side in its struggle with Israel.    We wish to confirm that Egypt and its political leadership  are fully convinced of the usefulness and inevitability of peace  and that ever since the peace process started, Israel has been  trying to escape from the peace siege. Those who have been  following the Egyptian stance since the state of Israel was  created realize that the Egyptian stance is firm and that Egypt  moves in all directions to retrieve Arab rights. Egypt has  waged many long wars for this purpose, the last of which was the  1973 war. Egypt's efforts did not stop for one instant. For  this purpose, Egypt participates in the other Arab efforts that  move in the same direction, particularly since recent  international developments have affirmed without a shadow of a  doubt that usurped Arab rights cannot be retrieved except with  solidarity and coordination among Arab capitals. Such  solidarity and coordination has become an urgent need now,  especially since Israel is trying to break free from the peace  siege. Proof of this is the Israeli Government's stance on the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Although some Israeli officials  condemned this massacre, the essence of Israeli policy toward  the settlers and settlements has not changed. Israel depends on  two things to continue this policy. The first is that the  international community is not yet ready to take decisive  measures against Israel; the Security Council's stand is the  prime example of this. The second is that the American stand  encourages Israel to continue ignoring Arab rights; U.S.  President Bill Clinton's statement provided the necessary  evidence of this point. He declared his recognition of  Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel at a time when the  blood of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque martyrs had not yet dried.    Egypt has proceeded to reject all measures taken by Israel  on  Jerusalem after June 1967. Egypt considers these measures null  and void. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa's statement that Jerusalem  is part of the occupied territories was a response to the U.S.  President's statement. He described President Clinton's  statement as a political and tactical statement.    In light of all this, the importance of proceeding with the  peace process becomes clear. Inciting the people and provoking  their feelings will not help resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>

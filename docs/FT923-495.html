			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / International Company News: Italian insurer prepares privatisation policy - Lorenzo Pallesi, chairman of Ina, tells Haig Simonian about plans for the state sell-off of his group Topping virtually every list of Italian privatisation candidates is Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni (Ina), one of the country's biggest and best known insurance companies. Ina's main business is life insurance, in which it ranks second to Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, on a group basis, and counts as the largest operator as an individual company. Through Assitalia, its quoted subsidiary, it also offers non-life policies, while it owns 20.25 per cent of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the big treasury-controlled bank, and 9.27 per cent of Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), the Rome-based financial services group. Total premiums amounted to L5,400bn last year, with L2,200bn stemming from directly written life business and a similar amount from Assitalia, while net profits were L19.9bn. Misunderstandings about premiums and earnings indicate how much preparatory work is necessary before Ina can sell its shares to the public. About L900bn of its total premiums stem from cessations from other life insurance companies, under a complex system dating back to Ina's foundation in 1912. Although conceived as a state monopoly, similar to those in tobacco and electricity generation, the idea never got off the ground. After 1918, when big Trieste-based insurers such as Generali and Riunione d'Adriatica di Sicurta came under Italian sovereignty, a looser alternative was chosen. In 1922, Mussolini imposed a sliding scale of quotas, obliging life insurers to cede part of their business to Ina. From 40 per cent of all premiums in the first decade, the quota fell in stages to a permanent floor of 10 per cent after 30 years. That system underscored Italian life insurance until just six years ago, when reforms were passed in line with planned European Community legislation, with compulsory transfers being phased out by 1994. Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, Ina's chairman, explains: 'The aim was to guarantee market stability and avoid damage to policy-holders if a company collapsed. Although seeming unfair, the system was very attractive for all concerned.' The sliding scale closed the Italian market to new entrants, put off by the fact that they would only receive premiums on 60 per cent of their business, while established rivals might already be down to the 10 per cent quota. 'It was cosy for everyone. The established companies kept out rivals, while Ina enjoyed guaranteed growth at market rates thanks to an automatic stream of business'. Changing the requirement to cede premiums to Ina will be one of the steps needed before privatisation. Mr Pallesi hopes Italian insurers will follow other European markets and opt for self-regulation. Ina's earnings are also deceptive. Superficially, last year's figure seems paltry for a company of its size in a business where profitability is normally high for big, mature players. However, the final result masks a variety of factors. Foremost is the L303bn paid in the special advance property tax, sprung on the industry last year. Rather than amortising the amount over three years, as permitted under law, Ina took the entire payment on its 1991 accounts. Other factors explain the relatively modest net earnings of previous years. 'The state never saw Ina as a source of income,' says Mr Pallesi. 'As a special form of state-owned company, it never had annual general meetings or even shareholders. And it never paid dividends.' As there was no need to distribute earnings - largely derived from tax-exempt government bonds - Ina traditionally shifted a large part of profits into reserves to minimise its tax bill. 'Our solvency margin is between 4 1/2 and five times that required by law,' he says. Only when facing the property tax in 1991 did the group refrain from ploughing money into special reserves. The second factor affecting profits is Mr Pallesi's policy, introduced in early 1990, of redistributing earnings to policy-holders. Last year, the company credited L135bn into policyholders' accounts, after L115bn in 1990. So far, it is unique among Italian life insurers. Mr Pallesi explains the strategy in marketing terms. 'Policyholders in the UK have many more rights than in Italy. The market there is much more transparent. I believe this will happen in Italy too, and we wanted to be the first.' Taken before redistribution and transfers to reserves, Ina's earnings have been consistently high. Last year, it made L460bn, a figure it hopes to repeat in 1992. Ina's transformation into a joint stock company last month shows changes are already on the way. With the new Italian government scrambling for income, Ina is no longer a special case but a vital source of funds for the Treasury, now its clearly defined shareholder. While Ina looks set to pay the Treasury dividends this year, private investors may have a crack as early as 1993. Merchant banks have already submitted exhaustive privatisation schemes. The most common involves the flotation of a 'new' Ina, owned by the existing group. While the parent company will continue its special functions for the state, such as administering funds for insurance against organised crime and export credits, the 'new' company will comprise the life insurance business and Ina's stake in Assitalia. The principle is clear, even if the details still have to be worked out. 'The question is not if to split, but how,' says Mr Pallesi. Necessary legal changes will take between three and four months, he thinks. And a flotation seems unlikely before certified 1992 accounts are ready by next May or June. With the long summer break ahead, September 1993 looks the first possible date for a stock market debut. How much is Ina worth? Ina's total assets amounted to almost L22,000bn last year. Its holdings include a sizeable property portfolio listed at historic prices. 'Some assets are at one third or a quarter of their market values,' Mr Pallesi claims. He puts a tag of between L10,000bn and L12,000bn on the group, implying L1,000bn to L1,200bn for a first 10 per cent tranche of shares, based on asset values alone. Details of a possible flotation are 'up to our owner', he says. But he makes two clear personal preferences. First, floating an initial stake should be the prelude to the sale of majority control within four years, provided there are guarantees such as a golden share to prevent a change of ownership. The second is to bring existing policyholders into the privatisation process. 'I'd like to see a simultaneous offer to policyholders and the markets, with preferential terms to existing customers based on the size of their current premiums.' With a marketing man's glint in his eye, he adds: 'That way, it would be possible to encourage customers to raise the size of their policies, and reward them at the same time. 'And in the end, it would create a virtuous circle by raising Ina's profitability. It would be the first time privatisation in Italy could be done in a truly entrepreneurial way.'</p>

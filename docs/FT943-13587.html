			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Technology: Japan's People World Saburo Goto hopes that in a few years' time it will become second nature for many of his fellow Japanese - at home and abroad - to use personal computers for buying goods, ordering services such as restaurant tables and even finding out about medical care. In a country where PC use is far lower than in much of the west - Japan has only a third as many PCs per head as the US, though ownership is rising steadily - the race to link homes and businesses to a variety of electronic and multimedia-based services is speeding up. As head of IBM Japan Services Business Company, Goto is involved with the US group's attempt to penetrate the still small local market for PC-based network services, using locally-developed software to cope with the complex Japanese language. With Mitsubishi Corporation, Hitachi and Toshiba, it has set up People World to encourage greater private use of PCs in Japan. The system will be easy to use, says Goto. 'It is not necessarily aimed at professional people but also at housewives and older people.' It will compete with PC-Van (run by NEC, the Japanese electronics group) and NiftyServe (run by an affiliate of Fujitsu computers). By 1999, IBM hopes to have more than 1.5m users of People World. The other services now have about 1.3m between them. People World is working with such providers of content as Hanako, a women's leisure magazine which will offer shopping information about sales and promotions in the Tokyo area. 'That kind of information is very important to improve the standard of living,' believes Goto. 'But equally important is medical information - the older we get, the more we need special services.' Since Japanese hospitals are closed at weekends - except for emergencies - People World will also tell users where to turn to for their unexpected healthcare needs.</p>

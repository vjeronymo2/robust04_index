			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / US rates 'not seen as target for policy': Senior Fed official plays down speculation THE US Federal Reserve does not regard interest rates as a target for monetary policy, but is putting more emphasis on them as an indicator of financial conditions, according to a senior Fed official. 'Some focus on interest rates can help to an extent - possibly reducing the odds of some of the most egregious policy errors - but it is no panacea,' said Mr Donald Kohn, director of the Fed's monetary affairs division. He was attending a monetary symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In testimony to Congress last month, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said the central bank would put more emphasis on real interest rates as a policy guide because traditional relationships between monetary aggregates and inflation and national income had broken down. He said it was important to prevent real rates moving too far from the 'equilibrium level' consistent with sustainable non-inflationary growth. This prompted speculation in financial markets that the Fed was changing the way it conducted policy and was adopting interest rate targets in place of a previous more eclectic policy. In an apparent effort to discourage such speculation, Mr Kohn emphasised the 'pitfalls involved in too heavy a reliance on interest rate indicators'. He noted that capital market innovations that had affected the relationship between money and other economic variables had probably had a similar impact on their relationship with interest rates. Targeting real interest rates could not tie down inflation because 'there is no unique inflation rate' associated with any given equilibrium or natural interest rate. Measurements of real rates, moreover, were complicated by the 'absence of information on inflation expectations'. Finally, equilibrium real rates were themselves likely to fluctuate over time, presenting a moving target for policy makers. Although the difficulties in using real rates were 'formidable' there was a 'potential significant place for them in policy - not as a target of policy but as an information variable'. Mr Kohn's remarks suggested that Mr Greenspan's emphasis on real rates in last month's testimony was mainly intended to prepare the ground for an eventual raising of short-term rates. Most estimates suggest that real rates are about zero at present.</p>

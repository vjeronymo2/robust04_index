			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Zenith Data climbs back into the ring - The French-controlled PC manufacturer could break even this year Tough controls on costs and quality together with a strategic collaboration with Packard Bell are at the heart of a turnround at Zenith Data Systems which suggests the French-owned personal computer manufacturer could break even this year. The company, formerly the computer arm of Zenith Electronics of the US, has been a heavy loss maker since its its acquisition by Groupe Bull of France in 1989. Analysts have attributed a substantial part of Bull's FFr15bn (Dollars 2.64bn) losses over the past three years to problems at the Chicago-based manufacturer, which until recently has been losing money on every personal computer it made. Now that the French government has made it clear that Groupe Bull is to be privatised, the performance of its troubled personal computer arm has assumed a new importance. Mr Jacques Noels, chairman and chief executive since January 1993, says there were three chief areas of concern when he took over. First, quality. Returned systems and repairs cost the company some 20 per cent of its Dollars 1bn revenues last year. Second, the lack of a line of low-cost, entry-level systems. Third, profit-ability. 'Our financials were absolutely catastrophic,' he says without disclosing the level of losses. Mr Noels, 53, took over from Mr Enrico Pesatori, now vice-president of worldwide sales and marketing for Digital Equipment, the US computer manufacturer. Mr Pesatori, also 53, had been brought in from Olivetti in 1991 to restore ZDS's technological and market credibility after Bull ran into problems in the early stages of bedding-in its US acquisition. Mr Pesatori, an expansive and charismatic executive, successfully catalysed the introduction of a new range of high-level personal computer and network servers but departed for Digital before the manufacturing bugs had been ironed out. Mr Noels, quietly-spoken with a fastidious attention to detail, set out on a 'quality overkill' mission. Engineering and manufacturing practices were overhauled in response to information about faults collated by ZDS field staff. ZDS sales people were encouraged to join customers in opening the cartons containing newly delivered systems: 'All sorts of things happen during transportation,' Mr Noels says darkly. The result has been, Mr Noels claims, a drastic improvement. Now the cost of faulty systems is less than 2 per cent of sales. According to a survey carried out in the US by the consultancy J. D. Power &amp; Associates, ZDS now ranks third behind IBM and Apple and just ahead of Compaq in quality. The problem of an entry level PC line was mainly solved by the decision last year to buy a 19.9 per cent stake in Packard Bell of the US, the largest supplier of low-cost personal computers to retail chains such as Sears, Roebuck and Wal-Mart. ZDS and Packard Bell develop and manufacture desk top computers jointly, while ZDS, which made its name in portable computing, provides Packard Bell with notebook computers. According to Mr Noels, the combined purchasing power of ZDS and Packard Bell is equal to that of Compaq. Furthermore, the deal gives ZDS access to 9,000 retail outlets in the US and to Packard Bell expertise in marketing low-cost, low-margin systems. Today, ZDS offers a complete product line from entry-level desktop systems through notebooks and high end networks servers. A line of personal digital assistants is in development. The overall cost of research and development has been cut from 7 per cent of revenues to 2 1/2 per cent through the association with Packard Bell. Overall, sales, general and administrative costs together with research and development expenses have been cut from 35 per cent in the middle of last year to 14 per cent now, helped by a reduction of 200 in the company's 1,700-strong workforce. The results can be seen in the company's results. Revenues are expected to reach Dollars 1.3bn to Dollars 1.4bn this year, about a 30 per cent improvement on the year before. In the first quarter, worldwide sales were 73 per cent on on the corresponding period last year, with especially strong growth seen in North America. The loss was about Dollars 10m on Dollars 300m of sales. Mr Noels aim now is to establish ZDS as a global force in what he describes as 'connected computing', the best way to network together machines from both the same and other manufacturers. A first step was the introduction this year of a workgroup server designed in conjunction with the leading networking software supplier, Novell, to make networking simple and affordable. It won a prize at CeBit, the computer exhibition in Hanover, Germany. The big prize for Mr Noels, however, remains to return ZDS to real and sustained profitability.</p>

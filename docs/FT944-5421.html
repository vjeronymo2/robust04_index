			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (4): It's costly, but RPI is on your side - Capital gains Tax Very few people pay capital gains tax - only about 150,000 assessments are issued in any tax year. But it is an expensive tax, capital gains being treated as the top slice of income (maximum rate 40 per cent). You mainly need to think about CGT when you sell shares, second homes and works of art. Many assets, such as a car or main house, are not subject to the tax. Gilts and most corporate debt are also exempt. CGT works like this. You set off your capital gains against your losses for a tax year, to produce a net gain or loss. If your net gain exceeds Pounds 5,800 (the annual tax-free allowance since 1992-93 - which rises to Pounds 6,000 in 1995-96) you pay tax on the excess. So, if you make gains of Pounds 8,000 and losses of Pounds 5,000 in the 1994-95 tax year, the net gain of Pounds 3,000 is tax-free. The Inland Revenue insists that you set off all your current-year losses against your gains before you use your annual allowance. In this example, you are not permitted to set off only Pounds 2,200 of your losses in order to reduce the net gain to Pounds 5,800, and carry the balance of the loss forward to future years. But if you do incur a net loss in any year, you can carry it forward, without wasting your annual allowance. Calculating capital gains seems very simple. The basic principle is that you deduct the base cost - the amount you paid for the asset - from the net sale proceeds. The gain is reduced by 'indexation'. The base cost is adjusted in accordance with the Retail Prices Index, so that only capital profits which beat inflation should fall into the CGT net. If you owned the asset which you are selling at March 31, 1982, you can substitute its value at that date for the base cost, if that is to your advantage. Unfortunately these simple principles are complicated by a mass of detailed rules. For example: if the effect of indexation is to create a capital loss, you cannot use the indexation part of any loss you realise after 5 April 1995, and there is a ceiling of Pounds 10,000 on indexation losses between November 30, 1993 and April 5, 1995. How to keep the bill down Bed-and-breakfasting. If your shares are showing a profit, consider selling and re-purchasing them to use up your annual allowance and increase your base cost. If you have indexation losses, you have until April 5, 1995, to realise them. Gifts between husband and wife are tax-free (unlike gifts to other family members). You can give shares to your spouse before they are sold, to use up his/her annual allowance, but the gift must be absolute  - the sale proceeds must not find their way back to the donor] You can defer CGT indefinitely by reinvesting the sale proceeds in enterprise investment schemes or, from April 6, venture capital trusts (see page 13). If you are in any doubt about CGT, there are several helpful leaflets available at your tax office. If these do not deal with your situation, take professional advice.</p>

Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of the  Unified Somali Conference, declared this program today. The  program includes the following:    1. Establishing a salvation council of 17 members made up of  all 15 groups, including General Mohamad Farah Aidid as well as  the leader of the National Somali Movement in the north. Ali  Mahdi Mohamed will have a seat on the council according to the  Addis Ababa resolutions. The chairmanship of the council will  alternate.    2. The first chairman of the Salvation Council will form a  provisional government of qualified Somali cadres. He will also  complete the formation of the transitional national council,  which will end the task of the salvation council.    3. The salvation council will assume the task of enacting  legislations, completing the transitional phase, and supervising  the building of state institutions.    Consultations will be held with the National Somali Movement  and the National Somali Coalition to participate in implementing  this program through a delegation that will be sent to meet with  General Aidid for this purpose.</p>

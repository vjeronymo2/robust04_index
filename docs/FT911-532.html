			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Week in the Markets: More surprises from metal stocks THE LONDON Metal Exchange warehouse stock figures again sprang a few surprises on the market yesterday. The figures were eagerly awaited as none had been issued earlier in the week because of the Bank Holiday. Copper stocks soared by 23,900 tonnes to a seven-year high of 261,775 tonnes, compared with expectations of a rise between 10,000 and 15,000 tonnes. Zinc stocks were up to a new record of 119,525 tonnes. Nickel stocks soared by 2,982 tonnes to 8,448 tonnes. Copper has been attracted into LME warehouses by the high premiums for cash metal over three-month metal. The premium reached Pounds 80 a tonne yesterday after Pounds 70 a tonne on Thursday and Pounds 50.50 on Wednesday. The market is in the grip of a technical squeeze in the run-up to next Wednesday, when options will be declared. 'A lot of metal needed for that date is being tightly held, forcing the shorts to cover,' explains Mr Robin Bhar of Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken. 'It's an old fashioned squeeze, and the shorts have been caught out.' He points out that copper on the LME is fetching about 8 cents a lb more than the spot price on New York's Comex, attracting shipments of copper across the Atlantic. This week has seen the price of 'borrowing' (buying cash and selling forward) copper for one day on the LME reach Pounds 25 a tonne. Early next week that figure could widen to Pounds 60, according to some observers. Yesterday cash copper fell to Pounds 1,437.50 a tonne, a fall of Pounds 30 on the week. The zinc market was faced with a similar squeeze last month, which also led to a sharp increase in LME warehouse stocks. That rise continued this week, taking the stocks to a new record. Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, fears that copper stocks will continue inexorably upwards in a similar manner once the squeeze is over. 'The zinc bubble burst, but the stocks are still rising,' says Mr Moore. These are huge stocks, he believes, which will not be eroded by the market running into deficit, or by increased demand. Disruption to supplies remains the only positive possibility, he suggests. This week, however, saw the end to one supply hiccup when about 1,000 employees at Brunswick Mining &amp; Smelting's big lead-zinc mine in New Brunswick voted to end a 10-month strike. The smelter will be operating at half capacity until autumn because large custom contracts have been lost. Mr Bhar believes the continuing influx of zinc to the LME is symptomatic of the depression in the automotive and construction industries. Now the economic weakness in the US and Europe appears to be spreading to the Far East, as signs emerge that the Japanese economy is slowing down. Yesterday cash zinc closed at Dollars 1,091 a tonne, a rise of Dollars 2 on the day but Dollars 43 down on the week. The rise in nickel stocks surprised the market, and was indicative that Soviet supplies of the metal from the primarily coal-fired complex at Norilsk have not been adversely affected by the coal strike, which is now over. Attention will now focus on labour talks soon to start at Inco, according to Mr Bhar. Cash nickel closed yesterday at Dollars 8,630 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 195 on the week. Aluminium stocks on the LME fell yesterday, and the International Primary Aluminium Institute showed total producer stocks at the end of March up a smaller-than-expected 6,000 tonnes. However, the slowdown in producer stock growth was accounted for by a disruption at Brazil's Albras smelter, which is now back in production, Mr Moore points out. Cash metal closed yesterday at Dollars 1,312 a tonne, down Dollars 4 on the week. Base metal producers continue to believe the recession in the US will end soon, says Mr Moore, and they do not want to implement costly or politically difficult cuts. But he likens the situation facing the base metals sector over the next six months to a boxer entering the ring. 'He knows it will all be over in just 15 rounds, but what state will he be in at the end?' Of the soft commodities, cocoa has shown the most movement this week, sinking slowly towards the 15-year lows seen early last year. The July contract closed yesterday at Pounds 622, after touching Pounds 617 a tonne during the day's trading. The fall on the week was Pounds 20. The main reason for the continuing fall remains the overhang of world production over consumption, which may be declining but is still enormous.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium -1600 to 362,125 Copper   +23900 to 261,775 Lead      +2075 to  74,950 Nickel    +2982 to   8,448 Zinc      +4250 to 119,525 Tin        -455 to  16,190  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

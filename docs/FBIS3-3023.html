			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Lixian (0719 4539 2009) and Jia Fenyong </F> (6328 1164 0516)]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of  the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] held its second plenary meeting  this morning to let committee members voice their views. Gu  Shengzu, Fang Jiade, Guo Guoqing, Li Hongchang, and Wang  Chuanlun expressed opinions on ways to guide "migrant rural  workers," to establish a modern enterprise system, and to bring  into full play the role of supervisors.    In his speech, committee member Gu Shengzu offered  suggestions on how to rationally guide the current massive  movement of rural labor. He said: At present, of the 0.2  billion surplus rural workers, 50-60 million are migrant  workers, creating a massive movement of rural labor. Migrant  workers do make contributions; however, they greatly affect  transportation and social order at the same time. He made the  following suggestions: We should use the market to rationally  guide migrant workers. Under the premise of guiding them  through multiple channels, we should make rural towns and  townships the main centers for channeling surplus rural labor in  a bid to slow down the flow of surplus rural labor to large  cities. Meanwhile, we should reform such systems as residence  registration to bring about a complete transfer of part of  surplus rural labor. To prevent a blind and disorderly massive  movement of rural labor and to organize migrant rural workers  systematically, the government should strengthen overall  regulation, guidance, and coordination in dealing with migrant  rural workers who move from place to place.    In his speech, committee member Fang Jiade said: To  establish a modern enterprise system is the foundation for  establishing the socialist market economic structure and the  goal of the reform in state-owned enterprises. To carry out  this important reform, we must whole-heartedly persist in the  policy of relying on the working class. In the course of  establishing a modern enterprise system, we must attach great  importance to the workers' role. Moreover, we must set up a  scientific enterprise leadership system and an organization and  management system with the workers' democratic participation.  He suggested: In the establishment of a modern enterprise  system, the board of directors, the supervisory board, and the  assembly of share-holders should consist of a certain number of  workers' representatives. We must uphold and perfect the  Workers' Congress and practice democratic management in  enterprises. We must uphold collective negotiations and sign  collective agreements to ensure that the legitimate rights and  interests of workers, who are the master of the state, will not  be violated. At the same time, we should step up the  formulation of relevant laws to incorporate the policy of  whole-heartedly relying on the working class into laws, policy,  and the plans and measures for establishing a modern enterprise  system.    Committee member Guo Guoqing said: Under the conditions of  the socialist market economic structure, it is very important to  bring into full play the role of special supervisors,  inspectors, auditors, educational inspectors, and other  discipline enforcement workers. He pointed out: These special  discipline enforcement jobs are highly political and  professional. We should arrange for professionally trained  comrades and those who are capable of participating in political  affairs to do those jobs. Meanwhile, relevant state departments  should make an overall plan for those special discipline  enforcement workers each year. In light of the development and  needs of the situation, these departments must promptly amend  and perfect the regulations governing the special discipline  enforcement workers; further specify their duties, rights, and  responsibilities; and institutionalize the special discipline  enforcement work. The CPC Central Committee and relevant state  organs should often communicate with special discipline  enforcement workers, ask for their opinions, summarize their  experiences, and bring into play the role of comrades  participating in special discipline enforcement.    Committee member Li Hongchang suggested that the  development of chambers of commerce be placed high on the agenda  to meet the socialist market economy's needs. He said: The  economy's rapidly growing nonpublic-owned sector has become  increasingly important. This sector, which is at its initial  stage and is rather scattered, has kept its distance from  macroeconomic regulation and control. Therefore, it is in  particular need of organizations like chambers of commerce that  organize their representatives, represent their legitimate  interests, maintain communications with the party and  government, and provide various services. At the same time, the  government needs the chambers of commerce to help it administer  and guide the nonpublic-owned sector's healthy development. He  also suggested that party committees and governments at all  levels be fully aware of the importance of chambers of commerce  and give top priority to their development. The relevant state  authorities should formulate a "Chamber of Commerce Law" at an  early date to clearly define, in the form of law, the functions  and responsibilities of chambers of commerce so that they can  operate in accordance with law.    Committee member Wang Weilun pointed out that the  anticorruption drive is of major importance today. He said that  in the ongoing anticorruption drive, it is important to rely on  the masses and step up efforts in investigating major cases in  accordance with law. Meanwhile, we must pay special attention to  collective violations of discipline; strictly enforce rules and  regulations; and root out unhealthy practices in various  industries, trades, and professions. Party and government  departments at all levels should also announce progress in the  anticorruption drive to keep the people informed and to bolster  their confidence and enthusiasm in the drive.</p>

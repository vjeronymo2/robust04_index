He arrived in  Nizhniy Novgorod today together with members of the LDPR group  of deputies in the State Duma.    The city's residents showed particular interest in a rally  held in its main square. At the rally, the party leader  reiterated that "there has been no real change in the lives of  the people of Russia following the elections." This is why,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy explained, "we are in opposition, and if  we do not succeed in replacing this government, we do not rule  out the possibility that we ourselves would cancel the Treaty on  Social Accord we signed earlier."</p>

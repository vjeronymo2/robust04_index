			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Trust Agency President Birgit </F> Breuel by Nikolaus Blome in Berlin; date not given: "`We Cost  Less Than the Coal'"]    [Text] In 1998 -- almost -- everything will be over: All  enterprises privatized, all contracts controlled, all assets  refunded to the communities and private persons. So the curtain  at the end of this year will not be the final curtain on the  Trust Agency stage. The reason for it was outlined by Trust  Agency President Birgit Breuel during a visit to the offices of  DIE WELT: "We were dipped into West German bureaucracy" -- with  all its regulations, guidelines, and laws that became bloated  over 40 years.    The commercialization of the property in real estate and  land  will even reach into the next millennium, a total of 200,000  claims for restitution have been filed. Mrs. Breuel's blood  pressure is going up whenever there is an argument about the  future number of personnel in the successor organizations:  "Those who want fewer people have to say which tasks they want  to put off or which tasks they do not want to fulfill at all."  People in Bonn should hear that. After all, in Bonn, various  expert opinions from the Federal Audit Court and from Kienbaum  enterprise consultants have been circulated, providing arguments  for a radical reduction of the Trust Agency staff. And the  responsible Bundestag committee has decided that "in all  appropriate cases" work will be awarded as federal orders to  private companies -- without separate Trust Agency successor  corporations. "In principle, I like the idea very much," Breuel  said. However, this would leave questions of liability unclear,  and in the case of putting off investment promises, equal  treatment would become impossible if there are various private  controllers of a contract, Breuel said and added: "Why send our  east German experts home to provide work for west German  consultants?"    Still, looking back leaves the president satisfied. Although  the Agency will leave a mountain of debts of almost 275 billion  German marks [DM], "this is less than a single industry, west  German coal, has cost the taxpayer." She said she was also  proud of the approximately 2,600 companies that went to their  own -- in most cases east German -- management. Apart from  that, "individual mistakes" have been made, but, all in all,  eastern Germany has embarked on the direct path to become a  "highly modern industrial center, albeit with problems on the  labor market." Indeed; although job and investment promises are  widely met, and although, according to Breuel, only 77 of the  13,500 privatized companies have gone bankrupt, three out four  jobs in the industry have disappeared since 1989.    Hardly anything remains of research, which used to be part  of  the old combines, because research was the first thing that  Trust Agency enterprises began to cut. "That is not our fault,"  Breuel said categorically. However, at the same time, she  admits that, at the beginning the Trust Agency was the only  powerful authority in eastern Germany -- even though it was not  one that should or wanted to make politics. And it certainly  did not want to indulge in structural policy, which did not fit  into the Berlin Agency's desired "entrepreneurial behavior."    When, one after the other, the new laender gradually began  to  try to fill this vacuum, cooperation was very good. Breuel:  "The land governments have gone very far." With similar  respect she looks at the work forces and work councillors in the  enterprises that had to undergo these radical changes. "After  all, everything, really everything has changed for these people."    It is thus, all the more astonishing that protests like  those  in the Bischofferode potassium mine, did not happen earlier and  more often. "I never went there because it would have led to an  explosion," the president said. Yet, it was in Bischofferode  where, for the first time, "politics" intervened massively and  made the potassium miners false hopes. "The Gysis of this  world" were seeking and managed to find new fields for their  activities in Bischofferode.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / S&amp;L chief jailed for 12 1/2 years FORMER US financier Charles Keating was sentenced yesterday to 12 1/2 years in federal prison for racketeering and securities violations, Reuter reports from Los Angeles. Mr Keating, a key figure in the costliest failure ever in the US building society industry, was ordered to serve a 151-month term concurrently with a 10-year state sentence imposed last year. The judge ordered him to pay Dollars 122m (Pounds 81.3m) in restitution to federal regulatory authorities, who seized his Lincoln Savings and Loan when it collapsed in 1989. 'The losses in this case are so extraordinarily large that the chance of full restitution is remote,' the judge said during sentencing.</p>

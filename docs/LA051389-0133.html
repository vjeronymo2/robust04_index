			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEITH CLARK'S NOT-SO-GRAND FINALE;  </P> <P> DEPARTING MUSIC DIRECTOR DOES GET SOME APPLAUSE  </P> <P> Outgoing music director Keith Clark got some respect from the Pacific Symphony  at his final classical concert Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> A day earlier, at a similar program, Clark had turned to applaud the orchestra  he founded in 1979 after leading Mozart's "Ave, verum corpus" as an encore  after Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.  </P> <P> No one had applauded back. ("A lot of bad feelings had built up over the last  year," said one musician, who requested anonymity. "I wondered if anyone would  notice.").  </P> <P> On Thursday night, however, the response was more generous, although not  universal. Many of the cellists and string bass players, a smattering of  violinists and some other instrumentalists tapped their bows or clapped their  hands.  </P> <P> The Pacific Chorale, whose music director, John Alexander, had also just been  cheered on stage, joined in with spirited applause.  </P> <P> The audience had been extraordinarily subdued during most of the concert but  came alive at the conclusion of the Beethoven Ninth. Many people -- more than  on Wednesday -- rose to their feet, and a few shouted "Bravo!"  </P> <P> No one, however, handed up bouquets of roses or offered farewell speeches in  tribute.  </P> <P> The orchestra's board of directors had planned to present a commemorative gift  to Clark during Wednesday's concert, and had gone as far as setting up a  microphone for some post-intermission speech-making. Clark, however, would not  let the gesture take place, and the audience watched perplexed as a stagehand  took away the microphone without explanation.  </P> <P> "For musical reasons, Keith Clark did not wish to disturb the performance with  a stage presentation," executive director Louis G. Spisto said Thursday.  </P> <P> Clark again declined the offer when it was extended before the concert on  Thursday, orchestra officials said.  </P> <P> Attendance figures for the two concerts also sent a curious message. Although  2,691 tickets had been sold for Wednesday's concert, only 1,814 persons  attended, according to orchestra figures. (An orchestra spokesman said he did  not know whether the 33% no-show rate was unusual for Pacific Symphony concerts  in general.) Likewise, a near-capacity 2,903 tickets were sold for Thursday's  performance, yet only 1,947 showed up.  </P> <P> Some music directors don't get any respect.  </P></p>

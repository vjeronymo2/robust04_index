			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Ivory Coast aspires to be an 'African elephant': Devaluation has helped set the west African country on the road to recovery Ivory Coast's prime minister Daniel Kablan Duncan recently compared the west African country's good growth prospects to those of south-east Asia. 'People talk a lot about the dragons of south east Asia,' he said. 'But I want Ivory Coast to become an African elephant.' His comments come after Ivory Coast's international competitiveness was restored in January by a 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc (the 13-nation west and central African common currency) against the French franc and follow a sharp rise in commodity prices. Confidence is high that after nearly a decade of economic decline, recovery may not be far off. The government expects gross domestic product to increase by 2 per cent in 1994 and nearly 6 per cent in 1995 and 1996, and most economists agree. But it will be some time before the improvement is reflected in the standard of living. The most direct beneficiaries of devaluation are exporters, mainly farmers. Cocoa producers, for example, have seen the prices paid to them by the state increase by 20 per cent since the devaluation. Another increase was due this month. Meanwhile urban Ivorians have been hit by the higher cost of imports, a problem only partly alleviated by the new government safety nets. Social unrest, however, has not been a problem. Fears that the recovery would be thrown off course by the death of the country's long serving President Felix Houphouet-Boigny in December 1993 have also proved unfounded. If anything, the smooth succession by Henri Konan Bedie has shown the durability of the system created by 'Le Vieux' in his 33 years at the helm. While the government has been quick to welcome the emergence of green shoots, recovery remains fragile. With public spending being increased, a balanced budget is dependent on cocoa and coffee prices holding firm and excessive public-sector wage demands being resisted. So far inflation has been kept under control. Although first half prices were up 20 per cent, compared with just 4.4 per cent a year ago, the increase is still well within the 35 per cent maximum set by the International Monetary Fund in a structural adjustment agreement signed in January under which Abidjan was promised soft loans totalling SDR333m (Dollars 486m) over three years. In February the World Bank approved structural adjustment loans of nearly Dollars 1bn, also over three years. Whether Ivory Coast achieves a sustained recovery will depend partly on factors outside its control and on its success in tackling deep-rooted structural problems. In the former category, much depends on economic recovery in Europe and Africa - in 1992 more than half its exports went to Europe and a third to Africa. At home, recovery will be constrained by at least two structural problems - debt and the lack of economic diversification. One of the government's top priorities is to reduce the high level of internal debt and, in particular, to clear internal arrears which have stifled economic activity in recent years. It has already rescheduled and consolidated the bulk of the debts to the banking system, public enterprises and the private sector. But internal Ivorian arrears were still about 8 per cent of GDP at the end of 1993. Ivorian banks meanwhile are less worried about bad debts than too much liquidity. Since devaluation, high interest rates have attracted a massive influx of capital from abroad and frightened off borrowers. As terms of trade have improved, exporters have begun to pay off their overdrafts and importers, having anticipated the devaluation, have built up stocks and cut orders, reducing their need to borrow. In the longer term, the biggest threat to recovery comes from the external debt burden, which grew by nearly 10 per cent last year. According to World Bank and IMF estimates, at the end of 1993 total external debt, 77 per cent of which is public sector, was about Dollars 19.4bn, more than twice GDP, and total external arrears were about Dollars 5.3bn, more than four times the previous year's figure. One effect of the devaluation has been to double the CFA franc cost of the debt. But, what is more important, it has also encouraged international creditors to release loans worth about Dollars 1.1bn to the country this year, including the 1994 instalments of the IMF and World Bank loans. While international aid may relieve the symptoms of external debt, a cure will require a widening of the economic base. Efforts to diversify have been largely unsuccessful - cocoa and coffee still account for more than half the foreign exchange - although the recent discovery of offshore oil and gas by US oil company United Meridian offers some cause for hope. Privatisation is also moving slowly, but this may soon change. Under pressure from the IMF, parliament passed a law in June outlining a detailed timetable for the privatisation of some 50 state enterprises by mid-1996. By the end of August, 10 companies had been privatised, including the electricity distribution company CIE which was sold to the French large engineering company Bouygues in 1991. The French company is also said to be interested in the telecommunications company CI-Telcom, due to be sold in 1995. With presidential and legislative elections due at the end of next year, economic reform is likely to remain slow. While President Bedie and the ruling PDCI party are certain to win the elections, only the second to be open to other parties, maintaining budgetary rigour will be more difficult. But failure to reduce economic dependence on cocoa and coffee might mean that the country misses its best chance in nearly a decade to revive its battered economy.</p>

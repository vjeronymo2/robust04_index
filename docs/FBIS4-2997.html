			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- A Taiwan food industry  delegation left Friday [15 April] for Subic Bay in the  Philippines, where it will look at investment possibilities.    Led by Fu Kuang-yen, secretary-general of the Taiwan Gourmet  Powder Industrial Association, the group comprises a dozen  senior business executives.    Group members include Secretary-General Shen Ta of the  Taiwan  Association of Frozen Food Industries, Secretary-General Wang  Yuan-chuan of the Taiwan Regional Association of Carbonated  Beverage Industries, and Secretary-General Shih Fu-yuan of the  Taiwan Association of Frozen Vegetable and Fruit Manufacturers.    Taiwan and the Philippines are jointly building a  325-hectare  industrial park in Subic Bay, and Lu said Taiwan investors could  use the site as a production base from which they could sell  foodstuffs to neighboring Vietnam and Singapore, whose residents  have a taste for Chinese food.    The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei on Tuesday.    Meanwhile, Vice Chairman Wu Kuan-hsiung of the China  External  Trade Development Council (CETRA) will head a mission to the  Philippines and Indonesia beginning April 24.    Wu said the CETRA mission will go to Subic Bay and to Batam,  Medan, Surabaya, and Jakarta in Indonesia to seek trade and  investment opportunities for Taiwan's machinery manufacturers.    The visits of the two delegations are regarded as part of  domestic investors' efforts to push for increased investments in  Southeast Asian countries in response to the government's  southern strategy.</p>

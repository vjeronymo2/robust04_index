			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Dollar up sharply on D-Mark, yen and Pounds THE DOLLAR moved sharply higher against the D-Mark, the yen and sterling yesterday amid increasing concern over deteriorating economic conditions in Germany and the political upheaval in Japan. It soared to a 15-month high against the D-Mark, in spite of the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday not to cut interest rates. The dollar closed in London nearly 2 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM1.68, breaking through the top of a trading range that had prevailed since March last year. It went on to close at DM1.681 in New York. There was also a dramatic reverse in the yen's sharp rise against the dollar, which has dominated currency dealing in recent weeks. After the vote of no confidence in Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government, the yen plunged to Y109.30 against the dollar at the London close, and 109.75 in New York. That left the Japanese currency some 2 1/2 per cent weaker than 24 hours earlier. Sterling also fell against the surging dollar, closing in London nearly 2 cents weaker against the US currency at Dollars 1.4960. The D-Mark was increasingly beleaguered against other European currencies, falling below FFr3.36 against the French franc for the first time in 13 months. The recent fall in the D-Mark has left the Bundesbank in a dilemma. Members of the German central bank's ruling council have talked of their concern that the deterioration in the D-Mark's value may fuel inflation. However, if the Bundesbank tries to preserve the value of the currency by keeping short-term interest rates at high levels, it may aggravate the German recession.

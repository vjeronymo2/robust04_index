			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson Lord White's nomination of his successor is to be welcomed as the first movement in the log-jam blocking Hanson's development. Mr David Clarke is on record as holding sensible views about the management of the company's organic growth in the 1990s. Hanson will be deprived of Lord White's deal-making flair. But not only has it outgrown that stage of its history: there is no obvious scope for the big deal in today's markets anyway.</p>

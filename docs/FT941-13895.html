			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Travel: Up to the waist in snow - Michael Woods samples the various means of transport in arctic Norway THE SILK-soft nostrils of Svartir, the impatient Icelandic pony towing the sledge behind, puffed hot, steamy breaths over us. Svartir was in a good mood though often she is a sluggard, falling farther behind on the half-hour journey along the frozen road leading deep into the Finnmark countryside. Tonight she was with us all the way as the sledges hissed and the ponies clip-clopped and jingled in the semi-darkness across the snow. Our destination was Ongajoksetra, near Alta in the area of arctic Norway known as Finnmark where, in Turid Kjellmann's kitchen, we drank a warming mixture of red wine, cherry juice and cinnamon called glogg before starting our meal. Even with Svartir's impatience, travelling by horse-drawn sleigh turned out to be a good deal calmer than dog-sledding the following day when we travelled from Alta on to the empty Finnmark plateau. The huskies arrived at our starting point in blocks of individual kennels bolted to the back of a pick-up truck; they were so anxious to be off that they almost burst through the doors. Once out and attached to the single trace, they yowled and barked with enthusiasm and strained to be away. As a precaution, the trace had been attached by a slip knot to the tow bar of the truck and, with all 16 dogs in place, even that began to slither slowly over the snow. Finally the driver of the dog team slipped the knot and our sledge shot off at high speed. The local policeman was to have been one of our sledge drivers but he was unable to be with us. Instead he had to go in search of a missing woman. She had set out on cross-country skis late the previous afternoon to visit friends but had not arrived. What seemed to us a foolhardy expedition was apparently an everyday journey for the Norwegians, who learn to ski at about the time they learn to walk. As I discovered for myself when I tried to go for a walk without the benefit of skis, the thick blanket of snow which cloaks the landscape is almost as confining as water, and I found myself floundering waist-deep in the stuff. The only way forward was to follow snow-mobile tracks. The snowy wastes were deserted. Tracks told where fox and mountain hare had woven a complex story in the night. Like an omen in the emptiness a raven flew overhead, croaking like an old donkey. We stopped our dogs to drink coffee, boiling the water on a fire built on top of birch twigs in a hole dug in the snow. We sat round the rim on reindeer hides, chewing dried venison and drinking our hot brew in the silence as the fire grew hotter and sank deeper and deeper into its pit. Even the dogs were quiet, anchored and strung out along the trace like dog-shaped washing in black and white. The silence was soon to be shattered, though, for just around the hill were the snow-mobiles on which we were to continue our journey; the odour of dogs was replaced by the smell of exhaust. The snow-mobile is the arctic equivalent of the Harley Davidson and brings out a lust for speed in the most staid. We set off down a designated track to Jotka mountain lodge for lunch. The Alta area is noted for its trees. It is not that they are special, just that there is nothing else this far north. Alta catches the last vestiges of warmth from the Gulf Stream, just enough to allow birches to raise their heads tentatively above ground level. They punctuate an otherwise featureless landscape plateau with shades and tones. Threaded through the trees, our route was marked by staves, a necessary precaution because even in spring it is possible for several inches of snow in a single night to obliterate the track. These staves are also important because of the need to restrict snow-mobiles. The advent of such fast, all-terrain vehicles has changed the face of the north and the lives of the reindeer-herding Lapps, now more properly called Sami. The Sami no longer need to camp out with their deer, moving with the herds as they search for food. Instead they live in nearby towns, racing out each day to seek the deer on their snow-mobikes. The resultant erosion, together with high levels of over-stocking to pay for such expensive machines, has destroyed areas of reindeer moss, the lichen staple of the deer in winter. Herds are being reduced sharply in order to control matters, while the snow-mobiles are required to stick to certain trails. Judging by the exhibition of lassoeing which we watched, that tradition, too, is on the decline. Two Sami tried to ensnare the reindeer antlers but they seemed unskilled; it was no surprise to find that they prefer to bribe their reindeer, gathering them around a bag of concentrated food rather than chasing them with lassoes. Up to their knees in snow, the reindeer looked even smaller than I had expected as they scraped away snow with insulated, fur-covered noses to reach the moss beneath. We had come to see these deer with their owner, Kirsten Bent Gaup, one of the few Sami still to own a herd. The male deer were bare-headed for they lose their antlers after the autumn rut; they are thus disadvantaged during the winter when the calf-carrying females, which retain their antlers, need food more urgently. As they crowded around Kirsten, it was the cows that prodded their way to the best of the food she was dispensing. In spite of the harsh climate and the months of winter darkness, the people of the north and their reindeer are great survivors. The woman, lost overnight, turned up safely if a little late, perhaps confirming the Samis' notorious disregard for punctuality and lack of urgency. 'If you are in such a hurry,' their saying goes, 'why didn't you arrive yesterday.' Perhaps Svartir was trying to do just that. Michael Woods flew to Norway with SAS and travelled with Norwegian State Railways (London tel: 071-930-6666) which runs tailor-made arctic Norway holidays from Pounds 1,000 for five days. These include horse and dog sledging, snow-mobiling and visiting Sami reindeer and their herders. A padded suit is provided along with boots, gloves and hat for a small extra sum. Specialist clothing is also available in Britain from Mountain Equipment (customer service department: 061-366-5020) and Helly Hansen (0234-266966).</p>

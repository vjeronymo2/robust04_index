			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dirk van Zyl] </F>   [Text] Cape Town April 26 SAPA -- By mid-morning there had  been no security problems at any of the voting points for  special votes in the Western Cape, an Independent Electoral  Commission spokesman said on Tuesday [26 April]. "The security  forces have not reported any major problems," he said. An  administrative hitch in the Mitchell's Plain area -- where  ballots had not reached the right destinations -- had been  sorted out, he added. And a claim that the African Christian  Democratic Party had distributed pamphlets on Tuesday at the  Buffeljags Prison at Swellendam, in contravention of the ruling  that all electioneering cease on Monday, was being investigated.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> At least 112 anti-abortion protesters affiliated with Operation Rescue were  arrested by Baltimore County police as they challenged a new state law barring  the blocking of entrances to medical facilities. Police estimated a crowd of at  least 400 people on both sides of the abortion issue gathered for a  demonstration and counterdemonstration in front of the Baltimore Women's  Medical Center. Anti-abortion forces view the Maryland law against blocking  medical facilities, passed at the last General Assembly session, as vague and  unconstitutional. It provides for a $1,000 fine and a prison term of up to a  year for offenders.  </P></p>

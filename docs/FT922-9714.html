			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK-led group likely to win HK bridge deal THE Hong Kong government is expected to announce tomorrow that a British-led consortium has won an HKDollars 8bn (Pounds 583m) contract to build one of the world's biggest suspension bridges. An Anglo-Japanese consortium, led by Trafalgar House, is believed to be the successful bidder to build a 1,377m bridge to connect Tsing Yi and Ma Wan Islands as part of the HKDollars 114bn (in March 1991 prices) airport and related infrastructure programme. The contract will be the biggest single one awarded so far for the colonial government's infrastructure development of Hong Kong. As well as the Anglo-Japanese consortium, three others were in the bidding: an all-Japanese group and one led by the French construction company Dragages et Travaux Publics; the third, a South Korean grouping led by Hyundai, was some HKDollars 2bn cheaper than the Trafalgar House bid. The HK government is expecting to be criticised by local politicians and probably China, which had an interest in the Hyundai consortium, if it awards the contract to Trafalgar House. Hyundai's troubles in South Korea, where some senior executives have been accused over taxes, and the highly-geared nature of Hyundai Construction and Engineering, the main bidder, are understood to have concerned the HK government. It raised doubts about the company's ability to enter into a long-term commitment to build the bridge. The government's critics say it should never have pre-qualified Hyundai. UK consulting firms have done well in bidding for consultancy contracts for the airport programme. They have done less well in previous building contracts, but the award of the bridge to a predominantly British consortium will be seen as favouritism in some quarters. The Anglo-Japanese group would be asked to build one of the world's longest suspension bridges in the shortest possible time. It will have to be completed by mid-1997, at the latest, when the airport is expected to be opened.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / ICI faces anti-trust inquiry IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, is being investigated by Spanish anti-trust authorities for sharply, and, allegedly, unfairly, increasing the prices at which it transfers agrochemical products to its largest Spanish joint venture, ICI Zeltia. The owners of Zeltia, a Galician-based chemicals group, have accused ICI of deliberately depressing profits at their 50/50 joint venture, whose share of the Spanish agrochemicals market has slipped from second to fourth since the price increases began in the spring of 1989. ICI Zeltia's net profits fell from Pta542m (Pounds 3.13m) in 1988 to Pta186m the following year, and to Pta96m in 1990. Spain's once-moribund Court for the Protection of Competition, recently given a new lease of life by the government, has agreed to investigate Zeltia's complaints. ICI said yesterday it believed the complaint was without foundation. ICI Zeltia has been distributing ICI products in Spain since 1964 under an agreement Zeltia's lawyers now say conflicts with a 1989 law guaranteeing free competition as it prevents the joint venture from exporting any of its product out of Spain.</p>

Ostrovskiy: "Yes, You and I Are Rich Men!"] </F>   [Text] As of the first of February, indexation of  Russian citizens' personal savings has begun: savings deposits  have increased threefold since 1 January 1992. However, the old  familiar lines outside savings banks made up of people anxious  to be personally convinced that their account was properly  indexed are no more.    The general indifference is not surprising. Three years ago  a  pensioner who had accumulated a thousand rubles in his passbook  felt reassured. He knew he had enough money for several months  of normal existence or, God forbid, for a decent funeral. Today,  the same deposit, even threefold, would barely get him an extra  bottle of vodka, and not even one from the famous Kristall  factory.    In previous, pre-reform years, each person who had even a  few  rubles in his savings passbook became a creditor of the state  and its economy. There was a time when citizens' savings  equalled 80 percent of the domestic national product. The state  used this huge sum of money freely, boldly, and carelessly to  extend credit to industry and agriculture.    At first glance, we were being robbed openly and impudently;  no other country in the world would have paid such a tiny rate  of interest on deposits. Only now does one realize that in many  ways the uncontrolled utilization of our money made it possible  for prices for most consumer goods to be kept virtually  unchanged for many long years.    In January 1992, price liberalization came crashing in.  Worker savings quickly evaporated. It was the lightning robbery  of millions of law-abiding citizens.    This event predetermined both the enormous losses for the  economy and the impossibility of establishing social peace and  calm in the country for many years to come, above all because  people lost faith in the state and the course toward  democratization and reforms, to which millions upon millions  linked their impoverishment. The state itself, deprived of huge  free credits, began to search for other sources that would keep  the economy functioning at least minimally. Since the former  billions were no longer on deposit, the state was forced to  resort to unrestrained credit emission.    Today many specialists feel that high rates of inflation,  rising prices, and the impoverishment of millions are the  consequence not so much of price liberalization as of the  unrestricted credit emissions they are attempting to use to  replace the old "private" credit.    Right now the chairman of the government and the vice  premier  talk about the need to repay their indebtedness to certain  branches of the economy, to supporting their preferential loans.  They are talking about 5-6 trillion rubles [R] already in the  first quarter of this year. Obviously those trillions are not in  the state treasury. If they are to give them out to miners, oil  workers, defense workers, and agriculture, money will have to be  printed, plain and simple. Monetary emission that is not  reinforced by a growth in production and services, however, is  the direct route to accelerated inflation and price increases,  to poverty for some and excessive wealth for others.    Let us ask ourselves a question, though. Is our state truly  so poor, is it so catastrophically short of money? The state,  that is the government, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of  Finance, may not have money. But you and I have "free" money.  Quite a lot of it. You don't believe it?    Goskomstat (State Committee for Statistics) publishes a  survey, The Socio-Economic Status of the Russian Federation. In  issue 11, in a chapter entitled "Standard of Living," on page  61, highly eloquent figures are published confirming what is at  first glance a debatable assertion about the unprecedented  wealth you and I possess. Between January and November of last  year the population held cash used to purchase hard currency and  bank deposits that amounted to nearly 22 percent of all income  received. Is that a lot or a little? Let us calculate: according  to the same survey, the population's income for those 11 months  totaled R42.2 trillion. This means that the free money--that is,  the cash in our pockets, hard currency acquired, and bank  deposits--for you and me came to about R9 trillion.    We can assume that in three months the population  accumulates  more than R10 trillion in free funds. If the government had the  opportunity to utilize some of this money, to put it into  economic circulation, there would not be such a need for  emission, preferential credits, inflation, and further price  increases.    All that remains for us is to bring it to the savings banks  and place it in our personal accounts. Why aren't we doing that?  Why do we prefer to buy hard currency and securities, to make  deposits in commercial bank deposit accounts?    For one simple reason. Hard currency and commercial banks  protect our money better from inflation. In order to be  convinced of this, a simple calculation will suffice. Last year,  the value of the dollar rose threefold. This means, the sum  which someone at the beginning of the year put into the purchase  of "greenbacks" grew by that much. This, of course, is not full  compensation for the devaluation of money, but it is still at  least some protection. The exact same effect could be derived in  a bank account, given a 200-percent rate of interest. As we  know, savings banks are not offering their depositors these  kinds of conditions. Commercial banks, though, are taking money  from the population at 300-350 percent.    Unfortunately, neither deposits in commercial banks nor the  purchase of hard cash can have as restorative an effect on the  economy as "private" credit. Last year, 95-97 percent of all  loans made by commercial banks were short-term loans for no more  than three months. Normal goods production requires loans for at  least half a year.    The hard cash, the billions of dollars acquired by the  population at exchange points, cannot work either because they  lie like a dead weight in citizens' apartments or in the  accounts of those same commercial banks.    So there is much more free money in the country than before,  but for the government, the economy, and society as a whole, it  is useless.    Is it possible to put those R9-10 trillion that remain with  the population in the first quarter to work? Undoubtedly.    For instance, it is worthwhile interesting commercial banks  in long-term loan extensions for production. How? With the help  of tax benefits or the transfer of property or real estate.  Interest on savings bank deposits can be raised significantly.  If rates exceed at least 200 percent, then many would prefer a  savings bank to other financial structures. Despite all the  upheavals and disappointments, many have retained their  traditional trust in state guarantees. If the conditions for  keeping money come even a little closer to what the commercials  are promising, millions of people may again go to the savings  banks.    Although voucher privatization is proceeding at a speedy  rate, the state still retains a significant share of property.  Here it is, especially after recalculating the value of basic  funds: this could become a guarantee for the repayment of debts  to tens of millions of citizens.    The state could transfer to the Savings Bank shares or debt  obligations with right of sale at auction. The earnings would  yield money for the fair compensation of deposits. Not by a  pitiful and ridiculous factor of 3, threefold, but by a hefty  and tangible factor of 50-70. This would return to the state its  citizens' confidence and sympathy.    Confidence will return. No one will be afraid to give his  money up, and the state will receive a powerful financial source  for reforming the economy without emissions or inflation. This  year the country's population is going to have approximately  R35-40 trillion. The possibility of utilizing even half of this  sum would mean the return of our hopes for the economy's  stabilization. Isn't this prospect worth making a decision,  after having thought it all over and weighed everything, that  would satisfy tens of millions of people?</p>

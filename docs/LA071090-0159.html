			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BROWN: MARRIAGE NOT A NECESSITY  </P> <P> Actress Blair Brown balks at the notion that all single women are looking for a  man. Brown, a non-married, working mother, says, "I don't think women are  waiting for that key piece any longer."  </P> <P> "It's not that they don't want that closeness," Brown said in an interview in  the August issue of McCall's magazine, "but we're more like men now. Women  don't have to settle, and they don't anymore."  </P> <P> The 40-year-old actress, who stars in cable television's "The Days and Nights  of Molly Dodd," says her time is divided between long workweeks and weekends in  the country with her 8-year-old son, the product of her nine-year relationship  with actor Richard Jordan. Although the couple split up about five years ago,  Brown says they remain close.  </P> <P> As for why she never married, Brown says:  </P> <P> "When I was younger, it was certainly about breaking the rules, but I think now  it's just a question of following your own heart and finding you're just not in  sync with whatever the norms are."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that it is hard  to consider the North Korean nuclear issue a South-North issue  because it has developed into an issue at the level of  international cooperation since the UN Security Council took  issued the president's statement.    While giving a briefing on the result of President Kim's  recent visit to Japan and China at the Democratic Liberal  Party's office today, Minister Han Sung-chu said the above and  added that we should try to resolve the nuclear issue between  South and North Korea through efforts between the International  Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea and between the United  States and North Korea.    Minister Han also said we should make efforts to remove the  belief at home and abroad that the Korean peninsula is facing a  crisis to prevent adverse influence upon our economy, including  tourism, investment, and trade. He added that U.S. Secretary of  Defense William Perry's recent remark that the United States  would not hesitate to bring about war has been confirmed to be  an exaggeration by reporters.    Regarding the Russian proposal for eight-party talks on the  nuclear issue, Minister Han said that he basically welcomed  [kibonjoguro hwanyonghanda] Russia's interest in the issue and  that he would consult with countries concerned, watching their  reactions.</p>

AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI reported that the North Korean delegation  consisting of experts in military technology returned home after  signing an agreement for the promotion of new military, nuclear  cooperation with Iran, but did not provide details.    North Korean government news agency KCNA reported on 12  January that the North Korean delegation led by Commander Cho  Myong-nok was visiting Teheran but neglected to mention the  purpose of the delegation's visit to Iran. The Iranian  Government press made no mention of the North Korean  delegation's visit to Iran.    The Western and Arab sources reported that during the North  Korean delegation's visit to Iran, the two sides probably  conducted intense discussion on the issue of test launches in  Iran of the Nodong-1 medium-range missiles that have been  developed by North Korea with Iran's financial assistance.    Diplomatic sources speculated that the North Korean  delegation may have visited Iranian military and nuclear  facilities, including the (Shard) missile test base located 320  kms east of Teheran.</p>

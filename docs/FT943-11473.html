			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Too much water and wine don't mix: Thunderstorms have wrecked some of the best French vineyards For some French wine producers it never rains, but it pours. The violent thunder and hailstorms that have rolled across France over the past few weeks have struck at random, causing serious damage to some vineyards, while leaving others untouched. Take the case of the Puligny-Montrachet vineyards in the Burgundy region of eastern France. Heavy hail on the night of July 17 could reduce this year's production by up to 20 per cent. Some vineyards are particularly affected. Chartron and Trebuchet, a company which owns and manages vineyards on the region's Montrachet hill, says that its grands crus and premiers crus have suffered severely. 'As far as the Domaine Jean Chartron is concerned, the parcels Clos des Chevaliers, Clos du Cailleret, Clos de la Pucelle and Les Folatieres have unfortunately been devastated by more than 50 per cent,' says Mr Louis Trebuchet. A colleague points out the element of chance involved. 'In Burgundy we have to live with hail. But it is very pinpoint. A few hundred metres away there will be no damage,' she says. There may be a silver lining to the hailstorm clouds. The scarcity of this year's vintage could raise prices of the Domaine Jean Chartron wines, for which the grands crus already cost more than FFr300 (Pounds 36) a bottle. But wine experts say that any increase in prices will be determined by the quality of this year's wine and the production in rival high-quality vineyards. Other regions have also been affected by the recent storms. 'Last weekend there was some damage,' says a spokesman for the association of Bordeaux wine producers. 'But it appears very isolated and I don't think there will be a widespread affect on production. For those which have been affected, however, the effects can be very damaging.' Until the harvests are gathered over the next few months, it is unclear whether 1994 will mark another year of declining production. Total production fell in 1993 by 19 per cent, to 53m hectolitres, according to Insee, the national statistics office. Last year, too, the weather was to blame. 'The harvest was greatly affected by rain,' says Insee, citing Aquitaine in southwestern France as one of the worst-hit regions. In general, however, the report concludes that the quality of the harvest was not greatly affected and '1993 should count among the good years'. There were other encouraging signs. Consumption rose by 7 per cent in volume terms, after several years of decline, although prices continued their downward trend. The sole exception, according to Insee, has been for Burgundy wines, where the average price rose by 6 per cent last year. As they survey their ravaged vineyards, however, that may prove little consolation for the producers of Puligny-Montrachet.</p>

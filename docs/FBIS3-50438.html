			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Anel Cordero] </F>   [Text] The National Renewal Movement (Morena) was admitted  yesterday as political party number 14, with full rights to  participate formally in the 1994 elections. The three Electoral  Tribunal magistrates presented the Morena Party credentials to  the leaders of that political organization. After complying  with this requirement, Morena has the full rights to participate  in the electoral process and to present candidates for this  event.    Morena President Pedro Vallarino said that the party will  attempt to be the vehicle for Panamanians who have not had the  opportunity to participate in politics to do so. He added that  Morena has talked to several parties, but, until now, has not  agreed on any alliance for the upcoming elections or to back any  presidential candidate. According to Vallarino, Morena prefers  to join independent groups and avoid the political parties,  because once the latter reach power they end up fighting for  political spaces.    A Morena source also reported yesterday that there is a  possibility that the group of former Christian Democratic Party  (PDC) members, who are called "The Brown Ones," may enter the  Morena party ranks. This decision could be announced next  Wednesday in a political event that will be attended by Morena  party leaders and representatives of "The Brown Ones."    According to Vallarino, the party has several presidential  candidate hopefuls, including former Comptroller Ruben Dario  Carles and Joaquin Jose Vallarino. He said, however, that the  Morena presidential candidate will be chosen at the national  convention.</p>

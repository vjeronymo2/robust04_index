			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Assault on Disc Pirates Picks Up Momentum"] </F>   [Text] The momentum is gaining in the nationwide fight  against pirated compact and laser discs, which should further  tighten copyright protection across the country.    The crackdown, launched in mid-April, was intended to check  the flow of illegal CDs and LDs and restore order to China's  audio-visual market, which is plagued by piracy and bogus  products.    The battle is particularly gaining ground in Beijing,  Jiangsu  and Guangdong provinces, according to Chinese reports.    Investigators have found that most Chinese audio-visual  publishing houses, record stores, show rooms and night clubs  follow the law, while a small portion seek illicit ways to gain  quick profits.    In Beijing, police launched an attack last week in the  entertainment market. They smashed three stores which sell  pirated or smuggled goods, confiscated 1,607 LDs and 125 CDs in  addition to 1,480 cassettes and tapes, the Beijing Daily  reported on Friday.    Currently, the city has 120 audio-visual publishing houses,  1,000 record shops, 400 show rooms and 500 night clubs.    Meanwhile, in East China's Jiangsu Province, fake discs also  have been the main prey of investigators from publication  administrations since early this year, the Press and Publication  Journal reported on Friday.    Their first target was two LD factories in Jiangsu.    One of the plants was found violating copyright law and was  fined 200,000 yuan ($23,000).    To add to the attack, investigators in the provincial  capital  of Nanjing have conducted six secret checks on the audio-visual  market.    They confiscated more than 5,000 smuggled and pirated discs.    In Suzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and other cities, the  investigators also seized more than 15,000 copies.    With the attack, audio-visual markets in the province are  taking on a new look, the journal said.    Furthermore, the journal added, Guangdong authorities have  also targeted CD and LD smugglers during the past two months.    In addition to confiscating discs, they also closed down  some  unlicensed shopping stands.    Along with the nationwide attack, research from the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences suggested three ways to stem illegal  pirating, the BEIJING DAILY reported.</p>

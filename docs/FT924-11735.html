			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rebels warn PM over Europe TORY Euro-sceptics last night delivered a strong warning to Mr John Major that his determination to restart the Maastricht ratification process threatens a renewed outbreak of civil war on the Conservative back benches. The warning came as Labour suggested that it might decide to maximise the prime minister's difficulties by opposing the return of the legislation before the Edinburgh EC summit in December. One member of the opposition front-bench team suggested that the party might join with the bill's Tory opponents to defer ratification. As the government announced that the Commons will hold a one-day debate on November 4 to pave the way for the return of the Maastricht bill, the Euro-sceptics won loud support for their demands to delay the treaty at a crowded meeting of the backbench 1922 committee. MPs at the meeting said some supporters of the treaty also expressed doubts about how sensible it was to press ahead with the detailed committee stage of the bill later next months after the latest convulsions among the government's supporters. Members of the 1922 executive also voiced fears that the renewed debate over Europe would break the fragile unity in the party which Mr Major managed to restore this week with the retreat over pit closures. Several pro-European Tories argued that Mr Major was right to get out of the way quickly what promises to be a gruelling three or four-week Commons war of attrition. Earlier this week Mr Major told colleagues that he was ready to make Maastricht an issue of confidence in his own leadership.</p>

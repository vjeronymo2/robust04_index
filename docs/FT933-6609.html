			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Turkey allows equity mutual funds on ISE TURKEY'S Capital Markets Board (SPK) is to allow equity-based mutual funds to be floated on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Reuter reports from Istanbul. Mr Caner Ertuna, SPK's deputy head, said the decree allowed for the establishment of index-based mutual funds with an obligation to invest at least 95 per cent of their portfolio in shares making up the ISE index. Turkish equity funds now total more than TL3,000bn. Mr Ertuna said: 'The new regulations will play an important role to develop financial markets and benefit more efficiently from these markets in privatisation. A parallel market will develop and the government will be able to sell a larger portion of its shares to these funds.' The recent implementation of tax advantages to mutual funds had unleashed a flurry of new fund issues.</p>

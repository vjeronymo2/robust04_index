			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Bankers Trust sheds 200 jobs in restructuring move THE slump in corporate finance activity in the US claimed more victims yesterday when Bankers Trust, the New York banking group, announced the restructuring of its corporate finance department at the cost of 200 jobs. The job losses are a result of Bankers Trust's decision to merge the three units which covered worldwide lending and financing activities into a single Global Corporate Finance department which will provide commercial and investment banking services to the group's US and international clients. Although the redundancies will be spread throughout the group's offices across the world, the bulk will come from Bankers Trust's New York headquarters. The costs of compensating the 200 dismissed staff has already been accounted for by the severance pay expense reported in the first quarter. So far this year, the group has shed 600 of its 13,000 staff, and more redundancies are expected as part of a general cost-cutting programme. The lay-offs at Bankers Trust are a result of the worldwide downturn in corporate finance business, primarily caused by the slowdown in economic growth worldwide and the credit crunch in the US and Japan. Lower interest rates in the US have so far failed to spur any significant increases in bank lending to companies. Moreover, big mergers and acquisitions are still a rarity, and junk-bond financing remains in the doldrums. The result has been a sharp drop in income from corporate finance activity, an area of traditional strength for Bankers Trust. Although it has avoided some of the other problems afflicting US banks (it is considerably less burdened by bad real estate loans), Bankers Trust has not been immune to the corporate finance slump. Fees earned by the group from corporate finance business fell 23 per cent in the first quarter of this year, and in the whole of 1990 corporate finance fees were down by 27 per cent. As part of the restructuring, Bankers Trust has set up several new units, including those to cover the real estate and energy business. An integrated European merchant banking unit based in London that will tackle eastern European corporate finance has also been established. Mr Ralph McDonald, formerly head of corporate finance for North American and Europe, and Mr George Vojta, who was in charge of financing in emerging markets in less-developed countries, will be joint heads of the new global finance department, which will also handle lease and project finance and asset-backed lending.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat What does Queens Moat Houses have in common with British Steel, the best performing stock in the FT-SE 100 during the first quarter of this year? Both have been bought by US investors attracted by a share price at steep discount to stated net asset value. Such a yardstick is popular in the US, where earnings trends are volatile. At its suspension price of 47 1/2 p Queens Moat looks cheap compared with last stated assets per share of 114p. Yesterday's British Steel closing price of 85p was less than half the company's net assets of 194p per share. The Queens Moat discount has been overtaken by events, however, while there must be room for debate about the real worth of British Steel's assets at a time of structural overcapacity in the European industry. Perhaps price to net assets is a better yardstick in the US because balance sheet accounting there is more disciplined. More likely it is flawed because it takes no account of the quality of management or its ability to generate profits from the assets under control. Either way, the measure looks an inadequate substitute for the price-earnings ratio which has been devalued by the new UK accounting standards.</p>

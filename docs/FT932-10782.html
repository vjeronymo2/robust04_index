			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Christie's to auction Michelangelo drawing CHRISTIE'S IN London is offering for sale on July 6 two exceptional master works, both created in the early 1530s, and expected to set auction records for an Old Master drawing and for a miniature. The drawing, 'Rest on the flight into Egypt', is by Michelangelo and could exceed the record Pounds 3.5m paid at Christie's in 1984 for Raphael's 'Study of a man's head and hand'. No paintings by Michelangelo are likely to appear on the market and very few of his drawings remain in private hands. Any rich museum, such as the Getty in Malibu, California, might regard this as a last chance to acquire a work by one of the greatest of artists. The drawing has an excellent provenance. It was apparently sold in the 1830s for 250 guineas. It comes from a British family but the government is unlikely to prevent it leaving the country. The miniature is by Hans Holbein, a double portrait of the Tudor statesman Thomas Cromwell in a single frame. In 1932 it sold at Christie's for Pounds 2,000. This time a price of about Pounds 500,000 is expected.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.: PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles attorney Patricia Phillips, a member of the state bar's Board of  Governors, is spearheading an effort to persuade lawyers to be nicer to each  other.  </P> <P> Phillips, co-chairwoman of the board's Statewide Committee on Professionalism  and Public Action, said she's concerned about the "growing numbers of personal  dogfights" in the courtroom, a problem that seems to be intensifying as  attorneys' ranks increase. The herd in Los Angeles County now numbers about  32,000.  </P> <P> Phillips has proposed a "Code of Professional Courtesy," which she borrowed  from a Texas bar association.  </P> <P>  All right, you attorneys out there. Raise your right hands and repeat the  following provisions of the code:  </P> <P>  "I will return telephone calls."  </P> <P> "I will not be late for court or for appointments."  </P> <P> "I will cooperate with my opponent as much as possible."  </P> <P> "I will never take cheap shots."  </P> <P> The code, needless to say, would be voluntary.  </P> <P> "The law is a ass," Mr. Bumble says in "Oliver Twist."  </P> <P> And it can be peculiar in Los Angeles, where citizens who tear down illegally  posted signs on city property could face legal problems because the signs are  technically personal property.  </P> <P> Only law enforcement officers and city Public Works employees are empowered to  take down such placards, said Christopher Westhoff, a deputy city attorney. In  one case, he said, "someone who took down a real estate company's signs on city  property was sued by the company and had to settle out of court."  </P> <P> "The law needs changing," said Tom LaBonge, deputy to City Councilman John  Ferraro.  </P> <P> The city attorney's office is drafting an ordinance that would deem illegally  posted signs as "abandoned," Westhoff said, and, therefore, ripe to be torn  down.  </P> <P> De Von Smith, a 61-year-old junk dealer from Wampum, Pa., arrived in town  Tuesday, lugging what he says is the world's largest birthday card.  </P> <P> It's a 53-pound, 1,500-foot-long strip of papers bearing about 35,000  signatures. The card commemorates the birthdays of the U.S. Constitution and  George Washington.  </P> <P> "I thought this was a way that average people, as well as celebrities, could  get involved in a patriotic project," Smith said.  </P> <P> Over the past two years, traveling on a bus pass donated by Greyhound Lines, he  has collected signatures at such diverse spots as Indian reservations in  Montana, college campuses in Idaho and shopping malls in Florida. He also  pasted in signatures from such celebrities as then-Vice President George Bush,  Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and actresses Mary Tyler Moore and Lynn Redgrave.  </P> <P> Smith plans to present his card to the White House next year in time for the  200th anniversary of the ratification of the Constitution.  </P> <P> He'd hate to be late and have to transfer all those signatures to a card that  says, "Belated wishes . . . "  </P> <P> Bill Keene, KNX's traffic reporter, received a letter the other day from his  most prominent car-phone tipster, Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony.  </P> <P> "He was a bit upset about one reference to him 'making a call in his limousi"  Keene related. "He pointed out that not only does he drive himself, but he has  an 'unpretentious Oldsmobile.' "  </P> <P> The freeway force hasn't lost a volunteer, though.  </P> <P> "The archbishop said he'd continue to make calls," Keene said.  </P> <P> Either from his car or from his new helicopter.  </P> <P> Everything's for sale . . .  </P> <P> A reporter, researching a story about the recent murders of prostitutes in  South-Central Los Angeles, approached a lady of the night on Figueroa Street.  The media-wise hooker yelled: "Five dollars a question, five dollars a  question."  </P> <P> Expense account limitations being what they are, that was the end of the  interview.  </P></p>

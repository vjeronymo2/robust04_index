			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Japan economy to 'contract 0.4%' Japan's economy will contract by 0.4 per cent next fiscal year, according to the Nomura Research Institute, which blamed the expected shrinkage on a continuing fall in corporate earnings and capital spending in coming months. The gloomy forecast by the leading private research institute was followed by a Daiwa Research Institute prediction that Japanese corporate profits will fall for the fifth successive term in the year beginning from April. Responding to indications of a deepening downturn, leaders of Japan's coalition government said yesterday preparations for a stimulatory package are likely to begin next week, when a supplementary budget is expected to complete its passage through parliament. Meanwhile, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the leading business grouping, said the government should stimulate the property market to assist banks attempting to clear away their mountain of bad property loans. The NRI forecast for next year was based on the presumption that the government will introduce another spending package and cut taxes, and that the official discount rate will be reduced from the present record low of 1.75 per cent to 1 per cent by the Bank of Japan. In the current year to March, NRI expects the economy will contract by 1.1 per cent, and it can see no signs of the recovery officially expected to arrive in the first few months of next year.</p>

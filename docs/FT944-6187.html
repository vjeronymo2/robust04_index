			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Alcoholic drinks mainly unchanged The duty rates on beer, spirits and cider and table wine were left unchanged. The decision reflects a number of considerations, including the position of the industry, levels of duty elsewhere in the single market, and the desire to simplify the duty structure where possible and eliminate anomalies. There will be changes in some of the minor wine duties. The duty (including consequential VAT) on fortified wine is being reduced by 13p for a 75 cl bottle, in line with previous international agreements, and the duty on sparkling wine is being aligned with fortified wine to remove the present anomaly whereby sparkling wine is charged more duty than fortified wine although fortified wine is stronger. The duty on a typical 75 cl bottle of sparkling wine will be reduced by 27p (including VAT). The changes take place from 1 January 1995. The estimated revenue cost from these changes is Pounds 10m in 1995/96 compared.</p>

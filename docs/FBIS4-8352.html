			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Undecided Voters With Antipathies"] </F>   [Text] Before the elections, when deciding on which party  to vote for, the voters apply both positive and negative  considerations. Thus, they regard some parties as worthy of  their votes and exclude others. However, at the end of this  decision process, some kind of positive approach emerges in the  actual voting, because voters do vote in favor of some party  after all. According to the Szonda Ipsos opinion poll, 12  percent of the citizens only express their antipathy at the  moment: They only name the parties for which they would  definitely not vote, but they do not name the parties for which  they might vote. We asked 3,000 people in February and March  1994, and we are only considering those of voting age now.    The exclusivity of party aversion is mainly characteristic  of  high school and university graduates, and 15 percent of each  group mentioned a party they would definitely not vote for, and  these have not formulated a clear sympathy either. The higher  the educational level, the more people can be listed among those  with party aversion. The same applies to the positive approach:  The more educated they are, the more probable it is that they  are sympathetic toward a certain party. We also found another  characteristic among those who expressed their lack of  preference: They can be found mostly in the towns (15 percent  in Budapest and 13 percent in provincial towns), rather than in  the villages (8 percent). However, we could find no age  differences: This attitude is equally characteristic of old  people, middle-aged people, and young people.    Some 29 percent of those who have a negative approach to the  political parties regard the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] as  the most disliked party. This list continues with the  Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], with 21 percent of the  people rejecting it. The fourth on this negative "top list" is  the Labor Party with 13 percent, closely followed by the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] with 12 percent. Few show any  definite antipathy toward the other parties: 7 percent  mentioned the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], 6 percent  the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], 4 percent the  Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], and 2 percent the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. The negative preferences of  the intelligentsia within this group slightly differ from the  average: More intellectuals exclude the FGKP than the MDF.    No one in this group has a party preference that he would  vote for, but this does not mean that these people will renounce  their right to vote. Their willingness to vote is above  average: Some 69 percent of these regard themselves as certain  voters if the elections were held today, and 18 percent said  they would probably vote. This considerable desire to vote will  probably mean actual participation in the elections in May.  These people's election forecasts can provide some basis to the  question of their actual voting preferences. Lacking a clear  party preference, it is possible that they will vote for a party  that they think will win the elections. Several people forecast  the victory of two parties: Some 17 percent think that the SZDSZ  will win, and 16 percent think that the MSZP will win. Only 7  percent think of the MDF and 5 percent the Fidesz as victors.  As for the other parties, these give them minimal chances of  victory. There is still a great deal of uncertainty in this  group because 48 percent did not mention any party.    Therefore, this group of people with party aversion is a  politically active group, and the current opposition parties can  count heavily on their votes; but not so the government  coalition parties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  (Christian Democratic Union) is pressing for Bundeswehr  participation in international UN missions. In a speech marking  the renaming of the General Schwartzkopf barracks as the  Lieutenant General Count von Baudissin barracks, Ruehe called  for German "sharing of responsibility for the protection of  freedom, against genocide and against disregard for human  rights."    If Germany does not take on this responsibility, then it is  isolating itself in the community of nations. International  Bundeswehr missions are therefore not a secondary military  issue. They take account of increased international  responsibility and are decisive for determining Germany's  abilities as a member of Europe and its credibility as an  alliance partner.    Ruehe added that during their UN missions in Iraq, Bosnia,  Cambodia, and Somalia the Bundeswehr soldiers had "proven their  military capability and their great ability to empathize." In  this way they visibly showed their support for the values of the  constitution and solidarity in the community of nations.</p>

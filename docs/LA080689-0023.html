			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> . . . Look for Hollywood magazine to premiere across the country on Sept. 1  with a $2 cover price. Managing editor Stephen M. Silverman calls the tone  "slightly irreverent and entertainingly skeptical." He confessed that the first  issue will include a piece on . . . his own upcoming book on director David  Lean.  </P> <P> . . . Adrienne Barbeau seems firmly established as the new queen of B Horror  flicks: She's set to star in "Two Evil Eyes," with Italian horror meister Dario  Argento and George Romero and Argento directing. And she's now on video shelves  in "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death."  </P></p>

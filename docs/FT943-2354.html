			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Halifax raises interest rates to borrowers Halifax Building Society, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, yesterday raised the standard variable interest rate it charges borrowers by 0.46 percentage points, taking it to 8.1 per cent. Interest-rate movements have often given financial institutions an opportunity to widen their interest margins, but the competitive pressure on organisations to pass on higher interest rates to investors was underlined yesterday as National Savings announced a new issue of higher returns on its fixed-rate products. Its variable rate products remain unchanged. National Savings' response to the 0.5 percentage points increase in base interest rates last Monday includes the pensioners' guaranteed income bond, which was launched in last year's Budget. The bond was seen by societies as partly responsible for the net outflows of retail deposits suffered early this year. Halifax has not yet announced the new rates it plans to offer on its savings accounts but said it would 'pass on whatever we can to our savers'. The society's results for the six months to the end of July showed that, like others in the sector, its margins had narrowed since last year. The increase in the rate paid by most of Halifax's 1.8m borrowers is the biggest yet by a lender in response to last week's increase in base rates, and is set to trigger rises from other lenders in the coming days. The society withdrew its range of fixed-rate mortgages last week and is not currently offering fixed-rate home loans. Barclays Bank also announced an increase yesterday - of 0.36 percentage points, taking its standard variable rate to 8.1 per cent. Last week it announced a rise of 0.5 percentage points in some of its savings rates. Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, and Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second biggest society, raised their mortgage rates last Monday - by smaller percentages than Halifax, but from the higher base of 7.74 per cent. At 7.64 per cent the standard variable rate offered by Halifax was among the most competitive on offer. It acknowledged that the next move in interest rates would be upwards but said there was no need for sharp increases and suggestions of steep rises were damaging for confidence. It said: 'To see speculation about rates in double figures does nobody any good.' So far, however, last week's rise had had only a 'minimal impact' on the housing market. Other lenders have, however, expressed greater concern about the adverse effect of the rise, particularly given its timing at the start of the important autumn sales period. Monthly mortgage lending figures have given a picture of a fragile and uncertain recovery in the housing market over the summer.</p>

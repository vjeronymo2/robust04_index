			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW ZEALAND;  </P> <P> MAORI ACTIVISTS HECKLE THE QUEEN  </P> <P> Radicals campaigning for Maori rights heckled Queen Elizabeth II in New Zealand  during celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of a treaty between Maori  chiefs and British colonial authorities.  </P> <P> One young woman was arrested for throwing a T-shirt at the British monarch. The  queen, accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, appeared shaken by the  incident in Waitangi. Maoris are descendants of Polynesians who arrived in what  is now New Zealand more than 1,000 years ago. Radicals say New Zealand  governments have not honored the treaty, which guaranteed them possession of  their lands.  </P></p>

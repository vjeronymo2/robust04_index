			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARKANSAS, FLORIDA STATE, MIAMI EYE SEC EXPANSION;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: WOULD CONSIDER JOINING CONFERENCE IF EXTENDED AN INVITATION, SCHOOLS'  ATHLETIC DIRECTORS SAY.  </P> <P> Athletic directors at Arkansas, Florida State and Miami say their schools would  consider joining the Southeastern Conference if the league extended an  invitation.  </P> <P> The schools have agreed to be placed under consideration for acceptance, the  athletic directors said.  </P> <P> Conference Commissioner Roy Kramer said the 10-team SEC, whose presidents  unanimously voted to explore expansion two weeks ago, is only in the  preliminary process of determining which schools might be interested.  </P> <P> Kramer would not discuss the candidates and said there is no timetable for when  the SEC might extend formal bids to join.  </P> <P> Kramer and athletic directors from across the nation were attending the  National Assn. of Collegiate Directors of Athletics convention, which continues  through Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I think realignment (of major conferences) is inevitable," Louisiana State  Athletic Director Joe Dean said Monday. "This is somewhat of a  television-driven thing."  </P> <P> Arkansas has been in the Southwest Conference for 76 years. Florida State is an  independent in football and a Metro Conference member in other sports. Miami is  an independent in all sports.  </P> <P> "There are very few schools that can make it as an independent," Miami Athletic  Director Sam Jankovich said. "We can make it as an independent. But you have to  look at what is down the road 10 years from now."  </P> <P> Should Arkansas join, it might open the door for SWC brethren Texas and Texas  A&amp;M to be considered by the SEC. Texas' big television market is attractive  to the SEC.  </P></p>

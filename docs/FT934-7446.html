			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn cuts interim deficit to Pounds 1.4m SHARPLY LOWER provisions enabled Porter Chadburn, the packaging, consumer products and specialist distributor, to cut its losses from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 1.4m pre-tax for the half year to October 1. However, the directors said the group's performance over the period had been poor with operating profits last time of Pounds 2.2m pre-exceptionals being turned into losses of Pounds 62,000.

Turnover declined to Pounds 66.3m (Pounds 67.4m). Exceptional charges, mainly provisions for withdrawing from certain lossmaking operations, accounted for Pounds 675,000 compared with Pounds 7m previously. Packaging returned operating profits of Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 2.29m) on turnover of Pounds 30m (Pounds 23.9m), consumer products incurred a loss of Pounds 1.32m (profits Pounds 729,000) on turnover of Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 30.6m) while specialist distribution profits fell from Pounds 379,000 to Pounds 179,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.75m (Pounds 8.13m).

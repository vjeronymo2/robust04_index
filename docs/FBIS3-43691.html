			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] In Dakar, the principle of devaluing our common  currency, the CFA franc, has been accepted although leaders of  the 14 members countries of the franc zone, are still examining  the issue. In fact, a devaluation risks to have consequences on  the purchasing power of the people of Niger. It will therefore  be necessary to mitigate the social cost of the action.    With the very probable devaluation of the CFA franc, the  uncertainty of the people of Niger is great, especially  concerning the hike in prices and the significant fall in the  purchasing power of workers which could cause obvious social  upheavals with unpredictable consequences. To prevent such a  situation, discussions began a long time ago at the Ministry of  Finance and Plan to define and draw up relief measures capable  of reducing the social cost of devaluation. To avoid inflation  of prices of local products, the government hopes to take  measures to avoid the increase in the prices of some local  products.    Concerning imported goods, the authorities are thinking of  subsidizing the cost of essential commodities. Concerning the  debt, it will especially be necessary to seek its cancellation  or to have it reduced. According to Mr. Abou Nasseba, head of  the economic and social reform department, acting for the  director of economic and financial journalism, the creation of a  social fund of between 20 and 40 billion CFA francs has been  envisaged.    [Begin recording] [Nasseba] This social fund will be used in  mitigating the negative effects of devaluation in Niger.    [Unidentified reporter] What are the concrete that measures  the government wishes to take to stop the increase in the prices  of fuel and other commodities?    [Nasseba] Well, concerning energy, we have envisaged the  holding of negotiations with our principal supplier which is  Nigeria.    [Reporter] (?Presently), do we know what Nigeria's reactions  will be following the devaluation of our currency?    [Nasseba] Personally, this morning I followed [words  indistinct] which came yesterday and we must now adopt an  economic policy which will apparently or totally favor us. In  other words, Nigeria will return to the system of daily rates --  I think it is 22 naira to $1 -- so negotiations must begin with  that country to reach an understanding in order to limit  increases to relatively acceptable levels. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Concerning state functionaries, can we expect any  salary increase in order to favor purchasing power of workers?    [Nasseba] Yes, but [words indistinct], unofficial according  to the calculations made with the [words indistinct] proposed, a  salary increase of almost 18 percent has been envisaged for the  year 1994 and probably, concerning salary arrears, measures will  be taken so that, at least, one or two months of arrears can be  paid in an attempt to mitigate the initial shocks of the price  hikes. At any rate, as a first step, there will be [words  indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

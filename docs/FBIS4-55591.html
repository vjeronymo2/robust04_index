			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 17 (AFP) -- Cease-fire violations are  becoming increasingly common in Sarajevo where frequent sniper  fire was reported Tuesday, the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  said Tuesday [17 May]. UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said  shooting in the center of Sarajevo "has been steadily  increasing" and was of great concern to the UNPROFOR and the  country's warring factions which means those responsible "are  probably uncontrolled" elements. He said Bosnian Serb troops  targeted a French Gazelle helicopter Monday as it was flying  over Ilijas, some about 15 kilometres (10 miles) northwest of  Sarajevo, but the pilot and crew were not injured.    Two armoured French vehicles were also targeted in the  capital Monday. The shooting is in violation of a ceasefire  agreement signed by Bosnia's warring parties in February after  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization threatened air strikes.  Annink said that elsewhere in Bosnia the military activity was  centered near the northern town of Tuzla. He said UN military  observers stationed in the region counted more than 80  explosions in various areas Monday. Mortar explosions were also  reported in eastern and western Bosnia.</p>

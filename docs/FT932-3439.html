			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Monday Interview: Apostle of low inflation - Donald Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, speaks to Kevin Brown Mr Donald Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, is rare among central bankers: he has also been an active politician. He might have been appointed finance minister in the present conservative government had he not been deprived of a safe parliamentary seat by a by-election protest vote 12 years ago. Yet it is hard to see how he could have had more impact on New Zealand from the Beehive, the government building, than he now has from the governor's office across the road. In four and a half years as governor, he has presided over a fall in the rate of inflation from 9 per cent to 1 per cent. More important, the consensus among economists is that price stability can be maintained, extraneous shocks aside. Government ministers, from the present prime minister down, praise Mr Brash's skills highly in private, and even Mr Mike Moore, the Labour opposition leader, says he has great admiration for Mr Brash's handling of monetary policy. Interviewed in his spartan office, Mr Brash is keen to talk about New Zealand's victory over inflation, but modest about his own role. Softly spoken and reticent, he is flattered by overseas interest, if a little surprised at the form some of the praise has taken. With a laugh, he refuses to comment on the suggestion by Samuel Brittan of the FT that he should have been appointed governor of the Bank of England. Mr Brash does not claim sole credit for transforming New Zealand's inflation prospects. Radical labour market deregulation and fiscal prudence by the conservative National party government have helped to reduce inflationary pressures. He is also becoming something of an apostle for New Zealand's innovative Reserve Bank Act, passed with cross-party support by the former Labour government in 1990, which put ultimate responsibility for fighting inflation in the governor's lap. Mr Brash will be evangelising on the benefits of central bank independence in London this Thursday in a speech to the European Policy Forum, the free-market think-tank. He will resist the temptation to present the New Zealand model as a complete solution to the UK's inflation problems. But his elucidation of the act's 'elegant constitutional structure' will add weight to those, such as the combative Mrs Ruth Richardson, New Zealand's finance minister, who believe it would transplant relatively easily to the UK. The act marked a watershed for New Zealand, which had suffered double-digit inflation for most of the 20 years since 1970, with the exception of an artificial fall during a prices freeze in 1983-84. Supporters claim the act achieves a compromise between the relative subservience of Threadneedle Street to the UK government and the independence of the US Federal Reserve and Germany's Bundesbank. As with the Bundesbank, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has total independence in the operation of monetary and exchange rate policy, subject to the provision that its sole objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. But the act leaves the definition of price stability to the government, which sets a target range for inflation in the form of a personal contract with the governor, usually for a fixed five-year term. The government can amend the contract, by fiat or by negotiation, but any change must be made formally and publicly, ensuring that monetary policy is always transparent. The government can also fire the governor if he fails to achieve the target but, contrary to popular belief, his salary is not directly linked to inflation performance. The act has made Mr Brash a symbol of New Zealand's commitment to low inflation, and no one was surprised when Mrs Richardson announced nine months early that he would be reappointed for five years from this September. His contract will require inflation to be maintained at 0-2 per cent - effectively a continuation of the existing contract, which required him to reduce inflation to 0-2 per cent between 1990 and September 1993. The government's role in choosing the governor means the bank is only as independent as its leader. It would be possible, concedes Mr Brash, for a government to relax its anti-inflationary stance, for example, by appointing a compliant governor or by pressing an incumbent hoping for reappointment to accept a renegotiation of the target. But he argues that the openness of the system, combined with the disciplines imposed by the financial markets, make it unlikely that any government would take the risk. 'It is obviously important to have someone in the post who strongly believes in price stability, but the framework does make it more difficult to derive the essentially short-term benefits of pushing inflation up. 'The incentives for a government to do that are not great because they have to make their intentions clear. An instantaneous bond market reaction would follow any loosening of the target by an injudicious amendment of the contract; governments know that.' But these are hypothetical problems. In practice, the most frequent complaint against Mr Brash is that he has pursued low inflation with excessive zeal, at high social cost. Mr Ken Douglas, president of the Council of Trade Unions and a critic of the act, claims the central bank put the economy into shock by disinflating too rapidly, causing a loss of confidence and high unemployment: 'We have been an international experiment for the mad scientists from the International Monetary Fund. No other economy has been as savagely restructured as ours.' Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Brash hints that the initial target may indeed have been too rigorous. It was 'very narrow', and he admits it left little leeway for forecasting errors. He also concedes that the bank made mistakes in manipulating the 'crude steering device' of monetary policy, particularly during the trough of the New Zealand recession in 1991, when inflation fell faster than expected. But he rejects the suggestion that the bank contributed to the depth or length of the recession, arguing that the long-term benefits of rapid disinflation greatly outweigh the short-term pain. 'New Zealand has incurred all sorts of costs through being late into the disinflation game, but one of the advantages was that we were able to learn lessons from what had been done elsewhere,' he says. 'For example, in many of the countries where disinflation has been achieved, wage settlements have not been moderated, so that when the foot came off the monetary brake inflation took off again. The bank's most significant achievement, he says, has been a change in inflationary expectations. 'One of the most important things that has happened is that, regardless of whether people agree with the policy, they know that miserable bloke in the Reserve Bank is going to keep pursuing it.' Selling this message is becoming easier as New Zealand consolidates what appears to be a sustainable economic recovery. Growth in GDP reached 3 per cent in the 12 months to December, and is widely forecast to be 2.5 to 3 per cent for the next two years. But Mr Brash chooses his words carefully when asked if the New Zealand model could deliver similar results in other countries. Mrs Richardson asserts that the act is part of New Zealand's 'exportable economic policy technology'. Mr Brash, however, says the act 'nicely balances the understandable desire on the part of an elected government to have an involvement in the target-setting process with the universally agreed fact that independent central banks are able to deliver low inflation rates at lower costs than central banks which are subject to very close political direction. 'It is a very useful bulwark against any government which might wish to return to the bad old days of saying one thing to the public (about the need to control inflation) and at the same time trying to get mortgage rates down before an election. That is the sort of thing which used to happen in New Zealand, and cannot happen now.' PERSONAL FILE 1940 Born, Wanganui.

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Trial shines light into dark Mexican corners: Drug case puts political system in dock MEXICO is accustomed to being portrayed by the US as corrupt and violent, but rarely can the charges have been as serious as those levelled last week during the trial of Dr Humberto Alvarez Machain. The Mexican doctor is accused by US federal prosecutors of aiding the 1985 murder and torture of a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) official, Mr Enrique Camarena. According to two witnesses called by the US government, Mexico's then interior minister, governor of Jalisco and defence minister were all in the pay of the Guadalajara drug cartel. The witnesses also claimed that the ministers and governor were present at meetings in which Mr Camarena's murder was planned and visited the house where Mr Camarena was held on the day he was killed. In the view of the Mexican government - already furious at the kidnapping by the DEA of Dr Alvarez Machain from Mexico, which enabled the trial to go ahead - the charges are 'based on the testimony of delinquents and criminals who do not merit credibility in light of their personal history'. Such an opinion has gained some sympathy in Mexico. The witnesses are convicted criminals, who have been offered immunity (and money) by the US government to testify and may convince the Los Angeles judge presiding over the trial. He was expected to decide yesterday afternoon whether to dismiss the case against Dr Alvarez Machain for lack of evidence. But to critics of Mexico's political system, the charges are an indictment of the state that has enabled the implicated officials to rise to such important positions. The two government ministers accused in the trial are not only quintessential products of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, but also close colleagues of former President Miguel de la Madrid and current President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Mr Manuel Bartlett, the interior minister at the time of the Camarena murder, has worked in the Finance, Budget, and Foreign ministries, was education minister until earlier this year. He has just been elected governor of Puebla state. At one point he was favoured to succeed Mr de la Madrid as president. Mr Enrique Alvarez de Castillo has been governor of Jalisco, attorney-general, and is now the director of the state bank, Banobras, while Gen Juan Arevalo Dardoqui, the former defence minister, is a career army man. For the Mexican government, allegations against such senior officials could not have come at a worse time. It is now trying to build ties with Mr Bill Clinton's incoming administration and convince the US public that Mexico is a worthy member of the proposed North American free trade area. The description of the torture of Mr Camarena by Mexican police, drug traffickers and possibly senior government officials, in retribution for his success as a DEA agent, will have done little to help that cause. The accusations, whether true or not, are also likely to draw attention to the greatest flaw in the Mexican state: corruption in the legal and political system - hardly touched by President Salinas's economic reforms. In practically all the big drug scandals over the past decade, be it the murder of Mr Camarena, the prison riot between rival drug gangs at Matamoros last year, or the shoot-out between the army and police in Veracruz this year, police, army or government officials have been implicated in narcotics trafficking. The police are also largely responsible for Mexico's dismal human rights record, another issue likely to be raised by the US Congress when considering the free trade agreement. As Mr Jorge Carpizo, president of the government's human rights commission, put it: 'Police officers who engage in torture are neither sadists nor deranged. . . . They know that in most cases, even when they exceed themselves to the point of homicide, they will not be punished because their chiefs will defend or cover up for them.' Mexico's politicians in turn are protected not just by a malleable police force and legal system, but by television and most newspapers, which try not to embarrass senior government officials. The owner and publisher of the Mexico City News, Mexico's English-language daily, blocked unflattering articles on Mr Bartlett in the run-up to the Puebla election earlier this year. In a similar vein, the investigative weekly, Proceso, claims state officials working for Mr Bartlett tried to buy up all Puebla copies of the December 6 edition, which featured charges against Mr Bartlett on the front cover, in a futile attempt to prevent the magazine falling into the hands of the public.</p>

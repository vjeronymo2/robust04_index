			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Kingdom and Yemen's Interests"] </F>   [Text] The claims that the kingdom is taking a biased stand  toward the Yemen war are both baseless and unjustifiable. For  the Kingdom's Yemen policy, as attested to by the Yemeni people,  has always sought to promote the lot of the Yemeni people, and  to boost their abilities through the huge financial assistance  granted to Yemen. This assistance was used to finance  development projects that were instrumental in making the  qualitative leap forward seen in the areas of education, health,  road construction, and other vital sectors in Yemen. The  Kingdom made undeniable contributions to this commendable  cultural leap forward.    It is not peculiar for the Kingdom, given its huge economic  prowess, to assist its brothers in Yemen. For, it has always  been known for aiding Arabs and Muslims whenever it could. This  is the reflection of a policy espoused since the unification of  the Kingdom. This policy is still in force. The kingdom has  not sought to take advantage of all the wealth and resources  bestowed upon it by God to the exclusion of others. It has  always extended a helping hand to fellow Arabs and Muslims in  pursuit of this sound policy and its spirit, which is derived  from the injunctions of the tolerant Islamic religion and its  sublime heavenly ideals.    Given all this, it is strange to see the northerners claim  that the kingdom's position on Yemeni developments harms the  interests of the Yemeni people, and that the kingdom is involved  in the ongoing conflict between Sanaa and Aden when they are  well aware that the Kingdom stressed the need to heed reason and  halt the war between the two warring sides to protect Yemen's  interests and end the bloodletting there even before the passage  of the UN cease-fire resolution. The northerners are also aware  that the Kingdom was one of the first countries to have blessed  Yemeni unity when it was established by agreement between the  two parts of Yemen four years ago. The Kingdom did so because  it has always been interested in promoting the interests of  Yemen and the prosperity of its people.    What is going on in fraternal Yemen nowadays can in no way  promote the interests of the people in the two parts of Yemen.  This is because war produces disastrous consequences. The  continuation of the war in Yemen will produce devastation there.  This will destroy the economic infrastructures built there,  thanks to the contributions made by the Kingdom to promote the  Yemenis' interests and bring about their prosperity. War could  only produce further ruination, destruction, and devastation for  both parts of Yemen. That is why the Kingdom hastened to support  the UN cease-fire resolution. The kingdom wants an end to the  heinous massacres to which the cities of southern Yemen are  being exposed, because they have opposed a unity meant to be  built on the dead bodies of the Yemeni people.    The Kingdom cannot take the blame for the mistakes Sanaa has  made--mistakes that have exacerbated and complicated the  political crisis in Yemen and caused it to flare up in a  military confrontation with the south. The Kingdom's political  constants cannot allow for intervention in Yemen's domestic  affairs. Nonetheless, the Kingdom is interested in helping the  Yemeni people overcome their current ordeal. Hence, its support  for the UN cease-fire resolution. Additionally, the Kingdom is  willing to help any Arab or Islamic efforts that could help to  settle the ongoing conflict in a manner that would halt the  bloodletting in Yemen and place Yemeni interests above all  considerations.    Given all this, the Kingdom rejects the baseless allegations  that it is involved in the ongoing conflict between north Yemen  and south Yemen. At the same time, the Kingdom would like to  reiterate that it is determined to work to safeguard the  interests of the fraternal Yemeni people. It goes without  saying that the Yemeni people's interests are not promoted when  Sanaa violates the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution.  Likewise, their interests are not served when Sanaa sticks to  a unity that is opposed by the southerners. This is because  unity cannot be built by the force of arms. Similarly, the  interests of the Yemeni people are not served when this war  continues to kill scores of innocent children, women, and  elderly in Aden, and to destroy vital economic installations  just to realize transient selfish interests.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIEWS OF TODAY'S AFI FILM FEST  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'Konitz: Portrait of the Artist as a Saxophonist'  </P> <P> Canada, 1988, 83 minutes  </P> <P> 6:45 p.m.  </P> <P>  The music, by "cool" school alto saxophonist Lee Konitz -- a member of Lennie  Tristano's group and a major presence on the Miles Davis-Gil Evans 1950  trail-blazer, "Birth of the Cool" -- is fine, and so is Konitz's company; he is  a self-effacing guy with an occasional dry wit and an air of sweet, pleasant  gravity. (His accompanist, pianist Harold Danko is a dark, intense fireball.)  But Robert Daudelin's documentary is visually flat, cinematically bland; its  only strategy is to ease us into the jazz and the anecdotes, which, thankfully,  are sometimes enough.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 29, IRNA -- Iran's foreign Ministry  Tuesday [28 June] categorically denied allegations made by the  Zionist regime on the presence of an Israeli pilot in Iran and  termed it as "sheer lie".    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and the Zionist  regime's  Air Force commander recently had claimed that Ron Arad, an  Israeli pilot whose plane crashed in 1986 while bombarding south  Lebanon, is in Iran.    An informed source at the Foreign Ministry in a contact with  IRNA categorically rejected the allegations and stressed "the  Zionists were following other objectives by repeating such  baseless and unfounded claims."</p>

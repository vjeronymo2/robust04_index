			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / White House pushes gun curbs: World News Digest The Clinton administration has begun an all-out drive to win support for a ban on assault weapons and large-magazine guns, but still faces possible defeat when the measure comes to a vote in the House of Representatives later this week, writes George Graham in Washington. White House officials acknowledge they are still around 15 votes short in the House. The proposed law closely resembles a measure included last year by the Senate in a much broader crime bill, and would outlaw 19 specific weapons, as well as high capacity magazines. It would also impose a more general ban on semi-automatic weapons which have additional features such as flash suppressors, but would specifically exempt more than 600 types of gun considered to have a legitimate sporting purpose.</p>

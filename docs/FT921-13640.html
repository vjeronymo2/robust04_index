			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (13): Car makers set the pace - Private industry is the key to growth IF ANY sector is to create prosperity for Egypt it is industry. Already the fastest growing part of the economy, industry is facing new challenges. A shift to greater reliance on private enterprise and exports has recently accelerated as the government launches privatisation plans, liberalises rules for trade and investment, and restructures the state sector which still accounts for half of industrial output. In a clear sign of re-ordered priorities, the Egyptian government last year gave General Motors and Japan's Suzuki approval to build passenger cars. Both companies have assembled commercial vehicles in Egypt since the mid-1980s, but had been unable to overcome the entrenched opposition of state-owned carmaker NASCO, which feared that its own inefficiently produced, outdated models could be squeezed from the highly protected local market. Analysts now expect Egypt's car production to nudge 30,000 vehicles a year by 1995, with an average 40-50 per cent local content. Government industry officials admit that the granting of the licences marks a policy change. During its flirtation with state planning in the 1960s Egypt nationalised traditional industries such as textiles and concentrated investment in heavy industry. The public sector was managed as an extension of the burgeoning welfare state, providing guaranteed employment and producing cheap and often subsidised goods. Since the 1970s the private sector's share of industrial output has grown from 15 per cent to more than 50 per cent, according to figures from the government's General Organisation for Industrialisation. Attractive investment incentives and a divestment programme by which the state plans to sell some Dollars 850m in shares it holds in joint ventures will soon widen the private sector's lead, Egyptian analysts say. Already, new investment in heavy industries such as a Dollars 138m specialised steels project, a 120,000 tonne capacity paper mill and the expansion of the large Alexandria National Iron and Steel plant have been almost entirely privately financed. Dr Mohammed Abdel Wahab, who as Egypt's Minister of Industry oversees some 150 state-owned enterprises with combined annual sales of around Dollars 5bn, says that Egypt has turned away from its long-standing policy of import substitution. 'We are now looking to the global, not the local market,' he says. Dr Abdel Wahab believes that the current major shake-up of the public sector, signed into law last year, will help to further this goal. 'Law 203 was the most important event of 1991,' he says, describing its effect as to lower an 'iron curtain' between government and the industries it owns. Under the law, all state industries - including some outside the purview of the Industry Ministry - will be organised into Italian style sectoral holding companies responsible to a single Public Sector Minister. The holding companies will be given unprecedented freedom to map strategy, appoint management, raise capital and, perhaps most importantly, to sell off assets. 'Some holding companies will have to sell successful parts to pay to restructure bad parts,' says Dr Abdel Wahab, but adds: 'We want privatisation to be a tool for restructuring, not an objective in itself.' The minister promises that private and public sector companies will soon operate under precisely the same rules. Already the two compete on equal terms for capital and foreign exchange, and will soon pay the same prices for energy. The government has stopped financing enterprises from its own budget; state owned companies must find their own resources. Dr Adel Gazarine, a former chief executive of NASCO who now runs a private consultancy, believes the new public sector law will be useful as a transition. But ultimately, he says, some state industries are likely to die. During a recent visit, International Finance Corporation director Sir William Ryrie said he believed Egypt was on the verge of a period of sustained growth in which industry would play a growing role. 'Egypt is at the same stage Turkey was at 10 years ago,' said the IFC official, adding that as a sign of confidence the World Bank's private finance arm planned to invest up to Dollars 80m a year in Egypt.</p>

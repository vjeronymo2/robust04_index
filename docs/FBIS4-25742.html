			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Beijing: "Lu Ping Emphasizes Hong </F> Kong's Economic Status and Further Warns Against Becoming a  Political City"]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (TA KUNG PAO),-- Lu Ping, director  of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office noted  that Hong Kong should give full play to its favorable conditions  as a city "with the mainland behind and Southeast Asia in  front," coordinating and cooperating with the China mainland and  each supporting the other. In this way Hong Kong will be able  to ensure its prosperity and stability; otherwise, if Hong Kong  and the mainland are against each other and confront each other,  "then, I think, Hong Kong will be finished and will have no  future!" he said.    After saying this he disclosed: "President Jiang Zemin did  mention this point when he met with the people from the (Hong  Kong) Federation of Trade Unions recently."    Talking about what Hong Kong should do to give full play to  its own advantages, Lu Ping told a visiting group from the  Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong: Now Hong Kong  enjoys a very great advantage, that is, the opportunity offered  by the development of the cities in mainland China and the  reform and opening up of the mainland. Hong Kong's position as  a city "with the mainland behind and Southeast Asia in front" is  a very big advantage which the three other little dragons of  Asia do not possess. In addition, as the China mainland is  carrying on the economic opening up and reform, China's economy  will be increasingly prosperous. This situation is very  favorable to Hong Kong.    He further pointed out: "In my opinion, therefore, Hong Kong  should consciously make use of this favorable situation and give  full play to this advantage. Only in this way can Hong Kong  retain prosperity." For this reason, "Hong Kong should maintain  a relationship of mutual support, mutual coordination, and  mutual cooperation with the China mainland, rather than a  relationship of confrontation, antagonism, and repulsion. If  the latter scenario takes place, that is, the relationship  between Hong Kong and the China mainland becomes a mutually  repulsive and mutually confrontational one then, I think, Hong  Kong will be finished and will have no future! President Jiang  Zemin did mention this point when he met with the people from  the Federation of Trade Unions today. We hope more Hong Kong  people will be aware of this."    He added that China hopes Hong Kong will be able to keep its  "economic superiority" and give full play to its economic role.  He said he does not want to see Hong Kong become a "political  city." The so-called "political city," he said, means a Hong  Kong being used to exert political influence on the mainland.  He reiterated that he did not mean that Hong Kong people should  be indifferent to politics but that Hong Kong should first of  all give full play to its economic superiority.    He warned that "Hong Kong will have no future if it is  turned  into a political city and is used to exert political influence  on the mainland." He stressed that Hong Kong and the China  mainland "should maintain a relationship of cooperation and  mutual support." "Only in this way will Hong Kong be able to  give full play to its role and be assured of prosperity and  stability."    Commenting on the relationship between Hong Kong and  Shanghai  in the 21st century regarding economic development, Lu Ping  said: The two cities will play their own roles and each will  make different contributions but they can complement and support  each other. Therefore, it will not be a case of Shanghai  replacing Hong Kong. He expressed his hope that Hong Kong  compatriots would realize that the state is now practicing a  very, very special policy toward Hong Kong, therefore Hong Kong  people should give play to their role and make greater  contributions in this respect.    He added that Hong Kong's future role does not lie in its  limited financial contributions to the state but in its status  as a window and bridge linking the country with the outside  world.</p>

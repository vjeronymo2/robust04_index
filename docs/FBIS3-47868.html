			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Senior officials of the Ministry of Finance [MOF]  voice dissatisfaction with the U.S. position in the insurance  sector negotiations of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  claiming "we cannot compromise in a one-sided, unreasonable, and  unfair negotiation." Japanese life and nonlife insurers also  agree with them. According to sources in the MOF and the  insurance industry, U.S. demands are all "unreasonable," and it  is rather the U.S. insurance market which is "closed."  Furthermore, the United States has been strongly critical of  the Japanese Government, the Japanese bureaucracy in particular,  even outside the framework talks. This has aggravated the  antipathy on the Japanese side.    Meetings on the insurance sector had been held on 10 and 11  January in Washington since the beginning of 1994. Yet, the gap  between the positions of the two countries have not narrowed.  Japan looks at the U.S. position as a completely uncritical  representation of the demands of some private companies, and  sees these demands as incoherent. Moreover, officials of the  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) are in charge of  the negotiations, and they are not knowledgeable about the  insurance sector, and "cannot conduct discussions based on the  actual market situation," (according to a senior MOF official).    Specific U.S. demands on the Japanese market include: 1)  clarification of the standards for approving new products; 2)  the introduction of a "broker" system, which is independent from  the insurance companies and recommends insurance companies for  the benefit of the clients; 3) reform of the insurance premium  computation association system; 4) expansion of foreign  companies' share in government-related insurance business; 5)  postponement of liberalization of the third sector, where both  life and nonlife insurance companies participate in the market;  6) rectifying the practice of insurance contracts between  "keiretsu" companies; and 7) adopting market share of foreign  companies as an objective criterion to gauge the openness of the  market.    Among these demands, for instance, the brokerage system has  not even been introduced in 12 states in the United States.  Furthermore, in the State of New York and several other states,  foreign insurance companies are required to put up property in  trust as the equivalent of reserve fund for liabilities; there  is actual discrimination against non-U.S. companies. The MOF  explains that "The Japanese insurance market is not closed  compared to the U.S. market, but the USTR does not know this."    With regard to the demand that liberalization in the third  sector be postponed for five years, Japan believes that "On the  whole, the United States demands the relaxation of regulations.  Yet, it wants postponement only in an area where foreign  companies are strong. That is self-serving."    Japan also strongly refutes the U.S. claim that foreign  insurance companies' share in the Japanese market is small, and  thus, the Japanese market is closed, asserting "the figures  cited are inaccurate." While the USTR claims that foreign share  in the U.S. market is 10 percent, a senior MOF official says  that Equitable Insurance, where Japanese and French insurance  companies hold a majority of the stock, is counted as a foreign  company, but foreign capital has no control in that company, and  "no American would consider Equitable a foreign company."    According to OECD statistics, foreign insurance companies'  share in the nonlife sector was 2.7 percent in Japan, and 0.9  percent in the United States in 1990. The MOF interprets this  to mean "you can say the U.S. market is more exclusionary." The  Japanese insurance industry also decries the fact that the share  of Japanese nonlife insurance companies is merely 0.1 percent in  the U.S. market, while "national treatment for foreign nonlife  insurance companies is being applied in Japan. It is rather the  U.S. insurance market which is closed" (according to Sotaro  Aoki, managing director of Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance  Company).    While Japan's current accounts surplus is the main reason  for  conducting the framework talks, in the case of the insurance  sector, the balance of payments between Japan and the United  States in fiscal 1990 showed a deficit of $420 million on the  part of Japan. The MOF and the insurance industry remain  doubtful if "insurance ought to have been an area of  negotiation."    Even though Japan sees the U.S. market to be more  exclusionary, the United States regards the framework talks as a  venue to correct the closedness of the Japanese market, and  refuses to do anything to rectify the U.S. market. In other  words, it takes the position of "rejecting two-way discussions."  It even demands prior consultation with the MOF on the  insurance system reform the ministry is undertaking at present.  MOF negotiators call this "saying whatever pleases them."    There is very little time left before the deadline of the  negotiations on 11 February, when a summit meeting will be held  between the leaders of both countries. Many in the MOF are of  the opinion that "we would like to deviate from the old pattern  of compromising in the end." Some even express the view that "a  compromise will rather undermine bilateral relations in the  future." Negotiations in the insurance sector are bound to  continue with the possibility of a breakdown constantly haunting  the negotiators.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Chevron helped by higher crude oil prices as earnings rise 21% CHEVRON, one of the biggest US oil and gas groups, yesterday reported a 21 per cent rise in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 378m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, compared with Dollars 313m, or 90 cents, a year ago. Stripping out special items and foreign exchange in both years, Chevron said earnings doubled to Dollars 419m, or Dollars 1.23, from Dollars 210, or 60 cents. Revenues advanced 11 per cent to Dollars 11.1bn, from Dollars 10bn. Chevron, like its competitors, said earnings were boosted by higher prices for crude oil, US natural gas and US refined product. The results were helped by reorganisation and cost-cutting, which contributed to an 11 per cent reduction in operating expenses from last year's third quarter. The weak economy, however, took a toll on profits from Chevron's chemicals business and international refining and marketing. Domestic petroleum operations were hurt by Hurricane Andrew, which disrupted production in August and September. Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive, said fourth-quarter results would include further cost reductions. The company also expects an after-tax gain of about Dollars 375m from the stock-for-property swap with Penzoil. During the quarter, US exploration and production profits soared to Dollars 253m, including gains of Dollars 62m from special items, from only Dollars 29m last year, including one-time gains of Dollars 10m. Chevron's average crude oil sales price rose 99 cents a barrel to Dollars 17.94, while average natural gas prices climbed 40 per cent to Dollars 1.75 per thousand cubic feet. Refining and marketing brought in earnings of Dollars 73m, including one-time charges of Dollars 21m, compared with a loss of Dollars 10m a year earlier, which included environmental provisions of Dollars 53m. Chevron's chemicals business lost Dollars 7m in the quarter compared with earnings of Dollars 44m last year. International refining and marketing lost Dollars 4m in the quarter, compared with profits of Dollars 136m, which included a favourable tax adjustment of Dollars 62m.</p>

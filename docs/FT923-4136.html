			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, The Netherlands (7): International focus - Insurers are looking to foreign markets INSURANCE broker Cor Van den Bord regrets the fact that he cannot place big ticket commercial risks business with his native Dutch companies. 'It is a pity that our companies have not followed Dutch industry abroad,' says Mr Van den Bord, who works with Amsterdam-based Alexander Bekouw. 'It would be nice to place business with Dutch insurers.' The fact remains though that the Netherlands leading insurance companies barely compete in the market for the larger industrial and commercial risks business, leaving the field free for their larger French, Swiss and especially German rivals. German companies such as Gerling and Allianz handle as much as a third of Dutch industrial risks business. Dutch enthusiasm for the big margin and bigger risk business - the sort of policies that the country's multinationals such as Shell or Phillips would buy to protect their installations worldwide - has if anything been on the wane in recent years. Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the financial services holding group formed when Nationale Nederlanden, the country's biggest insurer, merged with NMB Postbank, looks set to slash its already limited involvement. This follows heavy losses at its Nederlanden Reassurantie Groep reinsurance and Orion subsidiaries in the London insurance market in recent years. NRG has posted heavy losses as a result of reinsurance business underwritten by Victory, a company it acquired in 1990 for Pounds 122m. The company is suing its advisers who, it says, did not provide enough information about the shortfall in Victory's reserves. It is also reviewing its long-term commitment to reinsurance business. Orion, which specialises in marine and aviation business in London, has made losses in three consecutive years in London. In early September ING announced it intended to close Orion's commercial risks operation and sell off the company's UK personal health business. Mr Willem Scherpenhuijsen Rom, chairman of ING, says that the volatility of commercial lines business is leading him to favour personal lines and life business which provide more stable earnings. In addition, ING lacks the specialised risk management and engineering staff. Mr Jaap Peters, chairman of Aegon, the Netherlands' second-biggest company, takes a similar line. His company underwrites a mixed book of general and life business in the Netherlands but the accent is heavily on the lower-risk personal lines and life business. Yet although the country's large insurers have no intention of challenging the world's leading industrial risks insurers, they have established international operations. In 1991, for example, ING earned 53 per cent of its Fl 27.3bn insurance revenues from overseas operations, while in the same year Aegon earned 44 per cent of its insurance income from outside the Netherlands and more than a third from the US, where it is the biggest overseas life insurance company with a market share of 1.2 per cent in 1991. ING and Aegon, as well as Amev, the country's third-largest private insurer, have all built up relatively extensive international operations, focusing their efforts on a selected number of international markets rather than seeking to have a large share of every leading market. Priority areas for expansion for all three groups have included neighbouring Belgium, which Dutch insurers increasingly identify as part of an extended domestic market. Amev's merger with AG Groupe, to create the Fortis company, signalled a general trend. ING has followed suit by acquiring an interest in the Brussels-based Banque Bruxelles Lambert. Dutch companies have long-standing interests in the UK but are highly critical of British management which they see as partly responsible for the UK market's heavy losses in 1990 and 1991, and they are relatively unenthusiastic about further expansion. Each of the three companies is excited by the prospects of rapid growth in Spain and Portugal - ING has expanded relatively rapidly in the health insurance field, for example. Dutch companies are also intensely interested in expansion in newly emerging eastern European markets where they believe long-term rewards could be substantial. Aegon has led the way by acquiring Budapest-based Allami Biztosito, the former state-owned general insurer. Above all, Dutch insurers are enthusiastic about their participation in the world's biggest insurance market - that of the US. For all three companies the US is the biggest international market, accounting for more than a third of Aegon's premium income and a quarter of ING's insurance earnings. The Dutch companies have eschewed the top down, more centralised approach favoured by UK and some other European companies in the 1960s and 1970s and have not attempted to become 'national players', selling all types of insurance in all areas of the US. Instead, they have focused on niche markets, exploiting the open yet highly-fragmented character of the US market. US Aegon has focused exclusively on life and health business, acquiring a string of regional life companies each with separate specialisations - in particular, life assurance products - since it began its push into the US in the late 1970s. It has avoided risky areas such as guaranteed investment contracts and group health products. Each of the 11 companies acquired by Aegon in this period has a significant market share in its particular niche area. 'We decided not to go into property and casualty insurance in the United States,' explains Mr Peters. 'If you make that decision you say goodbye to 50 per cent of the world's premium income. But you just can't make money in US liability business. It is so difficult to operate there.' Mr Peters says that the key to his group's expansion has been the desire to give the local management of each concern more responsibility. Mr Peters visits each operation frequently and takes a close interest in performance. 'You have to decentralise and give responsibility to local people. You get to know them and make them partners in the business. They have to feel that they are Aegon people. You have to find the right kind of control.'</p>

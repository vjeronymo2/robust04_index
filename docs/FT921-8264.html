			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Warrants launched on four UK water stocks SALOMON Brothers has launched 10m put and 10m call warrants on a basket of four UK water stocks, designed to allow investors to take a view on the outcome of the UK general election and its effect on the stock market. The utility companies are considered the most politically sensitive stocks, since a Labour victory could squeeze profits as a result of a tighter regulatory environment. Salomon said trading in water company stocks has been subdued due to concern about the outcome of the election. The call and put warrants allow investors not only to take bullish or bearish views on the stocks, but also to hedge their portfolios against a fall in the price of the stocks without selling existing holdings. The four water stocks in the basket - Anglian, North-West, Severn Trent and Thames - were chosen because they are components of the FT-SE 100 index. Their weighting in the basket is close to their index weighting to facilitate the use of the warrants by fund managers which track the index. Only Thames Water is listed as a traded option on the London Traded Options Market. The US-style warrants can be exercised at any time during their one-year life. Dealers said several banks were attempting to design investment products based on the uncertainty over the election. Salomon, which recently announced its intention to expand its UK equity derivatives business, plans to launch further election-led products.</p>

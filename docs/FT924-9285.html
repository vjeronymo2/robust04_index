			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Basic pay set for 10 per cent of workers WHEN wages councils were set up in 1909 their brief was to encourage the development of voluntary collective bargaining in industries where unions had been weak, Catherine Milton writes. In the industries covered by today's wages councils four fifths of employees are women working part-time. The Department of Employment has recently indicated that two thirds of the workers whose wages are set by the councils are above the minimum rates which vary between Pounds 2.60 and Pounds 3 an hour. The councils were set up by the Trade Boards Act which established minimum pay rates for workers in the 'sweated trades'. Winston Churchill, then president of the Board of Trade, told the Commons: 'It is a serious national evil that any class of His Majesty's subjects should receive less than a living wage in return for their utmost exertions.' By 1953 there were 66 councils covering 3.5m workers. Since then some councils have become redundant, others abolished or amalgamated. The 1986 Wages Act reduced the scope of the councils' influence, removing workers aged under 21 and requiring councils only to set a single adult hourly rate and overtime rate. The councils are made up of workers' and employers' representatives, chaired by one of three independent conciliators who cast their votes if the two sides cannot agree.</p>

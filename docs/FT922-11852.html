			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / O&amp;Y confident despite hitch on Canada aid OLYMPIA &amp; YORK'S hopes of receiving Canadian government support in its attempts to reconstruct its CDollars 14.3bn (Pounds 6.8bn) debt encountered a potentially serious hitch yesterday because of political concerns. However, representatives of the world's biggest property developer emerged from a crucial meeting with 11 banks in London saying they were confident O&amp;Y would avoid filing for bankruptcy protection. A spokesman for Canadian finance minister Mr Donald Mazankowski said the government had political concerns about providing financial support to O&amp;Y's efforts to raise funds through the Dollars 300m sale-and-leaseback of a Toronto office building, the Exchange Tower. O&amp;Y had been counting on this support as a vital element in its plans to pay back holders of commercial paper, or short-term securities, which have fallen due for redemption. Mr Steve Miller, in charge of O&amp;Y's debt restructuring negotiations, said: 'It would be a problem if the Canadian government did not come through.' He insisted, however, that the government had indicated a willingness to help in the form of a short-term guarantee for the sale of the tower. However the finance ministry spokesman said: 'We remain to be convinced that we are needed, and we hesitate to put the taxpayers at risk'. Mr Miller was speaking shortly after attending a 90-minute crisis meeting with 11 banks, including Citicorp of the US, Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Barclays of the UK and its rival Lloyds. The banks were in private session from 11.30am to late afternoon in the City offices of solicitor Allen &amp; Overy. They were deciding whether to provide O&amp;Y with the Pounds 110m it needs to continue working on Canary Wharf over the next 90 days. Mr Miller, a partner of US investment bank James D. Wolfensohn Inc, said he had 'such a degree of confidence' that they would provide these funds that he had not contemplated what the company would do if the banks refused to provide the money. He confirmed that O&amp;Y had taken advice from the New York firm of lawyers, Weil Gotshal and Manges, on bankruptcy filing procedures but he insisted this was a routine procedure carried out by all companies in the process of a financial reconstruction. He said he had provided 100 pages of information to the 11 banks on the company's plans for financing Canary Wharf over the coming five years. In giving the banks estimates of Canary Wharf's value, O&amp;Y is assuming completion of the Jubilee Line Underground link to central London. However, Mr Miller said the Pounds 110m needed from the banks did not include provision for a Pounds 40m payment which O&amp;Y had promised as a first instalment on its Pounds 400m contribution to the Jubilee Line construction costs. He said O&amp;Y would be holding talks with the UK government on changing the terms of its Jubilee Line contribution. Mr Miller did not rule out an attempt by O&amp;Y to reduce its contribution. Most bankers believe, however, that any change in the terms would involve rescheduling O&amp;Y's payments to the government to the late 1990s. O&amp;Y public bonds, Page 31</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Ireland to borrow up to DM4bn to support punt IRELAND has arranged to borrow up to DM4bn from German banks in order to support the Irish punt in the foreign exchange markets. The package consists of a DM2bn commercial paper facility, a DM1bn overdraft facility and a DM1bn loan facility. Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency has arranged the loans with a group of leading German banks, including the country's three largest banks, Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank. The government has been struggling to prop up the Irish punt within the exchange rate mechanism since September. During September, the government is believed to have spent around IPounds 2bn supporting the currency. While the level of the country's reserves are not known, they are likely to have been severely depleted. Ireland made short-term borrowings in September to fund heavy intervention in the foreign exchange market, and some of those borrowings fall due shortly. In addition, Ireland needs further funds as it continues to support the currency within the exchange rate mechanism. This struggle is made more difficult by the political vacuum following last month's general election. A new coalition government has yet to be formed. Short-term rates have risen as high as 100 per cent in order to stem speculation in the foreign exchange market. Yesterday, the three-month Euro-deposit rate fell a point to 18 per cent on renewed hopes that the Bundesbank may ease German interest rates following weak German gross national product data.</p>

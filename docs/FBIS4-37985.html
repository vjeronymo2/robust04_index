			<p>BFN     [Text] London, 27 Jun -- In an interview published here  today, a prominent southern Yemeni official affirmed: "The issue  of a cease-fire is no longer a Yemeni issue but an international  one according to UN Security Council Resolution No. 924."    Staff Brigadier Haytham Qasim Tahir, appointed as Defense  Minister in the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which was  unilaterally announced in south Yemen on 20 May, told Al-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT in a telephone interview: "We have presented an  initiative to form an international observer team to monitor  implementation of the cease-fire and the withdrawal of northern  troops to their position prior to the eruption of the fighting."  He stressed he would "Not give up one inch of the lands of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen."    He described human, weapons and equipment losses as being  "small and limited among the military circles in the southern  army. As for the civilians, the losses are great because the  battles took place on our lands and because northern troops  launched a deliberate random and barbaric missile, air and  artillery attacks on towns and villages, including the capital  Aden, which caused the death and wounding of hundreds of  defenseless and innocent people."</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Austrian Industries sells 74% stake in chip maker AUSTRIAN Industries, the troubled state-owned industrial holding company, is selling 74 per cent of the equity of its subsidiary, Austria Mikro Systeme International, a maker of specialised integrated circuits. The issue marks Austria's first true privatisation. Previous flotations of state-owned companies have always left majority control in the hands of the government. Final pricing has not been fixed, but the issue is expected to value the company, which makes chips for mobile telephones, factory robots and car components, at about Sch860m (Dollars 75m). Of the 1.85m shares in the issue, 43 per cent will be offered to international investors and 57 per cent to private and institutional investors in Austria. Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein, global co-ordinator of the issue, and Kleinwort Benson of London, international lead manager, will be hoping to avoid repeating the embarrassing aftermath to the last Austrian flotation. Last November, 49 per cent of the shares of Voest Alpine Eisenbahnsysteme were floated. Even though VAE exceeded its profit forecast, its price slumped from Sch980 on issue to a low of Sch715 in mid-January. At Sch830 this week, it is still well below the issue price.</p>

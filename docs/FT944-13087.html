			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / BAT uphill task to secure deal BAT Industries can make a good case that its takeover of American Tobacco will increase competition in the US cigarette market but it faces an uphill battle to win court approval for the deal, analysts said yesterday. The Federal Trade Commission is trying to halt the acquisition because it believes a reduction in the number of manufacturers will make it easier for those remaining to set prices to their advantage. 'I find BAT to be very price competitive,' said Ms Diana Temple of Salomon Brothers in New York, 'but it will be hard for BAT to get the FTC's opposition overturned in court.' 'It is genuinely a bizarre ruling by the FTC because the cigarette market would never accept price rises,' said a leading London analyst. But with the court outcome unpredictable because of political overtones, 'BAT has an even chance, perhaps no better, of winning.' The FTC goes to court in New York City on Monday to seek a temporary injunction to block BAT's Dollars 1bn purchase of American Tobacco from American Brands. A full trial will begin in the first week of December. If BAT loses it could appeal to the federal second circuit appeals court. There would be insufficient time to take the case to the Supreme Court because BAT's option on American Tobacco expires next April.</p>

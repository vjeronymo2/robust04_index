			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany has said that  there is illegal trafficking of weapons through Panama en route  to Colombia. The president made this statement at the Supreme  Court, where he discussed government plans for 1994. According  to the president, 1994 is a year in which much attention will be  focused on the elections. He pointed out that the next  president will have to face the challenge of reorganizing the  government's program so that the country can be prepared to  manage the interoceanic waterway once it is turned over to  Panamania in 2000.    [Begin recording] [Endara] These next five years will be  crucial in Panamanian history.    [Unidentified reporter] Molirena [Nationalist Liberal  Republican Movement] might leave the ruling alliance. Have you  made the necessary changes?    [Endara] I will not get involved in political matters. I  realize that what may occur in politics has repercussions inside  my government, but I want it to have the minimum repercussion  possible.    [Reporter] Will there be political amnesty this year?    [Endara] Political amnesty is granted by the Legislative  Assembly, not me.    [Reporter] The Catholic Church is concerned about the large  number of weapons on the streets in the hands of third parties.  What can the government do about this prior to the elections?    [Endara] I am not aware of the Church's concerns in this  regard. I believe there definitely is arms trafficking, but --  thank God -- according to intelligence reports, the weapons are  only passing through Panama and do not stay here, at least not  in large numbers.    [Reporter] Where are those weapons going?    [Endara] Usually to Colombia. [end recording]    President Endara also pointed out that he has no plans to  grant amnesty to Colonel Eduardo Herrera. As for his  administration, he pointed out that he has fulfilled his role in  a transition government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Vedrashko, special correspondent: </F> "Ashgabat's Special Position"]    [Text] A meeting of the CIS state leaders was scheduled for  23-24 December in Ashgabat.    Your VEK correspondent, who had been in Turkmenistan for  several days prior to the Ashgabat Meeting, had a conversation  with Turkmenistan's minister of foreign affairs, Khalykberdi  Atayev.    "Our republic does indeed take a special position among the  CIS countries," the minister said. "We regard the Commonwealth  as a consultative instrument, lacking in any rigid  administrative organs. We consider that the CIS should  facilitate the development of bilateral relations between the  members of this organization. During the initial period many  people did not understand us, seeing in our position a desire to  isolate ourselves, to depart from the principles of uniting the  states involved. However, Turkmenistan's president, Saparmurad  Niyazov, maintains a different opinion. He advocates the uniting  of states on the basis of full sovereignty and the development  of bilateral relations. Therefore, our state did not sign the  CIS Charter in Minsk, nor did it join the economic union. We  assume that Turkmenistan will be able to join this organization  in the capacity of an associate member."    "Practical experience has shown that decisions adopted at  the  CIS level are not carried out in the necessary manner. Moreover,  these decisions do not facilitate businesslike cooperation among  the states involved. But bilateral decisions--in  contrast--clearly presuppose mutual obligations which must be  carried out. Such a position taken by Turkmenistan has found  understanding and support from a number of CIS states."    Khalykberdi Atayev went on to explain his state's position  with regard to the conflict in Tajikistan:    "When the matter arose of the need to create a joint troop  force in order to safeguard the Tajik border and to maintain  order in Tajikistan itself, Kazakhstan and Russia appealed to us  on this matter. Our president declared that he would not send a  single Turkmen soldier into Tajikistan and would not intervene  in this conflict. He posed the question as follows: Who would  the Turkmen soldiers fight against in Tajikistan? The Tajik  oppositionists had possibly crossed the border from Afghanistan  and were receiving support from certain Afghan groups. However,  the Kabul government immediately declared that it had nothing at  all to do with this. But within Tajikistan itself complications  and confrontations have taken place resulting from clashes  between various factions struggling for power. In such a  situation--just whom would the Turkmen troops be fighting  against? We have stated that Tajikistan must solve its own  internal problems by itself by means of talks among the  conflicting parties and by means of strengthening the power  structures within that country. Our participation in this matter  could consist of providing humanitarian assistance to the  suffering population."    Turning to economic problems, the foreign minister noted  that  at the present time some 11 billion cubic meters of gas annually  pass through Russian territory on their way to the West.  However, by way of seeking its own, independent egress to  foreign markets, Turkmenistan is actively carrying on  preliminary talks with regard to constructing a gas pipeline  through the northern part of Iran and Turkey--to Europe. As the  minister noted, his country could export 10-15 billion cubic  meters of gas to Turkey, whereas it it could send 30 billion to  Europe. The explored gas reserves in Turkmenistan amount to 13  trillion cubic meters. Proposals are now under study for laying  gas pipelines to China's eastern shore and to Pakistan. Other  large-scale projects are also being studied, in particular, in  the field of international railroad transportation.</p>

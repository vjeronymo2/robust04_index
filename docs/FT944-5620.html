			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Ushers is latest to withdraw flotation Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer and pub chain, yesterday pulled its flotation. Mr Roger North, chief executive, said the response from institutions had been good. But while more than 30 institutions had been interested, they had promised 'only three-quarters of the money we needed'. Unless the shares were fully placed ahead of the public offer, the group would be running the risk of a bad after market - 'and I would rather wait', Mr North said. The group was expected to be valued on flotation at more than Pounds 100m. It was planning a placing and open offer to raise around Pounds 50m of new money in order to clear senior debt of Pounds 35m, redeem preference shares and accelerate expansion. The withdrawal of the offer follows a warning earlier this week from Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-based brewer. The shares fell after it reported a rise in both beer sales and interim profits, but spoke of volatile trading and caution about second-half prospects. The beer market is widely seen as being in decline. While Ushers' brewery is making 300,000 barrels of beer a year, using 24-hour shifts working to meet demand, 200,000 barrels are under contract to Courage - a figure that will fall by two-thirds in 1996. Mr North said the Courage contract was not an issue - the float was a victim of the state of the new issues market. 'We thought we could prevail against the market, but we did not,' he said. The Ushers brewery in Trowbridge dates back to 1824 but the current company was formed only in 1991 after the Beer Orders, which obliged the industry to reduce the number of their tied houses. The brewery and an unrelated estate of 433 pubs in south-west England and South Wales were acquired through a Pounds 71m management buy-in from Courage. In the past three years the group has paid off Pounds 15m of debt and invested Pounds 13m in taking the number of pubs to 470, as well as modernising the brewery. The pathfinder document showed pre-tax profits for the year to October ahead from Pounds 7.76m to Pounds 10.4m on sales of Pounds 39.1m (Pounds 38.9m). The main shareholders are Schroder Ventures and Swiss Bank Corporation.</p>

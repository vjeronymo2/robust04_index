			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Generals Should Stick to Their </F> Duties"]    [Text] Very recently we commented that Gen. Dogan Gures,  the current chief of staff of the Turkish Armed Forces who will  retire in the summer of 1994 due to the official age limit of 67  and because he has completed four years in office, should not be  speaking on domestic issues and should keep away from daily  politics.    Ever since our comments appeared in the Turkish Daily News  we  have received much support from all quarters. As a matter of  fact, new developments came to the surface regarding Gen. Gures  which only proved our point.    There were rumors that Gen. Gures attended a dinner recently  with businessmen and there he allegedly made comments about the  formation of a new government dominated by technical experts.  The news broke when Culture Minister Fikri Saglar, the new  secretary general of the coalition partner Social Democrat  People's Party (SHP), told a newspaper that Gen. Gures should  disclose whether or not these claims were true.    This development came amid reports that Gen. Gures was  seeking new ways to have his term of office extended for another  year. There were also reports that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller  also wanted such an extension.    At a separate press conference Saglar also said the SHP was  against the extension of the term of office of Gen. Gures and  the commanders of the Navy and Air Forces.    So the General Staff made a statement on Sunday [3 May]  saying the military was not the body to set up governments in  Turkey. The statement also said laws and regulations were clear  about the appointment and retirement of military personnel and  called the press reports absurd.    Yet those of us who remember how coups come and go in Turkey  and the controversial way the chief of staff's term in office  was extended last year amid cries of foul play were not too  impressed.    Actually the chief of staff himself could not remain silent  despite the General Staff statement and had to make rather  awkward statements which showed either his lack of knowledge of  a true democracy or his lack of interest in it.    Gen. Gures criticized Saglar and said the politician did not  know the state hierarchy. He said the extension of the term of  office of force commanders was made when the chief of staff made  an offer and the minister of defense, the prime minister and the  president approved this. "When did he (Saglar) become a prime  minister? I didn't know he was in the state hierarchy." It  seems the chief of staff is unaware that his boss is the  civilian government which is a coalition government and the SHP  is a partner to it. Thus the SHP and its officials have a say  in whatever happens. This is a sad fact of democracy which a  military person is obliged to know.    On Tuesday Saglar also made a statement reminding the chief  of staff of the facts of democracy.    The chief of staff has recently said everyone should take  pains to avoid any controversies about the office of the chief  of staff as it may erode this very important post. We agree.  Yet, the chief of staff himself should be beyond all kinds of  controversy.    Now, he may ban Fikri Saglar from entering the General Staff  headquarters as he did the Turkish Daily News. But this is all  a passing phase. Military commanders come and go while we are  here to stay.    One day Gen. Gures and a handful of his men will go. We have  no hard feelings toward the Armed Forces because we are aware  there are very valuable and competent generals and admirals in  the Turkish Armed Forces who could and will replace them and the  military will function with great success.    Gen. Gures will one day be an ordinary citizen. Then he can  say whatever he likes and we can assure him we will be on hand  to defend him to the bitter end against all unjustified attacks.  Today, every word from him is plunging the Armed Forces deeper  into a fruitless and damaging controversy. We oppose this  because we feel the good name of the Turkish Armed Forces has to  be preserved at all costs.</p>

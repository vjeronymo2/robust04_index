			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN MAKES U.S. DEBUT AT AMBASSADOR  </P> <P> Ian Fountain had a right to seem a little shy and a little gangly, a mere  20-year-old striding onto the stage at Ambassador Auditorium on Monday night.  This was, after all, his U.S. debut.  </P> <P> But winners of prestigious competitions -- in this case, the 1989 Artur  Rubinstein International Piano Competition in Tel Aviv -- are already seasoned  by harrowing rounds of outperforming their rivals. The bloom of youth often  leaves their cheeks before its time.  </P> <P> Not so this lanky, fresh-faced Briton, who still looks like a chorister at New  College, Oxford.  </P> <P> Rest assured, however, that his playing is that of a virtuoso. And by evening's  end -- after a temperature-raising account of Chopin's A-flat Polonaise (an  encore) -- came the unmistakable flush of triumph.  </P> <P> Nor was there anything tentative throughout the oddly put-together program that  included Schubert. Whether laying out four Scarlatti sonatas immaculately, or  imparting full flourish to Liszt's B-minor Ballade, Fountain put himself  completely to the task.  </P> <P> One could hardly blame him for wanting to show off his champion's wares -- for  one, a Horowitzian ability to strike bunches of keys at high velocity and still  sound each note with singular clarity. The Ballade, and Chopin's B-minor Sonata  provided such opportunities, as well as a gauge of his youthful directness and  exuberance.  </P> <P> To Schubert's B-major Sonata he brought the music's life force, its gentleness  and the soul of a skipping child, without yet grasping the Andante's seraphic  quality.  </P> <P> For now, the pianist seemed content to display his startling technical gifts.  But Fountain leaves the hint of another sensibility, one to lure listeners to a  return visit.DONNA PERLMUTTER  </P></p>

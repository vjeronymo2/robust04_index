			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 5 May (PL) -- The positive signs following  implementation of the Cuban budget during the first months of  the year will make possible a reduction of the current deficit,  which amounts to 1 billion pesos (the official exchange rate is  one peso per dollar), should these indicators remain the same.  This statement was included in an analysis Finance and Prices  Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez presented to the recent meeting of  the presidents of the Provincial Administration Councils  [Consejos de Administracion Provinciales], the local  authorities' administrative institutions.    Rodriguez told the Chamber of Representatives, which opened  its session in this city, efforts at the provincial levels are  being made to contribute to the reduction of the national  deficit, which was estimated at 4.2 billion pesos in late 1993.    The minister said this encouraging sign is based on the  implementation of the budget during the first part of the year.  He added the budget includes more revenues, less expenditures,  and a 6.1-percent reduction in the estimated budget deficit.    Rodriguez also praised the aggressive efforts by the  provincial and national cities regarding collections and  payments because these efforts allowed for a reduction of 440  million pesos in accounts payable of the first quarter of 1994.    The finance and prices minister said [words indistinct] to  prevent past financial irregularities, for instance, the  noncollection of debts, from happening again in the country.</p>

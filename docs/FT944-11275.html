			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / The Markets: China as next superpower? - Economic Eye Is China the next economic superpower and, if so, how soon will it achieve that status? Those who say it is, or very soon will be, point to calculations of the kind shown in the chart. Among them is William Overholt in an important recent book.* Citing an estimate of Dollars 2,500 per head for Chinese real income put forward by Larry Summers, when chief economist of the World Bank, he argues that 'if Summers' calculation is correct, China's economy will pass the US economy in sheer size within 11 years'. Yet even if that were true, China would not have the most powerful economy in the world. To see this, it is necessary to understand what such estimates actually mean. Consider India, for which more reliable calculations exist than for China. At market exchange rates, its GNP per head was Dollars 310 in 1992, this being only 1.3 per cent of the US level. But the average Indian did not survive on a real income 98.7 per cent smaller, since so much of what Indians consume is far cheaper. At common international prices (or purchasing power parity - PPP), Indian income per head was Dollars 1,210, 5 per cent of the US level. There are three main reasons why internal relative prices differ across countries: protection at the border; internal taxation and subsidisation; and differences in costs of labour (and land). In the case of comparisons between developing and more advanced countries, the last is much the most important. Market exchange rates equate only the prices of tradeable goods and services across frontiers (net of protection). Generally, however, services are both less tradeable and more labour-intensive than goods. A resident of Los Angeles could save a small fortune by buying haircuts in Madras. She cannot do so, however, because transport costs are too high. Accordingly, GNP per head of poor countries at PPP is far higher than it is at market prices. The Bank's estimate of China's national income per head in 1992, at market exchange rates, is Dollars 470, while its guess-estimate of the country's GNP per head at PPP is Dollars 1,910, the relationship between the two being roughly the same as for India. (For a more detailed analysis of Chinese wealth and economic performance, see the article on page 4 of this morning's China survey.) Because primary data have not been collected in China, the PPP number is derived from a cross-country statistical relationship linking GNPs at market exchange rates to those at PPP. Other estimates of China's GNP per head at PPP in the early 1990s vary between Dollars 1,000 (which would make the economy a little larger than that of France) and Dollars 3,000 (which would make it even larger than Japan's). The uncertainty is huge. But concentrate on the Bank estimates. China's 1992 GNP at market exchange rates was only Dollars 506bn, smaller than Spain's and eighth largest in the world, while its GNP at PPP is estimated at Dollars 2,220bn. What has changed? The answer is that China has tens of millions of tax inspectors, teachers, builders, hairdressers, policemen, judges, doctors and so forth, all of whom are paid a pittance. Adjust their wages to international prices and the size of China's economy explodes. The economy does not just become far bigger at international prices, its structure changes. On the plausible assumption that spending on manufactures at market prices is roughly the same as at international prices, manufacturing would be only 10 per cent of China's GNP at PPP, down from 40 per cent at market prices. It is obvious, however, that China is not made more powerful by having millions and millions of cheap teachers, hairdressers and so forth. This merely means the country is poor and populous. Because the weight of services is much larger in GNP at PPP, growth rates will also be lower. The reason is that manufacturing has been the fastest growing sector of the Chinese economy. If it is given a smaller weight, the growth of the economy will also be reduced. Yet there is one respect in which the PPP numbers do say something about economic size. Convergence of GNP per head between China and more advanced economies will be faster than projections of recent real rates of growth from GNP at market prices would suggest. The reason is that real wages will rise as the economy grows. Those increases in real wages will show up as an appreciation of the real exchange rate. The explanation is that productivity growth in tradeable goods will be faster than in services. At an exchange rate that keeps international prices of tradeable goods roughly in line, those of non-tradeable services will rise. The effect will be particularly large in the case of China, because its economy is likely to grow particularly quickly. Nevertheless, purchasing power adjustments of GNP are relevant for estimates of economic welfare, but not of a country's international economic influence. That depends on the scale of its participation in trade and capital flows, its technological sophistication and the size and diversity of its manufacturing, on all of which the PPP adjustment is at the least misleading. The question is when China might become more powerful than the US in such respects. This is a vital matter for the future of the world, to be addressed two weeks from today. * William H Overholt, China: the Next Economic Superpower (London: Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 1993).</p>

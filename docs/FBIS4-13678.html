			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Foreign Secretary's Statements"] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said: I  have proposals to ease the result of the naval blockade imposed  on the Port of al-'Aqabah. The 45-month embargo on Iraq has  caused a heavy burden for Jordan. Relations between Jordan and  the United States are excellent. The U.S. position on Jerusalem  has not changed. The United States seeks to reach a  comprehensive peace in the region, and my tour emphasizes this.    These are highlights of Christopher's statements, which he  made at a news conference via satellite broadcast by several  world capitals.    If we want to assess these statements, we cannot but  describe  them as positive and consider them points in favor of the U.S.  policy in the region, that is assuming they were not made just  for consumption or to prepare for Christopher's upcoming tour of  the region, which will begin within days, in his capacity as a  full partner in the current peace negotiations between the Arabs  and Israel.    For the U.S. secretary of state to take note of the fact  that  the siege imposed on Iraq and the siege of al-'Aqabah have  caused a considerable burden for Jordan is something very  important, but talk and statements are one thing and actual  implementation is something else.    If the United States is serious about what it says, then the  first thing that it should do is to stop these measures and stop  all practices that cause any harm to any people in the region.    As for the peace process, the United States, which is the  full partner and main sponsor, should play its role honestly and  neutrally and without a clear and open bias to the Israeli side  as the situation is now. Israel still shows disregard for  international charters and resolutions and is obstructing the  path of peace in a bid to abort the peace process and preempt  the negotiations with the Arabs from tackling any issue that  brings a just and comprehensive peace closer.    The United States continues to supply Israel with all means  of strength, most modern weapons, and all it needs to remain  superior in the region, continue its deviation, and practice all  forms of repression, terrorism, killing, and siege on the  occupied territories, destroying houses, and launching  aggressions against cities and villages, whether in occupied  Palestine or south Lebanon. All these practices are carried out  while the U.S. Administration is aware of them.    At any rate, we are going to take Warren Christopher's  statements seriously, and we hope to see implementation on the  ground. Only then we will reconsider what is said about the  U.S. full bias toward Israel.</p>

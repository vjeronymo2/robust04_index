			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Local public  figures here criticized the uncooperative attitude of the  British and Hong Kong authorities on the construction of a new  airport in Hong Kong and urged them to act in accordance with  the spirit of the memorandum of understanding signed by Britain  and China.    Commenting on the statement issued by the spokesman of the  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the Chinese State  Council Tuesday [25 January] this week on the Hong Kong new  airport issue, sit Fung Shen, member of the Provisional Airport  Authority (PAA) and a professor of the Hong Kong University,  said the Chinese side has shown the utmost tolerance toward the  British side on this subject.    The British and Hong Kong authorities time and again asked  the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council to approve  additional funds for individual airport projects before an  overall financial plan on the airport construction was reached  between the Chinese and British Governments, he said.    Echoed Sit's voice, another PAA member Shiu Sin-por said  that  now it's not a question of appropriation of funds for individual  projects, but lacks an overall financial plan.    The Hong Kong Government failed to put forward a new plan  since the third financial plan was turned down by the Chinese  side. The delay of raising a new plan made it difficult to  re-open another round of Sino-British talks on the airport  issue, he said.    Legislator Tam Yiu-chung said, the Chinese side and future  Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong should not  honor the contracts approved by the Hong Kong Government under  the circumstance of no overall financial plan.    Fong Wong Dut-man, head of the Economic Group of the  Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of  the SAR, urged the Hong Kong Government to explain why the loans  borrowed or lend by the PAA did not belong to the government  loans as declared by the Hong Kong Government a few days ago,  since the PAA is an organ entirely funded by the government.    In view of the funds recently sought by the PAA for works on  government airport key projects, Fong said, the debt borrowed by  the PAA and to be left over to the future government of SAR has  exceeded 5 billion H.K. dollars (641 million U.S. dollars).    This runs counter to the stipulation provided in the  memorandum of understanding, she added.</p>

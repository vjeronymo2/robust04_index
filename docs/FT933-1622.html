			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Travelcard hope after bus sell-off LONDON TRANSPORT is planning a Pounds 22m smartcard ticketing system which could help preserve Travelcards after the deregulation of London bus services. The cards will enable passengers to use buses operated by different companies. Passengers will insert them in machines which will produce passenger figures to enable the revenue to be divided. A further Pounds 3m is to be spent on computerising London Transport's telephone information service.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds Judging by yesterday's interim figures, Courtaulds had a miserable summer. A seasonal lull in demand and a weak dollar left manufacturing capacity idle and margins squeezed. But events are now moving in the company's favour. A strong dollar will boost US profits on translation. Operating margins in dollar-priced products like cigarette filters will improve. European markets may be slowing, but Courtaulds is helped by manufacturing in the UK, Italy and Spain, which have all devalued. The broader question is whether Courtaulds can maintain earnings growth without the kind of vigorous cost-cutting that has underpinned progress since the demerger. Under accounting rules adopted yesterday reorganisation provisions will have to be charged against earnings from now on. The growth prospects in mature markets like viscose are hardly breathtaking even allowing for an upturn. But Courtaulds' cyclical businesses from marine coatings to packaging should benefit on any recovery. Admittedly, yesterday's figures are flattered by a pension fund surplus which contributed some Pounds 10m in the first half but without generating hard cash. The surplus shows every sign of growing though, after this year's revaluation. Besides, Courtaulds is likely to generate net cash this year despite maintaining a healthy investment programme and raising the dividend. Yesterday's 4 per cent rise in the shares is well justified.</p>

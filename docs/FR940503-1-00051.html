Each witness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall testify in the form determined by the Presiding Officer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be most efficient in resolving an issue. Forms of testimony  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include oral testimony provided in person or by other means, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written or otherwise recorded testimony. The Presiding Officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may limit the number of witnesses and the scope and extent of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct examination or cross-examination as necessary to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interests of justice and conduct a reasonably expeditious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Agency representative shall present the field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation and the evidence supporting its issuance, and any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material that is pertinent to the issues to be determined by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer. The respondent has the right to examine, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to respond to or rebut, the field citation and any proffered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence and material. The respondent may offer any facts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents, testimony or other exculpatory evidence which bears on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate issues, or which may be relevant to the size of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate penalty. Any opposing party has a right of crossexamination after the introduction of a witness' direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony. A party shall not cross-examine regarding a matter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is outside of the scope of the direct examination. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer may require the authentication of any written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhibit or statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) At the close of the respondent's presentation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence, the Presiding Officer may allow the introduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebuttal evidence by the Agency representative. The Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer may allow the respondent to respond to any such evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In receiving evidence, the Presiding Officer is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. In evaluating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence presented, the Presiding Officer shall give due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration to the reliability and relevance of each item of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The Presiding Officer may take notice of matters which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not subject to reasonable dispute and are commonly known in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the community, or are capable of accurate and ready determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questioned. Prior to taking notice of a matter, the Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer shall give each party an opportunity to show why notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be taken. In any case in which notice is taken, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer shall place in the record a written statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the matter as to which notice was taken with the basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such notice, including either a statement that the parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consented to notice being taken or a summary of any party's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;59.19  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Penalty assessment criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Presiding Officer shall consider the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria in reviewing the penalty proposed in the field citation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The size of the business;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The economic impact of the penalty on the business;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The respondent's full compliance history, and good faith  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts by the respondent to comply;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The duration of the violation as established by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credible evidence (including evidence other than the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test method);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Payment by the respondent of penalties previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed for the same violation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The economic benefit of noncompliance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The seriousness of the violation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Such other factors as justice may require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The burden of going forward with respect to criteria in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of this section, is on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the respondent. The burden of going forward with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria in paragraphs (a)(4) and (7) of this section is on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency. The burden of going forward with respect to criterion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a)(8) of this section is on the party proffering such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors. Failure of the respondent to meet its burden with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to any applicable criterion shall mean that a penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount that is appropriate in light of other criteria shall also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be appropriate in light of such criterion for which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondent failed to meet its burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;59.20  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Transcript or recording of hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The hearing shall be tape recorded unless the parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree and the Presiding Officer directs otherwise. A verbatim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transcript will not normally be prepared, but may be ordered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Presiding Officer if deemed necessary to permit a full and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair review and resolution of the case. If not so ordered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer, a party may, at its own expense, cause a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verbatim transcript to be made. The party causing the verbatim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transcript to be made shall submit one (1) copy to the Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer and one (1) copy to the other party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The transcript or recording of the hearing, together  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all written submissions made by the parties, shall become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the administrative record for the proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;59.21  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Post-hearing submissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Presiding Officer may request, within a reasonable time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the conclusion of the hearing, that the parties submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a written statement for his consideration including, but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to, proposed recommended findings of fact and conclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of law.

The recommended decision shall address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all material issues of fact or law properly raised by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondent, and shall recommend that the field citation be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affirmed, modified or withdrawn. The recommended decision shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be based on substantial evidence in the administrative record,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken as a whole, and shall provide citations to relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material contained in that record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Presiding Officer shall file a copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended decision with the Hearing Clerk at the time of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmittal to the Regional Administrator.

He said that  after 1 July 1997, people holding BNO [British National  Overseas] passports and CI's [Certificate of Identity] for Hong  Kong permanent residents, or those holding a DI [Document of  Identity], Seamen's identity certificates, or Hong Kong return  permits may continue to use those travel documents to travel  outside Hong Kong as long as the documents do not expire, so  people do not need to worry about their current travel documents  becoming invalid, which may affect their travel out of Hong Kong  and their return to Hong Kong. Wang Fengchao stressed: This  will be effected with the endorsement and full support of China,  and China and Britain reached agreement on this through the  Joint Liaison Group last year. As for the issuance of special  administrative region [SAR] passports that Hong Kong people are  now concerned about, a multidepartmental committee of the  Chinese Government has begun to handle this work. It is  expected that an initial plan will be formulated and the Social  and Security Affairs Work Group will be briefed on the plan and  will be consulted.    Fan Hsu Lai-tai, head of the Social and Security Work Group  from the Hong Kong side, pointed out after the end of today's  meeting that BNO passports are only a type of travel document;  if BNO holders do not possess other countries' citizenship, they  will still be treated as Chinese citizens and will still be  eligible to apply for SAR passports; and Chinese citizens  holding CI's may also apply for SAR passports. As BNO passports  are regarded as only a type of travel document, BNO holders may  simultaneously hold SAR passports.</p>

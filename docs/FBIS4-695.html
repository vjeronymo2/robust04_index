			<p>BFN     [Text] A police spokesman confirmed that the police have  investigated allegations of mercenaries from the South African  Defense Force [SADF] being involved in military activities in  Angola.    A spokesman of the SADF, Colonel John Rolf, said it was  being  alleged that in cases where South African soldiers were acting  as mercenaries in violation of the defense law, justice had to  take its course. After the police have completed their  investigation, the attorney general will have to decide whether  prosecution will be instituted. Col. Rolf denied that the South  African soldiers were involved in Angola with the full knowledge  and consent of the SADF; also that the companies responsible for  sending soldiers to Angola, Executive Outcomes, were a front for  the SADF.    The police spokesman in turn said that there has been a  police investigation into the allegations after the commissioner  of police had requested the investigation. According to  reports, there are still about 500 South African soldiers in  Angola. These soldiers are fighting on the side of the Marxist  MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] troops.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: KLM advances 20% to Fl 204m KLM, the Dutch national carrier which is closely involved in talks aimed at a four-way European airline merger, reported a 20 per cent rise in second-quarter profit. However, it cautioned that full-year 1993-94 results would be 'marginally positive' at best. Net profit in the latest quarter, which covers the period from July to September, totalled Fl 204m (Dollars 107m) compared with Fl 170m in the same period of 1992-93. Passenger traffic climbed by a strong 18 per cent, but the trend towards cheaper fares and the shift away from business class travel left its mark, with passenger yields down 9 per cent. 'Unrelenting competition and shifting demand continue to pressure yields negatively,' it said. KLM did not comment directly on the progress of merger talks with Swissair, Scandinavia Airlines System and Austrian Airline. But it noted that the airline industry was still 'marked by major uncertainties'. KLM said results in the 1993-94 second half were expected to show a clear loss, reflecting the seasonal nature of the air travel industry. It noted that its expectations of a marginally positive result for the full year were due partly to the pension contribution holiday negotiated earlier this year with unions representing flight attendants and pilots. Yesterday's figures took first-half net profit to Fl 245m, a rise of 18 per cent, on sales up just 1 per cent at Fl 4.5bn. KLM is eager to join forces with its three European rivals in order to trim costs and to fight competition from bigger airlines. The carrier, which has been seeking to cut costs throughout the early 1990s, said the productivity of workers at KLM and its subsidiary KLM Cityhopper increased by 14 per cent in the quarter. The KLM group also includes a number of foreign carriers such as Northwest of the US.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 23 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- About 5,000  people marched through the Mongolian capital's central streets  today, chanting slogans demanding the government's resignation  and the dissolution of parliament. Then the demonstrators  assembled on a city square to give moral support to Mongolian  opposition members who have been on a hunger strike for 11  consecutive days. Following the hospitalization of several  hunger strikers, 34 of them now remain. The opposition forces  intend to use the hunger strike to compel the government to  resign. Accusations of official corruption and discontent with  government policy in spheres such as social welfare, education,  and agriculture have served as the formal pretext for the  protests.    No serious incidents occurred, with the exception of  attempts  by government supporters to use smoke bombs and firecrackers to  hinder the demonstration. The security forces monitored  [kontrolirovali] the situation, observed the demonstrators from  afar and did not intervene in the events.    The country's President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat had a meeting  with the hunger strikers several days ago. However, the hunger  strikers, who were joined by former Vice President  Radnaasumbereliyn Gonchigdorj, refused to stop their action in  spite of attempts at persuasion. They say they will strike  until the government agrees to make concessions.</p>

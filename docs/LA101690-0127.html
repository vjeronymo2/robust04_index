			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> AFTERSHOCK: News of the death of Leonard Bernstein shook Carl St. Clair, the  music director of Orange County's Pacific Symphony, who had worked closely with  Bernstein. . . . Last year, St. Clair toured Europe and the Soviet Union with  Bernstein, and last August he subbed for the ailing conductor at Tanglewood,  Mass. . . . "As soon as I heard the news, I felt a great emptiness and a great  void," he said. "For everybody, there is a great person missing from us." Chris  Pasles and Tom McQueeney  </P></p>

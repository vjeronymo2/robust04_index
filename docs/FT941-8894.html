			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bingo side helps Vardon more than double to Pounds 5m Vardon, the fast-growing leisure group which owns the London Dungeon, more than doubled pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 5.13m, over 1993. The figures were boosted by a seven month contribution from the 10 bingo clubs which it acquired for Pounds 6.7m in May, funded by a Pounds 13.4m share issue. Earnings per share jumped to 5.6p (3.5p) and a final dividend of 0.825p increases the total to 1.125p (0.75p). Mr Nick Irens, chief executive, said the results had been achieved with 'very little help' from the economy but that it had detected 'glimmers' of recovery in recent months. In contrast to recent comments from First Leisure, where Mr Irens used to be finance director, Vardon was seeing good growth in spending per customer, in addition to more modest growth in attendances. He also pointed out that its Sea Life attraction in Blackpool had a record year while most operators in the resort, including First Leisure, had reported 'a dismal summer'. The attractions division, which now includes 13 Sea Life centres, a Cornish seal sanctuary and the London and York Dungeons, saw operating profits jump by 53 per cent to Pounds 5.3m while turnover rose from Pounds 9.73m to Pounds 14m. On a like for like basis, visitor numbers were up 3 per cent while revenue expanded by 11 per cent. Mr Irens said:'We were absolutely delighted with the performance of the existing operations and the performance of the new development was well ahead of expectations.' In June, Vardon opened a Sea Life centre at Scheveningen in the Netherlands, its first outside the UK, and Mr Irens said the attendance levels were particularly exciting. 'They give us considerable encouragement and confidence for future expansion of the Sea Life concept in continental Europe.' New centres at Newquay and Tynemouth will open this summer and Vardon plans to open a further three next year, one of which will be in northern Europe. In the bingo division, which in seven months contributed Pounds 720,000 to operating profits on turnover of Pounds 5.4m, Vardon opened a new 1,700 capacity club in Southampton in September with another in Coventry due to open in May. Excluding acquisitions, capital investment is expected to rise to Pounds 12m (Pounds 8.8m), which would leave it with gearing of about 15 per cent. COMMENT These results explain the heady rise in Vardon's share price which has more than trebled since Mr Irens and chairman Mr David Hudd floated the company less than two years ago. Through well-timed and keenly priced acquisitions they have built two highly cash generative businesses which both produce healthy returns from new investment. The early results from new openings, particularly the Dutch Sea Life Centre, show the scope for organic growth and the management 'remain alive to opportunities' in other areas. Assuming no further deals, profits should reach Pounds 7m this year which puts the shares on a multiple of about 20. A premium rating but Vardon still has its attractions.</p>

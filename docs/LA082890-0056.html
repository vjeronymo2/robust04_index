			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN'S HUSBAND LISTS CLIENTS, THREATENS TO SUE WILSON OVER 'LIES'  </P> <P> Investment banker Richard C. Blum, the husband of Democratic gubernatorial  candidate Dianne Feinstein, released a full list of his business clients on  Monday and publicly threatened to sue Pete Wilson if the Republican continues  his barrage of criticism against him.  </P> <P> The release of the list -- which had been sought during the Democratic primary  by Feinstein competitor John K. Van de Kamp and in recent weeks by Wilson --  yielded the names of 56 individuals and trusts, including some extremely  wealthy clients such as investor Robert M. Bass and composer Gordon Getty, son  of the late financier J. Paul Getty.  </P> <P> Also included were individuals who represent a cross-section of American  finance: Robert S. Salomon Jr. of New York firm Salomon Bros., venture  capitalist Arthur Rock of San Francisco and investment banker F. Warren Hellman  of San Francisco.  </P> <P> Blum, who earlier in the campaign had adamantly refused to name individual  clients, said he hoped that his change of heart would "dispel any notion that  there are any hidden agendas here."  </P> <P> The banker also said his attorney has sent Wilson, vying for the governorship  against Feinstein, a "cease and desist" letter requesting an end to the  questions Wilson's campaign has raised about Blum.  </P> <P> "If he's going to say anything about me -- and if I'm fair game, so be it -- do  it with some degree of integrity," Blum told reporters at a Los Angeles press  conference, where he repeated remarks made earlier in San Francisco.  </P> <P> "He's been put on notice that what he's doing is injurious to our business. . .  . I don't think we're fair game when someone maliciously lies about our  activities and he has done that rather consistently," Blum added.  </P> <P> In response, Wilson's campaign director, Otto Bos, said Wilson had made every  effort to be truthful in characterizing Blum's financial dealings. "We believe  the campaign should be fought on the stump, not in the courts," Bos said.  </P> <P> Blum, who has been married to Feinstein for a decade, released his records in  the face of Wilson advertisements that said the couple "own" an Oregon savings  and loan. The Wilson commercial itself was a response to a Feinstein ad that  suggested Wilson had voted for the thrift industry as a U.S. senator because he  had received more than $243,000 in campaign contributions from industry  officials.  </P> <P> The two candidates have been battling to see who can muddy up the other in the  minds of voters, who they believe are highly concerned about government ethics  and the spiraling savings-and-loan bailout now facing the federal government.  </P> <P> According to a Times Poll released Saturday, Feinstein and Wilson are running  dead even just days before the campaign's traditional Labor Day kickoff.  </P> <P> Monday's release of Blum's individual clients complements his disclosures  nearly six months ago of his corporate clients, which include Bankamerica  Corp., Executive Life Insurance Co., Northwest Airlines, Sumitomo Bank of  California and others. Overall, Blum said he controls about $400 million in  marketable and private securities.  </P> <P> In remarks to reporters, Blum echoed previous comments by Feinstein that the  couple keep their finances separate. He said his firm, Richard C. Blum &amp;  Associates, through which he makes investments, was founded before their  marriage and is not community property. According to state law, however, all  income gained from the investments is community property, he said.  </P> <P> Because Feinstein does not have a share in the firm, she does not have any  personal holdings in Jackson County Savings &amp; Loan, which the Wilson  commercial says the couple own, Blum said.  </P> <P> Further, Blum said that he does not "own" the institution either. He said his  firm owns 24.9% of the Oregon firm, a percentage deliberately chosen because it  is just under the 25% mark that would constitute a controlling interest.  </P> <P> Wilson's campaign countered that other Blum clients have holdings in the  savings and loan that -- combined with Blum's -- constitute ownership. But Blum  said he neither controls those investments nor votes their shares.  </P> <P> Overall, he said, he personally owns one quarter of 1% of the thrift, which he  said has yet to be profitable.  </P> <P> That holding is his only current investment in a savings and loan, Blum said.  He previously bought, and has since sold, shares in a second thrift, and a  trust set up for his adult children owns shares in American Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> Besides hitting Blum on the Oregon holdings, the Wilson camp has criticized him  for an investment he has in National Education Corp., whose subsidiary does  business with South Africa. As the Wilson camp has pointed out, that runs  counter to Blum's statements that he will not do business with any firm that  has South African connections.  </P> <P> Blum described the subsidiary's connection as short-term. He said he learned of  the corporation's South African dealings when it attempted to merge two years  ago with a company in which he had an interest.  </P> <P> "I made it very clear that we had no interest in pursuing the merger if they  were going to continue to do business with South Africa," he said.  </P> <P> National Educational Corp. sold off one South African subsidiary upon his  request, Blum said. Another subsidiary has a licensing agreement with South  Africa that it cannot legally abridge, he said, adding that the firm will not  renew the contract.  </P> <P> If his wife is elected, Blum said, he will forward listings of his holdings to  the attorney general for a legal opinion as to whether they would constitute a  conflict of interest with Feinstein's duties. To his knowledge, he said, only  one of the firms in which he has invested now does business with the state.  </P> <P> Blum and Feinstein supplemented her fund raising with about $3 million of their  own money during the primary, but he expressed hopes Monday that they could in  the future depend on outside sources for backing.  </P> <P> "Our fund-raising efforts today are very encouraging . . . and hopefully that  will suffice," he said with a wry smile.  </P> <P> Times political writer Bill Stall contributed to this article.  </P></p>

In a gesture of defiance seven internationally known  intellectuals sent a letter yesterday to President Jiang Zemin  and National People's Congress Chairman Qiao Shi demanding that  Beijing release "all citizens detained because of their thoughts  and expression of opinion". Not doing so, the appeal warned,  would "exacerbate contradictions and spawn irrevocable turmoil".    The petition, which has been made available to the Hong Kong  and foreign media, also expressed "deep dismay and worries" over  the recent spate of detentions of dissidents in Beijing,  Shanghai and other cities. The campaign is led by Xu Liangying,  74, a professor of philosophy of science at the Chinese Academy  of Sciences, who is known as "the conscience of China".    The other six signatories are Professor Xu's wife, Wang  Laidi, a history professor at the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences, Jiang Peikun and his wife Ding Zilin, both aesthetics  professors at People's University Liu Liao, a physics professor  at Beijing Normal University; poet Shao Yanxiang; and novelist  Zhang Kangkang.    The open letter, entitled An appeal for the improvement of  human rights in our country, said "the right of the freedom of  thought and the expression of opinion is an inalienable right of  modern man which brooks no interference". The petition warned  Beijing that "the search of modernisation becomes illusory if  human rights are dropped [from the agenda]". We appeal to the  authorities bravely to put an end to China's practice over  thousands of years of punishing people for their thinking,  speech and writings."    Chinese sources said party leaders were alarmed because  similar petitions for human rights and political reform in early  1989 snowballed into the pro-democracy movement in May and June.  One of the earliest such petitions was organised in February  1989 by Professor Xu. It was signed by 40-odd dissidents,  including astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and philosophy professor Bao  Zunxin. "The authorities have been behaving in an abnormal way  in the past months by detaining so many people," the professor  said from his home yesterday. "They should immediately release  all prisoners of conscience listed by international watchdogs  such as Asia Watch." Professor Xu added he and his friends had  no plans to hold demonstrations or to form political parties.  "If the authorities are clear-headed, they will not take any  action against us, but I myself am prepared for the worst," he  said.    The open letter came on the heels of efforts on Wednesday by  labour activist Liu Nianchun to form an unofficial labour union  with 120 members.    Meanwhile, American Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  who is due to arrive in Beijing today to press for an  improvement in human rights, indicated last night he had  cancelled plans to meet dissidents for tear of triggering  "retribution" against them.</p>

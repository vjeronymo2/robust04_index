			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Observer: Museum piece Reports that Rathbones, a firm of Liverpool financiers, is 'borrowing the Bank of England' for its 250th birthday party have raised a few eyebrows in the City. Was not William Lidderdale, the Bank of England governor who masterminded the rescue of Barings 100 years ago, a Rathbones' partner? Could it be that the current small firm of Rathbones is more privileged than anyone knew? On closer inspection, however, the event is not quite as grand as it sounds. It is being held in the Bank's museum, which can be hired for Pounds 325 per hour plus catering costs - and no, the Governor of the Bank of England will not be gracing the occasion. But at least Peter Baring, chairman of his family firm, will propose a vote of thanks.</p>

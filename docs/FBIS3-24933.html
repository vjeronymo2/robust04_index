In a speech during a two-day workshop  on "export finance policies and modalities," Mudavadi said  further reduction of the inflationary pressure may be  anticipated in coming months. "I targeted a rate of only 10  percent in my budget speech by the end of the year and while  this has not been achieved, we are already on track and progress  to date has been substantial," he said.    Mudavadi told the bankers, insurers, manufacturers, and  fresh  produce exporters who attended the workshop that development of  export finance and insurance sectors had to be set within the  context of the financial management of the economy as a whole.  The minister said the performance of financial markets directly  affects the rest of the economy, adding that sweeping changes in  the banking act, the central bank act and insurance act were  being considered within the treasury. Mudavadi noted that a  majority of Kenyan banks confined themselves to asset-based  lending rather than cash flow lending to avoid high risks.</p>

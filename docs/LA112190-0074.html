			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> RAIN ALSO BROUGHT POWER FAILURES  </P> <P> The rain that fell on Ventura County late Monday and early Tuesday failed to  bring the season's rainfall figures up to normal, but it did knock out  electricity to nearly 20,000 Southern California Edison customers.  </P> <P> A total of 19,800 residences and businesses had power failures lasting from two  minutes or less to about 15 hours, said Mike Montoya, Edison area manager.  </P> <P> Montoya said the power failures -- mostly in the central and western parts of  the county -- were caused by the arcing of electrical currents as dirt and dust  that had accumulated on insulators worked their way to the ground.  </P> <P> "It's similar to a short circuit," Montoya said. "It invariably happens during  the first rain after a long dry spell."  </P> <P> The Edison official said service was restored to 11,000 customers within two  minutes. In most other cases, he said, power was restored in 30 minutes to an  hour.  </P> <P> But disruptions that affected about 15 Edison customers in the Leland Street  area of Montalvo were not expected to be restored until early Tuesday evening.  The power failures began at 3:49 a.m. Tuesday when a power pole caught fire,  Montoya said.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service predicted mostly fair weather with mild Santa Ana  conditions through Saturday.  </P> <P> Weather Service meteorologist Terry Schaeffer said he is "guardedly optimistic"  that more rain will reach the county in the months ahead. The service's 90-day  forecast calls for normal rainfall.  </P> <P> This week's rains, pushed here by a cold Alaskan front, were the first in the  area in about six months. The storm Monday brought 0.57 inches of rain to  Camarillo, 0.38 inches to the County Government Center in Ventura, 0.35 inches  to Fillmore, 0.40 inches to Moorpark and Ojai, 0.37 inches to Oxnard, 0.52  inches to Santa Paula, 0.44 inches to Simi Valley, 0.57 inches to Thousand Oaks  and 0.23 inches to downtown Ventura.  </P> <P> Saticoy, with 0.61 inches, received the most rain in this week's storm,  according to Flood Control District gauges.  </P> <P> The measurements represent the county's first and only rainfall thus far in the  season that began Oct. 1.  </P> <P> In contrast, normal readings to date are 1.64 inches in Camarillo, 1.69 inches  at the County Government Center, 2.33 inches in Fillmore, 1.72 inches in  Moorpark, 2.18 inches in Ojai, 1.48 inches in Oxnard, 2.05 inches in Santa  Paula, 1.56 inches in Simi Valley, 1.68 inches in Thousand Oaks and 1.51 inches  in downtown Ventura.  </P> <P> Rain-caused mudslides that closed the northbound lanes of Pacific Coast Highway  near Deer Creek Road were cleared by 10 a.m. Tuesday, said Bruce Dyar, Ventura  County regional manager for Caltrans. He said northbound traffic was  temporarily detoured over the highway's single southbound lane.  </P> <P> California 33 north of Ojai was closed briefly Tuesday morning due to a  rain-induced rock slide, Dyar said.  </P> <P> Police and sheriff's deputies said the rain caused no major accidents.

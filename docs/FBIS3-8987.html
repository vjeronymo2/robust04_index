			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vlastimir Mijovic: "The Moscow Tailor's Shop"] </F>   [Text] Last week Moscow welcomed Radovan Karadzic and his  Pale delegation with open arms. Boris Yeltsin did refrain from  shaking hands with the man who has been accused of committing  war crimes unheard of in this century, but the fact remains that  official Moscow honored Karadzic in many ways that are by no  means fitting to his real significance and status. Karadzic was  a Moscow prima donna for three days. He was received by top  politicians, he met with cultural and political figures, and  reporters were always tugging at his sleeve. The Chetnik leader  had reason enough to glow with pleasure. Namely, his dream  about winning Russia's approval for his ideas and war aims had  come true.    Although Russian officials have verbally tried to relativize  and represent this sudden closeness with the Pale gang as  objective mediation in the Bosnian negotiation process, even  laymen understand that Russia is in effect taking up high  patronage not only of the rebel Bosnian Serbs, but of the  Orthodox part of the former Yugoslavia. The Kremlin has two  objectives: To use the Bosnian crisis to bring their diplomacy  back into international focus, and to reestablish the southern  Slav part of Balkans as their interest sphere.    For the time being, at least as far as the first objective  is  concerned, Russia is doing more improvising than actually  playing the role that it would like to play in the Bosnian  crisis. Using a cheap trick in cooperation with its friends in  Pale, Russia tried to win the points in the game with the NATO  ultimatum that eventually led to the resolution of most of  Sarajevo's war problems. The trick was repeated upon Karadzic's  arrival in Moscow, when the Russian- Serb agreement on the  reopening of Tuzla airport was flamboyantly declared. The  Kremlin diplomats triumphantly ascribed the main role in the  humanitarian unblocking of the Tuzla region to themselves,  although they understand that the UN would have conducted the  operation with or without the Russian-Serb approval. However,  Russia has succeeded in something here, as in the Sarajevo case:  It has reinforced its military presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Using the logic of following the path of the least resistance,  the UN has accepted Russian control role of the airport, as they  accepted a similar role for Russian soldiers in Sarajevo.  However, the question arises as to how far it is possible to  go. The ultimate Russian intention is to, in agreement with  Belgrade and Pale, deploy its soldiers in all the Bosnian buffer  zones as peace arrives in them. This is the line Karadzic  followed in talking to the presidents of both parliamentary  councils of Russia, whose have the final word when it comes to  sending Russian troops out of the country. There are many  reasons to consider the possibility that, following the trends  of Russian policies employed so far, Bosnia will soon be divided  and militarily neutralized like post-war Germany, with internal  borders seemingly there inevitably to divide the country, marked  by Russian troops on one side and Western troops on the other.    Russia wants to work on this arrangement hand in hand with  Washington. The United States has so far refused the Moscow  initiatives for returning to the principle of division of  interest spheres. However, no one can guarantee that this will  not eventually happen. Chiefs of diplomacy, Kozyrev and  Christopher, are meeting later this week in Vladivistok, and  Bosnia will be the center of attention. The Kremlin has planned  to close the circle started with Karadzic by then directly  contacting Croatian and Muslim leaders.    Haris Silajdzic accepted Moscow's invitation, but did not  want to rush off to Moscow, which wished to see him the same  evening that Karadzic was leaving. It seems that the head of  the Bosnian Government also refused the honors that he was  offered, certainly aware of the false hospitality that the  Russians were suddenly offering. By going to Moscow, he  acknowledges Russia's importance in the resolving of the Bosnian  crisis. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic is doing the  same. He will be visiting Russia's capital at the same time as  Silajdzic.    For the time being, there are no indications that Russian  diplomacy will mediate between the three people who have been  negotiating on Bosnia for a long time and without much success,  but it is quite possible that some of Karadzic's important  messages will be conveyed to Silajdzic and Granic by Kozyrev and  Churkin. The matter primarily concerns territorial demarcations  within Bosnia- Herzegovina.    To conclude, let us say that Moscow is very interested in  what lies behind the Muslim-Croat agreement signed in  Washington, which it both wants and fears. It wants the  agreement because it effectively legalizes its aim, which is to  break independent Bosnia- Herzegovina definitely into pieces,  and fears it because the unification of the Bosnian Muslims and  Croats with the Republic of Croatia can easily lead to another  escalation of the war, that is, to the creation of a  Muslim-Croat anti-Serb block! Russia is prepared for either  case. Everyone involved in deciding on Bosnia's future should  be aware that in either case Mother Russia will undoubtedly be a  Serb sponsor, and is, for the sake of its protege, prepared to  risk as much as its own international prestige.</p>

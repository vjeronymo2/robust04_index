			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Mexican peso steadies on hopes for economy The Mexican peso stabilised yesterday as investors were reassured by reports that an emergency economic plan would receive backing from leading industrial countries and international financial institutions. President Ernesto Zedillo was expected to announce details of the plan late yesterday, when there were widespread reports on local financial markets that Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the finance minister, would be replaced. Mexican reports suggested that the international backing might range from approval from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations of Mr Zedillo's proposals to funding of up to Dollars 10bn to ease fears over repayment obligations. US President Bill Clinton said he backed reform efforts in Mexico and was looking into 'what we can do' to stabilise the peso: 'It is something that I take seriously and we are looking at it very seriously. We're talking to the Mexican government about what we can do.' At midday, the spot rate for the peso was 4.925 to the US dollar, slightly up from Wednesday's close of 4.975, while the Mexican stock market was up 1.53 per cent. Mexican equities in New York continued a slow climb that began on Wednesday. A delegation from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Mexico City late on Wednesday night and was reported to have met Mr Zedillo and Mr Serra, who has been criticised for poor handling of the peso crisis. 'It is obvious that the president needs someone else to implement the plan,' a senior aide to Mr Serra said. Officials said the IMF mission was reviewing the economic stabilisation plan and might act as an intermediary between the Mexican government and international agencies. The IMF itself was unlikely to provide funds. Commercial bankers say the Mexican government would need extra funds if holders of government securities decided not to roll over their investments and demanded dollars over pesos. More than Dollars 10bn in dollar-denominated, short-term government securities called Tesobonos come due in the next three months. Backing from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations for Mexico's economic stabilisation plan would increase the likelihood that investors will remain in the market, reducing the need for an emergency injection of international capital. Meanwhile, the central bank said it was preparing 'new and attractive' debt instruments to retain foreign investors. Central bank officials emphasised that any new instruments would be voluntary, squashing rumours that investors would be forced to buy government paper. Details of the complete package were expected to accompany Mr Zedillo's announcement, the bank said. Investors were also encouraged by signs that negotiations between the government and armed rebels in the southern state of Chiapas might begin soon.

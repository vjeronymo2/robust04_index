			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Indonesia budgets amid policy malaise: Unease about economic direction in spite of the good numbers WHEN President Suharto announces Indonesia's annual budget tomorrow, he is likely to paint 1992 as a year of consolidation setting the ground for a renewed, if moderate, increase in growth. Behind the imperturbable face of government, however, there is growing unease at the conduct of economic policy. The main indicators give the economy a rosy hue. Inflation has been cut by a third in the past 12 months to about 6 per cent while the current account deficit, Dollars 4.5bn in 1991, will have fallen to about Dollars 4bn last year. Indonesia's international debt held steady in 1992 at Dollars 78bn and 20 per cent growth in non-oil exports should prompt a fall in the debt service ratio from 32 per cent of export proceeds last year. Economists estimate Indonesia achieved gross domestic product growth of about 5.75 per cent in 1992, down from 6.75 per cent a year earlier. A rise to about 6.5 per cent is forecast for this year. Mr Suharto's budget, however, will need to be a cautious one. Oil and gas account for nearly 40 per cent of exports and a weakening oil market could cause havoc with government finances. For every dollar drop in the price of a barrel of oil, export revenue falls by Dollars 500m. Pressures are rising on government expenditure, likely to be targeted at about Rp62,000bn (Pounds 19.9bn) this year. Civil service wages have been static for two years, so that a typical state employee with six years' service receives just Rp56,000 a month, close to the minimum wage. Demands for expenditure on overstretched infrastructure are increasing. Above all, with 2m people entering the labour market every year, strong growth is required to maintain social stability. Since the mid-1980s, the government has adopted economic deregulation as a means of promoting growth through the private sector. However, enthusiasm for this may have passed. Indonesia is still grappling with the effects of a 1988 package of financial deregulation which led to a near doubling in the number of banks to more than 200 and a concomitant growth in bank credit, offshore borrowing and new investment. Poor management and a lack of central supervision have left many banks undercapitalised. And the level of non-performing loans - those on which no interest has been paid for three months or more - is estimated by one donor official at up to 20 per cent of the banking sector's assets. Central bank officials say it is no more than 6 per cent. Last month Bank Summa, the country's tenth-largest private bank, was ordered into liquidation owing Rp1,600bn. Foreign bankers say lending limits to Indonesia are being tightened and the cost of borrowing increased. Government officials also concede actual investment in Indonesia has fallen sharply (exact figures are not available) in the last year. Approvals in 1991 were Dollars 29bn. Mr Adrianus Mooy, governor of Bank Indonesia, says the decline 'is the cost we have to pay in the short run in order to achieve more sustainable long-term growth'. However, with the opening up of southern China and Vietnam, the fall in investment may be longer-term. Donors, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, are pressing the government to respond with further deregulation. But the problems with the financial sector have strengthened the hand of those arguing for state intervention and a controlled business environment for the private sector. Deregulation last year was piecemeal. Foreigners were allowed to own 100 per cent of new projects but, on the main island of Java, only if they invested more than Dollars 50m. Sectors of the economy such as cement, steel, sugar, wheat, rice, and cloves  -the essential ingredient in Indonesia's kretek cigarettes - remain heavily influenced by government or dominated by politically well-connected private companies. Moves to attract private sector involvement in infrastructure projects have also faltered. Negotiations over the Dollars 2bn Paiton power plant in East Java have yet to be concluded, seven months after Mission Energy of the US won approval for the project. The contract to expand the congested main port of Tanjung Priok has been delayed while a proposal by the Humpuss Group, controlled by Mr Suharto's youngest son, to run the port is considered. Diplomats say Mr Suharto is receiving conflicting advice from ministers promoting themselves prior to a cabinet reshuffle in March. In one ear he is told to confront project delays and economic weaknesses by strengthening central decision-making. In the other he hears that the failings of deregulation are the result of economic technocrats having insufficient autonomy, while central interference is obstructing essential projects. The message from the business community is more succinct. As the head of one conglomerate puts it, until the direction of economic policy is clear, 'I've told my staff, no more investment'.</p>

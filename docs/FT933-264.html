			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / France's communist chief to step down: End of the road for Marchais - the hardliner who preferred egalite to liberte MR Georges Marchais, France's veteran Communist party leader, said yesterday he would step down next January as the party's general secretary. 'I have held this position for 20 years and you know how old I am,' said Mr Marchais, 73, who has a history of heart problems and is recovering from a hip operation. Mr Marchais, whose bushy eyebrows and booming voice have made him a favourite target of France's satirists, has not only played a prominent part in domestic politics but was a key figure in western communism during the closing years of the cold war. However, his reign over the French communists has been an era of dramatic decline. Mr Marchais, long a protege of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, took the helm in 1972 when the communists were the dominant force on the French left, with 25 per cent of the vote. But their share had slipped to just over 9 per cent in this spring's first round of voting for the legislative elections. The first thorn in the communists' side was the rise of the Socialist party after its resurrection by Mr Francois Mitterrand in 1971. The socialists swiftly ousted the communists as the main faction on the left. When Mr Mitterrand won the presidential elections in 1981, Mr Marchais polled 15.3 per cent, the lowest score of any communist leader since 1935. Many commentators blamed Mr Marchais' orthodox view of communism for the loss of appeal. The decline of the Communist party accelerated during the 1980s. Many of the party's traditional working class supporters defected to Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme-right wing National Front. At the same time it lost prospective young recruits to Les Verts, the radical wing of the environmentalist movement. The party's problems were aggravated by Mr Marchais' refusal to adapt to changing circumstances. Snubbing public opinion, he backed the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as well as the crackdown on Poland's Solidarity movement in 1981. Mr Marchais' hardline views came under regular attack from the reformists within his party, who lobbied for the French communists to modernise along the lines of their more dynamic Italian counterparts. He always succeeded in staving off the attacks on his own position and in clinging on to his Val-de-Marne constituency in the Paris suburbs, despite the erosion in the party's support. His position within the party was reinforced by his high public profile. Mr Marchais, a miner's son from the Calvados region, was a talented television performer who styled himself as a wise-cracking demagogue, in stark contrast to the bourgeois intellectuals who tend to dominate French politics. However, the attacks on his leadership continued, not least from Mr Charles Fiterman, the outspoken reformist who is now the favourite to succeed him as general secretary. Mr Marchais was recently forced to agree to a package of internal reforms. The most embarrassing aspect of his career was his second world war record, which dogged him through the years. While other communists played key roles in the wartime Resistance, he worked in an aircraft factory in Nazi Germany. He always argued he was drafted as a forced labourer but never succeeded in dispelling doubts that he went voluntarily because it offered him a job. Suffering from arthritis and a weak heart, Mr Marchais said he would retain his parliamentary seat for the Val-de-Marne. Despite the rows, the communist leadership yesterday rallied behind their departing general secretary. Mr Pierre Blotin, a member of the central committee, described his resignation as 'an important and moving moment'.</p>

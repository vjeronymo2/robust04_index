			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Solidarity as Political Support"] </F>   [Text] External political departments of Argentina,  Denmark, Israel, China, and Japan have recently made official  statements in support of Ukraine with regard to resolving the  conflict situation in the Crimea. This became known at a  briefing at Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition  to official circles of the world's leading countries,  international organizations, public associations, and the  Ukrainian diaspora have also demonstrated their solidarity with  our state. All of them are in favor of a peaceful settlement of  the conflict situation in which the principles set by the CSCE  -- inviolability of borders and maintenance of states'  territorial integrity -- will be adhered to. It was also stated  at the briefing that a Ukrainian delegation headed by minister  of foreign affairs A. Zlenko will soon visit Istanbul where it  will take part in the session of the Council of the North  Atlantic Cooperation. The program "Partnership for Peace" will  be the main topic of the discussion.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: British Land improves 12% and sees sound outcome BRITISH LAND, the property company chaired by Mr John Ritblat, yesterday announced an 12 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 11.4m for the six months to September 30. Mr Ritblat, one of the most prominent investors in the property market over the past two years, said he was confident about the market. 'I have not altered the view expressed in June that the direct property market has now seen the worst of the recession.' The results reflected the emergence of some long-term benefits from the company's active buying programme during the downturn, he said. He expected a sound outcome for the current financial year. 'Unless buffeted by accidents, financial or political, we remain well placed.' The results, in line with expectations, together with a greater-than-expected dividend increase, sent the shares up 4p to 174p. Since the last year end, British Land has bought Pounds 78m of property although Mr Ritblat said that an improvement in property yields had reduced the flow of suitable investments properties. The acquisitions included the outstanding interest of offices at Finsbury Avenue in the City of London, Teesside Retail Park and Greyhound Retail Park in Chester. In addition, the company spent Pounds 13m on updating its portfolio. Net rents were 17 per cent higher at Pounds 54.4m (Pounds 46.6m) while the interest bill was Pounds 45.9m (Pounds 38.5m), excluding Pounds 1m (Pounds 600,000) of capitalised interest. The portfolio's voids remained at 2.5 per cent, excluding two development properties. Earnings per share were 3.8p (3.6p), up 5.6 per cent. The interim dividend is increased by 10 per cent from 2.07p to 2.28p.</p>

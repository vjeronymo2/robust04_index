			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WRONG CONCLUSIONS ABOUT COMPUTERS  </P> <P> Ah, c'mon, Joe. I think you blew it. You know from a previous letter that I am  an admirer of yours, but in your Sept. 18 column, "Maiming the Message Is Only  Half the Danger," I think you and the researcher you cited draw the wrong  conclusions. I don't doubt the evidence of poorer writing debouching from some  computers, but I think that evidence might carry other interpretations than  that computers somehow cause bad composition.  </P> <P> For example, I think the evidence is capable of indicating the inverted values  of our society, which does not prize and therefore pay for disciplined  learning, clear thinking and powerful expression. Thus, the people who do  possess the above characteristics often do not have the financial resources to  buy the more expensive computers and must make do with typewriters or legal  pads.  </P> <P> Alternatively, the computer for those who are in the high school and college  population may be just another toy from indulgent parents, along with the  sports car in the parking lot and the posh apartment. Indulged students are not  notorious for disciplined learning. Those who are in school despite having to  work for the privilege or scrape along on a meager parental stipend may know  the value of what they're working for and, again, be able to afford only a  typewriter or legal pad. This may not be a true alternative to the previous  paragraph but only a different facet of it; I can spell marvelously, but I'm no  great shakes at logic.  </P> <P> Speaking of spelling, I'd like to point out that the greater incidence of  misspellings in the computer output surely is an indication of prior mental  disability or laziness. All it takes is running the essay through a spelling  checker to obviate this. That same device also catches true typos, transposed  letters (I'm slightly dyslexic) and twice-written words, although it will not  indicate the improper use of there or their, to or too, as long as they're  properly spelled.  </P> <P> And then there are the marvels of the electronic thesaurus.  </P> <P> I'd like to recommend that you seriously consider learning to use a computer.  Like me, you already know how to compose and spell. I find that the computer  allows me to write much faster than I type or write longhand, so that I am  better able to keep up with the flow of thought -- that is, when my thoughts  are flowing rather than obstructed. I think that my writing is clearer and more  elegant, in the best sense of that term, because I am able to go back and  easily rewrite, change words, etc. When I typed, I would often forgo  non-essential rewrites because I didn't want to retype the whole page for one  word.  </P> <P> The radiation danger and consequent risk of cancer is another matter entirely.  Now what is the telephone number of my oncologist?  </P> <P> MARK SHIER  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Wang Dan, one of the most prominent leaders of the  1989 student movement, will not be in Beijing for the fifth  anniversary of the June 4 massacre.    Mr. Wang, 25, said yesterday he had decided to leave the  capital towards the end of May and return a few days after the  anniversary. "The political situation here is very sensitive at  the moment so it really would be inconvenient for me to be here  on June 4," he said.    Analysts said the absence of Mr. Wang, the only significant  leader of the student movement still in Beijing would make it  difficult for any meaningful commemorative protest to take place  on June 4. "Any commemorative activity would require a  figurehead and Wang Dan is just about the only person who fits  the bill," a Western diplomat said. "Everyone else is either in  detention or abroad."    Mr. Wang had earlier said he felt a moral responsibility to  be in Beijing during the anniversary but admitted yesterday to  having a change of heart. "I've come to the conclusion that  things will only get worse if I stay," he said. Mr. Wang said  he would probably be travelling on his own and at his own  expense although he had not yet decided where to go.    He has been under intense pressure from the security forces  to curtail his political activities and stay away from foreign  journalists. Friends of the democracy activist said the  pressure was affecting him and it was not surprising that he had  decided to lay low for a while.</p>

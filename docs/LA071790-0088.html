			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUMINA HOPES TO HITCH A RIDE WITH TOM CRUISE;  </P> <P> MARKETING: MANY ARE SKEPTICAL, HOWEVER, THAT THE CHEVROLET'S SUPPORTING ROLE IN  THE "DAYS OF THUNDER" MOVIE WILL BRING BUYERS TO SHOWROOMS.  </P> <P> When mom, dad and the kids drive to the neighborhood theater to see "Days of  Thunder" this summer, they may be surprised to discover that the family car has  a starring role.  </P> <P> The Chevrolet Lumina, the transportation of choice for many people whose  favorite option is a child safety seat, turns up as Tom Cruise's howling  monster of a race car in the film, complete with stickers on its neon-green  body armor promoting auto parts, not theme parks.  </P> <P> This may strike some as an odd way to promote a car that was introduced as a  competitor for the conservative Ford Taurus last year. But Chevrolet hopes the  entire Lumina line -- which includes a sedan, a coupe and a van -- will benefit  from the "Days of Thunder" connection.  </P> <P> Chevrolet dealerships are bedecked in "Days of Thunder" banners, and shoppers  are being offered special incentives on the sportiest version of the Lumina,  the Euro model. The $50-million promotional effort by the auto maker and other  sponsors even includes a shopping mall tour featuring a replica of Cruise's  car.  </P> <P> "What we are looking for is lots of exposure for the Lumina," said Chevrolet  spokesman Dan Hubbert. "This is another way of generating some excitement for  the product."  </P> <P> Hubbert said it's too early to tell whether the campaign will power Lumina into  the winner's circle. Other cars have benefited from favorable film and  television exposure, including the Pontiac Trans Am in "Knight Rider," the  Pontiac Firebird in "Smokey and the Bandit" and the Ford Mustang in "Bullitt."  But dealers said "Days of Thunder," released June 27 and doing less business  than expected, has had little impact on Lumina sales so far.  </P> <P> At Kramer Chevrolet in Santa Monica, Claud Ellard is still waiting for the race  to begin. "In our particular store, there's been no reaction," Ellard said  recently.  </P> <P> Tracy Browne, sales manager at Nugent Chevrolet, said most Lumina enthusiasts  are in the 30-year-old to 40-year-old range, hardly the speedster crowd.  </P> <P> At Daniel Chevrolet in Marina del Rey, however, sales manager Michael Borden  said growing numbers of people, fresh from seeing "Days of Thunder," are taking  a look at the Lumina, especially the red or black Euro models that include a  spoiler. But Borden added that many customers remain confused about the nature  of the automobile.  </P> <P> "The MPV (mini-van) model is our best seller," Borden said. "But interest in  the coupe is building through the movie. They probably should have named the  van something else."  </P> <P> Marketing and automobile experts agree that the Lumina line lacks a clear  identity. Early promotional campaigns were squarely aimed at the family market.  The Lumina sedan was named the "official car" of Disney World's Disney-MGM  Studios Theme Park in Florida, and one television commercial even showed Disney  cartoon characters parading around the auto.  </P> <P> Chevrolet branched out by introducing a sportier two-door model and by placing  the Lumina name on its version of General Motors' futuristic-looking mini-vans.  Lumina took on yet another identity when it was recently refashioned as  Chevrolet's entry in NASCAR competitions. The souped-up Lumina has thus far won  about 44% of the races it has entered, Chevrolet says.  </P> <P> One sponsor of Lumina racers, J. R. Hendrick III, is a friend of actor Cruise.  And it was the two of them who reportedly persuaded Paramount to use the Lumina  in "Days of Thunder." Chevrolet General Manager J. C. Perkins has boasted that  the movie identifies Chevrolet as a winner.  </P> <P> But Jon Lowell, a senior editor at Ward's Automotive Reports in Detroit, said  the marketing strategy makes no sense.  </P> <P> "What's particularly bizarre about using the Lumina in 'Days of Thunder' is  that the cars on-screen are rear-wheel-drives powered by a V8 engine, neither  of which is available on the showroom floor," he said. "This is a family  sedan."  </P> <P> Car &amp; Driver magazine last year noted that even the sportiest V6-model  Lumina took 10.5 seconds to reach 60 miles per hour, not exactly race car  speeds. "Almost everything about it is average," Car &amp; Driver concluded.  </P> <P> Statistics compiled by Chevrolet for the first half of the year show that the  four-door sedan, the model that most appeals to families, has dominated Lumina  sales, accounting for 56%. The two-door Euro made up only 15% of the car's  business.  </P> <P> The basic model sells for about $15,000. Ward's reported that the Lumina was  the seventh-most-popular car sold in America during the first half of the year.  But it still ranked behind two other Chevrolets, the Corsica-Beretta and the  Cavalier.  </P> <P> Jeffrey B. Hirsch of Hirsch Marketing in Venice said the "Days of Thunder"  tie-in could actually hurt the car. "The Lumina is not the same thing to all  people, so there's some potential for confusion," he said. "Is this a family  car or what? People may start to ask: 'What are we supposed to be doing with  this car?' "  </P> <P> Frank Devaney, an executive with public relations firm Rogers &amp; Cowan who  specializes in car placements in films and television shows, agreed that the  showroom Lumina may not live up to expectations, but said the car could still  benefit from the association with Cruise. "People really do emulate their  favorite stars," Devaney said. "And many of them will want to be like Cruise."  </P> <P> Another placement specialist, Jim Hillson of Phase One, said any  attention-grabbing device may prove helpful today. "It's a way to get something  distinctive going in a market that is so cluttered it's hard to break anything  through," Hillson said.  </P></p>

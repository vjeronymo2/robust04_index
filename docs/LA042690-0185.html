			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME, VIACOM NEAR ACCORD TO MERGE 2 COMEDY CHANNELS  </P> <P> Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. have reached a rough agreement to merge their  respective cable television comedy networks, executives familiar with the  negotiations said late Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We have an agreement in principle, but there are still some minor details to  work out," said an executive close to the negotiations. However, the executive  said an announcement could still be a week away.  </P> <P> Time Warner and Viacom have been holding discussions for several months about  merging their fledgling cable comedy channels, both of which are struggling to  attract subscribers and advertisers.  </P> <P> Time Warner launched the Comedy Channel last November to a subscriber base of 6  million homes, and Viacom premiered Ha! on April 1 with only 4 million  subscribers. Executives at both companies remain convinced that there is a  demand for an all-comedy cable channel, but system operators who carry the  services do not believe there is room for two competing services.  </P> <P> According to executives close to the negotiations, the combined comedy channel  would be managed by a board composed of representatives from Time Warner,  Viacom and any cable system operators who may become equity partners in the  combined service. Time Warner and Viacom would be equal shareholders, while the  cable operators collectively would own less than a one-third stake.  </P> <P> "We are pretty comfortable at this point," said one executive. "We believe some  of the cable companies will come in for a piece of the equity."  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Time Warner threatened to sue five of the country's largest  cable operators that were negotiating to buy an equity stake in Ha!, which is  operated by Viacom's MTV Networks division. The cable operators included  Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp., Continental Cablevision, Newhouse  Broadcasting and Cox Cable. The deal would have boosted the channel's  subscriber base to 20 million homes.  </P> <P> Time Warner feared that any such deal would lock out the Comedy Channel from  systems owned by those operators, and the company threatened to sue on  antitrust grounds. The threat was apparently taken seriously enough that  negotiations were dropped.  </P> <P> But a rough start for both comedy networks and limited channel space on cable  television systems has forced Time Warner and Viacom back to the negotiating  table.  </P> <P> Viacom, although it launched Ha! with fewer subscribers than the Comedy  Channel's, has one important bargaining chip: a $2.5-billion antitrust lawsuit  that it filed against Time Warner's HBO last year, alleging that HBO  monopolizes the pay television business. Industry analysts have speculated that  Viacom would drop its lawsuit as part of any merger deal, but a Viacom  executive Wednesday evening denied that there was any link between the lawsuit  and the proposed comedy channel merger.  </P> <P> "The two are separate issues," the executive maintained. Viacom Chairman Sumner  M. Redstone has been taking a hard line on the lawsuit, insisting that it not  be linked to any deal to merge the comedy networks.  </P></p>

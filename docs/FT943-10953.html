			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke eyes casinos business Ladbroke, the hotels, betting and DIY group, could agree to buy three casinos by the end of this month - 15 years after being forced out of the business for what a court called 'disgraceful' behaviour. Ladbroke is thought to be three weeks away from concluding a Pounds 50m deal to buy three London casinos from Mr Trevor Hemmings, the leisure operator. The group will not know until after the deal is concluded, however, whether it will get Gaming Board approval to run them. Ladbroke could continue to run the establishments under their existing licences on a temporary basis, but will then require a new certificate of consent from the Gaming Board, confirming that it is a fit and proper company to run the casinos. Ladbroke lost three of its casino licences in 1979 after allegations about the way in which it had attempted to win business from rivals. The retirement of Mr Cyril Stein as Ladbroke chairman at the beginning of this year, however, opened the way for the group to attempt to re-enter the casino business. Mr Peter George, Ladbroke's new chief executive, has made no secret of his desire to run casinos once again, alongside its hotel and betting operations. The group has said it wants to sell off its property division. While it is continuing to improve the management of its Texas Homecare DIY chain, Ladbroke does not see itself as a retailer in the long term. Mr Hemmings' clubs would provide Ladbroke with a good spread of casino business. Maxims is aimed at high-spenders, the Golden Horseshoe at the middle market, and Charlie Chester's at small gamblers.</p>

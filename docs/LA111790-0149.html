			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BURTON BLAMES 'SELF-SERVING, INEPT' JERRY BROWN FOR FEINSTEIN'S DEFEAT;  </P> <P> POLITICS: BUT OTHER DEMOCRATS SAY THE NOMINEE FOR GOVERNOR SHARES  RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER LOSS TO PETE WILSON.  </P> <P> Internal bickering among California Democrats over blame for Dianne Feinstein's  narrow gubernatorial defeat surfaced Friday in Florida as delegates to a  meeting of state Democratic officials snickered over a letter harshly critical  of state party chairman and former governor Edmund G. Brown Jr.  </P> <P> In a letter dispatched to state Democratic Party chairmen meeting in Miami,  California Assemblyman John Burton of San Francisco said Brown bungled the  party's get-out-the-vote drive and doomed Feinstein to defeat. Feinstein lost  to Republican Pete Wilson by 3% of the votes cast.  </P> <P> Brown "is the most self-serving, inept politician that I have ever met in my 35  years in politics," Burton's letter to the Democratic officials said.  </P> <P> Brown, defending his tenure as state party chairman, promptly labeled Burton "a  yeller and a screamer" and said the assemblyman was "out of touch" with  California Democrats.  </P> <P> "He's used to just yelling and having everybody shake," Brown said in a  telephone interview from Miami.  </P> <P> Burton's letter was only the latest bit of ammunition to be fired at or by  Brown since the Feinstein defeat. As dispute over the election results  continues, some Democrats have separated into camps. Others are openly  chagrined that the tempest will further sour the party's image.  </P> <P> While the shifting of blame is a traditional act for fratricidal Democrats, it  has been heightened this year because of maneuvering over the two 1992 Senate  races and the general tumult caused by the success of initiatives limiting the  terms of elected officials.  </P> <P> So far, Burton has raised the loudest public ruckus against Brown, and has  himself come under criticism from Brown partisans. They contend that Burton is  trying to undercut a future Senate bid by Brown in order to assist his  political ally, Rep. Barbara Boxer of Greenbrae. Boxer has announced she will  run for the Senate.  </P> <P> Burton, in an interview, dismissed with an expletive the suggestion that his  attack was politically motivated.  </P> <P> The intraparty tussle is expected to be renewed this weekend at a meeting of  the state party's executive committee in San Jose.  </P> <P> Burton said he personally believes that Brown, whose term runs until 1993,  should be ousted as the party chairman. However, party rules establish a  complicated process for dismissing officers, making summary action this weekend  impossible.  </P> <P> Brown also maintains some strong ties with party regulars, many of whom insist  that it is overly simplistic to blame him for Feinstein's defeat.  </P> <P> Feinstein herself made several strategic errors during the course of the  campaign, fellow Democrats point out, including a decision not to air  television ads critical of Wilson's absence from the Senate until after Wilson  had defused the issue by returning to Washington.  </P> <P> The surge of concern over the Persian Gulf stalemate and fears about a  recession played against Feinstein's positioning of herself as a "candidate of  change." And some voters were influenced against Feinstein because she is a  woman, polls showed.  </P> <P> Fund-raisers who could have financed a stronger get-out-the-vote effort were  pulled in several different directions. In June, Democrats were working to  defeat initiatives that would have reformed the reapportionment process. In  November, many were allied against the term-limit initiatives, one of which  succeeded.  </P> <P> Brown has pointed out that his San Francisco law firm spent $300,000 to help  overturn Proposition 73, the campaign financing measure that was struck down by  a state court in September, allowing Feinstein to collect millions in extra  campaign dollars and bringing her closer to Wilson in the polls.  </P> <P> Several of the party's organized groups, including the Los Angeles County  Democratic organization, have rushed to Brown's defense.  </P> <P> "We all share responsibility for the loss of the governor's race," said David  Brooks, chairman of the Butte County Central Committee, in a letter to the  party executive committee.  </P> <P> Problems with the party's get-out-the-vote organization began in February with  the dismissal of voter organizer Marshall Ganz over what Brown says was a  financial dispute and Ganz says was a failure by Brown to commit to a massive  plan to target 750,000 voters.  </P> <P> Ganz was not replaced until mid-September, when fellow organizer Larry  Tramutola was brought in to head what turned out to be a much-diminished  effort.  </P> <P> Although Ganz said Brown bears "a major responsibility" for November's results  because Brown scuttled the initial program, he and other Democrats said elected  officials and Feinstein herself deserve some of the blame for the low-powered  effort.  </P> <P> "Once the statewide candidates were nominated in June, they certainly had  responsibility, too," Ganz said. "Why the Feinstein people didn't raise holy  hell . . . is a mystery to me."  </P> <P> Ganz said he proposed a get-out-the-vote effort to Feinstein's campaign staff,  but the suggestion "disappeared into the mist."  </P> <P> Several Democrats said this week that they were concerned that public dissent  over the election results would disintegrate into Brown-bashing and enhance the  perception of Democrats as a less-than-organized lot.  </P> <P> "I really wish what was being debated was why did the party drop the ball on  registration and get-out-the-vote and why didn't Feinstein pick up the ball,"  Ganz said. "Instead it's a little like low farce."  </P> <P> Times political writer Robert Shogan contributed to this story from Miami.  </P></p>

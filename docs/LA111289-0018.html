While Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko's characters  all died, negotiations are under way to sign survivors Lou Diamond Phillips,  Emilio Estevez and Kiefer Sutherland. Since production is scheduled to get  under way in January, when weather could be a problem, location scouting is  going on in Arizona and Texas as well as New Mexico, where the original film  was shot. . . Arnold Kopelson and Keith Barish will produce "The Fugitive," a  $30-million film version of the 20-year-old TV series for Warners. Production  is four to six months off as rewrites of David N. Twohy's script are being  done. Sources indicate that British director Stephen Frears ("Dangerous  Liaisons") and actor Harrison Ford are among those being approached about the  project. . . . Meanwhile, Twohy is writing "Aliens III" for Fox. . . .  </P> <P> Isabella Rossellini joins Bruce Willis in the caper film, "Hudson Hawk."  Michael Lehman ("Heathers") directs the Joel Silver production for Tri-Star.

Woody  has left himself out of the cast, but Mia Farrow is in. . . David Carradine  stars as a preacher, and former porn star Tracy Lords plays the eldest of his  five daughters in Eyefilm's "Prey, for the Wicked."

Chesler, executive producer and creator of pay-TV's "The Hitchhiker,"  has purchased film rights to 1963 Japanese novel, "The Lady Killer" by Masako  Togawa, a highly controversial and erotic thriller that dealt with role of  women in that society. Screenwriter Robert J. Avrech ("Body Double") will adapt  the book, and Carl Schenkel ("The Mighty Quinn") will direct. "Crimson  Cabaret," the title of the film version, will film in Japan and possibly Hong  Kong this spring. . . . KIRK HONEYCUTT  </P></p>

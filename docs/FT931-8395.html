			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Hooked on glory drug The British government is cutting defence expenditure, expanding British military commitments, and doggedly refusing to ask the basic question behind this impossible equation. That question is: what is the proper role for a medium-sized nation shorn of its empire and much of its former economic strength? You could argue that our contribution to the world's security should be enhanced. If so, the government should halt the present run-down in our military forces. Equally, you could say that a significant proportion of Britain's military spending is devoted to the massaging of national self-esteem, or, worse, to nostalgia. If that is the case, we spend too much now, and plan to cut too little in the future. The conundrum seemed easier to think through when the Soviet threat existed. I remember a lunchtime meeting with the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher in her room at the House of Commons. It was, I think, 1976. Sir, now Lord, Keith Joseph was the other guest. As our hostess set about carving slices of ham the two of them set about public spending. Their knives swished through the air. Millions were chopped off this, that and the other departmental budget, until, quite quickly, the two founders of Thatcherism had saved a billion. In those days that was serious money. 'What would you do with the billion?' I asked the then recently elected leader of the opposition. 'Spend it on defence,' she replied at once. She did. She became prime minister three years later. In 1978-79 the armed forces' budget totalled Pounds 7.6 bn. By the time Lady Thatcher left office in 1990 that cash outlay had very nearly trebled. In real terms the figure rose by 28 per cent between Labour's last year and 1984-85. The inflation-adjusted amount has since been declining steadily from the peak achieved in the mid-1980s. By 1995-96 British spending on defence will be back to the equivalent in today's money of what was being laid out just before the Thatcher decade began. This time, however, there is no overriding Soviet threat. Perhaps that explains why others are cutting their defence budgets faster than we are. In 1992 average military spending in Nato was 2.9 per cent of gross domestic product. The equivalent figure for the UK is expected to work out at 4.1 per cent. Even France, at 3.6 per cent in 1990, is less ambitious than that. Germany is planning to cut its defence force by about 40 per cent. Belgium and the Netherlands, also Nato allies, are contemplating halving theirs. Britain plans a cut of one-fifth. Against that our wholly professional army, like that of the US, is more expensive than many of the Continental forces, which depend on conscripts. Under President George Bush the US planned to reduce its outlay on national defence - down to 5.6 per cent of GDP in 1990 - by nearly 14 per cent between 1992 and 1996. The equivalent British reduction is 11 per cent. The additional cuts proposed by President Bill Clinton in his state of the union message on Wednesday will further increase the rate of shrinkage of spending by the Pentagon. This is not to say that Britain is necessarily the profligate one. It depends upon what the money is for. The government's master plan is Options for Change, the name given to a review initiated in 1990. Lord Chalfont said in the Lords last week that when the results of this review were announced, 'we were told that it was based upon fulfilling commitments to Allied Command Europe, the dependent territories, Northern Ireland, and the defence of the United Kingdom'. Yet within months Britain was undertaking commitments in Yugoslavia and the Middle East 'which were nothing to do with any of those four basic interests'. It is not clear to me why we maintain 46,000 troops in Germany, and will still have 23,000 when the current reduction process is completed in two years. Do we really need to keep 3,300 troops in Cyprus, let alone little support services around the portions of the world formerly coloured pink on the maps? While the government thinks we do, there may be something in the argument by the select committee on defence, in its report published 10 days ago, that given what is asked of it Britain's army is more than fully stretched. The trouble is that the committee does not question those tasks. Nobody does. The defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, did not do so in last year's statement on the defence estimates. The foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, failed to do so in his otherwise thoughtful speech at Chatham House a few weeks ago - the one that began, 'British foreign policy exists to protect and promote British interests'. Yes, but what is Britain's proper place in the world? Most of us can agree on the case for maintaining troops in Northern Ireland, the need to insure against direct attack upon ourselves, and the desirability of contributing to European defence forces, particularly through Nato. The rest sometimes seems to be determined by what gets first place on the TV news. One minister has said, only half in jest, that 'we are all human; we see an atrocity on the small screen and come into cabinet next day spouting that something must be done about it'. Britain's role appears to be that of joint second policeman to Uncle Sam, with France in an equal position. This awkward squad is ever-poised to chase into every trouble-spot that manages to catch the popular eye. As Mr Hurd said, the UN knows of about 25 substantial conflicts going on now. 'I suppose that world cameras cover 2 or 3 at a time,' he added. This made it all very difficult. The foreign secretary has yet to state the government's criteria for choosing where, if anywhere, to send British troops. The answer is, of course, gut feel, the product of a lethal mix. Start with ministers' sense of British history. Add a dollop of popular pressure. Pour in our pride in our nuclear power, our permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council and our prominence in most global organisations. Add a dash of undying allegiance to the US. Wash over with deep tribal memories of the days of empire, enhanced by dreams of a long string of past victories. It is such desires that Britain's Conservatives need to assuage, by means that Labour dares not thwart. Glory is an expensive drug. Britain is still hooked.</p>

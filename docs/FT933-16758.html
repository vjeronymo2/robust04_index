			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / China tries to quell rural fury THE Chinese government, has promised to cash IOUs worth millions of dollars in a move designed to quell the anger of the country's peasants who feel they are being cheated of their share in China's growing prosperity. The central bank, the Bank of China, has authorised post offices in areas where dissatisfaction has erupted into rioting and violence against government institutions to draw on local branches to cash remittances sent from relatives working elsewhere. Accounts will be settled directly with the central bank because the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China, the specialised banks that would normally meet this demand, are short of cash, the official China Daily reported yesterday The paper said peasants in some areas, unable to get their money, have attacked post offices, smashing windows and injuring postal workers. The announcement follows rioting last month in Sichuan, China's most populous province, in which furious farmers attacked government headquarters in protest against tax increases. The China Daily said the problem of tight money supply is worst in the southern provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi, among the country's main grain-growing areas, but also exists in central provinces, including Anhui and Guizhou which are among China's poorest. Official figures show that peasants' annual average per capita income is 770 yuan (Pounds 90), which is less than half the average city income. The remittances, known as 'green IOUs' to distinguish them from 'white IOUs' paid to farmers for their state quota of grain, are one of the few sources of cash for China's peasants, who are having to rely more and more on money from relatives in the relatively affluent cities. With the approach of summer planting, farmers need money to buy increasingly expensive equipment and fertilisers. Once they harvest, they face the prospect of again being paid white IOUs for compulsory state purchases. These IOUs were such a source of discontent last year that the government opened its coffers to honour its commitment to pay up by Chinese New Year. The depth of government alarm at the rural unrest was reflected in recent calls by senior Chinese leaders, including President Mr Jiang Zemin and Vice Premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua, for immediate settlement of the green IOUs. The problem has prompted postal officials to 'reconsider' setting up a postal savings bank to take responsibility for cashing remittances, the China Daily said yesterday.</p>

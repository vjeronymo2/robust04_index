			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Markets: Bank shares - 'don't panic' - The Bottom Line Abbey National and Midland Bank have fired some warning shots at their competitors in retail banking over the last couple of weeks, and shares in UK banks have been looking slightly wounded. Despite the advancing gunfire, however, the message for investors seems to be 'don't panic'. It is hard to find an analyst who does not think the market has been 'oversensitive'. Bank shares first fell sharply at the end of last month after Abbey, the former building society turned bank, said that it was reducing the annual percentage rate (APR) on overdrafts from 18.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent. Another front was opened by Midland last Tuesday, when it launched a campaign aimed explicitly at overcoming the inertia in the personal financial market and attracting customers from other banks. And on Wednesday, the government announced that building societies would be given new powers to enable them to compete more effectively. Fears that these are the first signs that banks will use - or will have to use - the capital they have started to accumulate to compete for business on price have caused the bank sector to underperform the FT All-share price index by more than 2 per cent since late June. Shares in National Westminster Bank fell from 456p on 29 June to 435p on Thursday. Over the same time, TSB shares fell 12p to 198p, Barclays shares fell 6p to 529p, and Lloyds Bank shares lost 1p to 538p. Even the aggressors have not remained unscathed: HSBC Holdings, which owns Midland, fell from 702p to 692p while Abbey dropped from 406p to 393p. But fears of an all-out price war seem exaggerated, as the moves by Abbey and Midland may in practice amount to no more than marketing skirmishes. Abbey has made little secret that the cut in overdraft rate is directed towards increasing its 1.4m of the estimated 33m personal current accounts, and some analysts doubt that the 10 per cent overdraft will remain a lasting feature of retail banking once some advance has been made. The Midland initiative of a pledge of Pounds 10 for every error it makes in the course of setting up a new account is perhaps even an encouraging sign for the banks in terms of the direction competition may take. As Peter Toeman, banking analyst at Hoare Govett, put it: 'Competition on service quality is much more lenient than competition on price'. He points out that the barriers to moving current accounts remain quite high, and that the number of those who change accounts in any one year could double to 1m and still represent only 3 per cent of the customer base. Competition on price is unlikely to be structural and more likely to take the form of temporary, special offers - perhaps on personal loan rates or credit cards. Even if banks did feel obliged to cut margins on core services to personal customers, they are aware of ways of cushioning the blow. During 1989, for example, when Abbey National and Nationwide building society forced the sector towards giving interest on current accounts, the banks responded by introducing a new product into which existing customers could transfer. This not only spread the cost over time but meant they also obtained more information about their customers. Despite Midland, the continuing reluctance of personal customers to change banks makes competition weak, leading analysts to believe that banks will be able to avoid substantial cuts in their wide margins on most retail business. Instead, they believe that retail margins can afford to fall slightly without damaging the banks' business, because they will be reflecting realistically the lower costs of lending in a less risky environment. As Hugh Pye, banking analyst at BZW, put it: 'Margins are incredibly fat, and likely to remain so.' Good news for those who invest in banks - less good news for them in their capacity as customers.</p>

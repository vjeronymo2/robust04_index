			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER GAY PRIDE EVENT, IRVINE ORDINANCE  </P> <P> Last summer, at the request of the homosexual community and against the wishes  of hundreds of Irvine residents, who packed the Irvine City Council chambers,  the Irvine City Council adopted a "human rights" ordinance that would include  protection for one's "sexual orientation."  </P> <P> The ordinance, defines "sexual orientation" as "heterosexuality, homosexuality,  or bisexuality."  </P> <P> I personally feel this ordinance currently condones the acts of  heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality. It is not the role of  government to condone any sexual practice. One's sexual activities should be  kept private and not be made a political football for any reason.  </P> <P> Discussions surrounding this ordinance have missed the point. The Irvine City  Council and homosexual community tell us that if the term sexual orientation is  deleted from the ordinance, then it will be legal to discriminate against  homosexuals. Nothing could be further from the truth.  </P> <P> The City Council and homosexual community state that the deletion of the term  "sexual orientation" would prevent homosexuals from living and working in  Irvine and would legalize discrimination against homosexuals. By the city's own  definition, this argument is absurd. To use its logic, the deletion of the  words "sexual orientation" would also legalize discrimination against  heterosexuals and prevent heterosexuals from living or working in Irvine as  well.  </P> <P> Obviously, the argument of the City Council and the homosexual community is  filled with error. So their recourse has been to resort to scare tactics, name  calling, and distortions in an effort to hide the truth.  </P> <P> BARRY HAMMOND  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

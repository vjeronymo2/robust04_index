			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia April 26 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and  Brazil are both interested in increasing the volume of mutual  trade and extending economic cooperation, Czech Premier Vaclav  Klaus and Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said yesterday.    The Czech Government is prepared to enter negotiations on  the  creation of a free trade zone either between the Czech Republic  and Brazil or between the countries of the Central European Free  Trade Agreement (CEFTA) on the one hand and the Mercosur  Association (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay) on the  other, Klaus said at a press conference after his meetings with  Amorim, Brazilian President Itamar Franco and other leading  figures.    Klaus spoke in favour of creating bilateral free trade zones  when in Argentina and Chile on an earlier stage of his ten-day  tour of South American countries.    Amorim told CTK on Monday [25 April] a free trade zone  should  not be limited to the two states but rather include all Mercosur  and CEFTA countries. He said he felt prospects for greater  mutual trade were very good because the economies of Brazil and  the Czech Republic had undergone great changes, privatisation  and intensive liberalisation.    Amorim hailed the agreement on economic cooperation and the  mutual granting of most-favoured nation status which he signed  with Klaus on Monday as the first step towards closer trading  relations. But he also urged the two sides set up a joint  commission, on the basis of an inter-governmental agreement, to  ensure the political framework for bilateral business.    Klaus said the drop in trade with Brazil over the last three  years was only a temporary phenomenon and refused to draw any  conclusions from it. He said the market was opening up and the  volume of trade could be expected to increase.    In foreign affairs Klaus said the two countries had many  views in common, which allowed them to work together within the  framework of the United Nations and elsewhere. Amorim said the  UN Security Council should be enlarged if it were to remain  legitimate in the new world. Developing countries should also  be represented on it, he said.    On Monday evening Klaus left for Sao Paulo where he is to  meet the Sao Paulo state governor and meet university students  before returning to Prague.</p>

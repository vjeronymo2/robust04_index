			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Watchdog considers big auditing shake-up The Auditing Practices Board is considering proposals that would radically alter the relationship between auditors and their corporate clients. Board members are discussing a recommendation for the introduction of a panel of shareholders or an audit commission that would wrest control of the remuneration and appointment of auditors from executive management. The change would be an attempt to respond to the prevailing suspicion that a 'cosy' relationship exists between auditors and the boards of directors of the companies they serve. The law states that the auditors are responsible to shareholders of the com-pany for ensuring that the accounts show a 'true and fair view'. However, auditors spend most time in discussion with the board, which hires and fires - and sets their remuneration - leading to a belief by some critics that their opinion will also be subject to influence by the board. There has been growing public attention to the issue of improving the quality of auditing and restoring the credibility of accountants after a series of high-profile corporate collapses since the late 1980s. The Auditing Practices Board, which is controlled by the accountancy profession, does not have the power to implement the proposals. However, its membership of leading City figures is highly influential and could lead to a substantial movement for reform. The recommendations echo more tentative calls for reform along similar lines in the report published in November 1992 on the development of auditing, chaired by Mr John Macfarlane, now a director of Standard Chartered, the banking group. A working party to develop the ideas has been meeting, and includes Mr Macfarlane; Mr Ian Percy, chairman of the Scottish Accounts Commission; Mr Ian Plaistowe, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board; and Mr David Hatherly, head of the accounting department at the University of Edinburgh. Mr Percy helped to write a report by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland last year which also called into question the relationship between auditors and executive management. In spite of lengthy discussions, the working party has not yet reached a final decision on its recommendations, which are expected to be published in October this year. It is also exploring boosting the role of audit committees in the short term and the introduction of a German-style supervisory board to strengthen the hand of a company's non-executive directors in relation to the audit.</p>

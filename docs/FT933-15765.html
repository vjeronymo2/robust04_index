			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Howden to spend Pounds 15m to diversify fan side HOWDEN GROUP will spend Pounds 15m on restructuring the fan manufacturers which it has bought in an attempt to diversify out of large-scale contracting work. A total of Pounds 40m has recently been spent in acquiring Novenco, a Danish maker of industrial fans, and Buffalo Forge, a US fan and air-handling business. About 400 jobs will be shed in the US, and 250 from the enlarged group's European fan division. These substantial balance sheet provisions were revealed yesterday when the group reported an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 18.5m over the year ended May 3 1993. Sales rose from Pounds 292.3m to Pounds 335m. Profits were reduced by an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.46m after the final settlement of a dispute over tunnelling machines which the group supplied to Denmark. This ended a bitter wrangle which caused Howden heavy losses and a crash in its share price in 1990. Mr John Jackson, chairman, said Howden's prime objective was to complete the successful integration of the past year's acquisitions, particularly in North America. Order intake totalled Pounds 266m (Pounds 278m) which was 'satisfactory' in current circumstances. During the year management had responded to a more competitive environment by cutting costs, and the overall workforce fell by 10 per cent to about 4,500, excluding the Buffalo acquisition. Mr Johnny Johnsen, chief executive, said he hoped to move away from Howden's traditional contract business of supplying specialised fans for power stations, which came through erratically. Instead, he wanted to focus on smaller industrial fans, which yielded higher profit margins. He said business was flat in the UK and Europe, but recovery was firmly established in the US. He saw the greatest new opportunities in south-east Asia and the group was in talks about setting up a joint venture in China. Earnings per share came to 6p (5.5p). A final dividend of 1.45p on increased capital gives a total for the year of 2.2p (2p). COMMENT Having finally got out of the hole represented by the Danish tunnelling contract, Howden still has its work cut out. The group issued 62m shares in the last year to fund acquisitions, and analysts estimate that pre-tax profits will have to increase from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 24m just to avoid dilution of earnings. Focusing on smaller fans seems plausible, but the group makes no bones that the trading outlook is tough - particularly in Europe and the UK. Institutional investors have supported the cash calls and the shares have risen from 33p in October to close unchanged at 78p yesterday. They are unlikely to advance further until the success of the new strategy becomes clearer.</p>

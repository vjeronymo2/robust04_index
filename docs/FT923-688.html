			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pirelli reports profits turnround PIRELLI, the Italian cables and tyres group, has returned to profit with net earnings of L77bn (Dollars 61.5m) for the first half of 1992 after a loss of L105bn in the same period in 1991. However, the figures are not directly comparable with those for 1991 owing to the change to historic from current cost accounting and the consolidation of the accounts of some subsidiares on an equity rather than global basis. Pirelli warned that 'the significant deterioration' in market conditions would make it difficult to maintain the current earnings trend. While net profits this year would 'foreseeably' be positive, the improvement would essentially be due to extraordinary gains. The upturn this year stems from both tyres and cables, confirming the current recovery in the tyre industry after cut-throat competition in the past. Pirelli's resources were further depleted by its abortive bid for Continental, its slightly bigger German rival, which collapsed last year. The profits turnround was due to heavy restructuring, with an 8.4 per cent drop in staff to 61,465, cost cutting, improved productivity and lower capital spending. Earnings were also boosted by substantial, but undisclosed, capital gains on divestments. Pirelli said its tyre and cable operations were close to break even at the net level, implying that extraordinary items comprised all its interim net profits. So far, three of the seven units of Pirelli's diversified products division, which were put up for sale in 1991 to strengthen its balance sheet, have been sold. Pirelli warned of a 'difficult' second half for both cables and tyres, with the boost from a devalued lira being countered by higher interest rates. But it did not expect this month's currency movements to have 'major effects' on its results. Sales, adjusted for disposals, rose by 2.9 per cent to L4,252bn, with a particularly strong increase in tyres. Operating profits surged to L179bn from L170bn, in spite of a 30 per cent rise in depreciation to L276bn under a revised policy for write-downs.</p>

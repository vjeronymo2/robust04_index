			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 1.38m loss for Hawtal Whiting HAWTAL WHITING, which provides design and engineering services to the motor industry, ran up a loss of Pounds 1.38m in the first half of 1992, but expects the current period to improve. Benefits of reorganisation were coming through and should be fully reflected in the second half, said Mr John Whitecross, chairman. He felt the group performed creditably with turnover down only 9 per cent to Pounds 27.3m. The loss compared with a profit of Pounds 178,000. However, losses per share soared from 0.7p to 22.9p as UK losses could not be offset against North American profits.</p>

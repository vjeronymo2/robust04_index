			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: New Torke double-act - Concert Commissioned by the London Sinfonietta with South Bank Centre funds, Michael Torke's Monday and Tuesday had its premiere on Tuesday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. In fact it is two pieces, but built upon a single ground-plan. The title is meant to invoke the mundane similarity of one day to the next, with their local differences. Both pieces are in D, more or less, and more or less in motorised 4/4 time (with many sideslips), and the material is put through the same patterns of rotation and fragmenting. But the basic chordal stuff of the music is slightly different - 'Tuesday' is distinctly more chromatic, which lends it darker shadows and extra sonorous depths; so the matched pair strikes intriguing sparks. The usual Torke fingerprints are all there, but in particularly high relief. The incessant, frenetic syncopations are more ingenious than ever, the arching tunes which grow upon the chord-sequences more evasively appealing. The pressure is regularly lightened by little carolling duets and such for the winds. An incisive piano (Torke's own instrument) serves as monitor; vibraphones at either side of the platform mostly lend support and emphasis, like the under-favoured string quintet. For some people it will be thoroughly rebarbative, but I found Monday and Tuesday exhilarating, clever and funny, like all the best Torke. Lothar Zagrosek conducted it with the same attentive precision he bestowed on every work in a superlative Sinfonietta programme, disparate though they were. Lutoslawski's Chain 1, written for the band, sounded tauter than ever, and still wittier; Ferneyhough's Carceri d'Invenzione I rather more opaque and surly. In Hans Abrahamsen's Marchenbilder, six linked 'fairy-tale pictures', Zagrosek exposed some powerful dramatic shudders that have not been so plain before. Birtwistle's Silbury Air is rock-like, unbudgeable, and remains forbiddingly impressive. Among the band's inspired roster of commissioned pieces, these are treasures.</p>

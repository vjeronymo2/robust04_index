			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Around the world A pair of globetrotters are taking a holiday with a difference by visiting all 188 countries in the world in just 80 days. Stuart Cheese and David New will be taking 170 flights and travelling 80,000 miles by land, sea and air in the record bid which they hope will raise Pounds 250,000 for the United Nations Children's Fund. The existing record for visiting every country on the globe was set by two American missionaries but it took them 41 years - from 1934 to 1975 - to complete the task.</p>

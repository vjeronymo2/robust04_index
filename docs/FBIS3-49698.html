			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 13 (CTK) -- Jaromir Stetina, former  editor-in-chief of the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY,  expressed concern about the future independence of the paper  today. Stetina, who resigned on Wednesday [12 January], told  CTK that he believed that most of the staff shared his fear,  being shocked by the latest developments in the paper. "I never  knew that it was so easy to violate documents in force," he said.    LIDOVE NOVINY was founded in 1893 as a liberal daily. Banned  by the communist regime after it seized power, it started  reappearing in 1988 as a dissident publication.    Last November the Swiss press company Ringier purchased a  majority stake in the paper, whose circulation is around 100,000  copies.    Stetina justified his resignation by the fact that the new  internal rules and procedures, accepted by the Board of  Directors of the LIDOVE NOVINY joint stock company recently,  violates two essential documents -- the Editorial Statute and  the agreement on the editor-in-chief -- which guarantee the  independence of the paper.    "The internal rules and procedures circumvent the editor's  right to appoint leading workers of the staff.... As long as  they are in force it will be quite easy to replace one-third of  the leading workers who give their judgment on a new  editor-in-chief," Stetina said.    The Board of Directors said on Wednesday that it "did not  see  any discrepancy between the internal rules and the status of the  staff."</p>

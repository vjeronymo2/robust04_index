			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOTTEST JOB': SALARIES COST CITY, COUNTY TOO MUCH  </P> <P> I would like to comment on your firefighter article ("L.A.'s Hottest Job," July  27). The firefighters have never gotten the publicity that the police do in a  job that is probably more dangerous. The Los Angeles County firefighters in  particular set a standard in bravery, professionalism and quality of service  that is the envy of every agency in the world.  </P> <P> But the compensation for those outstanding men is unconscionable in a world of  limited resources. Entry-level salaries of $35,000, journeyman at $45,000, and  supervisor at $60,000 for a job that takes about one year of post-secondary  education and training is just the start. Benefits of early retirement and  prime medical add another 80% to 100% to the total.  </P> <P> The work is very easy by any standard. One fire call a day is a hard day. Most  days are spent polishing fixtures, reading the paper and sleeping, so they can  do some real work on their second job. If a firefighter does paramedic and  actually has to respond to calls, he gets about a 15% bonus. Early retirement  and second jobs make firefighters the quintessential double-dippers. With these  wages, benefits and duties, it is no wonder why hundreds of applicants appear  for every job opening.  </P> <P> The fault does not lie with these outstanding men. It lies squarely with the  members of the Board of Supervisors, who are afraid of opposing the police and  fire associations. Los Angeles County and the city have always paid higher than  any other agencies and dragged the rest of the market behind them.  </P> <P> And what is the financial status of this lavish spender? Los Angeles County  cannot pay for hospitals to provide care for AIDS victims, cannot provide  welfare service, has no jail space, sanitation disposal sites, etc.  </P> <P> In a world where government cannot seem to make rational economic and service  decisions -- we need only cite the current budget impasses in Washington and  Sacramento -- the county's policy to pay firefighters (and sheriffs)  top-of-the-market wages is the height of the irrational.  </P> <P> BILL HENRY YEOMANS  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

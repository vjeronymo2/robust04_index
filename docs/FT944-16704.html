			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Threat to tear apart big beast: NTT of Japan will resist plans to break it up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the part-privatised Japanese telecommunications operator and the world's most valuable company, is preparing to fight off the third attempt in 10 years to break it up. Today, UK investors will be invited to buy shares in the company - capitalised at Y13,603bn (Pounds 85bn) - when it makes its debut on the London Stock Exchange. Last month, NTT was listed in New York. Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT's tough-talking president, hopes that success in attracting foreign investors will help fend off a break-up of the company by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications when its status comes up for review next spring, five years after the last such exercise. The company wants to boost its poor international image and raise the proportion of shares in foreign hands above 1.5 per cent, a fraction of the average for leading listed Japanese companies. At issue is how fast Japan will modernise its backward telecommunications industry, and provide companies and private subscribers with the advanced communications they need in the next decade. The ministry wants to divide the group into a long-distance unit and one or several local monopolies to increase competition and improve efficiency. The model is AT&amp;T in the US, which was split in 1984 into several companies that have become fiercely competitive in the home market and abroad. NTT's detractors say that the arguments for break-up look stronger today than in 1985, when the ministry first launched a campaign to dismember the group in the run-up to partial privatisation. Japanese telecommunications lag 10 years behind the US in the scope of services, according to Jardine Fleming Securities. Japan is, for example, well behind the US in installing digital technology in local networks, where NTT has a monopoly. Prices on long-distance calls have fallen less fast than in the US - despite competition from five private operators. The proportion of mobile phone users, where NTT has a 60 per cent share of the domestic market, is among the lowest in the developed world. Only recently has it been possible to buy a mobile phone - they had to be rented until last April. While there is competition on trunk calls, the company's competitors allege that it has charged them unfairly high rates for connecting long-distance calls through its own local networks. And they claim that profits from the local monopoly subsidise operations in the long-distance market. Mr Kojima denies that NTT is overcharging long-distance competitors, and points out that prices have fallen by an average of 12 per cent a year. The access charges paid by long-distance operators for using the local network are in line with those in the UK and US, he says. However, the competitors also allege that NTT uses its monopoly over the local network to get access to crucial business information and to delay or even thwart new services. Separating NTT's long-distance from its local business would weaken its monopoly power and force it to set lower access rates, they argue. NTT's case for staying together is not helped by its poor financial performance. Profits have fallen for the past four years. Today's share price of Y872,000 is well below the Y1.197m at which the first tranche of the company's shares was floated in 1986. Even at this level, the shares stand at almost 184 times this year's prospective earnings, a price/earnings ratio that is unlikely to be attractive to non-Japanese investors. Over the next few months, Mr Kojima will try to persuade the ministry mandarins that NTT has been reborn under his guidance. The company has cut labour costs and focused on fast-growing services, such as recently deregulated mobile phones. 'We used to be like an elephant. Now we are a lean, strong tiger,' he says. Securities analysts now predict a gentle profits revival next year and a strong recovery in 1996. However, the outlook for a longer-term profits recovery depends partly on persuading the ministry to agree a rise in local call rates on top of a rise in line-hire charges, likely to take effect early next year. NTT has lost money on this part of its business for 15 of the 17 years since the cost of a local call was frozen by the ministry at Y10 for three minutes - one of Japan's rare bargains. The company has asked for an 18 per cent increase in local call charges next year or in 1996. Mr Kojima is confident that the ministry will concede a rise, perhaps slightly below this level. The company's other main defence against dismemberment rests on the growing complexity of the tasks required of a national operator. Mr Kojima says 'the situation has changed dramatically' since the last time a break-up was aired in 1990. NTT's telephone services face growing competition from private mobile operators, at a time when the arrival of multimedia will push up research costs. With US regional telephone companies pursuing integration in response to these pressures, it would be eccentric for NTT to follow the opposite tack and split up, says Mr Kojima. Only a single group can invest the Y45,000bn needed to catch up with the US and give Japan a full multimedia network, offering services such as video on demand, home shopping and banking. In fending off NTT's detractors, Mr Kojima has lost the support of important allies, including customers, who have become more aware of the benefits greater competition has brought in other countries. The Keidanren, Japan's powerful business federation, has also embraced deregulation in its eagerness to drive down business costs at a time when the strength of the yen is damaging Japanese competitiveness. NTT's position as Japan's largest buyer by far of electrical equipment, with an annual budget of Y1,900bn, used to assure it of business support, but the Keidanren is now said to support an NTT break-up. The trade unions, another old NTT ally, may be rethinking their loyalty. They helped block two previous break-up attempts, in defence of Japan's largest private sector employer and the system of lifetime employment NTT represented. That loyalty has been weakened by the company's decision last year to cut 10,000 jobs, 13 per cent of the workforce, as part of an attack on NTT's uncompetitive labour costs. One important ally remains reluctant to split NTT: the finance ministry, which wants to sell part of its 65.6 per cent holding of the company's shares. A plan to reduce its stake to 50 per cent in 1991 had to be delayed because of the poor performance of the shares. The ministry, which is more influential politically than its telecommunications colleagues, believes keeping the company intact will maximise the price on share sales. Whatever the outcome of the battle over the future of NTT, foreign investors are unlikely to be affected, say securities analysts. If the company were broken up into several local operators, a package of the new companies' shares would probably perform just the same as NTT over the years, says Mr Barry Dargan of SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank handling the listing. Mr Kojima hopes that more foreign interest in NTT might help change telecommunications ministry mandarins' uncharitable view. 'Not even the ministry can ignore public opinion,' he says. But Japan's new drive for deregulation means he faces a tough fight to justify NTT's existence in its present shape. It is evidence, for those who doubt Japan's new enthusiasm for deregulation, that even the biggest corporate beasts are being challenged.</p>

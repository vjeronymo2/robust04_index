			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Chancellor denies prejudicing defence in arms to Iraq trial Mr Kenneth Clarke told the Scott inquiry yesterday he was convinced he had served the national interest by attempting to restrict information on Britain's intelligence services from the Matrix Churchill trial about the export of arms to Iraq. The chancellor, pictured arriving at the inquiry, gave a robust performance. He insisted that his actions had not prejudiced the defence in the trial and refused to accept any personal blame.

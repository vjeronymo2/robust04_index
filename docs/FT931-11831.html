			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Lamont's big chance THE BUDGET that he is to present on March 16 is likely to be Mr Norman Lamont's last, or so many in the City and Westminster think. He must rise to the occasion. Otherwise, he risks going down in history as an unhappy cross between the prime minister's poodle and his scapegoat, having presided, insouciantly, over the deepest recession since the 1930s and the sharpest deterioration of the public finances to occur in peacetime. Mr Lamont has nothing to fear but fear itself. He should dare to be bold. The tasks the chancellor should set himself are to present a convincing prospect of recovery, a sustainable profile for the public finances and, if possible, an attractive vision of fiscal reform. So dreadful is the state of the economy and so dire the state of the public finances that this must seem almost impossible. But it is not, or at least not altogether. This is the first Budget of the new parliament; it is the first of two Budgets this year; and it is also the first post-ERM Budget. All these give the chancellor important opportunities. Assume the worst First, however, Mr Lamont should assume the worst, not only on prospects for the economy, but also on those for the Budget and the balance of payments. There are three reasons for advising a bias towards gloom in the preparation of this Budget: first, the worst - dismally slow growth and fiscal deficits of well over 10 per cent of gross domestic product stretching into the distant future - could quite easily happen; second, if this were to be how things turn out, the government could find itself without politically tolerable means for tackling the ensuing disaster and no time within which to do so either; third, should things turn out better than feared, it would always be possible to make more politically popular adjustments later, as the next election approaches. What might advice to be bold, but also to assume the worst, mean in practice? The chancellor's starting point must be with the way in which monetary and fiscal policy became disastrously unbalanced within the ERM: a public sector debt repayment of 3 per cent of gross domestic product in 1988-89 will, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its Green Budget, turn into a public sector borrowing requirement (less privatisation receipts) of 9 1/2 per cent of GDP only five years later, while the ratio of net public debt to GDP will rise by 50 per cent between 1990 and 1994 alone. Meanwhile, the growth rate of broad money (M4) has fallen from an average of 16 per cent a year between 1985 and 1990 to a dismal 3.7 per cent in the year to December 1992. Gradual approach The government has begun to put things right. Monetary policy has been loosened, although real short-term rates of interest remain quite high. Base rate of interest may have to be pushed down still more before the vicious cycle of debt deflation is put into reverse. But if the chancellor is to dare loosen monetary policy further, he must offer a sustainable fiscal prospect. That he cannot now do. The only question is when Mr Lamont should act on the public finances. The answer, given the fragility of the economic position, on the one hand, and the rapid build-up of public debt, on the other, is sooner rather than later, but not at once. Mr Lamont should announce a large fiscal adjustment, including higher taxes on spending, in the March Budget, but the bulk of that adjustment should be postponed to the financial year 1994-95. Mr Lamont should also announce further fiscal adjustments that could be put into effect depending on circumstances at the time of this year's second Budget. The great advantages of this approach are that it would bring spending forward, hastening the faltering recovery; it would make the fiscal outlook tolerable, rendering lower rates of interest on long-term bonds more likely; and it would make still lower short-term interest rates appear part of an overall strategy, not just another sign of panic. On March 16 Mr Lamont should be daring. This may be his last chance to rescue both the economy and his own battered reputation. This is the first of a series of leaders on the March Budget.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close takes Footsie to peak A LITTLE unwillingly at first, the UK stock market moved forward to a clear new closing peak yesterday, with buying pressure increasing at the end of the day when dealing is effectively for next week. The market had already begun to joust with its previous closing high when Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, rose to deliver his keenly-awaited speech to the UK Conservative party conference. Equities were encouraged by strong gains in government bonds and also by a renewed advance in German stock markets. The FT-SE Index closed at the day's best, with the final reading of 3,108.6 showing a rise of 16.2. Turnover was unimpressive, however, and price gains often reflected a squeeze on marketmakers' trading positions when the December futures contract moved higher. This week has brought a gain of 69.3 points, or about 2.3 per cent, on the Footsie Index, and the marketmakers have been running out of stock to meet their commitments. However, the equity account has another week to run. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also found support, gaining 6.8 to 3,477.3; this wider-ranging market measuring rod remains around 1 per cent below its all-time high. Non-Footsie stocks made up about 57 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total of 477.4m shares, down sharply from 572.1m on the previous day. Thursday's retail business, worth Pounds 1.31bn, remained comfortably inside the market's range of profitability. Optimism on base rate prospects have been strengthened this week by comments from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who stressed commitment to strengthening the economic recovery. Yesterday's sharp fall in yields in long-dated government bonds provided fresh encouragement for equities which have been led by the bond market rally over the past two months. Long dated gilts rose by around  5/8 , implying confidence ahead of next week's list of economic statistics on retail prices, industrial output, unemployment and wages. Near-dated gilts edged slightly higher. London gilts followed a strong performance from US bonds. Pharmaceutical stocks gave a good lead to the blue chip sector but oil stocks looked less certain. There were gains in the banking sector, which has been identified as perhaps the chief beneficiary from base rate reductions, while the consumer sectors advanced.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: BPB The departure of Mr John Maxwell after only nine months as chief executive of BPB provokes explanations both mundane and Machiavellian. On the one hand the bromide issued by the company to explain his removal seems both a little thin and self-serving. BPB had six months to evaluate Mr Maxwell's performance before promoting him, so any concerns might have been expected to come to light earlier. If there were worries about his performance, then he was given precious little time to rectify them in a period of comparative calm in the plasterboard market. The temptation is thus to look deeper for potential policy disagreements. While there is much to be said for concentrating on areas of expertise, BPB's heavy dependence on a single product with such a violent cycle is something few managers would freely choose. If Mr Maxwell wanted to diversify he might well have met resistance, since the company has failed here before. Perhaps the appointment of his successor will offer clues to the course of such internal debates.</p>

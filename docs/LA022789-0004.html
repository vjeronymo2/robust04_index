			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and Congress were criticized for failing to fill top  government health jobs. "Almost four months after the elections, we are still  wondering who will be named to the post of presidential science adviser," Dr.  James H. Sammons, AMA executive vice president, told the American Medical  Assn.'s National Leadership Conference in Chicago, "and we don't have an  assistant secretary of defense for health at the Pentagon." Vacancies delay  progress on health programs and put the executive branch at a disadvantage in  dealing with Congress on legislation, said Dr. James C. Todd, AMA deputy vice  president.  </P></p>

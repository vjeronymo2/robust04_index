			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Public sector rises 'mean real pay cut' Pay rises of between 2 per cent and 3.25 per cent, which are expected to be recommended today for more than 1.5m public sector workers, represent a cut in real disposable income, according to a report published yesterday. The Institute of Fiscal Studies analysis says that a worker on slightly below average earnings will need a pay rise of about 5 per cent to maintain spending power once inflation and tax rises are taken into account. The cabinet is expected this morning to endorse the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies covering nurses, teachers, doctors, the armed forces and top public officials. Rises of more than 3 per cent may be phased in. The increases, however, are still higher than the government would have liked - it has imposed a three-year freeze on the public sector pay bill. It said the increases may have to be paid for in productivity improvements, which could involve job losses and cuts in services. Separately, Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, used a parliamentary written answer to emphasise that the government expected pay rises in all public sector pay groups in 1994-95 to be funded by efficiency improvements. The IFS analysis, undertaken for pay analysts Industrial Relations Services, shows that a worker on Pounds 12,750 a year will pay an extra 2.83 per cent of income in tax by April 1995 as a result of last November's budget. With an inflation forecast of at least 2 per cent next year, that means a pay rise of 5 per cent would be required to maintain current disposable income. For a lower paid worker, such as a nurse paid Pounds 8,250 a year, the tax take will be 2.38 per cent. IRS said that a higher inflation rate next year and the effect of the tax changes would increase pay expectations in the private sector, and could account for the government's acceptance of pay review body recommendations. Union officials have expressed their fear that the pay bill freeze and this year's pay recommendations will result in a change in the review bodies' remit. The IRS said that although private sector pay rises have averaged 2 per cent in the past five months, several companies in the finance sector have awarded rises substantially higher. Sun Life of Canada has made merit awards averaging 6 per cent to clerical and administrative staff, while American Express has allocated 4 per cent of its pay rise total to merit reviews.</p>

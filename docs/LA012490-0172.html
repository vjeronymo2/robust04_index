			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR LYNN LORING, REAL-LIFE DRAMA BEHIND THE SCENES;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE OUTSPOKEN FORMER ACTRESS, WHO IS THE INDUSTRY'S HIGHEST-RANKING  FEMALE EXECUTIVE, IS TRYING TO BALANCE HER CAREER SUCCESS AGAINST ITS TOLL ON  HER PERSONAL LIFE.  </P> <P> It was the end of the TV season, and Lynn Loring didn't want to be a studio  executive any longer.  </P> <P> Loring, the child actress who grew up to be president of MGM/UA Television  Productions, was not having a good day. Six months into a three-year contract  to fill one of Hollywood's most powerful positions, Loring was announcing her  retirement.  </P> <P> "This will probably be my last three years," Loring said emphatically during a  conversation last July. "I'm coming to a time in my life when I'm not finding  it to be the fun I thought it would be.  </P> <P> "This is not a golden age for television," Loring continued, staring pensively  into the nearly deserted breakfast room of the Four Seasons Hotel with eyes as  round and wide as those of her childhood publicity stills, cigarette smoke  framing her face along with her curly russet hair. "The show has gone out of  it, and we're left with the business.  </P> <P> "I never wanted to grow up to be president of a studio."  </P> <P> But that was July -- following a TV season that was about as much fun as a car  wreck for Hollywood's producers. Besides the devastation of the writers strike,  the 1988-89season resulted in two casualties for MGM/UA: Its NBC series "Baby  Boom" died quickly and "Dream Street," a youth-oriented, blue-collar drama from  "thirtysomething" executive producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick, lasted  only a few episodes.  </P> <P> By the time the new season began in September, however, Loring had decided that  being president of a major TV studio just might be a decent way to make a  living after all.  </P> <P> MGM/UA's "thirtysomething," which had walked away with the Emmy Award for  outstanding drama in its first season, had just netted 17 Emmy nominations (it  went on to win two major Emmys), and Loring had high hopes for the studio's new  ABC drama, "The Young Riders," a sort of new-age Western about the teen-age  riders of the Pony Express. The studio had also just inked a development  agreement with Dan Curtis, producer and director of the ABC miniseries "The  Winds of War" and its mammoth sequel, "War and Remembrance."  </P> <P> And Loring -- who had vowed to renounce her studio presidency to become an  independent producer, or a lawyer, or the president of a network, or an author,  or a ski bum -- now declared herself back in the game.  </P> <P> "What happens is, at the beginning of the year, you don't examine yourself,"  she said. "At the beginning of the season, when everybody is up and has all  these ideas, it's like having Mounds Bars and Almond Joy and Eskimo Pies --  this feast of sugar. By the end of that season, the sugar is starting to wear  off, and you have the sugar lows."  </P> <P> Now at mid-season, MGM/UA has no new crises to deal with, since its shows --  "thirtysomething," "In the Heat of the Night" and "Young Riders" -- have all  been picked up for the remainder of the season. There is little time to enjoy  the success, however: Pilots for new shows are being developed.  </P> <P> "In terms of the Top 10 shows, nothing new is really (a hit)," Loring said.  "It's a tough year." "I guess the basic question none of us can answer is: Why  do we do this?"  </P> <P> Loring has become the most highly placed woman executive currently at a  Hollywood television studio without ever really figuring that out.  </P> <P> Second in command to MGM/UA Television Productions Chairman and CEO David  Gerber, Loring does not carry the same clout in the TV business as former  Columbia Pictures' president Dawn Steel did in the feature-film industry, and  Barbara Corday outranked Loring when Corday served as president and chief  executive officer of Columbia Pictures Television in the mid-'80s.  </P> <P> Still, at least in terms of title, Loring's at the top among female TV  executives at the studios -- and, although Gerber's the boss, Loring and Gerber  make most decisions as a team.  </P> <P> "I don't look at it as something I've accomplished for all womanhood," she  said. "But in my position, I have an obligation to stand up and be counted. I'm  not looking to be a spokesperson for women, but I find what I say matters, and  that excites me."  </P> <P> They say life imitates art; in the case of a studio executive, life apparently  imitates TV. Loring readily acknowledges that her decision to get off the  executive roller coaster -- and to get back on again -- is part of an annual  ritual that mirrors the ups and downs of each TV season.  </P> <P> In one way or another, television has dedicated the pattern for most of  Loring's life.  </P> <P> At age 6, she landed a guest appearance in CBS' anthology series "Studio One,"  which ran from 1948-58. At 7, she became a spokeschild for RCA Victor; her TV  commercials won her the moniker "The Junior Set's Betty Furness." From 6 to 16,  she played Patty on "Search for Tomorrow."  </P> <P> After years of guest appearances on shows including "Playhouse 90," "Hallmark  Hall of Fame" and "The Defenders," and study at New York City's Barnard  College, Loring married actor Roy Thinnes in 1968. They divorced in 1984;  Loring married attorney Michael Bergman in 1988.  </P> <P> And, aside from occasional guest roles, Loring played housewife and mother  until 1979 -- when Thinnes, disturbed that his wife seemed to be descending  into a routine of soap-opera watching and apathy, encouraged her to go back to  work. Producer Curtis, for whom Loring had worked as a child, invited her to  became casting director for his NBC movie "Raid on Coffeyville" and that  network's "Supertrain," the 1979 anthology series described in one TV  dictionary as "one of the most expensive failures in the history of network  television."  </P> <P> After "Supertrain," Loring joined Aaron Spelling Productions, a partnership  that grew out of a friendship with Spelling developed during her days as an  actress. During a week when "I was really depressed and thinking about what my  life was going to be," Loring called Spelling and asked him to help her launch  a TV movie based on the book "The Best Little Girl in the World," about an  anorexic teen-ager.  </P> <P> Spelling liked the idea, and took it to ABC. They liked it too. Before making  Loring producer of the movie, however, he insisted she get her feet wet by  producing a two-hour movie called "Return of the Mod Squad" (husband Thinnes  played a role in the movie). After that, Spelling asked Loring to stay with the  company as vice president of development and talent, motion pictures and  television; she later created a feature-film division for the company, which  produced the hit "Mr. Mom."  </P> <P> Hence Loring's tendency to respond to TV's annual schedule as the tide responds  to the sun. "By the end of May through the beginning of July, I'm going to be  right back into 'I hate this. I never want to do this again,' " Loring said. To  put it mildly, Loring tends to be blunt about all of the frustrations of the TV  business -- including her conflicts with others with whom she has worked. Where  the public statements of some studio executives remain as sterile as a press  release, Loring ruffles feathers. Big feathers.  </P> <P> Take Spelling's feathers, for example.  </P> <P> Although quick to credit Spelling for teaching her the TV basics ("I got my  B.A. from Spelling, and my master's degree from Gerber."), Loring is equally  quick to bite back when attacked by her former mentor.  </P> <P> Spelling was recently quoted as criticizing MGM/UA's "thirtysomething" as  "whiny" (hardly the first time anyone has offered that opinion). Loring was  quoted as saying that Spelling had abused his immense power by turning out  titillating trash like NBC's short-lived "Nightingales" instead of quality  programs. "Speaking as a woman, not as an executive, I find that show  offensive," she said.  </P> <P> Loring winced when reminded of those comments -- although she said she would  have made them to Spelling's face. "That's what I meant about my being too  honest," she said. "The person who was angriest was Gerber. He said: 'Why was  it important for you to go on the record that way? . . . You are the most  self-destructive person on the planet!' "  </P> <P> Though Aaron Spelling Productions has recently optioned the first screenplay  written by Loring's 21-year-old son, Christopher Thinnes, a UCLA student who  also works for "Young Riders" producer Jonas McCord's Paragon Productions,  Loring is still critical of Spelling. She and Spelling parted in 1984 because,  she said, she no longer wanted to produce featherweight projects such as the  series "Glitter," "Sizzle" and "Portrait of a Male Model."  </P> <P> "I decided, what does it mean that I'm taking his paycheck, when I'm producing  projects that I don't have a passion for?" Loring said. "That's selling out. I  wouldn't sell myself out to get a show on the air, I just wouldn't."  </P> <P> Loring says now that she no longer blames Spelling for all of his choices,  since many of them were handed down by the networks. "They kept coming to him  for more and more 'Aaron Spelling' kind of shows, and it was very easy for him  to keep doing it. In all fairness to him, he kept trying to push for more  uplifting television." Through his publicist, Spelling declined to respond to  Loring's comments.  </P> <P> Loring also had a few complaints about "Baby Boom" star Kate Jackson. Bad  publicity about Jackson's temperamental behavior dogged that production from  the beginning. "She should have lost her SAG card," Loring said indignantly.  "It was the most unprofessional behavior I've ever seen."  </P> <P> Like Spelling, Jackson refused comment, but NBC Entertainment president Brandon  Tartikoff said: "I would say that at any given time, there is an actor or an  actress walking off some set somewhere. That's, like, standard -- when you hear  about it, your blood pressure doesn't even go up one decimal. I can't comment  on the day-to-day -- but from where I sit, I didn't find anything extraordinary  about her (Jackson's) behavior."  </P> <P> Gerber believes Loring is learning to temper her outspokenness. "I chide her  about it -- and she laughs, because I'm pretty outspoken myself," Gerber said.  "There is a thin line between being irate and outspoken, and being shrill or  blatant. I think, over the years, she has understood that. She did learn a lot  from Aaron, and I think she has good feelings about him."  </P> <P> Loring believes that most producers face the same pressures as Spelling in TV's  increasingly grim economic landscape. She shuddered when recalling that Lee  Iacocca recently referred to television shows as nothing more than "window  dressing" to sell products. "Is that what I've become, window dressing for  Chrysler?" she asked bleakly.  </P> <P> "If 'thirtysomething' were being launched today, I wonder if the network could  afford to take a chance on it?," Loring continued. "With the advertising dollar  getting softer and softer, and people clicking their clickers all the time,  would people even tune into that? It gets harder every year. And you can't make  a show if it's fiscally irresponsible for the company, even if the network  wants it."  </P> <P> Eventually, Loring expects to go into independent production. In the meantime,  a reflective Loring has begun trying to balance the pluses of her career  success against its toll on her personal life -- and is not sure she's come out  ahead. Her first marriage ended, she said, because of her career, and she  remains wracked with guilt over time lost with daughter Casey, now 13.  </P> <P> "In 1984, I was divorced and (left) my job with Aaron Spelling within 24  hours," she said. "It was a wonderful week -- a week I'll never forget and  never want to repeat. 'Mr. Mom' was in many ways what was going on in my  personal life. . . . In the movie, (Michael) Keaton and (Teri) Garr got back  together even though her career was going better. In real life, Roy and Lynn  split up because of what was going on with her career, and didn't live happily  ever after.  </P> <P> "If you ask, do I balance my life well? Absolutely not."  </P> <P> New husband Bergman, she said, is more tolerant of her personal -- and  financial -- independence. In sort of a paraphrase of Scarlett O'Hara, Loring  declared: "I'll never ask a man if I can buy six pairs of shoes again!  </P> <P> "What happened (with Thinnes) is that I changed the rules of the marriage well  into it, and it was a new package that neither of us had agreed to. I was very  fortunate to meet a man who knows this package. And this package is a woman  who's passionate about her work; unfortunately, that's a major priority of her  life.  </P> <P> "There was a time when being Mrs. Roy Thinnes was enough for me. Being in a new  marriage, being Mrs. Michael Bergman isn't enough for me. It's important for me  to be Lynn Loring."  </P></p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Franc falls closer to ERM floor: Bank intervenes to bolster French currency as Balladur says it will not leave EMS THE BANK of France yesterday intervened on foreign exchange markets to support the franc after the currency again came under heavy selling pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism. The intervention was the first by the French authorities in nearly five months, and came on a day of very strong selling of other European currencies by international investors who sought to buy D-Marks. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, tried to allay concern about the franc by affirming that his government was 'totally determined' to maintain the stability of the French currency within the European monetary system. The prime minister, who had on Thursday night denounced rumours that the franc would leave the EMS as 'farcical', said French authorities would use 'every available means' to support the franc given that monetary stability was critical to his administration's economic and social policies. But there was a strong impression in financial markets that the franc could face another round of speculation next week unless the Bundesbank cut its short-term interest rates, a move that would help France to ease monetary policy and stimulate its economy. Yesterday's intervention was said to be discreet, with the Bank of France buying only small quantities of francs. The operation failed to stop the franc falling below FFr3.40 to the D-Mark, little more than 3 centimes above its ERM floor of FFr3.433. The franc closed in London at FFr3.399, compared with FFr3.395 on Thursday, but slipped further in late trading in New York to FFr3.402. The fall in the franc came as French short-term interest rates rose sharply  - last night trading above German money market rates for the first time in nearly two months. In recent weeks, French leaders had expressed pleasure that their country's money market rates had fallen below German levels, because this implied dealers were more confident about investing in the French currency. Economists in Paris played down concern about the franc's prospects. Ms Dominique Graber, deputy chief economist at Paribas, said yesterday's pressure mainly reflected selling by foreign investors who were 'confused about the French government's economic policy' and about the role of the Bank of France once it becomes independent of the government. 'There are lots of rumours around. But it would be a slight exaggeration to compare the present situation with the heavy pressure on the franc last September and earlier this year.'

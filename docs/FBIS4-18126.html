			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dirk Hoeren report: "Stasi Wanted To Sell Gold Worth 2 </F> Billion"]    [Text] The mystery surrounding the secret pecuniary  sources of the leaders of the former German Democratic Republic  [GDR] seems to be resolved. In 1990, shortly after the collapse  of the communist system, Stasi members tried to sell gold worth  up to 2 billion German marks [DM]. Investigations are now under  way as to what happened to the money.    A secret note by the Federal Intelligence Service (BND)  revealed the following: The Stasi cover company Impag offered  the Swiss company Jenzen AG 50-100 tonnes of gold. At the time  the gold was deposited with "West European banks."    The Stasi submitted the following offer: "The delivery will  be carried out in the form of 12.5-kg bars." The market value  of the gold was DM1.05 billion to DM2.1 billion.    The Stasi offered a discount of 10 percent of the gold price  quoted at the stock exchange to obtain the money quickly.    Strangely enough, the secret document has disappeared in the  safes in Bonn. Investigations are not being carried out.</p>

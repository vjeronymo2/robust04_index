			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION: 'LONG LINE'  </P> <P> The editorial on abortion was excellent. I sincerely appreciate it. I have been  waiting and watching for a historical story.  </P> <P> There is so much time, energy and money wasted on fetuses and almost no concern  or compassion for newborns with AIDS or drug dependencies, or babies lacking  proper care.  </P> <P> There is much too much preaching instead of support for more facts, more  knowledge and more education.  </P> <P> MARGARET GARCIA  </P> <P> Homeland  </P></p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Masters of cut and thrust - The Four Marketeers THE ARCHITECT IT WAS a job well done, even if his part in it finished before he would have liked. 'Broadly speaking, it's been completed in time,' intones Lord Cockfield, the man who, as a European Commissioner, was responsible for shaping plans for the single market between 1984 and 1988. He would have loved to have stayed on in Brussels but was withdrawn four years ago when Margaret Thatcher decided he had 'gone native'. With the air of a stern Dickensian parson, the 76-year-old Cockfield says the 5 per cent of his single market recommendations not implemented are 'minor compared with the vast panorama of the programme'. But the now part-time accountancy adviser still betrays more than a whiff of acrimony towards the Tory government. 'It had very little understanding of what the single market meant,' he sniffs. 'It was thinking of areas like transport - it never thought it had to take fiscal matters into account as well.' He is predictably dismissive of the UK's efforts to bring the European central bank to London and is a believer in a single European currency but does not think it will be the Ecu. His money is on the D-Mark. HIS SUCCESSOR Italy, bottom of the EC league for transferring single market legislation into its national law, had been piqued into rapid action just ahead of the January 1 deadline. In an 11th-hour effort, the Italian parliament authorised a fast-track procedure for implementing 33 directives covering everything from the labelling of medicines to the trade in fresh meat. The move should spare the blushes of Italy's new commissioner, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, when he arrives in Brussels on Wednesday. For at least the next two years he will be responsible for making the internal market work. The appointment raised a few eyebrows within the Commission when it was announced a fortnight ago, given Italy's poor track record on implementation. GONE FISHING Come New Year's Eve, most of the Brussels architects of the single market appeared to have folded up their blueprints and disappeared instead of sticking around for the launch of their masterplan. The headquarters of the European Commission was almost deserted as officials, true to form, took the week between Christmas and New Year off. PRIVATE FUNCTION Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, was said to have celebrated privately somewhere in France. His spokesman said a public display of enthusiasm would have been inappropriate given the economic and political background. In any case, he added, Mr Delors had always made it clear that establishment of the single market would not be 'un big bang' but a gradual process. MIND GAMES Contacted on New Year's Eve, advisers to Mr Martin Bangemann, the internal market commissioner, were unable to say where he intended to celebrate the New Year. 'He keeps changing his mind,' said one. THOSE AGAINST One group unlikely to be celebrating arrival of the single market is the anti-federalist Campaign for an Independent Britain. Its Christmas card, in stark red and white, featured an accusatory Kitchener-like Santa Claus on the cover posing the question: 'Will 1992 be your LAST British Christmas before European Union?' 'Britain's future is in OUR hands this Christmas', it reads inside, urging recipients to help the campaign to oppose the Maastricht treaty.</p>

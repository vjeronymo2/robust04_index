			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Robert Charvin,  secretary general of the International Committee of Jurists for  Democracy and Human Rights in South Korea, on December 22, 1993,  issued a written statement exposing the United States and South  Korean authorities' anti-DPRK, anti-popular moves and  distributed it to UN nongovernmental and other international  organizations.    The statement charged that the United States was kicking up  a  nuclear racket on the pretext of North Korea's "nuclear threat"  with a view to justifying its acts of interference against Asia.    The Seoul "civilian government", it said, defined North  Korea  as "a danger" and has brought even the North-South dialogue to a  deadlock, still following the methods employed by the former  military dictatorial "regime", to continually intensify  crackdown on the South Korean people.    The statement noted that the South Korean authorities,  ignoring the righteous aspirations of South Korean students,  have been ruthlessly trampling upon even the elementary human  rights of the people and opened the rice market to jeopardize  the existence of peasants.    It referred to the South Korean authorities' failure to urge  Japan to pay compensations for the "comfort women for the Army".</p>

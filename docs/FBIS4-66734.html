			<p>CSO     [Text] Last year Iran's economy put problems behind it  while maintaining economic growth, and it had striking successes  making structural adjustments.    Foreign pressures on the domestic economic system, the  problems and difficulties created by American-led world  imperialism, which sometimes became severe, the effects of the  worldwide economic recession, especially in the economies of  Europe and Japan and changes in the international markets,  placed problems in the path of the nation's rapid economic  development, but with the help of God and through the  comprehensive and coordinated efforts of those working in the  Islamic Republic's divine government, few bad effects were  imposed on the nation's economy.    Of course, the effects from the reform of policies and  programs on the nation's economy must not be overlooked, for  these existed along with the problems beyond the nation's  borders. Yet striking successes were achieved in the growth of  the agricultural and industrial products, despite the fact that  the relative stagnation of economic activities, the lack of  clarity in the evaluation of investments in the nation's new  economic conditions, and the lack of clarity of some laws having  to do with investment, especially in the industrial free trade  zones, cast a shadow over Iran's economic situation.    Last year the Islamic Republic of Iran was not spared the  pressures of propaganda and baseless accusations from world  imperialism, and in some cases, fighting tooth and nail against  evil American-led imperialist propaganda required unceasing  effort.    America's constant activity aimed at isolating the Islamic  Republic of Iran and placing it in difficulties did not stop  even for a moment. At the meetings of the leaders of the seven  industrial nations in Geneva on 93 Tir 1372 [as published, 22  June-22 July 1993], America once again asked the other nations  present at the meeting, including Germany, France, Italy, Japan,  Canada, and England to reduce their economic ties to Iran as  much as possible and it accused Iran of supporting international  terrorism.    These baseless accusations received a positive answer only  through the extensive political efforts of those working in the  government to retain the independent positions of the Islamic  Republic of Iran's foreign policy. In reality, America was not  able to achieve its goals, chief of which was to put Iran under  economic pressure in order to dilute the principled and  righteous positions of the Government of the Islamic Republic of  Iran towards international issues.    The Islamic Republic of Iran is still considered the  greatest  power in the Persian Gulf area. It is a wealthy and independent  nation in political activity in the strategic region of the  Middle East, and the outlook for its reasonable economic growth  and development is still hopeful.    Iran's economy during the last year can be studied from  various perspectives.  <H5>  Gross Domestic Product </H5>   According to the preliminary estimates of the Plan and  Budget  Organization, the value of Iran's gross domestic product in the  year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] at fixed prices based in  the year 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] was 12,483 billion  rials [R], which compared to the R11,715 billion fixed figure  for the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] shows an  increase of 6.5 percent.    The growth in Iran's gross domestic product was 3 percent in  the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], 12.1 percent in the  year 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], 9.9 percent in the year  1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] and 6.2 percent in the year  1371.    Iran's average economic growth in the years 1368-1372  implementing the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan  reached 7.5 percent per year, which is close to the 8.1-percent  figure set in the plan.    Although at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan's  implementation most Western experts said that the economic  growth set in this plan would be impossible to achieve and that  the goals were opportunistic, today the achievement of this  growth is recognized by international experts as an undeniable  success for the Islamic Republic of Iran. The small difference  between the nation's real economic growth and the goal set in  the plan is due to the failure to achieve growth in the oil,  industry and construction sectors, especially in the years 1371  and 1368, even though the growth in the water, electrical power,  gas and transportation sectors was faster than expected under  the plan.  <H5>  Added Value of Economic Sectors </H5>   In view of the new conditions for continuation of the policy  of economic adjustment, in the year 1372 the unification of the  foreign exchange rate and the application of the floating  foreign exchange rate system, in view of the amount of currency  in circulation, and the insufficient activity in the banking  system in providing the needed means for the nation's economic  units, especially in the first half of the year 1372, were among  the factors in the slower growth of economic sectors.    According to statistics published by government sources, the  growth in added value in the agricultural sector in the year  1372 was 6.5 percent, it was 10.1 percent in the oil sector, 8.5  percent in industry and mines, 17.8 percent in water, electrical  power and natural gas, 4.8 percent in construction, 1.3 percent  in transportation and shipping, and 15.5 percent in  communications. The average growth in these sectors in the First  Five-Year Plan was 6.1, 9.5, 15, 9.1, 14.5, and 5 percent,  respectively. Growth in the communications sector under the plan  was not announced.    The experience of the First Five-Year Plan has caused  economic planners to pay more attention in writing the Second  Five-Year Plan to capital resources in the nation's economy,  international conditions, the oil market situation and  unpredictable changes, and they have set a more reasonable  economic growth target of 5.8 percent per year.    Most of the world's independent economic experts consider  Iran's economic success in recent years, despite increasing  foreign pressures on the country, to be a great success for  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government.    Of course, it is necessary to pay appropriate attention to  the reasons for the failure to achieve all the goals. Most of  those reasons originate abroad, and some of them are the result  of domestic economic policy and behavior.  <H5>  Government's Role in General Budget </H5>   Despite the fact that in the 1372 budget the expected and  approved deficit figure was zero, according to the latest  estimates from the Plan and Budget Organization the general  budget deficit in the year 1372 was R2,139 billion, an increase  compared to the 1371 budget deficit of R1,077 billion.    The government's total expenses in the year 1372 were  estimated at R21,823 billion, compared to revenues of R19,684  billion. To a great extent the general budget deficit in the  year 1372 was due to the failure to achieve oil revenues,  because the tax revenues were greater than expected in all the  years of the First Five-Year Plan. Even in the year 1371 the  government's tax revenues were 45.4 percent greater than the  figure projected in the Five-Year Plan.    Despite the economizing done by the government  organizations,  especially this year, and despite the economical payments and  allocations done by the Plan and Budget Organization, general  expenses increased. Some of this was due to changes in the  foreign exchange rate and heavier expenses that the floating  foreign exchange rate imposed on government applicants for  foreign exchange.    The failure to achieve projected oil revenues in the First  Five-Year Plan, mostly due to foreign factors and inappropriate  behavior by international agents in this industry, caused the  nation's economic officials and planners to act with greater  caution and to set next year's oil revenues at above $10 billion  in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, to reduce the  negative effects of economic changes in the world's energy  markets on the national economy, and this is considered one of  the positive points in the planning of the nation's economy.  <H5>  Imports and Exports </H5>   The rapid growth in trade in the first years of Iran's First  Five-Year Economic Development Plan led to the nation making  foreign exchange commitments. Thus, since the beginning of the  year 1372 [21 March 1993] the officials of the nation's economic  system took a more conservative position on imports to reduce  the trade imbalance and to be able to reduce the burden of  foreign exchange commitments.    Iran's imports in the year 1372 decreased sharply from the  year 1371, and according to estimates from unofficial sources it  reached $13 billion. The Plan and Budget Organization estimated  this figure at $16 billion.    In view of estimates from this organization that the value  of  oil exports in the year 1372 was $14.9 billion and that nonoil  exports were valued at $3.26 billion, in the year 1372 there  should be a trade surplus of about $2.16 billion for the year  1372. However, unofficial sources, who have estimated Iran's  nonoil exports at about $3.5 to $4 billion and sometimes more,  say that Iran should have a trade surplus of about $3.5 billion  in the year 1372. In view of the fact that Iran had a trade  deficit of more than $5 billion in the year 1371, this is  considered a great success for Iran.    Although the trade surplus was due to the increase in nonoil  exports and restrictions on imports, it was necessary to apply  the floating foreign exchange rate, which is to some extent  responsible for imports costing more and making exports more  profitable, and on the other hand reducing imports has suspended  or slowed implementation of some economic projects, and this has  made it difficult to make full use of economic capacities due to  the shortage of monetary resources to obtain the needed raw  materials in time.    It is clear, however, that economizing on imports, in view  of  the nation's limited foreign exchange resources, was a positive  and necessary step in the view of most economic experts.    Iran's foreign exchange commitments against usance purchases  have increased in recent years, and repayments on these  commitments have been deferred to the last year of the First  Five-Year Plan and the years of the Second Five-Year Plan. This  has made it necessary to economize on foreign exchange  expenditures.    Among Iran's other economic successes in the view of the  experts are the infrastructure and essential investments that  have been made in the First Five-Year Plan, which have created  conditions allowing for growth in domestic production and  reduced demand for imports to achieve society's essential needs.  For example, in recent years Iran was a major importer of steel,  cement and wheat.    In the year 1372, not only did steel and cement imports  stop,  but Iran began exporting steel to the world's markets with rapid  growth. Demand for wheat imports also decreased significantly  this year, and this was due to increased domestic production.    On the other hand, preparations for increased nonoil exports  were made under the First Five-Year Plan. The value of Iran's  nonoil exports this year is more than $3 billion. The estimate  by the Plan and Budget Organization shows a figure close to $3.2  billion, but insiders in trade affairs believe that including  the smuggling of goods outside the country and in view of the  continued low customs rates for export goods, the value of  Iran's nonoil exports this year is even greater than $4 billion.  This group believes that with the growth in the quality and  quantity of the nation's production, the development of  industrial exports, Iran's active involvements in marketing,  international expositions and markets, and better packaging, it  will be easy to more than double Iran's nonoil exports during  five years to $10 billion and to increase the role of nonoil  exports in meeting expenses to more than 50 percent. In the year  1372 this figure was about 25 percent, yet before implementation  of the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan that figure was  less than 10 percent.  <H5>  Foreign Exchange Market Fluctuations </H5>   Despite the implementation of the floating foreign exchange  rate system and the sale of dollars by the Central Bank of the  Islamic Republic of Iran and the banking system, since late in  the month of Farvardin 1372 [21 March-20 April 1993], there were  two successive periods of severe fluctuations in the foreign  exchange market, which ultimately led to the dollar increasing  in value against the rial. From Farvardin 1372 until prior to  the announcement of the sale of travel and commercial foreign  exchange at the floating rate by the banking system, the value  of the dollar increased to R1,850, yet at the same time the  floating foreign exchange rate was less than R1,500. In the  first phase the Central Bank raised the value of the dollar  against the rial to about R1,750.    In the first fluctuation of the foreign exchange market the  value of the dollar increased again against the rial, and on the  free market the price of a dollar reached R2,800 under the  pressure of the demand for and short supply of foreign exchange.  Among the main reasons for that were the activities of foreign  exchange speculators in fanning the flames of market change.  <H5>  Foreign Exchange Commitments </H5>   Iran's major problem in the year 1372 was the suspension of  the country's foreign exchange commitments. According to reports  from official sources, by the end of this year the nation's  total of unpaid foreign exchange commitments reached $12  billion. Under the effects of this problem, it was difficult for  Iran to open credit documents in the foreign banking system and  most of Iran's transactions were done in cash drafts, which  proceeded slowly.    The banking system's low sales of foreign exchange also  caused many who were seeking foreign exchange to turn to the  free market, and increased demand on this market. In view of the  short supply of dollars and the speculative activities of  brokers, this caused the rial to weaken against the dollar.    Iran's efforts to renegotiate the timetables for its foreign  exchange commitments late in the year 1372 bore fruit, and this  was considered one of the great successes of Iran's economic  policymakers. Successes were achieved with German creditors in  rescheduling 4.5 billion marks of Iran's foreign exchange  commitments, and with Japanese creditors in rescheduling about  $800 billion in suspended commitments to Japanese companies.  These successes paved the way for Iran to open credit documents  and to procure the foreign exchange needed normally through the  banking system. It is expected that in the near future this  process will proceed with sufficient smoothness and will show a  positive effect on the free foreign exchange market. For the  first time in recent years the Central Bank did not seek to  strengthen the value of the dollar and during the foreign  exchange rate fluctuations in the first part of the month of  Esfand this year [20 February-19 March] it did not lower the  value of the rial.  <H5>  Volume of Currency in Circulation </H5>   In view of this, the government's budget deficit helped with  the growth in currency in circulation in the country. The First  Five-Year Plan, which had the goal of achieving economic balance  by controlling the growth of currency in circulation by reducing  the government's budget deficit to zero, was in practice faced  with increased demand for cash.    The volume of currency in circulation in the year 1370  reached R28,628 billion, based on the estimate from the Plan and  Budget Organization. In the year 1371 this figure reached  R35,799 billion. It is likely that in the year 1372 this figure  will reach more than R40,000 billion or a maximum of R47,691.5  billion, an increase of 33.2 percent compared to the year 1371.  <H5>  Rate of Inflation Growth </H5>   This rapid growth has intensified inflationary pressures.  The  indicator of prices for consumer goods and services with a base  year of 1361 as 100, reached R421.9 in the year 1370 and in the  year 1371 it reached R513.2. In the year 1372 this figure is  expected to reach R667.3. Thus inflation in the year 1372 is  estimated at 30 percent, which is more than the 21.6 percent  registered for the year 1371.    Although the government is trying to guide currency in  circulation into productive channels and positive economic  activities by selling the shares of the producing units under  its control on the Tehran stock market or through auctions and  negotiations, providing various services with new tariffs,  increasing tax rates, especially in the customs sector, changing  the consumption model, encouraging investment in the producing  sectors and other things, there is still a hot market for  speculation in gold, foreign exchange and other profitable  materials in the trade and services sector and it is attracting  some of the currency in circulation.    By increasing the profit rates it pays on deposits,  especially fixed-term deposits and providing various financial  services, Iran's banking system is trying to guide the currency  in circulation in the private sector into the banking system.  However, the difference between the profit rate for bank  deposits and the enormous profits for speculative transactions  has kept this goal from being completely achieved. Despite this,  existing statistics testify to the increased volume of bank  deposits.    In the first half of the year 1372 the government took steps  through the banking system to control the flow of currency in  circulation. Although the implementation of the floating foreign  exchange rate system and increasing the foreign exchange rate  for that group of producing units that had used preferred  government and competitive foreign exchange rates before the  year 1371 increased the demand for currency in circulation to  procure the foreign exchange needed, in the first half of the  year the banking system adopted a more restricted policy for  granting credits, which serves to control the growth in the  government's currency in circulation. However, at the insistence  of economic agents, who were making less use of production  capacity because of the shortage of currency in circulation to  procure raw materials, the banking system changed this course,  and in the second half of the year 1372 more credits were  granted. This was followed by growth in currency in circulation,  and the inflationary pressures were pronounced.    Thus Iran's economy, through great effort, forbearance and  solving problems, during the year 1372 continued moving towards  a market and pricing system and the government made greater  efforts to expand private sector activities and to transfer to  the private sector some executive and practical  responsibilities, especially in the production sectors.  <H5>  Oil Market </H5>   More than 80 percent of Iran's foreign exchange revenues  come  from the export of oil, and the nation's economy is sensitive to  world oil market conditions. Last year the situation in the oil  market was the worst it has been in five years. The price of oil  decreased more than 25 percent and, like it or not, it affected  Iran's economy.    Although the nation's economy was not able to obtain the  projected revenues of $16.8 billion from oil sales in 1372 and  the weakness of the market caused oil revenues to drop below $14  billion, various factors influenced this situation, and despite  Iran's efforts in OPEC to overcome the malfunctioning situation  in the oil market, they made the market situation worse day  after day.    The rapid increase in the production of oil in the non-OPEC  nations, especially Norway and England in the North Sea; the  growth in oil sales by Russia to Western markets to obtain more  reliable foreign exchange revenues; the growth in oil production  in other non-OPEC nations; the continued economic stagnation in  Western Europe and Japan, which led to reduced demand for oil;  efforts and collusion by the big oil producers to keep oil  prices down on the world market, and other things all affected  the world oil market situation in the year 1372.    Despite this, Iran's efforts at the September 1993 OPEC  meeting of oil ministers in Geneva were especially important,  because if these efforts had not borne fruit and if the OPEC  members had not tried to control the marketing of oil, even  greater decreases in oil prices would have been inevitable. The  oil market, which was severely weakened and in disarray after  the summer of 1372, was offering more than 1 million barrels a  day [BPD] because of reduced demand and excess marketing, mostly  by the independent producers.    The efforts of the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran  to contact Fahd, the king of Saudi Arabia, to put the oil market  in order, was among the effective steps bringing OPEC members to  an agreement to keep production down to 24.58 million BPD in the  first half of the year 1993 and the first three months of the  year 1994, and it prevented a further drop in oil prices,  although the non-OPEC producers responded irresponsibly.    Despite this, OPEC continues to work to gain the support of  non-OPEC producers through reduced production, although some  independent producers insist on continuing to produce at high  levels, and in reality the have created a disappointing outlook  for the oil market by working with the world's other dominant  powers.    Consequently, this undesirable situation has caused most  OPEC  members, including Iran, to review their economic development  programs and the implementation of their national projects and  expenditures to keep this process from having undesirable  effects on their economies to the extent possible.    Although Iran's oil production capacity reached more than 4  million barrels in the year 1372, its true production level was  kept at 3.8 million BPD, and the Islamic Republic of Iran has  kept its commitment to OPEC decisions on oil production quotas.    Despite more limited revenues from oil sales than those  projected for the year 1372, oil and gas projects still have  priority and are being pursued. Many projects in the oil and gas  sectors were completed. Production capacity increased and more  wells were drilled in the Persian Gulf and in the Caspian Sea.  The capacity of the oil refineries increased with the  reconstruction of the Abadan refinery and the establishment of  the Arak refinery. Natural gas delivery projects to 150 of the  nation's cities continued, and the Esfahan motor oil project,  the Arak petrochemical project, and others went into operation.    The year 1372 was the final year of implementation of the  Islamic Republic of Iran's First Five-Year Economic, Social and  Cultural Development Plan. Despite the effective and  comprehensive advances in the oil industry, which were made  through extensive investment and persistent effort by those  working in this industry, the revenues projected in the  Five-Year Plan were not achieved. In the year 1372 Iran's  revenues from oil sales were to have reached $16.8 billion, yet  according to the latest estimate by the Plan and Budget  Organization these revenues were $14.9 billion, based on daily  exports of 2.545 million barrels of oil at an average price of  $14 per barrel. Independent economic experts put Iran's revenues  from the sale of oil at about $13 billion.</p>

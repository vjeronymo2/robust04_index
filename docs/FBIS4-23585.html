			<p>BFN     [Text] Transitional State Council Chairman David Kpomakpor  says government is to shortly call on the Organization of  African Unity to clearly define the role of multinational  African peacekeeping force in Liberia, ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group].  Councillor Kpomakpor accused the multinational peacekeeping  force of failing to take instruction from the transitional  government and said the force was being indecisive in pushing  the disarmament of the former warring factions. Councillor  Kpomakpor squarely blamed the United Nations Observer Mission in  Liberia and ECOMOG for the stalemate in the disarming of  fighters because orders were not being taken from government.    The blame comes following warnings from the visiting U. S.  State Department official, Prudence Bushnell, that the United  States Government will reconsider its position on Liberia by the  end of the month if up to about 50 percent of the arms are not  taken away from the fighting groups in Liberia.    Councillor Kpomakpor, as an individual member of the State  Council, has also registered his opposition to the formation of  a national army by all parties to the Liberian conflict.  Reports said NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and  ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Africa]  representations on the State Council are in favor of the  formation of the national army and that pronouncement by  Councillor Kpomakpor does not represent a consensus view of the  State Council as called for by the Cotonou Accord regarding  decision-making.</p>

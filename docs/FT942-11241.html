			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Wassall acquisition takes a bet on America Wassall, the conglomerate which lost the bid battle for Evode last year, has clinched its first deal since 1991 with the Dollars 269.8m (Pounds 180m) acquisition of General Cable in the US. The proposed purchase is being partly funded by a Pounds 92.2m rights issue. The City gave the thumbs up and the shares rose 18p to a new high of 320p. The purchase of General Cable, which makes power, communications and consumer product cables, will more than double Wassall's turnover and increase US sales to more than three-quarters of the total. Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, said: 'We are consciously taking a bet on America.' He said General Cable was an ideal target for Wassall, being a manufacturer in established markets which has suffered from under-investment and performed poorly relative to its competition. It barely broke even on sales of Dollars 763m (Pounds 510m) last year. The main vendor is American Premier Underwriters, formerly The Penn Central Corporation, a financial service group which partly demerged General Cable in 1992. 'It is just the sort of owner you like to buy from,' said Mr Miller who described General Cable as 'a corporate orphan'. The bulk of the consideration covers the purchase for Dollars 169.8m (Pounds 113m), a 30 per cent discount, of a loan note issued by General Cable to its parent. Wassall is paying an additional Dollars 34.5m for APU's 54 per cent of the ordinary shares and has made a Dollars 38.1m tender offer for the remainder which are traded on Nasdaq. Mr Paul Beaufrere, an analyst at James Capel, said he expected the deal to be neutral at worst for Wassall's earnings this year and that next year there should be 'significant enhancement'. Wassall plans to keep cash on deposit in the UK which should prevent any problem with unrelieved advance corporation tax. On a pro forma basis the enlarged group would have had gearing of 18 per cent at the end of last year. The company estimated this would creep up to not more than around 30 per cent. The terms of the rights issue are one-for-four at 250p. Mr Miller yesterday admitted he had overlooked the possibility that, with over half its sales coming from cables, Wassall might be reclassified from the diversified industrials sector.

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Redundancy terms accepted at pit MINERS at the Calverton colliery in Nottinghamshire yesterday agreed to accept enhanced redundancy terms in a move which suggests that British Coal's pre-privatisation pit closures programme will meet less resistance than ministers had feared. The vote among the more than 550 men is the first in favour of accepting closure proposals since British Coal began closures among its 30 remaining pits two weeks ago. It is likely to influence similar votes expected at five other pits where British Coal has already called for talks on prospects with union leaders, usually a prelude to closure. British Coal yesterday confirmed closure plans for one of them, Hatfield in South Yorkshire, amid criticism from management of the pit's performance. The company also wants to close Frickley and Bentley in South Yorkshire. The Calverton miners had been advised by leaders of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which represents them, to resist closure by referring the plans to the industry's review procedure which can delay closures for nine months. However, in a pithead ballot they voted by 367 to 131 for an enhanced redundancy package which could mean the longest serving miners receiving Pounds 44,000 pay-offs. The terms are thought to be the best received by miners leaving the industry. They would have been jeopardised if the miners had fought closure. Mr John Breward, Calverton branch secretary, said he was disappointed by the result but added that British Coal would have closed the pit whatever miners had voted.</p>

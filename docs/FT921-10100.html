			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries mark time ahead of employment data US TREASURIES marked time yesterday as investors waited for today's employment figures for January to give some sign of the state of the US economy. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond ended the day about  1/4 lower at 102 13/16 , yielding 7.75 per cent, after posting gains in morning trading. Shorter-dated maturities were unchanged to  1/32 higher. Among intermediate issues, the 10-year note reversed direction in the afternoon, sliding  1/8 after firming about  7/32 earlier in the day. With Fed funds trading at 4 per cent, in line with the Federal Reserve's perceived target for the rate, the Fed refrained from operating in the open market for a second day. Wednesday's Treasury refunding announcement helped calm a market which is focusing on today's employment data. There was little reaction to yesterday morning's release of jobless claims for the week ending January 25, which fell 10,000 to 450,000. UK government bonds ended mixed with short-dated issues almost unchanged on the day while longer-dated issues weakened slightly. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 116 3/8 to 116 9/32 . The Liffe gilt future contract traded down from 97.29 to 97.28 on average volumes. There is some speculation in the market that the Bank of England may announce further tap issues today or early next week following the success of the three tap issues which it sold on Wednesday. GERMAN government bond prices rose, helped by a combination of strong buying interest from traders and the US Treasury bond market lead in the afternoon. Traders said the Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 87.90, traded up to 88.04 by late afternoon, breaking through an important resistance level. 'The higher prices helped to entice new buyers into the market,' said one trader. Dealers said the main switch trades yesterday were out of the Dutch government bond market into French government bonds, and out of the Danish and German markets into Sweden. SHORT-covering helped to push up Japanese government bond prices which ended higher yesterday after a volatile trading session. The market opened on a firm note helped by the strength of the US Treasury bond market following Wednesday's favourable announcement on the US Treasury refunding. However, early gains were wiped out after the Bank of Japan governor said that conditions for well-balanced, sustainable growth in Japan could be in place by June. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.465 per cent and traded in a range of 5.385-5.52 per cent before closing at 5.395 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELMET BILL VETO  </P> <P> I applaud Gov. Deukmejian's veto of the mandatory motorcycle helmet bill. The  proposed helmet law embraces the philosophy that it is better to force the  judgment of the majority on the individual than to grant that person the  freedom, dignity, and occasional mistakes that all come as a package deal with  being truly human.  </P> <P> Furthermore, as long as the state reserves the right, at its own discretion, to  draft a man and send him off to end up face down in a rice paddy somewhere with  his brains blown out, it has no business telling him he must wear a helmet when  he rides because otherwise he might get hurt.  </P> <P> JOEL VOELZKE  </P> <P> Tujunga  </P></p>

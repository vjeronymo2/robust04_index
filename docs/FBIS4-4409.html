			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Does the Government Change Its North </F> Korean Nuclear Policy again?"]    [Text] The government's North Korean nuclear policy is  shaking once again. After meeting with the Chinese leaders,  President Kim Yong-sam -- who promised in a meeting with  Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa to "closely cooperate with  Japan" to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue -- is moving in  the direction of "resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue."  This happened only five days after he visited China.    When President Kim Yong-sam left Seoul for China, it was the  government's position that it would persuade China to stand with  the other permanent member states of the UN Security Council to  discuss sanctions against North Korea. According to the outcome  of the ROK-PRC talks, however, President Kim was likely to be  persuaded by President Jiang Zemin with China's logic that North  Korea must not be aggravated.    Regarding the government's policy change, the government  said  that it would expect China -- as the only state that can  persuade North Korea to accept the nuclear inspections -- to be  a mediator in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.    There may be some reasons for the government's change of  policy, but what makes the people at home and abroad feel  embarrassment regarding the issue is that its uncertain policy  can cause harm to the country' reputation, as well as badly  affecting its security system. This is why we worry over the  government's uncertain policy.    We must, first, consider relations with the United States,  as  well as Japan with which we have cooperated in strengthening the  joint effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Now,  the government may lose its credit in diplomatic circles because  it has decided to delay all ongoing meetings regarding the UN  Security Council's sanctions against North Korea. Even the  United States has denounced the government's unfixed nuclear  policy toward North Korea.    In addition to this, Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK ambassador to  China, said that "we would discuss the issue with the United  States, as well as with China," and that "we would even work  together with China to resolve it." We cannot but be stunned by  his remarks. These remarks indicate that the government will  introduce China's active participation in the settlement of the  North Korean nuclear issue. Up to now, the United States, South  Korea, and North Korea have mainly made efforts to resolve the  issue. Also, this can cause confusion in our country's security  system, as well as in the basic direction of our diplomacy,  which we have so far carried out centering on the United States  and Japan.    We wonder how the ambassador -- even though he is neither  the  relevant official in charge of policy affairs nor the  responsible official in charge of diplomatic affairs -- could  make such remarks at an ambassador-level position. This  indicates that there are some problems in the diplomatic  organization.    The present international trends around the Korean peninsula  regarding the North Korean nuclear issue look like the ones in  which the great powers struggled against each other in the late  period of the Yi Dynasty. There are even signs regarding these  trends. China has already pressured the ROK Government  regarding ROK policy under the pretext of its influence over  North Korea. Recently, Russia, which had so far remained silent  regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, proposed to hold an  eight-party international conference. Even an organ published by  the National Defense Ministry reported that Russia should take  the lead in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. On the  other hand, the Russian deputy foreign minister suddenly said  that the treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and  North Korea, a military treaty, can be initiated [paltong] when  North Korea is invaded.    This means that all great powers concerned with Korea will  competitively participate in the Korean peninsula issue. A  century ago, we already had a bitter experience with these kinds  of struggles conducted by the great powers regarding the Korean  peninsula. The country's main pillar must not be shaken because  of a diplomatic issue such as the North Korean nuclear issue.</p>

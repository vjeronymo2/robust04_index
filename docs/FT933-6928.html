			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Jobs boost for consumer confidence CONSUMER confidence in the health of the economy has increased again, fuelled by a growing belief that unemployment has stopped rising, the latest Gallup survey of consumer confidence shows. The survey, conducted on behalf of the European Community, found that when asked about prospects for growth, optimists outweighed pessimists by 6 percentage points. Thirty-four per cent of the 2,042 respondents expect the general economic situation to improve in the next 12 months, against 28 per cent who expect it to deteriorate. The balance of 6 per cent is 11 points higher than the July result. With the exception of May, when expectations soared briefly only to evaporate, this month's figure is the best since June last year. The positive assessment of the economy apparently stems from brighter expectations about jobs. Less than half (49 per cent) of Gallup's respondents predict an increase in unemployment in the next 12 months, while 20 per cent expect the jobless total to fall. The still positive balance of 29 per cent expecting unemployment to increase is nonetheless 11 percentage points lower than the July figure. The balances in this particular series have fallen sharply since the beginning of the year. In February a balance of 74 per cent of respondents expected unemployment to increase over the year ahead. More people believe now is the right time to make a big purchase, possibly indicating that consumers are becoming less worried about committing themselves to significant retail spending. But consumers are not yet convinced that their own financial health will improve. In spite of optimism about the general economic situation only 20 per cent of households expect their financial position to improve in the next 12 months. They remain outnumbered by those who expect it to deteriorate. A survey yesterday from Brook Street, the recruitment specialists, suggested that optimism about the economy is also prevalent in industry. A survey of 1,514 companies showed that 61 per cent expect an upturn in business before the end of the year. Almost 40 per cent indicated their intention to take on more employees by the end of the year. The number of business failures tumbled in the second quarter of the year in England and Wales, figures published yesterday show. According to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm which compiled the figures, company liquidations fell 10.5 per cent from the previous three months and individual bankruptcies dropped by 21.5 per cent. Company liquidations fell to 5,265 from 5,881 in the first quarter of the year, while bankruptcies dropped to 7,403 from 9,435.</p>

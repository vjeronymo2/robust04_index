			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Intel tries to block chip challenge INTEL, the largest US semiconductor maker, has pre-empted another challenge to its dominance of the market for personal computer microprocessors. It has filed a patent infringement suit against Cyrix, a small Texas company that is today announcing its own version of one of Intel's widely-used microprocessors. Anticipation of the Cyrix announcement fuelled a sharp decline in Intel's stock price last week. Before seeing the Cyrix chip, Intel filed a suit charging Cyrix with infringing four patents that protect Intel's microprocessor technology. Intel said that its claims were based on information gleaned from financial analysts Mr Thomas Dunlap, Intel general counsel, said: 'We do not believe that it is possible to produce a chip that is compatible with our 386 microprocessor without infringing our patents.' Intel is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent Cyrix from selling its microprocessor chip. Intel has filed suit against all of its would-be competitors, but has yet to win an injunction to prevent them from selling the look-alike chips.</p>

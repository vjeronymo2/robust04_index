			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Serbian policemen yesterday surrounded Ceraj  village, north of Kosova, for six consecutive hours. Here is a  report by Shaban Arifaj from Kosova:    [Arifaj] More than 200 armed Serbian policemen raided 22  Albanian families in this village under the pretext of searching  for arms and Albanian adolescents who abandoned the former  Yugoslav Army during 1991-92.    A report that arrived today from the Kosova Information  Center and the Council for the Defense of Human Rights and  Freedoms in Mitrovice stresses that during the siege, the police  arrested and physically maltreated several people, while many  others were presented with summons to go to the police station.  It is reported that the police behaved fiercely against the  Albanian inhabitants of this village that borders Serbia. The  expedition finally abandoned the village, taking several hunting  weapons from the homes of the peasants, who had permission to  keep the weapons, and threatened that unless the runaway  adolescents are not handed over, the police violence will not  cease.    Reports from Mitrovice also confirm that the Serbian police  this morning carried out the third consecutive search for Enver  Brahimi, from the Tavnik quarter of the city, who has been  living in Germany for three years now.    Meanwhile, the Information Commission of the Kosova  Democratic Alliance [LDK] first branch in Koder e Trimave in  Prishtina reports that Nazif and Rexhep Beqiri were seriously  maltreated at the police station in Dardani of Prishtina under  the pretext that they were in possession of weapons.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Elsevier to lift turnover in trade publishing ELSEVIER, the acquisitive Dutch publisher, aims to derive 45 per cent of its turnover from trade publications in the professional, business and educational fields by 1996, putting this sector ahead of the company's important science publishing activities for the first time. Science publishing and the professional, business and educational sectors each accounted for 36 per cent of turnover in 1991. Speaking at the presentation of the annual report, Mr Pierre Vinken, chairman, said the emphasis on trade publishing would not be made at the expense of science publishing - whose share of 1996 turnover will remain roughly unchanged at 35 per cent - but at the expense of consumer publishing. This sector, which mainly comprises Elsevier's two Dutch daily newspapers, will see its share of turnover fall to 20 per cent in 1996 from 28 per cent in 1991 and 35 per cent in 1986, when it still represented the company's single biggest activity. This decline would not be achieved by divestments but by quicker growth in the other two areas. Mr Vinken said Elsevier expected to spend its usual minimum of Fl 100m (Dollars 53.7m) on acquisitions in 1992. In 1991, the company spent more than 15 times this sum, most of it on acquiring Pergamon Press, the UK-based scientific publisher, from the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Cornelis Alberti, Elsevier's finance director, said the company was looking at new acquisitions but did not expect to announce one in the very short term. Mr Alberti, who was quoted by Reuter news agency last month as saying that Elsevier would be interested in acquiring a leading foreign newspaper such as the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung or Suddeutsche Zeitung, said his remarks had been intended as an 'academic' example of the type of quality Elsevier pursued in making its acquisitions. He repeated that Elsevier realised these newspapers were not for sale.</p>

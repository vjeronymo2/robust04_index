			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Social clause in a trade pact to protect workers is not protectionist (2) Sir, Your editorial, 'Workers' rights and free trade' (March 28), dismisses too casually the case for incorporating minimum standards for the treatment of workers into international trade agreements. Why, for example, should it be tolerable for a country to seek competitive advantage by jailing trade unionists or flouting the most elementary factory safety requirements, while it is prohibited from seeking such advantage through discriminatory tariffs? Indeed, the more the international community insists on a level playing field in other areas bearing on trade, the more differences in labour costs will become important, particularly in manufactur-ing. Workers throughout the traditional industrial areas of the US understand this only too well, as they see their jobs 'relocated' to Mexico, where free trade unionism scarcely exists, working conditions are often Dickensian and pay rates tiny compared with north of the border. While in Morocco to sign the Gatt agreement, world leaders will be able to observe similar conditions. Unfair competition does not lie simply in the fact that labour costs (pay, health and safety requirements, social spending, etc) are extremely low compared with those prevailing in most of Europe; it is also that the state is often acting to keep wages low, by denying workers the rights necessary to improve their conditions and by failing to enforce even such legislation as may be on their statute books. That is why President Bill Clinton is right to force this issue on to the trade agenda. If the liberalisation of the world economy is founded upon the (often literally) broken bones of working people, it will not endure and will end up provoking the very protectionism it seeks to avoid. There can be no free trade without free workers. Bill Morris, general secretary, Transport and General Workers Union, Transport House, Smith Square, London, SW1P 3JB</p>

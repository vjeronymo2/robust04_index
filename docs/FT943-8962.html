			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / As one chess player to another . . .: The lesson that Jeremy Hanley has failed to grasp One could not help but be touched by the puzzlement of Jeremy Hanley as, last week, he gave his first interview as Conservative Party chairman. It was published the day before a Gallup opinion poll showed that the Labour Party had an unprecedented 33.3 per cent lead over the Conservatives. While no one seems to believe that this result would pertain in a general election it is, nevertheless, chilling for the Conservatives to be presented with so graphic a premonition of their political annihilation. Yet, as Hanley plaintively told the Sunday Telegraph, everything seems to be going swimmingly with the economy. Inflation and interest rates are at levels not enjoyed since the early 1960s (when we had never had it so good, apparently). Unemployment is falling sharply. And last week, the Confederation of British Industry, perpetual moaners and complainers, reported that for the first time in a decade all of their 11 regions, from Scotland to the south-west, were increasingly optimistic about both output and new orders. For Hanley, whom I know to be a chess player of iron logic, such an apparent divergence between facts and opinion is genuinely paining, and not just because his own seat is a bit marginal. One of Hanley's colleagues, struggling to come up with an explanation, said it was because the electorate was 'bored' with John Major and the Conservatives. The implication was that the nationwide enthusiasm for Anthony Blair, the Labour leader, was merely a fashion, which had come, and would go, rather like skateboarding or bungee-jumping. This may, indeed, be part of the reason, and one must concede that Major's appeal does not lie in the generation of excitement. On the other hand, I have always thought that the British people do not want to be excited by their politicians. They rather like the idea of boring competence, a la Stanley Baldwin. But the key word is competence. And I would not be the first person to point out that the government's reputation for competence, so assiduously cultivated by 'honest' John Major, was shattered by Britain's humiliating exit two years ago from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. That traumatic event was the main reason why the British economy is now growing faster than those of its European partners. But everyone realises that it had been the government's sworn policy, on the political equivalent of stacks of bibles, never to take the cut-and-run exit from the ERM, even while a number of wise and experienced commentators had warned that such an outcome was not only inevitable but desirable. There is some political injustice in Blair benefiting from this debacle. He and his wing of the Labour Party, 'the modernisers', had uncritically stood four-square behind the government's ERM policy, and were as astonished as anyone by the eventual result. Indeed, the only Labour MP of any stature who warned of the consequences, Bryan Gould, has sunk into political oblivion. The government's big mistake was its brazen refusal to take any responsibility for the debacle, to pretend, quite shamelessly that what had happened was an accident that could not have been foreseen, and that its economic policies remained a seamless web of consistency, rather like one of Hanley's better games of chess. It is true that politicians never apologise, and rarely explain, but the government on this occasion underestimated the public's capacity for outrage. Norman Lamont's singing in the bath and regretting nothing was charmingly insouciant, but contrition was the order of the day. Alas, Hanley does not yet seem to have grasped this lesson. In his interview he seemed unable to express any genuine regret for the ERM fiasco, and indeed hinted strongly that this was an experiment we might want to take part in again. As one chess player to another, I would implore Hanley to remember that it is better to admit one's errors during the game, rather than try to justify them after one has lost.

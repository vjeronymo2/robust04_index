			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Mallett up despite difficult conditions Despite 'difficult' trading conditions, Mallett, the New Bond Street art and antique dealer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 501,000 for the half year to June 30, an increase of 22 per cent on the comparable Pounds 409,000. The company attributed the upturn, achieved despite an 11 per cent contraction in turnover to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 5.13m), to it selling more of its own stock. Last time, a higher than usual proportion of sales were on a commission basis. The second half had started slowly but directors stressed that the main selling thrust tended to come in the autumn months. The sales effort would be increased, they added. The interim dividend goes up 50 per cent to 0.75p, payable from earnings of 2.4p (2p) per share.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / National champions become laggards: Europe's electronics industry is in crisis and may not last the decade - Why? It has long been a tenet of European industrial policy that a successful modern economy depends on a healthy electronics sector. Yet the deepening crisis among Europe's electronics producers suggests that their biggest challenge this decade may be to survive at all. Most European-owned chipmakers made losses last year, as did many computer companies and Philips of the Netherlands, the biggest electronics group. Savage cutbacks across the industry have brought almost 100,000 job losses, while the European Community's annual electronics trade deficit has swelled to almost Dollars 35bn. Distress signals are multiplying. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of the French state-owned Thomson group, is openly urging more trade protection. Earlier this month, he and other industry leaders sought more EC support at a 'mini-summit' chaired by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The industry has long argued for special treatment on two grounds. One is that the market for its products is growing fast. The other is that they are used by so many sectors, from cars to financial services, that failure to retain a European presence in electronics could jeopardise industrial competitiveness across a broad front. Many national governments and the EC have responded sympathetically. In the name of safeguarding a 'strategic' sector, they have repeatedly supported indigenous electronics producers with subsidies, preferential procurement and trade protection. Yet these remedies have failed to cure deep-seated problems - and may have prolonged them. Not only have misjudged policies perpetuated bad habits in the industry, they have often been inconsistent with the larger goal of disseminating advanced technology throughout the economy. The first error has been to confuse invention with product innovation. Most EC funding has focused on expanding research and development, emphasising collaborative projects intended to boost European companies' technological firepower. Some critics say EC subsidies have been too thinly spread to be effective. More fundamentally, they do not address one of European manufacturers' biggest traditional weaknesses - a belief that laboratory breakthroughs can substitute for efficient manufacturing and aggressive marketing. That is a costly delusion in an industry ruled by short product cycles and steeply falling prices. Japanese companies have thrived by concentrating their technical resources on product development and production engineering and fine-tuning them to the market. Europe's industry structure has also adapted sluggishly to rapid technological advance. In the US, the established order is regularly challenged by home-grown market entrants. The industry shake-up instituted by innovative newcomers such as Compaq and Sun Microsystems is as responsible as the recession for the current difficulties of traditional US computer companies, including IBM. In Japan, the most potent agent of change is also intense domestic competition. But there it is chiefly between large vertically-integrated groups, where the thirst for business drives them constantly to invade each others' markets. In Europe, by contrast, lack of a fertile start-up culture has left slow-moving older companies dominating the indigenous electronics industry. Direct competition between them is often timid: most European computer makers still rely heavily on their home markets. European companies have also often been late into hot new products such as camcorders and scientific workstations. Europe's three main chipmakers - Philips, Siemens of Germany and the Italian-French SGS-Thomson - are being heavily subsidised in their efforts to catch up in chip technology. They are also discussing pooling research. But they account for only about 10 per cent of world production - and barely 30 per cent of European sales - and are poorly represented in the high-volume microprocessor and memory segments. Indeed, the only electronics equipment sector in which Europe boasts consistently profitable world leaders is telecommunications, where monopoly procurement of network equipment in most countries continues to shelter entrenched suppliers and maintains high margins. Inadequate home demand is often blamed for industry weaknesses. Though Europe's spending on information technology has been rising, it is still lower per head than in the US and Japan. The market is also divided by differing national standards and fragmented distribution channels, which add to selling costs. However, volume of demand is probably less important than its quality. As computer power grows steadily cheaper, the sophistication and complexity of the applications to which it is harnessed play a bigger role in expanding the market. Producers are depending more on customers to set the pace and direction of the industry. But large European information systems users are notoriously cautious about pioneering leading-edge applications: those which do often prefer US suppliers for their superior expertise. Brussels is now considering plans to boost demand by persuading national authorities jointly to back a futuristic Europe-wide electronic information network. tions. First, whether the large contracts it would generate could legally be reserved for the European-owned suppliers it is intended to benefit. Second, whether it would not simply repeat at the EC level European countries' largely unsuccessful use of public procurement to bolster national champion suppliers. The result has often been to induce dependence on captive markets. Putting the interests of producers ahead of customers has been a consistent  -and often unsatisfactory - theme of European electronics policies. For instance, the EC's faltering strategy for high-definition television (HDTV) has been shaped largely by European equipment makers anxious to keep Japanese competitors at bay. Only recently has an effort been made to involve broadcasters, whose commitment is vital to HDTV's success. Perhaps most dubious of all have been EC attempts to use trade protection to strengthen indigenous producers. During the 1980s, repeated EC anti-dumping actions led to price rises of as much as 50 per cent on electronics imports from computer printers to video recorders. Since offending exporters have often agreed, under EC pressure, to raise prices unilaterally, they have reaped windfall profit gains paid for by European consumers. Yet there is little evidence that threatened European producers have taken advantage of anti-dumping relief to step up investment and raise productivity. In semiconductors, the EC has followed the US by engineering trade arrangements which require Japanese producers to co-operate in limiting price reductions at times of glut. That is profoundly ironic, since European chipmakers have long warned that if they were unable to compete, Japanese producers would collude to rig the prices and supply of components sold to European customers. If that was ever a serious risk, it has been mitigated by the rapid growth of large Japanese-owned chip plants in the EC. It would hardly be in Japanese companies' interest to restrict output to local customers after laying out billions of dollars on production capacity. Indeed, the recent influx of Japanese and US investments is one of the main sources of European electronics industry growth. Yet it is also posing new policy dilemmas, underlined by the outcry over the acquisition of ICL, Britain's largest computer maker, by Fujitsu of Japan last year. ICL has since been expelled from the European industry's most influential lobby group and partially excluded from Jessi, the Dollars 5bn EC-funded microchip research programme. That response was doubtless intended as a warning to the Japanese. However, it also poses awkward questions about the EC's insistence on defining the electronics industry narrowly in terms of a shrinking number of European-owned suppliers. Behind the indignant chauvinism lies, nonetheless, a more serious concern: that if Europe's electronics industry passed entirely into foreign hands, critical management and technological functions would move overseas. The industry could be reduced to branch plants making mature products, with little capacity to innovate. Yet in this context, corporate ownership is something of a side-issue. For many companies, including Bull, ICL, Olivetti, Thomson and Siemens already rely heavily on overseas competitors for products and vital technologies. The flow is almost all one way - and is growing. The industry's options appear limited. Trans-European mergers, frequently touted as a way to strengthen indigenous producers, have often proved tricky to arrange. In microchips and consumer electronics, such mergers have also been disappointingly slow to deliver improved scale economies and financial returns. Meanwhile, the EC Commission is refusing to bail out troubled companies, and its competition watchdogs are investigating French state aid to Bull. In any case, the French government's largesse is bounded by budgetary constraints, which recently prompted it to relax its opposition to privatisation. Nor would further trade barriers offer much of a solution. Past EC trade protection has proved a Maginot Line, easily outflanked by overseas companies which have set up plants to compete from inside the EC. Barring a miraculous recovery in their performance, the outlook for many of Europe's embattled electronics manufacturers is likely to be further retrenchment and takeovers. The most optimistic prognosis may be that, as they retreat, innovative home-grown competitors will spring up in their place. That is what has happened in the US. However, the US has also long had a dynamic and demanding home market. The lesson for Europe may be that indigenous suppliers can only be as vigorous as the customers they serve.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Irish ask for probe on plant THE Irish government has asked the European Commission to investigate claims that Britain breached EC competition rules by offering incentives to keep open a computer manufacturing plant at Ayr in south-west Scotland. Dublin says the incentives - in the form of public procurements and state aids - have been offered to Digital Equipment, the US computer manufacturer, which is to decide this week whether to concentrate production at the Ayr plant, or at a similar one at Galway in the west of Ireland. The Ayr plant employs 980, the Galway one 1,100. On Tuesday Mr Padraic MacKernan, Ireland's ambassador to the EC, delivered letters to both Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, and Mr Renie Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC commissioner for the internal market, asking them to investigate whether the incentives offered by the UK government to Digital had breached EC competition rules. Ireland's department of enterprise and employment said yesterday the request did not yet constitute a formal complaint to the EC, as hard evidence was lacking. The request was being made on the basis of media reports out of Scotland 'and information which has emanated from non-media sources in Britain and Scotland'. The Scottish Office refused yesterday to comment beyond saying it was a matter between the Irish government and the commission. Any question of support for Digital's European reorganisation would be subject to the normal EC rules on state aid, it added. Scottish Enterprise, the development body, said it had 'no difficulty with any investigation'.</p>

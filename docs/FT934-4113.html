			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Treasury promotes family values Mandarins at the Treasury have been told to abandon the habits of a lifetime and go home early rather than risk overworking and disrupting their family lives. Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, has told senior officials that their junior staff should cut down on excess work by reducing their briefings for ministers and other Whitehall departments. The change is designed partly to create a more relaxed atmosphere and encourage more women with family commitments to rise to the top of the department. Treasury officials spend a lot of time preparing general briefings for ministers on how to answer tricky questions about economic policy. In an effort to make the Treasury culture more sympathetic to women, who comprise 45 per cent of staff but just 7 per cent of the top 140 officials, Sir Terry is meeting a group of junior women from the department tomorrow to discuss subjects such as childcare provision and part-time working. This follows an earlier meeting with senior women officials to discuss such issues. The initiatives are designed to counter what an official says is a 'macho' style at the Treasury of encouraging overwork, which officials now admit is sometimes counterproductive. One official said: 'We have a tremendous tendency to write a vast amount of briefings which are used for purely defensive purposes.' Another admitted: 'We waste a lot of time producing the same material over and over again.' After an internal survey early this year indicated that large numbers of the Treasury's 1,400 staff often worked 11-hour days, Sir Terry has instructed top officials to cut down on their habit of working late into the evening. One official said: 'We are trying to substitute quality for quantity and persuade people that it is acceptable to go home early.' Sir Terry's initiative comes as the Treasury is starting a project with 15 leading companies, including BP, British Aerospace, Cable &amp; Wireless, Boots, Lloyds Bank and the UK subsidiaries of IBM, Nissan, and Merck, to encourage more of its officials to mix with industrialists to learn about business. Under the scheme 15 Treasury officials aged between 25 and 35 will shadow counterparts from business in an attempt to encourage a greater flow of outside ideas into the Treasury. These efforts are part of a broad move by Sir Terry to change the management style of Britain's most important government department, which has been criticised for being too introverted and over-concerned with limiting public spending rather than thinking imaginatively about the economy.</p>

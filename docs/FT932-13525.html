			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Nedlloyd tumbles into the red A SQUEEZE on prices in international container shipping helped push Nedlloyd, the Dutch transport group, into the red last year, prompting the company to omit its dividend for the third successive year. The loss of Fl 58m (Dollars 32m) which had been widely expected after the company's profit warning in November, was also caused by the absence of the large extraordinary gains on divestments that had flattered 1991 results, when net profit of Fl 145m was posted. Nedlloyd said it could not make a forecast for 1993 results, but confirmed that it had made an unspecified loss in the first quarter. It aims to reduce costs by Fl 250m a year from 1995 and eliminating 2,000 jobs out of a total of 23,500 over the next two years.</p>

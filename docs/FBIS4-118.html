			<p>BFN     [Text] Additional members of the South African Army will be  deployed throughout kwaZulu/Natal over the Easter weekend.  Deployment strategies have already been planned by the Natal  Command headquarters.    [Begin recording] [Franz Verfuss of the Natal Command] It  will be three companies, a company being approximately 100 to  150 men strong. A company will be deployed in each of the group  areas: one going to the Group-9 area -- Pietermaritzburg, one  going to the Group-10 area near Durban, and one going to the  Group-27 area round about Eshowe.    [Van der Westhuizen] Colonel Verfuss said because  kwaZulu/Natal is such a vast area, the troops would be mobile  and would assist the police and the other troops already in the  area to stabilize the most volatile areas starting off with  kwaMashu and Bhambayi near Durban. He said they would not work  directly with the kwaZulu Police.    [Verfuss] If the kwaZulu Police cannot handle a situation,  they approach the police, the South African Police. If the  South African Police feel that they need extra forces, they  approach the South African Defense Force. Our support is to the  South African Police and not directly to the kwaZulu Police.    [Van der Westhuizen] Despite Bhambayi and kwaMashu being  very  quiet during the daytime, it's at night that violence usually  erupts, and it's then that the security forces will be most  needed.

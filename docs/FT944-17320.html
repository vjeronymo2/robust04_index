			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Don't delay that will - Scheherazade Daneshkhu explains the benefits of making proper provision Only one-third of UK adults have made a will. To spur the rest, Make a Will week, an annual promotion organised by the Law Society, starts on Monday, October 17. Married people tend to assume everything will pass to their spouse when they die - but this is not always so, as the chart shows. In broad terms, if you die without a will and leave an estate worth more than Pounds 125,000 (in England and Wales), it will be divided between your spouse and children (sometimes parents if there are no children). This can be a problem if much of the estate's value is concentrated in the family home - the spouse might have to sell it to satisfy other claimants. People who stand to lose most are unmarried partners who survive the person with whom they lived. They have no rights under the intestacy laws although, if they are a dependant, they may be able to claim through the courts. There are three distinct elements in making a will: Appointing executors to handle your affairs. Usually, these will be trusted relatives or friends. If you die intestate, your next of kin will have to do the job - even if they are reluctant at such an upsetting time. Try to avoid appointing a professional, such as a solicitor or bank. They are likely to be expensive and the family could find it difficult to control them if it is unhappy with their service. A non-professional executor can always appoint a solicitor to help, anyway. Prescribing powers for trustees. If you have children under 18, you must have trustees to handle their affairs - although the executors can fulfil this role. How much power the trustees should have is for you to decide. Distributing the property. This should be quite straightforward so long as you have calculated the size of your estate and know where you want your possessions to go. But remember to revise the will if your financial or personal circumstances change significantly, or a beneficiary dies. Where should you have the will drawn up? The options are wide, ranging from a trip to the stationer for a do-it-yourself pack to a solicitor's office. But research by the Consumers' Association - published this week in its magazine, Which? - found that one in five wills was of poor quality, with sloppy drafting. The association suggests shopping around for quotations, working out figures beforehand, and getting the person drafting the will to explain any jargon they might use. Always check the will after it has been drafted. Solicitors came out best in the survey. Of the 31 wills drawn up by them, six were deemed good and 20 reasonable, but five were poor. Quality of service can vary considerably and is not always related to how much you pay  -anything between Pounds 23.50 and Pounds 117.50, according to the association. Solicitors also can guide you on inheritance tax but the costs for this will push up the bill; ask for an estimate first. The best are likely to be found through personal recommendation. If you are unhappy, you can turn to the Solicitors Complaints Bureau*. Banks and building societies. The main problem here is that most banks insist on being named executor and, since their fee tends to be a fixed percentage of the estate, they can be very expensive. The survey found that of the 10 wills given to banks and building societies, three were good, five reasonable and two poor. It also found incompetence and lengthy delays in executing wills. Will-writing services. Of the six firms surveyed by the association, four produced poor wills while those from two others were no more than reasonable. But these often are franchise operations and qualifications are not needed to provide such a service. Moreover, they are unregulated - there is no point of redress for unhappy clients. Life insurance companies. Some of these, or independent financial advisers, may offer 'free' will-writing services, but be wary - this could be a marketing ploy to sell you something else. The survey tried out only three life companies, however. Two drafted reasonable wills. The third did not draft one after the client refused to buy any life products. Do-it-yourself packs. These may seem an easy option but you can miss out on good advice, which could cause unnecessary complications after your death. *Solicitors Complaints Bureau, Victoria Court, 8 Dormer Place, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV32 5AE.

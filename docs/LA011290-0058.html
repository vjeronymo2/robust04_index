			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BEST OF THE SHORTS ARE BRITISH IN NORTHRIDGE ANIMATION FESTIVAL  </P> <P> "The 1990 Festival of Animation," a program of 17 shorts from the United  States, Canada, England and Holland opening tonight at the Cal State Northridge  Campus Theater, features three extraordinary films by British artists that  illustrate the versatility of the animator's art.  </P> <P> Easily the most beautiful film in the program, Erica Russell's exquisitely  sensual "Feet of Song," stands out as an example of sophisticated design and a  celebration of the joy of motion. Semi-abstract figures composed of geometric  shapes and brush lines of brilliant color dance to an upbeat Latin score. As  the film progresses, groups of figures form complex patterns that recall the  exuberance of Matisse's dance paintings.  </P> <P> Mark Baker creates a bizarre, two-dimensional world of square sheep, circular  chickens and angular people in "The Hill Farm." Although the antics of these  odd creatures are often hilarious -- a ravenous pig devours its supper like an  amoeba engulfing a smaller microbe; a farmhand scares off a Gargantuan bear by  tapping it on the nose with a shepherd's crook -- Baker somehow manages to make  their lives seem compelling. "The Hill Farm" has already won the British  equivalent of the Academy Award, as well as prizes at major festivals in France  and Bulgaria.  </P> <P> In "In and Out," the Canadian/British husband-and-wife team of David Fine and  Alison Snowden infuse the familiar theme of the Seven Ages of Man with  delightful absurdity that characterized their Oscar-nominated shorts, "Second  Class Mail" and "George and Rosemary." During the wedding scene, the toy bride  and groom leave the top of the cake for a lower layer furnished with miniature  armchairs and a television set.  </P> <P> Two films by American artists demonstrate the latest developments in  computer-assisted character animation. The previously reviewed "Knickknack" by  PIXAR's John Lasseter and Bill Reeves (who won the Oscar last year for "Tin  Toy") focuses on the frustrations of a tiny snowman struggling to escape from a  souvenir paperweight. "Locomotion" by Steve Goldberg of Pacific Data Images  depicts a cartoon locomotive's determination to arrive on schedule -- at any  cost. The opening sequence of the train emerging from a tunnel into a forest  offers a dazzling example of the trompe-l'oeil realism that computer graphics  can achieve.  </P> <P> The remaining films in the Festival are less impressive. "Creature Comforts"  from the British stop-motion studio, Aardman Animations, features clever  designs and polished movements, but the voice artists provide all the humor and  render the visuals superfluous. Bill Plimpton's "25 Ways to Quit Smoking"  (U.S.A.) is basically a retread of his popular "Your Face." As pointless as it  is ugly, "Black Hula" (Canada) by Marv Newland provides a good opportunity to  sneak out for a cigarette, even if you don't smoke.  </P> <P> "The 1990 Festival of Animation" continues at the Campus Theater through Jan.  25, then plays at the State Theater in Pasadena, Jan. 26 through Feb. 3.  </P></p>

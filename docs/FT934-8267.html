			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES traders opened the new equity account with a nervousness masked by strong technical trading in FT-SE futures and options contracts, writes Peter John. Turnover in Footsie futures was boosted by one house taking advantage of the differential between the contract which expires next month and the contract for March and rolling forward its exposure. More than 2,500 December contracts were sold and the equivalent number of March contracts bought. The December contract rose through the morning to hit a high of 3,123, a premium of some 15 points above cash compared with its new estimated fair value of about 6 1/2 . It then trickled back to around 3,100 in late trading. Dealers were also selling FT-SE options to take advantage of high implied volatility in the contract. Recent concerns over the direction of the underlying equity market had pushed implied or theoretical volatility up to 15 1/2 per cent by the start of trading. That uncertainty is not expected to go away ahead of the Budget. But the nervousness was considered slightly overdone yesterday and marketmakers were offloading puts and calls to pocket their profits. The implied figures eased to 15 per cent by the close. Volume in traded options was just over 30,000 lots with FT-SE options contributing 12,440 and Amstrad (3,482) topping stock options.</p>

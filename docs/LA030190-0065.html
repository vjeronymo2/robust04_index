			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THE FIRST CONVENIENCE ITEMS ARE CONSIDERED AS UP TO DATE  AS 10 BC  </P> <P> These days, eating can seem like serious business, what with fretting about  fiber and chafing over cholesterol. For a breather, step back in time. Test  your knowledge of fascinating food facts and fancies with this quiz:  </P> <P> Question: Convenience foods seem like a 20th-Century invention, but what were  the first ones?  </P> <P> Answer: Fermented milk and cheese are often considered early convenience foods.  On a more exotic note, more than 2,000 years ago the Chinese prized dried snake  as a portable food for long trips, while Indians traveled with dried rice and  dried bummelo fish, curiously labeled "Bombay duck." The Tibetan combination of  yak butter and tea leaves also served well on trips. More recently, the  portable staple for sailors was hardtack, made of flour and water, then baked  rock-hard.  </P> <P> Q: The modern eggplant looks nothing like an egg. How did it get its name?  </P> <P> A: The only link we can find is shape, dating back to when eggplants were grown  for decorative purposes. Actually, only Americans use that name, the British  preferring the French word aubergine. That word can be traced to the Sanskrit,  meaning "anti-wind" vegetable. Eggplant became a favorite of what might loosely  be described as hippies and beautiful people in late 18th-Century France.  Earlier it had been blamed falsely for causing epilepsy and fever.  </P> <P> Q: At one time, tomatoes were considered poisonous fruit. How did that lore get  started?  </P> <P> A: Early botanists recognized the tomato, along with potatoes and eggplants, as  members of the same family of poisonous plants as belladonna and black henbane.  In 1544, Italian botanist Pierandrea Mattioli initially named the tomato mala  aurea, meaning "golden apple" (the first ones to reach Europe were yellow), but  later renamed it mala insana, or "unhealthy apple."  </P> <P> Q: Oats have enjoyed a meteoric rise in reputation as a "health food." We  associate them with Scotland, but where did oats originate?  </P> <P> A: Oats, it appears, forced themselves on the world's diet. Perhaps having  first taken root in northern Germany, they were already being eaten, possibly  in wild form, in northern Europe in Neolithic times. By the Bronze Age, oats  were under cultivation in central Europe. In ancient times, growing as weeds in  high, cool altitudes, they choked out wheat, so farmers gave up and harvested  them instead.  </P> <P> Q: Numerous studies have explored the effects of coffee on health, but  clear-cut links have yet to be found. In times past, coffee was valued for its  special benefits. What were they?  </P> <P> A: Coffee is said to have achieved its initial popularity among a religious  sect known as dervishes, whose ritual included chanting and continuous whirling  until participants slipped into a trance. Caffeine in the coffee may have  prolonged the precataleptic state. Coffee originated in Ethiopia, but it's not  known who first realized it was edible and drinkable. The word derives from  both Turkish and Arabic roots meaning "wine."  </P> <P> Q: Cocoa trees, native to South America, were probably brought to Europe by the  crew of Columbus' fourth voyage. Cocoa was consumed as a beverage first,  chocolate in block form came later. When was it first made into bars?  </P> <P> A: For nearly 300 years after it was introduced in Europe, chocolate was  consumed only in drinks. Chocolate bars appeared in Europe in the 19th Century.  </P> <P> Q: While olive oil has been a valued food since ancient times, it has other  uses too. Can you name some of them?  </P> <P> A: Before soap was invented, olive oil was used as a cleanser. In ancient  Egypt, it may have been used as a lubricant to help move the huge blocks of  stone forming the pyramids. The ancient Greeks and Hebrews applied it to the  skin to bestow health and longevity.  </P> <P> As a fuel, it was burned in earthenware lamps. The pulp remaining after the oil  was pressed was used as animal feed and fertilizer. The Romans used the  leftover liquid both as a weed killer and as insecticide on cabbage. Wood from  olive trees was used for various purposes, notably the tabernacle of Solomon's  temple.  </P> <P> Q: Pasta's popularity has soared in recent years. Everyone knows the story that  even though it's the keystone of Italian cooking, it was brought back from  China by Marco Polo. But was it really?  </P> <P> A: According to Reay Tannahill, author of "Food and History" (Crown Publishers:  1988), that idea is a mistranslation of his having said that he "discovered"  that the Chinese had pasta "which are like ours." The Italian pasta may date  back to Etruscan times. If so, that would predate Chinese noodles by roughly  500 years.  </P> <P> Besides Tannahill's book, for more fun reading about food, try Waverly Root's  "Food: An Authorized and Visual History"; Harold McGee's "On Food and Cooking:  The Science and Lore of the Kitchen"; both Jane Grigson's "Vegetable Book" and  "Fruit Book"; "Food in Chinese Culture" by K.C. Chang, and "Savoring the Past"  by Barbara Wheaton.  </P> <P> From Dickens to Modern Doctors: No One Is Exact About Dyspepsia  </P> <P> Question: I've often wondered -- especially when reading old novels, where it  seems to be a common affliction -- exactly what the term "dyspepsia" means.  </P> <P> Answer: You're not the only one. The name derives from two Greek words, dys,  "bad," and pepsis, "digestion." Hence, bad digestion. That meaning is far too  broad, since digestion covers everything from chewing to defecation. With  dyspepsia, the focus is on the upper gastrointestinal tract and can include a  laundry list of symptoms such as upper-abdominal pain or discomfort, unusual  fullness after meals, feeling too full early in a meal, loss of appetite,  belching, nausea and vomiting, and heartburn or regurgitation.  </P> <P> That's why we say you're not the only one who's wondered how to define the  condition. Attempting to reach a consensus, a group of physicians formed the  "International Working Party on the Definition and Investigation of Dyspepsia"  (some party). Here's their definition: "episodic or persistent abdominal  symptoms, often related to feeding, which patients or physicians believe to be  due to disorders of the proximal (upper) portion of the digestive tract." They  suggest that it's a more useful term if accompanied by modifiers, as in "ulcer  dyspepsia" or "nonulcer dyspepsia."  </P> <P> Dyspeptic symptoms may be linked to structural problems of the gastrointestinal  tract, use of drugs or alcohol, or metabolic diseases. With the possible  exception of milk intolerance, it's rare to be able to prove objectively that a  particular food is responsible for dyspepsia.  </P> <P> Dyspepsia can also occur in individuals in whom no disease can be identified.  This common problem is generally called functional dyspepsia. Did the  dyspeptics of Dickens' novels suffer from functional disease, from extra-tight  corsets, or from food-borne illnesses caused by foods poorly cooked and  improperly stored? We'll never know for sure.  </P> <P> Q: I had to go back to work soon after my son was born. I considered  breast-feeding, but it was logistically impossible. My baby is healthy but  sometimes fussy. My pediatrician says that's normal, but a friend who was  visiting suggested I switch to iron-free formula. She claims that the addition  of iron to formula can cause discomfort in some babies. Is that true?  </P> <P> A: As a parent, you'll receive lots of free advice from friends, well-meant but  not always accurate or helpful.  </P> <P> The Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics found no  scientific evidence that infants who consume iron-fortified formulas are more  likely to suffer colic, constipation, diarrhea or regurgitation than those on  nonfortified formula. The only difference observed, in one study where infants  were fed both types of formula, were darker stools when the babies received the  iron. That is of no importance.  </P> <P> The committee also addressed another concern: that iron-fortified formula might  interfere with absorption of zinc and copper. Again, they found no evidence  that any impairment of absorption is nutritionally important, given the levels  of both those minerals in the formula.  </P> <P> According to the committee, by 1985, iron-fortified formula represented 80% of  all formula sold in the United States, up from 40% in 1971. This trend is  believed to be a major factor in the decline of anemia among infants in this  country, among both low-income and middle-class populations. Their conclusion:  Given the demonstrated benefit and lack of evidence for untoward effect,  iron-fortified formula should be used for all formula-fed infants.  </P> <P> Q: Oh bacon, bacon, I used to eat you often, but now, only on special  occasions. My question is this: I know that in times past, cured meats were  stored for long periods. But in that era, food safety was not well understood.  Just how long is it safe to keep bacon?  </P> <P> A: Begin by checking the package. As long as the bacon remains sealed in a  vacuum package and looks well-colored, it should be just fine as much as a week  after the last date of sale. Once opened, though, it should be wrapped tightly  and kept no longer than a week. For longer storage it should be frozen, but not  too long. After about a month the fat starts to turn rancid.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most efficient way to freeze bacon is to precook it until it's not  quite done. Then drain it well, wrap it in paper towels, and then in heavy  freezer material. It can then be stored in the freezer up to six weeks.  </P> <P> An important difference in curing methods allowed people in earlier days to  keep cured meats over an entire winter. Today's cured meats, mildly cured and  moist, generally are prepared for flavor rather than longevity. Those earlier  meats were heavily salted and well dried, allowing them to keep through winter  and beyond.  </P></p>

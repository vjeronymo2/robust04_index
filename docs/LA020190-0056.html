			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'ROSEY' GRIER TACKLES SOCIAL SERVICE NEEDS  </P> <P> Roosevelt Grier, who starred as a defensive tackle for the Los Angeles Rams, is  joining the San Diego County administrative staff as a special assistant to  give a helping hand running a spectrum of social services programs, county  officials announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Although best known for his crushing tackles, Grier has also received  recognition for founding and operating community service programs since ending  his 12-year football career in 1967.  </P> <P> According to Norman Hickey, the county's chief administrative officer, Grier  will serve on his staff as a special assistant and participate in a variety of  programs, ranging from those that help underprivileged youth to programs that  assist senior citizens. Grier also may be asked to help defuse the county's  growing gang problem.  </P> <P> "Rosey Grier is a humanitarian," Hickey said in a statement released Wednesday.  "He has repeatedly demonstrated a unique capability to interface with virtually  every facet of humanity, even those who have become splintered from society."  </P> <P> Hickey and Grier are both Penn State University alumni.  </P> <P> It has not been determined how long Grier will work for the county, Lerner  said.  </P> <P> "It's a part-time position to be determined at the pleasure of the CAO," Lerner  said, referring to the chief administrative officer. "It may go beyond a year,  it might be less." Grier is due in San Diego today to make things final, Lerner  said.  </P> <P> Regardless of how long he works, Lerner said, Grier will be placed on the  county government payroll and receive a sum based on a $50,000-a-year salary.  Grier may be put on the payroll as early as Friday, Lerner added.  </P> <P> Grier is expected to work with the county's social service and probation  departments.  </P> <P> Leon Williams, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors, described Grier in  the statement as "a good role model whose presence in our ethnically diverse  county will be an asset to our ongoing efforts to promote positive social  change."  </P> <P> Grier is the founder and director of a federally funded program designed to  give job training to disadvantaged youth. He is also the founder and chairman  of a program aimed at helping inner-city youth improve their self-esteem and  assists them in finding better educational and employment opportunities.  </P> <P> Grier began his football career with the New York Giants (1955-62), where he  was named as an All-Pro defensive tackle in 1956.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THE CHANGING PICTURE(S) OF WASHINGTON  </P> <P> What kind of big changes are going on in Washington now that we have a new  President?  </P> <P> If there are any at all, they are taking place among the lawyers and lobbyists  who make their living persuading our elected officials that what's good for  their clients is good for the country.  </P> <P> I dropped in to see the lawyer-lobbyist, Norton Nesbitt, the day after the  inauguration. He was removing all the photographs of Reagan appointees and  replacing them with autographed pictures of Bush people.  </P> <P> "Redecorating the office?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Just changing the decor a little," he replied. "You get tired looking at the  same faces all the time."  </P> <P> "You're not throwing an autographed picture of Ed Meese in the trash can, are  you?"  </P> <P> "What kind of a friend do you think I am? I'm taking it home and putting in the  bathroom. Ed was good to me. He always took my calls."  </P> <P> pichar  </P> <P> "I can understand your taking Ed Meese off the wall, but how can you discard a  picture of you and Cap Weinberger, particularly when he signed it 'To Ted, with  admiration'?"  </P> <P> "I need that space for a golf photo of me and Secretary of State Jim Baker."  </P> <P> "Can I see it?"  </P> <P> "I don't have it yet, but I'll get one at the next Republican fund-raiser."  </P> <P> "I notice that you have a big gap where you used to have an autographed photo  of Ronald Reagan."  </P> <P> "Yeh, I decided to take Ronnie down and put him in the storeroom so that no one  will steal him."  </P> <P> "Who are you planning to put in his spot?"  </P> <P> "I'm waiting for a picture of the big guy."  </P> <P> "You mean President Bush?"  </P> <P> Nesbitt said, "I could kill myself. I had thousands of opportunities to have my  picture taken with him when he was vice president. I remember one time I was at  the New Jersey State Fair for the crowning of Miss Bergen County, and George  wanted to get a photo with me. I turned him down and went off to get myself a  beer."  </P> <P> "You really blew it."  </P> <P> "How was I supposed to know he was going to be President? Whoever heard of  having your picture taken with a vice president of the United States?"  </P> <P> "I just hope for your sake that Bush doesn't remember that you walked away from  him."  </P> <P> "I doubt it. People were doing it to him all the time. I have someone in the  White House working on an autographed picture of the Prez right now. They owe  me for all the money I raised for the party in Michigan."  </P> <P> "Nesbitt, people will think of you as a good lobbyist whether you have a photo  with the President or not."  </P> <P> "That may be true of those who know me, but what about the potential clients  who don't? They will only judge me on the basis of whose picture I have hanging  on the wall. This is a dog-eat-dog business and the reason that they hire you  is because they think you have access to the top dogs."  </P> <P> "I guess once they're out of power there is no reason to keep in touch with the  Reagan people any more."  </P> <P> "Some folks may feel that way -- but I don't. Those I dealt with during the  Reagan years are still my friends -- regardless of what they are doing now."  </P> <P> Nesbitt's secretary came up to him and said, "George Shultz is on the phone."  </P> <P> "Well, for gosh sake, don't tell him I'm here." He turned to me, "The man  thinks I have nothing to do but chat with him on the phone."  </P></p>

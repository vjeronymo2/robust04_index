			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JAPAN;  </P> <P> WORLD'S BIGGEST USER OF IVORY ACCEPTS BAN  </P> <P> Japan, the world's largest consumer of ivory, agreed to abide by an  international ban on ivory imports, a move seen as vital to the effort to save  the African elephant from extinction. The announcement came on the last day of  a two-week conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, of CITES, the French acronym  for the International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species. A ban could  never be effective without Japan, a CITES spokesman said, since that country  "accounts for around 40% of world imports of ivory." Some conservationists  estimate that the number of African elephants has been halved in the past  decade, plunging from around 1.3 million to the 625,000 mark.  </P></p>

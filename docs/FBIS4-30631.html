			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating and  Indonesia's President Suharto, have held talks in Jakarta.  Although the talks were mainly on trade, Mr. Keating is under  pressure to raise the issue of Indonesia's recent media clamp  down during his discussions.    The Australian Government has already expected  disappointment  about last week banning of Indonesia's three leading news  magazines. Mr. Keating did not commit himself to raising the  sensitive issue with President Suharto. Before leaving  Canberra, Mr. Keating said that Australia was not about to  become an international media policeman.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Lumber Lawsuits Reinstated: The state Court of Appeal in San Francisco  reinstated two suits aimed at barring Pacific Lumber Co. from logging 456 acres  of old-growth redwoods in Humboldt County.  </P> <P> About half the acreage is within the company's 3,000-acre Headwaters Forest,  which would have been turned into a state preserve had voters approved  Propositions 128 and 130 on the November ballot. Both failed. The appellate  court ruling sends the suits by the Sierra Club and the Environmental  Protection Information Center back to Superior Court.  </P></p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Taiwan to probe pollution claims Taiwan's Environment Ministry has launched an investigation into allegations that France's Thomson Consumer Electronics and US-based RCA dumped organic wastes near factory sites, polluting soil and groundwater over 20 years. Chinese New party legislator Jaw Shau-Kong, former head of the Environmental Protection Administration, had accused Thomson, which bought the two factories south of Taipei in late 1987, of covering up the extent of the damage. The EPA promised legal action against the companies involved if the water supply had been contaminated and proof of a cover-up found. RCA built the factories in 1970, and they became the property of General Electric of the US in 1986 when GE took over RCA, according to Mr William Betke, Taiwan general manager of General Electric Technical Services. A spokesman for Thomson Consumer Electronics said from Paris: 'To the best of our knowledge, Thomson did not violate any environmental laws or regulations during the time the company owned the properties.' Thomson sold the sites in 1991 and 1992 to local conglomerates, which apparently plan to use them for commercial and residential purposes. An EPA spokesman said the results of the investigation would be made public next week.</p>

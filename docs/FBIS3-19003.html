			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel,  Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], sees essential common  points with the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in  foreign policy. In an interview with NEUE PRESSE (Friday [11  March] edition), which is published in Hannover, the foreign  minister stated that "it is correct: There are essential points  in foreign policy where we are indeed in complete agreement with  the SPD." Kinkel cited European policy as an example.    However, the controversy about international Bundeswehr  missions is an absolutely central issue that threatens to harm  Germany because of the SPD blockade, the FDP politician said.  There, the SPD must "bring itself to change course." Even a  clarifying ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court does not  release "the SPD from its share of responsibility for finding a  political solution for the necessary amendment to the Basic Law  regarding Bundeswehr missions." Germany has every reason to  strengthen the United Nations in terms of organization,  personnel, and finances, Kinkel said.    (The interview was prereleased to DPA in an editorial  version).</p>

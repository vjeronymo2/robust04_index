			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Sales of Wood Stoves Heat Up: Sales of wood stoves are up again as people worry  about the rising cost of fuel for the winter.  </P> <P> "The good news for our industry is that there's been a wake-up call on the  energy front," said Jim Hermann, president of the Earth Stove Inc. of Portland,  Ore. Stores that sell wood stoves say they saw interest in the products surge  almost immediately after Iraq invaded Kuwait. In Massachusetts, for example,  the average price of home heating oil has risen 18 cents per gallon since the  invasion. While a wood stove can cost $1,000, the low price of wood compared to  oil translates into savings over the long term.  </P></p>

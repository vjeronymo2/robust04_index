			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION SPRAYING URGED FOR WOODCREST  </P> <P> A state panel of scientists recommended Monday that 19 square miles of  Woodcrest in Riverside County be sprayed with malathion at least eight times to  eradicate Mediterranean fruit flies infesting commercial orange groves.  </P> <P> The panel also proposed that aerial pesticide spraying begin over parts of  Hancock Park in Los Angeles and the city of Walnut, citing new fly discoveries  during the past week.  </P> <P> A decision by the state Department of Food and Agriculture is expected this  week.  </P> <P> If accepted, the territory of Southern California under treatment with aerial  applications of malathion would be expanded to 430 square miles, in an  infestation that is approaching its ninth month. While the state previously  announced that it would wind down spraying by May 9, the deadline will not  apply to the Riverside County spraying.  </P> <P> The panel's recommendations were decided during an emergency conference call  prompted by the discovery of four Medflies last week.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, scattered showers Monday forced cancellation of malathion spraying  that had been scheduled for a 26-square-mile area of Los Angeles and Orange  counties, including some parts of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton.  </P> <P> Officials had not decided by Monday afternoon when to reschedule the spraying.  </P> <P> Residents in Orange County's only other spray zone -- a 36-square-mile area  that includes parts of nine cities near Garden Grove and Westminster -- are  scheduled to get their fifth dose of malathion on Thursday.  </P> <P> After this week's scheduled applications, each Orange County region is to be  sprayed once more, the Brea area on April 30, and Garden Grove on May 3.  </P></p>

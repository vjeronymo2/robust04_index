			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the evening of 23 February, President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide attended, with a group of  parliamentarians including Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis  and Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde, a  reception held in his honor at the Haitian Embassy in Washington  on the eve of his visit to France which will begin on 27  February. For the first time, the plan that was worked out by a  group of parliamentarians with the support of the State  Department was delivered to President Aristide in a sealed  envelope by the former president of the lower chamber, Antoine  Joseph, who asserted that he hopes for an answer from the head  of state. President Aristide, who was speaking [on that  occasion], stated that everyone knows why no government can  function in Haiti and why it is impossible [for him] to appoint  a new prime minister. He nevertheless asked the parliamentarians  to forget about their political affiliations and work toward  unity among all Haitians.    With this unity in mind, some of the parliamentarians have  decided to extend their stay in Washington so they can continue  the dialogue to find a solution to the crisis. The president has  promised to remain in contact with them during his trip.    Port-au-Prince Mayor and National Front for Change and  Democracy spokesman Evans Paul, who attended the reception,  asked all factions represented in Washington to fuse their  various plans into a final plan. We are all asking for a return  to democratic order; so, let us all together try to speak with  only one voice, Paul added.    President Aristide was to leave Washington on 24 February  for  New Hampshire, where he will depart for Paris.</p>

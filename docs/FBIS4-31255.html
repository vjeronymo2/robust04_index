			<p>BFN     [Text] We have heard what the situation is like in Tuzla;  now let us see what is happening in Bihac. The increasing  resistance to fundamentalist policy and demands of the 5th Corps  for offensive actions are causing a mutual settling of scores  between individual armed groups. It has been learned that the  greatest number of clashes, killings, and the burning and  destruction of houses is being directed against progressive  Muslims, who are advocating a cease-fire with [self-proclaimed  leader of autonomous province of western Bosnia] Fikret Abdic.    Well-informed sources have learned that in Bihac there is  real chaos. Anarchy and criminals are everywhere, and war  profiteers are taking up key positions of authority. Refugees  from Prijedor, Novi, and Krupa are refusing to take further part  in the fighting because their commanders are pushing them to  take up the hottest positions, while locals are engaged on  secondary tasks or are exempt from military service.    In keeping with orders from Sarajevo, the command of the  Fifth Corps is preparing an offensive against Serbian-held  areas. As a result, the inhabitants of the villages of Sturlic,  Nisici, and Hale have already been evacuated.    However, problems in connection with certain tasks have  caused clashes within the command of the 5th Corps, and as a  result several officers have been dismissed. All these problems  and clashes are continuing with undiminished intensity and are  causing a very difficult and uncertain situation in the Cazin  region.</p>

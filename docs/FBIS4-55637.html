			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 14 (CTK) -- The leadership of the  Slovak National Party (SNS) decided to recommend to its June  congress to enter the autumn parliamentary elections  independently, not in coalition with its current ally, the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the SNS Chairman Jan  Slota announced yesterday. The SNS leadership will recommend to  the June congress to return to the the original statutes which  prefer the national to the civic principle, Slota said. The  April poll showed that the SNS (9 deputies in the 150-member  Slovak Parliament) is favoured by some four per cent of voters,  while the HZDS by 32 per cent.    The observers have suggested that the decision is connected  with alleged internal feuds regarding Slota. He enjoys the  reputation of a radical politician, not acceptable for Meciar's  HZDS. The press has speculated that the June SNS congress could  lead to a split into three factions. One could be headed by  Slota, the second by deputy chairmen of former Meciar's  government Jan Prokes and Marian Andel, and the third by Juraj  Molnar who has recently espoused the Pan-Slavic idea of the  Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky.</p>

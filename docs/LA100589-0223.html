			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ABORTION FOE OPTS FOR JAIL OVER FINE  </P> <P> Anti-abortion activist Randall Terry was fined $1,000 today for a sit-in at a  clinic during the Democratic National Convention last year -- but chose two  years in jail rather than pay.  </P> <P> Fulton County Judge John Bruner had told Terry, leader of the group Operation  Rescue, he would suspend a two-year jail term on condition Terry pay a fine,  stay out of the Atlanta area and not violate Georgia law.  </P> <P> But Terry, 30, told the judge, "In good conscience, I cannot pay the fine." He  contends he committed no crime because he was trying to save unborn children.  </P> <P> "That's entirely up to you, sir," replied the judge.  </P></p>

The worst clash  erupted in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli  soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing youths and wounded 11, Arab reporters  said. The army confirmed that 16 people were wounded in several clashes.  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the president of the European  Parliament, Lord Plumb, that the European Community is siding too much with the  Palestinians to play an active role in any peace process.  </P></p>

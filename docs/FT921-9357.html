			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Collapse of the second Guiness Trial: Strain on Seelig caused concern - The case that brought a city financier close to breakdown IT WAS evidence from two consultant psychiatrists that confirmed Mr Justice Henry's concern - which had been growing since quite early in the trial - about Mr Roger Seelig's ability to continue to defend himself. When he discharged the jury yesterday the judge was at pains to give them a detailed account of the doctors' evidence which, he said, showed that Mr Seelig might do 'something irrevocable' if the trial went on. He said: 'The strains on him have been enormous and have proved too much. His mental condition reached the point where it is no longer possible for him to conduct his defence adequately.' The judge spoke of repeated emotional outbursts from Mr Seelig, including one 'tearful, hysterical outburst' on January 29. He gave jurors a transcript of that occasion which, he said, showed 'a man at the end of his health, bewildered at his loss of control and his inability to think straight, wondering whether his medication rather than his mental state is to blame, recognising that he seems to have gone funny yet insisting that he was all right and could go on.' The court tape recording, which the judge said the jurors could listen to in their room, was 'even more poignant', he told them. The psychiatrists believed, as did the judge, that that 'panic reaction' had been genuine. The psychiatrists also believed that a slight stroke Mr Seelig had in 1990 might be a factor in his difficulty in controlling his emotions. The judge said that last November he had recommended that Mr Seelig seek regular medical help. Mr Seelig had replied that because of carrying out his own defence he was very short of time. 'Prophetically and significantly', Mr Seelig had not wanted to have the trial stopped because of his medical condition. The psychiatrists' opinion was that Mr Seelig was suffering from agitated depression accompanied by high anxiety. The effect had been to render him incapable of sustained concentration and accounted for his lack of mental clarity and impaired judgment and comprehension. Mr Seelig had described himself as feeling 'detached or distant' when not actively involved in cross-examination, and as having difficulty in following what was going on. He had been acutely conscious of the conflict between his desire to continue with the case until verdicts had been reached and his fear of doing himself permanent mental damage if he continued. On February 4 Mr Seelig had told one of the psychiatrists: 'I have come to the end of the bloody road and don't like admitting it. I have tried as best I can but the mountain is too high.' The judge said he had explored with the psychiatrists a number of possibilities to enable Mr Seelig to continue defending himself. They included giving Mr Seelig periodic breaks of up to a month at a time. But one of the psychiatrists had warned that although that might offer Mr Seelig temporary relief there was a risk it would fail and that the additional strain on him 'might lead him to do something irrevocable.' The judge told the jury: 'In these circumstances it seems to me that discharging you from giving verdicts in the case of Mr Seelig is quite inevitable.'</p>

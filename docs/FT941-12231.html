			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / ANC tries to heal mines investment confidence The African National Congress is stepping up its efforts to repair damage to investor confidence in South Africa caused by what it says is misunderstanding by foreign investors and the mining industry of its draft mining policy. While the ANC is determined to see mineral rights fall under state control, it is increasingly concerned that change takes place after consultation with the mining houses, trade unions, and foreign mining companies operating in South Africa. Despite an acrimonious meeting between the ANC and mining industry representatives last week, the organisation and the Chamber of Mines are moving towards a more constructive relationship. The chamber is preparing an official response to the ANC proposals before a meeting tomorrow at which the two sides will draw up guidelines and a timetable for more talks. Mr Paul Jourdan, the organisation's co-ordinator of mineral and energy affairs policy, said yesterday the ANC had no plans to set up a state-run marketing corporation with control over the pricing of South African mining output, and had no intention of expropriating or nationalising mineral rights or mining companies. Clauses in the draft mining policy document referred only to the establishment of a formal minerals auditor to monitor export pricing, a job which the South African Reserve Bank was already doing. Mr Jourdan said research showed that although the mining sector seemed to be one source of irregular capital flight from South Africa through transfer pricing, it was small mining companies rather than the mining houses which were to blame. Mr Jourdan believed the ANC's plan to return mineral rights to the people was in line with general sympathy inside the industry that public ownership was preferable to private. Given the complexity of mineral rights in South Africa, the transfer to the state would be slow, perhaps involving the introduction of a tax on mineral rights with the option of ceding rights to the state in exchange renewable long-term mining leases. 'Reversion should be achieved without impairing the profitability and expansion of all mining companies operating in South Africa,' Mr Jourdan said.</p>

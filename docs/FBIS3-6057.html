			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Pak Tu-sik] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 12 March that the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has made partial changes on its  inspection plan, in which the agency was to begin inspections on  North Korean nuclear facilities on 3 March and finish them  around 14 March. It decided to have some members of the  inspection team remain in North Korea for additional inspections.    Since North Korea postponed inspections on the radioactive  chemical laboratory in Yongbyon, contrary to what it had  promised to the IAEA, and sufficient inspections cannot be  completed by 14 March -- the deadline for scheduled inspections  -- the IAEA decided to extend the schedule and have some members  stay there for one or two more days to inspect the facility. It  has been learned that the IAEA had already made a tentative  agreement with North Korea on the inspection method of the  radioactive chemical laboratory, which is believed to be a  nuclear reprocessing facility. The IAEA plans to have  inspection members, aside from the ones who will stay longer,  return to the IAEA secretariat office in Vienna on 15 March as  scheduled.    A well-informed diplomatic source in Seoul explained: "The  IAEA actually finished inspecting the North Korean nuclear  facilities during the past inspections and is eager to have the  results back at the IAEA headquarters for analysis. Some  members will stay for a more thorough inspection of the last  radioactive chemical laboratory, and all of them will be back by  the middle of next week." Regarding the broken seals, the IAEA  verified the information and accepted North Korea's explanation  that "those were because of careless handling."    The source said: "North Korea intended to test the will of  the ROK and U.S. Governments by deliberately creating obstacles  to the exchange of North and South special envoys; however, the  IAEA appraises that North Korea accepted comparatively easily  the IAEA inspections, which are directly connected with UN  sanctions."</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH IS CAUGHT IN A PENTAGON TIME WARP;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: AFTER THE 'REVOLUTION OF 1989,' IT MAKES NO SENSE TO PUSH FOR CUTS IN  CONVENTIONAL ARMS WHILE BUILDING UP THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL.  </P> <P> There is a time warp in Washington. In his State of the Union Address,  President Bush correctly described the world in 1990: The diminishing Soviet  military threat allows for greater and faster conventional-force reductions in  Europe. Then he reverted to the language and logic of 1983: "We must sustain  our own strategic offense modernization and the Strategic Defense Initiative."  </P> <P> Today's nuclear balance does not justify this policy conflict. While the Soviet  Union and the United States each have different nuclear arsenals, both  countries are grotesquely overarmed. There are 13,000 U.S. strategic weapons  aimed at the Soviet Union; there are nearly 11,000 Soviet missiles aimed at us.  In any nuclear exchange, the war would be over, with both nations destroyed,  long before all existing weapons were detonated.  </P> <P> Why, then, does President Bush call for a continued nuclear-arms race? A look  at the proposed 1991 budget provides the answer.  </P> <P> A listing of the new weapons systems under development or in production reveals  that the Pentagon is still pursuing its strategic dream of nuclear superiority:  five B-2 Stealth bombers; a Trident submarine (the 18th); 52 more Trident II  missiles; 12 rail-mobile MX missiles; development of a new mobile Midgetman  missile; a new aircraft-launched nuclear missile; 100 advanced air-launched  cruise missiles and additional sea-launched cruise missiles; and a 23% increase  in funding for the space-based missile defense program. Cost in 1991: $25  billion to $30 billion.  </P> <P> President Bush justifies this enormous expense by citing the Soviet Union's  continuing modernization of strategic forces. Actually, the Soviets are  tailoring their nuclear forces to square with proposed limits in a future START  agreement, as both Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and CIA Director William H.  Webster have testified. By contrast, the U.S. program is turning out nuclear  arms in excess of these limits. New American tactical systems included in the  budget would create additional layers of unneeded nuclear-fighting  capabilities.  </P> <P> Moreover, an intensive research program involving an array of exotic "third  generation" nuclear weapons is under way. X-ray and optical-frequency laser,  hyper-velocity pellet and electro-magnetic-pulse weapons are being designed and  developed. Maneuvering and earth-penetrating re-entry vehicles are also on the  drawing boards. This research effort, unreported by the President, again  signifies the Pentagon's quest for the kind of technological superiority that  has fueled the nuclear-arms race for 45 years.  </P> <P> These new offensive and defensive weapons will require extensive nuclear  testing before they can become operational. That's why the President has  decided to defer further negotiations with the Soviet Union on test  restrictions once current talks are completed. This will allow the United  States to continue unlimited underground nuclear testing so long as the  150-kiloton limit is not exceeded.  </P> <P> There are political costs to this 1983 mind-set. The Administration's refusal  to consider test restrictions that would prevent development of exotic nuclear  weaponry is a violation of U.S. commitments in two arms-control treaties. In  the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968,  the United States pledged "to continue negotiations" leading to a cessation of  nuclear testing.  </P> <P> Is sustaining the 45-year-old nuclear-arms race the appropriate response to "a  singular moment in history" (to use the President's words)? Beyond question,  Mikhail Gorbachev and his country are on a far different course from that of  even five years ago. To continue their new direction, they must lift the  crushing economic burden of developing ever more nuclear weaponry. The Soviets  temporarily halted nuclear testing in 1985 and are committed to stopping again  when the United States does. They made major concessions to conclude an  intermediate-range missile treaty in 1987; they are willing to do the same to  get a START agreement.  </P> <P> Unless President Bush begins to think in nuclear terms about the changes  created by "the revolution of 1989," it appears that America will waste a  priceless opportunity to reduce the dangers of nuclear war. It makes no sense  to apply the logic of 1990 to conventional weapons while applying that of 1983  to nuclear weapons.  </P></p>

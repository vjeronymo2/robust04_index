			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fenchurch postpones flotation Fenchurch Underwriting Agencies is to postpone the flotation of a new Lloyd's investment trust, confirming earlier indications that the limit of institutional investor interest in the insurance market's plans to introduce corporate capital has been reached. Fenchurch said the Minories Investment Trust would now be launched next year. In the meantime its board, including independent non-executive directors, would remain in position. So far 16 investment and insurance companies have committed more than Pounds 850m to Lloyd's for the 1994 year, increasing capacity to underwrite insurance by at least Pounds 2bn. However, because of a fall-off in investor interest, one investment trust has been scrapped and several others have scaled back their capital raising targets. Fenchurch, which had planned to raise Pounds 35m, said its decision had been taken in 'light of market conditions and the current lack of institutional interest.' Fenchurch stressed that its decision 'not to proceed was taken entirely on the basis of the current lack of institutional appetite for these funds and not because of a lack of quality capacity.' The group's members' agency pooling arrangement or MAPA - a unit trust style arrangement that allows Names to diversify their risks across a large number of syndicates - was recently rated by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, as the best among those investment companies that were either listed or planning a listing.</p>

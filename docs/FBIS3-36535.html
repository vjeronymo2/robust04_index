Worries about Russia's relations with the Baltic states and  other former Soviet republics took center stage at a two-day  meeting on strategic and military issues where William Perry  made his international debut as U.S. defense secretary. Perry  sat between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the German Defense  Minister, Volker Ruehe, at the gathering of defense ministers,  politicians, officers and defense experts, which he was to  address Sunday.    Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, was quoted last  month as saying Russia should keep troops in former Soviet  republics to protect its vital interests. Many people worry  that the Russian Government, under pressure from  ultranationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovksiy, could start  bullying the new countries of the former Soviet bloc to get its  way.    William S. Cohen, a Republican senator from Maine, thinks  this is starting to happen already. "We have to keep a very  close eye on what the Russian military is up to," Cohen said.  "They have been engaged in a protectionist racket by bringing  governments to their knees and rushing in with aid, provided  they join the Commonwealth of Independent states, which is under  the protection of Russia," Cohen said.    Malcolm Rifkind, the British defense secretary, said NATO's  immediate priority must be to agree on a strategy for dealing  with any attempt by Russia to "regain hegemony" in areas of the  former Soviet Union. "One not only hears from the  Zhirinovskiys" the demand for greater Russian influence, he  said. "One hears it also from those who speak in much more  measured tones." Kozyrev has "made speeches of that kind,"  Rifkind said.    Kohl said the West must avoid doing anything that would make  Russia feel internationally isolated, since that could  jeopardize efforts by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to make  greater strides in democratic and economic reforms. He said  Yeltsin had written him recently to assure that he "will not  listen" to those who call for renewed Russian expansionism. But  it's unclear whether Yeltsin can withstand nationalist  pressures, Kohl indicated. He cautioned Russia not to act  aggressively against the former Soviet republics: "We expect  Russia to continue a foreign policy marked by constructive  participation in solving international problems."    The German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, issued a blunter  statement in a speech Friday night in Bonn. He demanded Russia  respect its borders and said the Russians could expect a cutoff  of aid if they stopped economic reforms.    Kinkel demanded the full pullout of Russian troops from  Latvia and Estonia by the end of August and upbraided Russian  leaders for using the term "near abroad" to describe the former  Soviet republics. "It implies an inferior status for Russia's  neighbors that is not acceptable," Kinkel said. The term is  commonly used by Russian politicians and newspapers. Kinkel  said the resignations of Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar and Finance  Minister Boris Fedorov last month "threaten to destroy trust" in  Russia's economic future, as reflected in large-scale capital  flight. "If Russia's economic policy can't even keep Russian  capital in the country, how can Russia expect inflows of foreign  capital?" Kinkel said.    Germany has provided 90 billion marks (about dlrs 52  billion)  over the past five years to Russia, more than half of all  Western contributions. "There won't be more money for less  reform," he said.</p>

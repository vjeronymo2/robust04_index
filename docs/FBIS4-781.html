			<p>BFN     [Text] The AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has  confirmed that Zulus are being trained on the farm of Mr. Eugene  Terreblanche at Ventersdorp in the Western Transvaal. This  follows an eyewitness report from the ANC that at least one  busload of Zulus had been seen arriving at the farm of the AWB  leader. Earlier Mr. Terreblanche told a newspaper that he was  providing training for what he termed nonwhites who were opposed  to communism. Mr. Fred Rundell of the AWB confirmed the reports  but would not say if the Zulus were members of the IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] or if the training enjoyed the support of the  Zulu king.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Malaysia in row with BBC: News service withdrawn after item is dropped Malaysia, which in late February imposed a ban on giving government contracts to British companies following unflattering reports about the country and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in the British press, has now become involved in an argument with the BBC about its TV news broadcasts. Satellite transmissions are illegal in Malaysia but since the beginning of March the BBC has been supplying Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM), the local state run broadcasting service, with a daily news programme. Last weekend the BBC withdrew the service, saying RTM had broken agreements that its news bulletins be run in full and not censored. At issue is an RTM decision to drop a BBC news item which showed recent labour unrest involving thousands of people in the Indonesian island of Sumatra. An official at Malaysia's information ministry said the item had been dropped so as not to jeopardise relations with Indonesia and accused the BBC of 'blatantly disregarding Asian sensitivities'. In place of the BBC news programme viewers will now watch American wrestling.</p>

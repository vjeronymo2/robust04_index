			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: Struggle of the sexes - The Berghaus treatment of 'Ariane' in Paris MONDAY evening at the Chatelet had all the hallmarks of a classic Paris opening-night scandale: end-of-act thunderclaps of booing interspersed with equally forceful cheers, with the booers eventually triumphant during the final curtain calls. To the critic of Le Figaro the whole show was 'parfaitement detestable'; to the Cassandras in the audience who believe that opera as a theatrical medium is being ruined by the excesses of the modern producer, the evening will have supplied plenty of confirmatory evidence. The opera chosen for revival was Dukas's Ariane et Barbe-bleue. It is one of the key items in the French-music cycle that is the principal preoccupation of the season's musical programme at the Chatelet, since it is an early-20th-century French landmark - much loved by its devotees, a semi-rarity in the last few decades (not staged in Paris for 16 years), recently re-discovered in Amsterdam, Geneva and Leeds. But the choice of production team for the revival seemed to guarantee controversy, being headed by Ruth Berghaus, actress, choreographer, widow of the composer Dessau, veteran of the Berliner Ensemble, and exponent since the 1970s of a mode of psycho-surrealist opera production that all over Europe has won her fanatical admirers and detractors in equal proportion. (In Britain we know her work only from the 1984 Welsh National Don Giovanni.) For her an opera's text is a blank canvas: she creates on stage the associations that it summons into her head, not the events invented by the librettist and set by the composer. Ariane, whose allegorical narrative Maeterlinck placed in the depths of an ancient castle penetrated by the determination of its light-bringing heroine, is here a Freudian fantasy set (by designers Hans-Dieter Schaal and Marie-Luise Strandt) among the roof-tops - all dream-world white - of a modern city, Paris presumably. The action takes place on, beside and around chimneys, roof doorways, staircases, gutters; at those points in Act 1 when Ariadne (in huge frizzed wig and Nehru suit) and the Nurse (dressed, according to Le Figaro, 'en mauvais garcon', in tights and bowler) uncover the secrets of the locked doors, apertures fly open and dancers in coloured tights wriggle out. The connection between the opera's leading role and the Ariadne of Greek mythology is forged by a line of trailing cord, at times electrified like the lights on a Christmas tree. Bluebeard in a natty three-piece arrives stage right on a huge speedboat, the wives ensconced within like chattels; this is a moment of enormous theatrical frisson. In Act 3, when the women have temporarily freed themselves, we find this symbol of male potency laid on its side - but at the end, as they opt to return to Bluebeard and familiar servitude rather than departing with Ariadne to follow a life of feminist freedom, the wives crawl back into the boat, and Ariadne and the Nurse march off to explore horizons, and rooftops, new. In short, and leaving undescribed a thousand fascinating production details, Dukas's and Maeterlinck's opera is here mined for its 'deep structure'; and it is this - the symbolic struggle of male and female - that we see staged at the Chatelet, filtered through the Berghaus subconscious. I found it all wonderfully rich and substantial, magically beautiful to look at, endlessly absorbing: even where I failed to catch the significance of this or that moment, I was swept along by Berghaus's immense powers of stagecraft, and by the feeling I had that this was, however maddening, a serious enterprise, deeply considered, by no means either 'fashionable' or intentionally iconoclastic. There is, of course, much to be said against it. Berghaus's is a dangerously in-group method of opera-staging. You might almost call it meta-production: you need to have the libretto under your belt in advance, not to mention your well-sharpened tools of Freudian dream-interpretation, otherwise you get left very much on the peripheries of the theatrical unfolding. This Ariane was not an integration of words and music, not a unification of pit and stage; the ineluctable build-up and achievement of climaxes that Opera North audiences will have learnt to regard as one of the work's prime glories was not to be had here. Even though after a lumpy first act the Orchestre Philharmonique (and, hidden from view, the Choeur) de Radio France performed extremely well under Eliahu Inbal, the music and the staging seemed discrete entities, to be experienced as it were on different artistic planes. Directness of verbal communication from the lips of the singers was not the first source of revelation. As it happens, the opera was most eloquently and - apart from the rich-toned but word-muffled Nurse of Nadine Denize - clearly sung. Gabriel Bacquier was, as one might expect, effortlessly authoritative with Bluebeard's few lines; the wives, led by the Selysette of the excellent mezzo Hanna Schaer, were well contrasted. The opera's leading role was taken by the new white hope of French opera, Francoise Pollet. She was perhaps ill-advised to tackle this Everest of French dramatic-soprano roles, being soft-grained in her timbre and sometimes strained at climaxes; but her musical manner and delivery are so ravishingly fresh and responsive that I was glad she had done, and full of admiration for her willingness to appear in so unflattering a garb and head-dress. Indeed, she and all the cast gave the impression of full commitment to Berghaus. This is not the way I want to encounter Ariane in particular, or opera in general, very often; on its own terms it was unforgettable.</p>

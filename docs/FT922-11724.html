			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / World Trade News: Prospects fair for east-west trade bridge  -Leipzig Fair is finding a new role after the collapse of the Soviet bloc DR CORNELIA Wohlfarth, appointed last August as managing director of the Leipzig Trade Fair, is offering no hostages to fortune. 'This is the year after zero. I'm not offering any predictions for the future,' she says. 'There are not the masses here that were here before, but that means nothing because many of those who used to come from the Eastern bloc were just getting away from their dreary lives, enjoying a rare opportunity to taste the consumer goods of the west.' Dr Wohlfarth, who left the world of publishing at the age of 47 to head what used to be called 'the mother of all fairs', has good reason to be unclear about the future: 11 of this year's 26 fairs have never been mounted before; many are exhibiting for the first time; and with the economies of eastern and central Europe in turmoil, it is no mean task to pinpoint what market the fair should be aiming for. She can nevertheless be cautiously sanguine about long-term prospects. The 830-year-old fair is at the heart of the economy of both Leipzig, and the Lander of Saxony of which it is capital. Traditional fairs such as the Fashion fair and the Jewellery fair have grown this year despite turmoil in the east: each attracted over 20 per cent more visitors this year than in 1991. With the federal government pouring up to DM200bn (Pounds 68bn) a year into the east, it is unlikely to lack financial and strategic support. Bonn has granted DM300m for modernisation, while the municipal government has provided land for a new technical fair site to open in 1995. Already, there is an air of hope in the city: many buildings are being refurbished; the air is clearer following the closure of many of the dirty, loss-making heavy factories; free enterprise has brought colourful street stalls selling everything from socks to potted pansies; pizza bars stay open until midnight. Dr Wohlfarth has a clear strategy: 'We should try to develop an identity of our own. The fair is part of the regeneration of the east, she says. 'The aim is to offer fairs that solve problems - not just the usual product exhibition halls, but workshops, seminars, congresses and a contact centre. 'But without hotels, there is nothing we can do in this direction yet: at present we are providing a preview of what the future will offer.' One thousand extra visitor beds are being provided by renovating houses in the city centre. But eight new international hotels will be open by 1995. Her critical task is to provide focus for Leipzig fairs of the future. The universal spring and autumn fairs that used to provide the west with a business link to the former Soviet bloc are as much a part of history as the bust of Lenin outside the Soviet pavilion at the fair site. In the long term, Leipzig's comparative advantage is likely to be its strategic location between west and central Europe, but with the economies of central Europe in disarray, short-term focus is on the needs of Saxony and other neighbouring eastern Lander. 'It may be 15 or 20 years before eastern Germany has the same quality of life as the west, but business will be going on: there is so much catching up to do. There will be business openings in the reconstruction of the area, so fairs will focus on the environment, transport, and construction sectors,' she forecasts. So in March Leipzig mounted Terratec, a fair for environmental engineering and environmental protection, and Translogo, a fair on traffic engineering. In autumn, fairs on building engineering equipment and on the construction trade are among those aimed at rebuilding the region's economy. But long-term plans focus on Leipzig's role as a springboard to east and central Europe. Dr Wohlfarth aims not only to attract exhibitors from the west looking to markets in the east, but also to bring managers from the east to Leipzig to attend workshops on international trade, marketing, and funding: 'We will help to train them to find their way through the market systems of the west that are so new to them,' she says. 'It will take a long time before the former Soviet Union is able to build its own effective links with western companies, but by then we will have established ourselves. In the end, it will not be the size of the fairs that will count, but the quality,' she adds. An East-West Contact centre is planned, with an aim that at least half the exhibitors should come from eastern Germany or eastern Europe. To pave the way, the fair has appointed representatives in Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, Vilnius, Moscow and St Petersburg. Representatives are about to be appointed in Minsk and Kiev. To give them added clout, they will represent not just the Leipzig Fair, but also Saxony.</p>

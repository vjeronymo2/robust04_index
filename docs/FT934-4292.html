			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / The curse of Gyllenhammar: Kevin Done and John Ridding sift through the wreckage of the failed merger between Renault and Volvo Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar is leaving Volvo for the wilderness like a baleful Old Testament prophet cursing his people. Left in isolation by his shareholders and his senior management, he is prophesying only the apocalypse for his abandoned flock. The Volvo organisation is 'crushed', the company 'wounded'. The critics of his vision are guilty of 'turning their backs on Europe and the world' and have 'reduced the probability of Volvo's long-term survival'. The rejection of a full merger of Renault and Volvo's automotive operations was also a rejection of all that had been achieved in the last three years of alliance between the Swedish and French automakers, he claimed. In his most damning imprecation Mr Gyllenhammar warned: 'The alliance will not remain. It will be dismantled by a Renault management which has lost its confidence in Volvo. To dissolve the alliance will require time, energy and will be demoralising.' Yesterday Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault and the man who shared Mr Gyllenhammar's vision for building Europe's second-largest vehicle maker, was understandably more cautious. 'The industrial agreement signed with Volvo in 1990 remains in force. It is not threatened by the failure of the merger,' he insisted. 'But the dynamism has been lost. We have to look with sangfroid at what we do now. We will examine our projects on a case by case basis.' In reality the choices facing Mr Schweitzer - and Mr Gyllenhammar's successors at Volvo - are bleak. The challenges and threats in the fiercely competitive global automotive industry, which first encouraged the two companies to look at merger as a road to survival in the next century, remain. The world's car and commercial vehicle makers are haunted by overcapacity, minimal growth in demand, continuous upward pressure on product development costs, increasing price competition, and the need to overhaul radically their components and materials supplier bases in order to reduce components costs. To make matters worse, the auto industry is still caught in the worst recession in Europe and Japan of the postwar era. Much of the industry is in loss, and those parts still in profit are scarcely making enough money to support the demands for ever increasing investment. Instead of confronting these external threats Renault and Volvo must now turn aside and use invaluable management time and resources to unpick their relationship. Outright merger had always been the only logical conclusion of the far-reaching alliance announced by the two companies in 1990 and formalised with an exchange of large minority cross shareholdings at the beginning of 1991. The two companies must now examine what can be saved from their collaborative projects, and assess which activities have been rendered impossible by the breakdown of trust between the organisations, and which areas may lend themselves to collaboration with other rivals. Some joint activities will still make sense outside the remit of a full merger. The world auto industry is a complicated square dance in which the big players co-operate in some regional markets of the world and compete in others. The exchange of major components such as engines and gearboxes is becoming increasingly common. Renault already supplies engines and transmissions for the Volvo 400 series. Projects such as this will probably survive. In doubt, however, will be the future of the ambitious plans that had been put into place in preparation for full merger. These include the establishment of common operations for purchasing and quality, the merger of car marketing and sales organisations in big markets such as Germany, and the creation of single project teams for the development of new model ranges, such as the joint executive car planned for the end of the decade to replace the Volvo 800/900 series and the Renault Safrane. If a full divorce occurs, it would leave the Volvo car operations looking particularly exposed. Mr John Longhurst, automotive analyst for UBS, warned that Volvo's shareholders had won 'a hollow victory' by stopping the merger. 'Volvo Car will ultimately wither in the absence of the economies of scale that would only have come from a full merger.' The development without a partner of the Volvo 850, the Swedish carmaker's latest new car project, had almost 'broken' Volvo's car division, said Mr Longhurst. 'Its replacement could finish the job.' Most industry observers believe that Renault remains in a relatively healthy position without the merger. 'Volvo needed this merger much more than Renault,' said one automobile industry analyst in London. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, is confident that the car group can remain profitable throughout the worst downturn in the world automobile industry. New products are also on the way. At the beginning of next year Renault will introduce the Laguna to replace the Renault 21. A replacement for the Renault 19 is also due by 1995. But the collapse of the merger is still a blow. Renault and Volvo predicted cost savings of more than FFr30bn (Pounds 3.4bn) by 2000 as a result of economies of scale in production, combined R&amp;D efforts and joint purchasing programmes. Renault was also aiming to capitalise on Volvo's strength in upper-range cars and safety technology. From Renault's perspective, the merger was particularly important in commercial vehicles, where Volvo is stronger. 'In the trucks sector, now more than ever you have size problems,' said Mr Schweitzer. 'R&amp;D costs are growing rapidly and these are the kind of costs saved by a merger.' It seems inevitable that the process of picking up the pieces will take place in a mood of bitterness. Renault said it 'deplored' Volvo's failure to ratify the merger. 'This is an unpredictable partner,' said Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister. 'It is a missed opportunity for European industry.' Most troubling for Mr Schweitzer is the state of limbo in which the group finds itself. 'The alliance with Volvo was meant to lead to a merger and synergies between the two groups,' said one industry observer. 'Instead Renault now finds itself with an albatross around its neck.' Mr Schweitzer has consistently maintained that, without a merger, the existing co-operation would be jeopardised. 'It has always been a two-stage process,' he says. 'Co-operation has worked because we were heading towards a common goal of the merger.' For the French government, the accord was regarded as a vital step before the privatisation of its automobile group, one of the most attractive assets on the list of 21 publicly owned groups slated for sale over the next five years. Resolving the status of the alliance, and in particular the cross shareholdings, will be crucial to the privatisation. In January 1991, Volvo took 20 per cent of the shares in Renault and 45 per cent of the shares in its trucks and buses division. Renault took 25 per cent of the shares in Volvo's car operations, 45 per cent of its truck activities and about 10 per cent of the voting capital in the parent company. The French government said the failure of the merger did not affect its intention to privatise the car group, but it could hardly do so soon. 'For one thing, who would buy shares when the situation is so chaotic?' asked one merchant banker in Paris. 'Second, the French government must be nervous about the prospect of having Volvo so prominent in the share register after everything that has happened.' The result is likely to be a delay in Renault's privatisation, which may be welcomed by the government. 'It may now be able to wait for conditions in the automobile market to improve to maximise its revenues,' said Mr Philippe Barrier, automobile analyst at Societe Generale, the financial group. But the state of the car market is hardly the priority for either Renault or Volvo. Business-as-usual must take a back seat as they struggle to emerge from the wreckage of the failed merger, with Mr Gyllenhammar's prophecies ringing in their ears.</p>

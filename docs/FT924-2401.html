			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures traded in a tight range on the last day of the underlying equity account, as technical trading ahead of next week's expiry of the December FT-SE Index contract brought improved turnover in futures, writes Joel Kibazo. A poor opening on the December FT-SE contract brought selling, sending the contract to the day's low of 2,718, and hit the cash market. A leading US house was a big buyer of gilts after the release of inflation figures, and this encouraged renewed buying interest of the December contract. It rose to the day's high of 2,738 ahead of lunch before trading in a narrow range of 2,725, and 2,735 for the rest of the session. Once again dealers reported good roll-over from the December contract into March. December closed at 2,727, nine points above estimated fair value premium and about four above cash. Turnover was a healthy 11,582 lots. Traded options were dull, with turnover reaching only 20,271 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option a mere 6,346.</p>

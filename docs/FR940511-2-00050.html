(KNGG), P.O. Box 281304, Lakewood, Colorado 80228&hyph;8304, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94&hyph;397&hyph;000, requesting that the Commission declare that facilities to be acquired from its affiliate, K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co. (KNI), are gathering facilities exempt from Commission jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KNGG states that it has agreed to purchase from KNI the Bowdoin Gathering System located in Phillips and Valley Counties, Montana. KNGG states that the Bowdoin facilities are separated into four distinct segments delivering gas into the facilities of Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. (Williston). It is indicated that none of the facilities is attached to the rest of KNI's system. It is also indicated that KNI has sought authorization to abandon these facilities in Docket No. CP94&hyph;430&hyph;000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KNGG states that, by applying the modified primary function test as set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amerada Hess, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  52 FERC &para; 61,268 (1990), the facilities to be acquired from KNI qualify as gathering facilities exempt from Commission jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. In support of its claim that the facilities are gathering, KNGG indicates that the subject facilities are short in length, small in diameter, web-like in configuration, and located entirely within the production area. It is also indicated that the facilities operate at a range of between 100 and 180 psig and are attached to approximately 700 wells throughout the system. KNGG also states that the gas gathered in the system is delivered into four small field compressors which boost the pressure of the gas sufficiently to enter Williston's facilities. In addition, KNGG states that the dehydration plants located in the system perform dehydration required to meet Williston's quality requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> May 24, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

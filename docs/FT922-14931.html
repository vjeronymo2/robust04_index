			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Tighter rules for foreign banks in US THE FEDERAL Reserve Board, acting to tighten regulations in order to prevent another scandal similar to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) affair, yesterday put into effect a series of tough new rules to govern foreign banks operating in the US. The new rules, which will require a foreign bank to prove to the Federal Reserve that it is subject to comprehensive supervision by a regulator in its home country, stem from the passage last December of the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act, part of the banking reform legislation approved by the Congress. A spokesman for the Fed said the new rules were proposed last year to correct regulatory gaps that became evident as a result of two banking scandals. These were the BCCI affair - where the Abu Dhabi-owned bank engaged in fraud in the US - and the separate scandal about the making of more than Dollars 4bn of improper Iraqi loans by the Atlanta, Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. The rules give the Fed the authority - for the first time - to decide which foreign banks can set up branches and representative offices in the US. During 60 days from today, the Fed will receive comments on the rules but the regulations take effect immediately and are unlikely to be changed in any substantial way. Specific provisions call for any foreign bank entering the US market to prove to the Fed the extent to which its home country central bank is assured it has adequate procedures for monitoring international banking activities. The rules also require home-country supervisors to monitor relations among foreign bank affiliates in the US and to receive regular consolidated financial reports that permit analysis of the bank world-wide.</p>

EPA, therefore, took no official action on that regulation on August 28, 1975, when the other regulations were approved, pending the conclusion of additional studies. Consequently, the State's process weight and general opacity regulations remained the only federally approved regulation for coke oven pushing emissions. On April 4, 1979, EPA approved coke oven plan revisions submitted on July 14, 1978, to attain the national standards for particulate matter. These regulations were later relaxed to the 1975 version.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither of the two regulatory approaches heretofore described contained specific regulations to limit fugitive particulate emissions from road dust, parking lots, storage piles, etc. However, these nontraditional fugitive emissions are now subject to limitations by permit condition and by the terms of today's final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 3, 1978, in accordance with section 107(d) of the CAA, EPA designated the area surrounding the Gulf States Steel Corporation facility in Etowah County, Alabama, as nonattainment for total suspended particulates (TSP). Gulf States Steel Corporation remained the dominant major point source contributing to the particulate nonattainment problem in Etowah County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 172 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires that plan revisions assuring the attainment of the NAAQS for particulate matter are to provide for the implementation of reasonably available control technology (RACT) as expeditiously as practicable. In response to the section 107(d) nonattainment designation and call for a particulate SIP revision for Etowah and Jefferson Counties, Alabama revised its coke oven pushing and charging regulations to require a RACT level of control. These regulations were directed specifically to Jefferson and Etowah Counties and were federally approved on April 4, 1979. These regulations, however, were never implemented due to legal challenges to the section 107 redesignation process. On procedural grounds, Republic Steel and U.S. Steel challenged the validity of EPA's March 3, 1978, designation of portions of Jefferson and Etowah Counties as nonattainment areas for TSP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 3, 1979, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals (now the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals) in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Republic Steel vs. EPA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. Steel vs. EPA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> found that EPA had not adequately complied with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act in its nonattainment designation action, and directed EPA to initiate the designation process again. On June 10, 1980, EPA again designated Etowah County as primary nonattainment for TSP and directed the State to submit a SIP revision. U.S. Steel and Republic Steel did not appeal this designation of nonattainment by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

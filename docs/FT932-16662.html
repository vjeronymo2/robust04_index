			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Funding warning over rail sell-off THE Bow Group, a Conservative think-tank, is warning that the government could face 'a second coal crisis' over its rail privatisation plans unless imbalances between rail and road transport are addressed, Richard Tomkins writes. Failure to put the financing of railways and roads on a similar footing will mean that many lines will be unable to compete with roads and will close. It says: 'The parallels with the rigged market in electricity and its impact on demand for coal are striking.' Railway freight and passenger traffic is being lost to the roads because road users are not required to pay their full costs. Levelling the Tracks. Bow Group, 92 Bishop's Bridge Road, London W2 5AB. Pounds 20.</p>

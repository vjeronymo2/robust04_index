			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: HK investors buy into Westcoast Petroleum FIVE wealthy Hong Kong investors are taking a substantial stake in western Canada's oil and gas industry by buying Westcoast Petroleum, a subsidiary of Westcoast Energy of Vancouver. The Hong Kong consortium will pay CDollars 247.5m (USDollars 196.4m) for Westcoast, which has been seeking extra capital for some time to finance exploration programmes in western Canada, as well as Libya and Indonesia. The buying group is led by Mr Cheng Yu-Tung, chairman of New World Development, Mr Stanley Ho who heads Shun Tak Holdings, and Mr Lee Shau Kee, chairman of Henderson Land Development. Canada has been one of the main beneficiaries of the flight of capital from Hong Kong ahead of the colony's 1997 handover to China. The Westcoast purchasers are following in the footsteps of Mr Li Ka-shing, who controls Husky Oil, one of Canada's biggest independent oil and gas producers. Husky has incurred sizeable losses in recent years however, and has been a heavy burden on Mr Li's Hong Kong companies. Mr Stephen Letwin, Westcoast's chief financial officer, noted yesterday that his company was smaller than Husky and more focused on upstream exploration and production. 'We think these investors are going to be more than pleased with what they get,' Mr Letwin said. Westcoast, which is based in Calgary and classified as a mid-sized producer, suffered a CDollars 5.7m loss in the first nine months of 1992 on operating revenues of CDollars 82m. The setback was due largely to lower natural gas prices, which have staged a recovery in recent months. Westcoast Energy was due to release its annual financial results late yesterday. Westcoast Petroleum produced an average of 14,400 barrels of oil and 76m cu ft of gas a day last year. Westcoast Energy is selling the oil and gas division to concentrate on natural gas distribution following its CDollars 600m purchase last year of Union Energy, an Ontario gas company. Proceeds from the disposal will be used to reduce borrowings used to finance the Union acquisition. Westcoast is also planning an equity issue.</p>

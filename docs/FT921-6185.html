			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major attacks opposition stance on tax - Prime Minister's Questions THE PRIME MINISTER stoked up the electioneering atmosphere yesterday by again warning that Labour would increase taxation, and suggesting that the Liberal Democrats also were in favour of such a policy. As expectations of a tax-cutting Budget on March 10 were given further impetus, Labour backbenchers renewed their charges that the government was planning to use 'election bribes'. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, repeated the charge that Mr Major was on record as having said that a promise to cut taxes and increase public expenditure was 'dishonest and absurd'. To government cheers Mr Major retorted: 'It is quite staggering how terrified you and your party are of tax cuts - they still think they are immoral.' He stressed that Labour MPs had opposed every tax cut introduced by the Conservatives since 1979, and that they were now threatening to reimpose any tax cuts introduced in the Budget. Mr Kinnock said Mr Major was head of a government which had imposed the biggest tax burden in British history. Mr Bernard Weatherill, the speaker, rebuked Conservative backbenchers for what Mr Kinnock described as 'deliberate disruption'. Persisting with his attack, Mr Kinnock said the prime minister had promised to increase public expenditure, cut taxes and balance the budget. 'Your promises do not add up,' he declared. The prime minister emphasised that Conservative ministers had cut taxes and raised public expenditure in the 1980s. 'Before you start giving lectures on borrowing get your facts right,' he told Mr Kinnock. Mr Major faced a further barrage of criticism from Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who said industry was burdened with debt and Britain's trade deficit was at the highest level for a year. Mr Ashdown called on the prime minister to explain 'why tax cuts, which will suck in more imports, are right - whereas public investment in the kind of things Britain needs for the future are wrong'. Mr Major contrasted Mr Ashdown's view with the policy of the old Liberal party when it 'trusted people with their own money and believed they could make their own decisions'. He urged the whole country to note that 'yet again the Liberal party was aligning itself, on social and taxation matters, with the Labour party'. An early increase in consumer demand was envisaged by Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, opening a debate on Welsh affairs. Acknowledging that Hoover and Hotpoint had suffered along with others in the 'white goods' sector from the downturn in consumer spending, he said: 'I very much hope that is a short-term problem.'</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Salomon sees deficit of Dollars 30m in fourth quarter US SECURITIES house Salomon announced yesterday that it expected to report a Dollars 30m after-tax loss for the fourth quarter of 1991. The warning surprised brokerage analysts on Wall Street, who had expected the company to record healthy profits in the wake of lower US interest rates and vibrant domestic financial markets. Salomon said in a brief statement that the fourth-quarter loss would reduce after-tax earnings for the full year to about Dollars 500m, a figure which includes the Dollars 200m charge the company took in the third quarter to cover potential costs and fines arising from its illegal activities in the US Treasury markets. The loss in the last three months of 1991 was partly due to a one-off Dollars 60m charge taken by Salomon's oil subsidiary, Phibro Energy. The charge, which will leave Phibro with a loss of Dollars 60m for the quarter and a small profit for the year of Dollars 43m, was taken to reflect the reduction in the value of the company's oil refining and marketing inventories, caused by the worldwide decline in petroleum and petroleum product prices. Although the Phibro charge partly explained why the Salomon group incurred a loss in the fourth quarter, analysts remained puzzled by the forecast of a disappointing contribution from the Salomon Brothers securities operation, which the company said would make a 'modest' profit in the fourth quarter. Salomon offered no explanation why its securities business did not shine in a quarter when US interest rates were falling and bond prices were rising. As Wall Street's premier bond trading house, Salomon would normally be expected to have profited hugely from the favourable interest rate environment and the heavy trading volume in Treasury markets. Industry observers suggested several possible reasons for Salomon Brothers' modest quarter. The sale of Dollars 50bn in assets that Salomon undertook in the second half of the year to stave off liquidity problems in the wake of the Treasury market scandal will undoubtedly have reduced the firm's earnings from interest and capital appreciation. The scandal also led to the loss of some customer business and forced the firm into a radical restructuring, which are likely to have reduced revenues and pushed up costs, particularly those related to the shedding of more than 130 jobs in US and European operations.</p>

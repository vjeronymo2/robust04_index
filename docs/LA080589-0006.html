			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOON FOR WILD RIVERS  </P> <P> With barely a ripple compared to past save-the-river battles, California has  added two streams to the state wild and scenic river system and protected a  third from being plugged with any dams. These are the first additions to the  state system since it was created in 1972 to protect the Eel, the Trinity and  the Klamath rivers on the state's north coast.  </P> <P> Newly protected under legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher  (D-Palo Alto) are 10 miles of the East Carson River in Alpine County, 38 miles  of the West Walker in Mono County -- both along the eastern Sierra -- and 53  miles of the McCloud River and its tributaries in Siskiyou and Shasta counties  in Northern California. While the McCloud was not accorded complete wild and  scenic status, it is protected from dam construction. Landowners along the  McCloud opposed full state protection because of a fear it would lead to  federal wild-river designation and potential land condemnation, although that  has not been federal practice. But even the ban on dams on this fine trout  stream is a major achievement.  </P> <P> The Sher bill did not sail through the Legislature without any challenge,  although the measure passed the Assembly on a vote of 60 to 0 and the Senate 21  to 1. The state Resources Agency had wanted a provision to allow a 12-year  study period for possible dams on the East Fork of the Carson. There long has  been discussion in Nevada of a structure that would back up a reservoir into  California and flood a stretch that is popular with rafters. But the study  provision was removed from the bill after Alpine County supervisors decided a  free-flowing river was more important to their recreation and tourism  businesses.  </P> <P> The bill was the outgrowth of a two-year Resources Agency study mandated by the  Legislature. The agency supported the legislation even though the Nevada dam  provision was deleted, and Gov. George Deukmejian signed the measure into law.  The legislation is one of the most important environmental initiatives to come  from the state Administration, and was a pleasant surprise to environmental  groups. Both the governor and Legislature deserve credit for this welcome and  significant contribution to California's limited inventory of wild and free  rivers.  </P></p>

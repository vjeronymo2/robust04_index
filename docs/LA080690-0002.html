			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADIATION FOR THE AVERAGE LANDFILL;  </P> <P> NUCLEAR WASTE: DEREGULATION BY THE NRC COULD OPEN VIRTUALLY EVERY AMERICAN SITE  TO LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL.  </P> <P> Apparently buoyed by the success of the deregulated savings and loan industry,  the Bush Administration has just opened the door to deregulation of nuclear  waste. This policy is not only potentially threatening to the public health,  but it is unnecessary.  </P> <P> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has announced that it will allow disposal of  some "low-level" nuclear waste along with common household garbage in ordinary  landfills. This defies common sense. It also represents a historic and  unwarranted reversal of current policy, which requires the use of licensed  low-level radioactive waste sites.  </P> <P> The NRC commissioners who proposed the change argue that deregulating low-level  nuclear waste will free the agency's overworked staff to better regulate "real  problems," such as more dangerous radioactive waste and nuclear plant  operations.  </P> <P> But instead of receding from its responsibilities, the NRC should better  utilize its ample resources to regulate the nuclear industry. Given the already  low credibility of the industry, discarding the NRC's responsibility to monitor  low-level radioactive waste will further undermine its image.  </P> <P> The NRC policy is in conflict with the opinions of many scientists, who believe  that low-level radiation may pose a greater threat to public health than  originally thought.  </P> <P> In June, the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommended  that radiation-exposure limits for workers be cut by more than 50%. And in  December, 1989, a panel of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences  concluded that the risk of developing cancer after exposure to low levels of  radiation is three to four times higher than previously believed.  </P> <P> The new NRC policy would permit an unlimited number of exemptions as long as  the total exposure to an individual from all exemptions is less than 100  millirems per year. Deregulating low-level nuclear waste could increase  exposure to radiation by as much as 25% for some people. The NRC argues that  the increased exposure is acceptable because it is smaller than the 360  millirems that the average American receives every year from background  radiation and radon gas. The NRC neglects to mention that radon exposure alone  causes lung cancer in up to 20,000 Americans every year.  </P> <P> Supporters of the NRC policy argue that deregulating nuclear waste would reduce  the American nuclear industry's radioactive waste disposal bill by as much as  $35 million per year by exempting up to one-third of the radioactive wastes  from nuclear plants from current regulation.  </P> <P> But is it rational to turn virtually every landfill in the country into a  potential, unregulated radioactive waste dump to save money? And even if there  is some level at which radioactive waste is not hazardous, it would be very  difficult to ensure that unscrupulous operators do not try to save even more  money by putting extremely dangerous waste in the local dump rather than in a  licensed repository. The policy is also troublesome because it could exempt a  large volume of presently hazardous waste from cleanup at radiation sites, like  decommissioned nuclear plants.  </P> <P> Even more disturbing, the NRC deregulation policy would permit higher radiation  exposure than similar policies proposed by our Environmental Protection Agency,  Great Britain, Canada, Japan and Finland. The NRC policy is also inconsistent  with recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the National  Council on Radiation Protection. Furthermore, the NRC is pursuing this policy  over the objections of its own experts.  </P> <P> As further justification, the NRC points to similar exemptions allowed for  medical technologies, such as X-rays. But the NRC fails to understand that the  public supports the use of radiation for medical purposes because it saves  lives. There is no such benefit from the deregulation of nuclear waste, In  fact, the policy could cause additional cancer deaths.  </P> <P> Already, a number of states and locales have passed laws banning the disposal  of radioactive waste in ordinary landfills. It seems likely that more  communities will pass such restrictions if the NRC continues to insist on its  nuclear-deregulation effort despite the hostility of the public and the  skepticism of industry. Unfortunately, under current law, the NRC has the power  to force states to accept its policy.  </P> <P> If the NRC continues to pursue this misguided policy, Congress should, at a  minimum, remove the NRC's authority to impose it on the states.  </P></p>

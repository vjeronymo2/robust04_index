			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (8): Government offices head the list - Some of the principal occupants and their requirements Ambitious plans in the 1980s for decentralising ministries to high-unemployment areas sent shivers through the property market. Government bodies occupy around a third of all West End offices. They also tend to have the biggest buildings - which can be the hardest to re-let. Further threats came from the Next Steps programme, aimed at forcing semi-privatised departments to cut costs - particularly rents. But Armageddon has failed to arrive. In fact, government take-up is running at similar levels to a decade ago. The private sector appears just as reluctant to decamp. When Herring Baker Harris (HBH) polled six major sectors forming around a quarter of tenants, all but one insisted that a West End address was essential. They all had different reasons; retailers and foreign banks cited need to be close to clients, while oil and advertising companies voted mainly for ease of communications. Management consultants put both these factors on a par with access to skilled labour. Having a presence is less important than how much space each will take in the future, however. And that rests on even more complex factors affecting each sector. Government is obviously the most crucial player, particularly in Victoria where it accounted for more than 40 per cent of take-up in the last decade, says HBH. A single decision helped give the local market an edge of respectability in the last 12 months. The Cabinet decided not to relocate two major departments to Canary Wharf when their Marsham Street headquarters are demolished. Instead, the DoE will have its own environmentally-friendly, 250,000 sq ft home built by Land Securities on the site of Elland House, while the DoT has taken 220,000 sq ft in Horseferry Road. Along with the letting of Portland House to the Crown Prosecution Service, that almost used up Victoria's current stock of prime big buildings. The Defence Ministry, a Bloomsbury occupier, could have the opposite effect by halving its workforce, but the government will continue to be a major overall force in future, says HBH. 'There is unlikely to be a significant reduction as new agencies, departments and quangos continue to be established and take up space released through rationalisation, says the firm in its report Thriving in the Midst of Plenty. Oil is the next largest sector, with 56 companies occupying 2.3m sq ft - around 6 per cent of the West End stock. While most companies want to keep a presence, this appears likely to be much smaller. Mobil, Total, Chevron and Conoco are among big names either moving out of London or reassessing space demands. Victoria, which is still home to more than a quarter of the sector, will feel the draught most keenly. Telecommunications is also set for decline. It is the only sector which does not believe a West End location is important and, with 5 per cent of the office stock, this could have important repercussions. BT is the driving force, with the lion's share of both the industry and office space. The company is determined to cut its workforce by more than 100,000 by 1997, but an even bigger knife will slash the national property estate from almost 50m to 7m sq ft. That casts a shadow over 25 West End centres comprising around 1m sq ft. Even if they survive, it is likely that most will shift out of central London. Some 80 advertising agencies occupy around 4 per cent of the area's office space. The large majority are in Soho, Covent Garden or north of Oxford Street, mainly in buildings of less than 50,000 sq ft. This sector is among the most dedicated to the West End, despite one or two important moves to places such as Docklands. While recovery is bringing demand for more space, HBH forecasts further rationalisation through mergers and takeovers, with any expansion limited to small setups. Retailers are also set for fundamental changes. They, too, occupy around 1.5m sq ft of offices as an administrative back-up to the country's largest shopping centre. But this will decline as new technology reduces staff required for tasks such as sales forecasting and analysis. Headquarters will shrink and computing services relocate out of central London. That will leave many companies with the difficulty of getting rid of space tied into long leases. More than 90 foreign banks occupy a similar total space as retailers, and mainly in the same areas of St James's and Mayfair. New ones are expected to emerge, but just like most existing setups they are likely to be small operations. This is another sector committed to the West End, but any return to rent increases could see back-office space decamping to cheaper locations. Management consultancies are the final piece in the jigsaw, covering a wide variety of services. But despite rapid growth in the 1980s, they make up only around 1 per cent of West End space. While demand will grow from both larger agencies and boutique offices, the scale is unlikely to be significant. Government therefore appears to have a key role in the future of the West End. While other sectors are set to remain stable or decline, Whitehall's appetite for space should keep growing.</p>

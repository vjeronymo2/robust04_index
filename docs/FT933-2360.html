			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (16): A high-value premium may cost less - Insuring your precious possessions / Specialist underwriters know that anyone who can afford a home full of rare artefacts usually has better security than the average householder RICH art collectors living in big houses are generally a better risk for insurance companies than the average householder, whose most valuable possession may be a video recorder, yet this is not always reflected in their respective insurance premiums. 'Most thieves would probably walk straight past a Rembrandt,' says Aron Shapiro, of Artscope International, specialist fine art brokers. Young, opportunistic burglars tend to go for easily disposable televisions and videos, not unique works of art which are much harder to sell in a hurry. Standard household insurance policies tend to be rated on the assumption that your home is stuffed full of electrical goods and gold necklaces, rather than old masters. The main risk that general insurers are concerned with is theft, whereas for art or antiques, fire or water damage could be a more serious threat. So collectors may be paying more than they need for insurance, if they stick to standard policies. Insurers who specialise in high-value home contents insurance can afford to offer lower premiums, because claim rates are much lower than average. Depending on the area, premiums for the high-value items can be as little as a quarter of those with mainstream policies. As a rule of thumb, if you are currently paying much more than Pounds 1,000 for household contents insurance, and you have a number of valuable non-electrical items, it could be worth trying a specialist high-value policy. Companies have different minimum premiums and sums assured, but if you are on the borderline, insuring buildings and contents with the same company could bring you into the net and cost you less overall. The big names in the field are Hiscox, Nordstern and Sun Alliance, but a broker should be able to help pick the most appropriate one for you. This type of insurance is nearly always sold through brokers rather than direct, as policies have to be tailored to individual requirements, demanding more involvement from the broker than most off-the-peg household insurance. Specialist underwriters have learned from experience that anyone who can afford a home full of rare and beautiful artefacts usually cares enough about them to have far better security than the average house. Most proposal forms will ask detailed questions about locks and burglar alarms, while some insurers insist on carrying out a security audit of your home, and making recommendations about how to improve it, before accepting the risk. The good insurers, however, realise that while no one can object to proper locks, the joy of collecting is ruined if everything has to be kept in a bank vault or safe. One problem with collectables is that, unlike stereo equipment, they cannot easily be valued and replaced once they have disappeared. A customer may feel that no money can adequately compensate for the loss of his lovingly built up collection of pre-war cigarette cards, but he will demand compensation anyway, and the insurance company's business is to attach a price-tag to the priceless. However, getting valuations on which both insurer and insured agree can sometimes be tricky, particularly if the collection is an unusual one. This is where the insurers' specialist knowledge and contacts can be useful for finding an authority on the most obscure objects. Specialist policies often operate on an 'agreed value' basis, which means that the insurer accepts a valuation for an item and will pay that amount if a claim is made. This makes the claims procedure simpler, but valuations must be reviewed periodically to take account of fluctuations in the market. Apart from price, specialist insurance policies also have the advantage of cover designed specially to meet collectors' needs. For example, most have clauses based on the idea that the loss of, or damage to, one item of a pair or set will reduce the value of the remaining items. Insurers will either pay for the lost value, or accept the remaining items as salvage and pay for total loss. Masterpiece, from Sun Alliance, automatically covers new acquisitions up to a certain proportion of the total sum insured - so even if your house went up in flames the day after you had bought a new painting at auction, it would be covered. Insurers are also involved in promoting schemes to make it harder for thieves to dispose of stolen art objects, and improving the chances of recovery. One is the Art Loss Register, which in spite of its name will record the loss of not just works of art but any unique or rare item, with a minimum value of Pounds 1,000. The register is international, and subscribers include most big insurance companies, dealers and auction houses. The police are increasingly taking an interest. Another useful enterprise along the same lines is Trace magazine, which publishes photographs and descriptions of stolen items, to alert anyone who may have bought or been offered one. Both these systems rely on owners keeping photographs and precise descriptions of their belongings in a secure place for use in case of theft.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Machine tool gloom deepens THE worldwide recession in the machine tool industry has claimed another UK victim with the appointment of administrative receivers at Coventry-based Wickman Machine Tool Manufacturing. Mr Maurice Withall and Mr Roy Welsby of Grant Thornton are seeking purchasers for a company that, in its heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, was Europe's largest manufacturer of multi-spindle automatics, used for high-volume production of turned parts by the automotive and other industries. The receivership is the third in the UK machine tool industry this summer, and will increase the industry's frustration at the government's attitude towards manufacturing industry and the lack of fiscal stimuli to investment in new capital equipment. It also underlines the severity of the present machine tool recession, which has hit machine tool makers in Japan, the US and continental Europe. Wickman employed more than 400 people at its peak but that has now fallen to 58, including 15 employees made redundant before the receivership appointment, Grant Thornton said. The receivers are offering the business and assets as a going concern, and a two-day auction starts today at Wickman's Banner Lane plant to sell 3,000 lots of surplus stock and equipment. Wickman was founded before the Second World War by Axel Wickman, a former Alfred Herbert apprentice who developed a wide product range of multi-spindle automatics before selling the company to John Brown in the 1950s. The company continued to thrive until the early 1980s, when, under new ownership, it ran into difficulty seeking business in the Soviet Union and spent heavily on a new range of computer numerically controlled single-spindle automatics. It continued to lose ground during the 1980s and, according to one observer, was unable to generate enough volume to withstand a business downturn. In the 16 months to December 1990 the company had sales of Pounds 26m and net profit of Pounds 2.6m. By December last year, annual turnover had fallen to Pounds 12m, yielding a Pounds 500,000 profit. Nevertheless, Wickman has several attractions for a potential purchaser. Apart from a skilled workforce and a quality reputation, earlier this year it launched a range of multi-spindle automatics incorporating the latest technology.</p>

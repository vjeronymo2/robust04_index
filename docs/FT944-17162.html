			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Observer: Phut phut The UK's Institute of Personnel and Development says that Dutch managers, whose work often takes them into Germany, like to run two cars. They keep the prestige motor for doing business in Germany - where they feel an impressive vehicle is de rigueur - and the clapped-out banger for working in the Netherlands, where an ostentatious company car might suggest a lack of investment in the business. Presumably they keep the moped for dealing in the UK - so they won't offend their poorer cousins.</p>

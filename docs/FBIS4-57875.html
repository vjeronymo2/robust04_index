			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] On 19 May, the National Executive Committee of  the Herreraist faction unanimously proclaimed Juan Andres  Ramirez its presidential candidate. They also approved the  first five candidates for the Senate by a majority.    The executive committee of the majority faction of the party  also approved the report drafted by its Political Affairs  Committee -- thus confirming what EL PAIS published yesterday --  recommending that the faction's convention on 22 May approves  these two points.    Ramirez' proclamation, which was the first point, was  unanimously approved. The second point, regarding the list of  members for the Senate, received a negative vote from Deputy  Arturo Heber and reservations from two other leaders.    Senator Jorge Silveira Zavala, president of the Herreraist  faction, announced this at the end of a two and a half hour  meeting. He confirmed that the Senate list will be headed by  Transport and Public Works Minister Juan Carlos Raffo, San Jose  Mayor Juan Chiruchi, Deputy Luis Alberto Heber (Rivera  Department), Deputy Carlos Garat (Colonia Department), and  Uruguay Tourne, a former senator and current member of the  National party's executive board.    The executive board decided to postpone selecting the  candidate for the vice presidency. [passage omitted]</p>

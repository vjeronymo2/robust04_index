The general framework, the Joint Commission, was set up  under  an agreement signed by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his  Cambodian counterpart Prince Norodom Sirivut.    Agreement in principle to set up a "Joint Committee on  Boundary" was recorded in a joint communique signed by Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai and Cambodian co-prime ministers Prince  Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen.    The Joint Commission is expected to hold its first meeting  later this year in Bangkok, according to a delegation source.    It remains unclear at this point whether the Joint Committee  on Boundary will come under the umbrella of the Joint  Commission, the source said.    But the boundary committee will deal specifically with  questions of borderline by land and sea, he said.    The boundary committee was proposed by Thailand in a bid to  stem future border problems.    "The Joint Boundary Committee will provide an opportunity  for  both sides to make direct contact at all levels if problems  arise," said the source. [passage omitted]    Cambodian Defence Minister Tie Banh emphasised the  importance  of reaching a fair agreement on sharing resources such as gas  and oil.    Fisheries so far have caused "minimal conflict" but  authorities from both countries should try to prevent any  deterioration, he said.    Issues involving the land boundary he said, were more  difficult to settle at this stage because some areas remained  beyond control.    He argued for better roads linking remote areas, saying  "when  (we) have routes, all things will follow, including trade and  public health".    "But this needs a lot of money, tools and human resources.  It's not very easy for a poor country like ours to talk about  much money," he said.    Gen Tie Banh also noted that a permanent checkpoint between  Klong Luek and Poipet would be declared open "very, very soon".  In the way are technical details on customs and immigration.    Customs procedures are important to the transfer of logs,  including those in Khmer Rouge zones, to Thailand, a source  said. But the Cambodian government is not expected to extend the  March 31 deadline for the transfer of felled logs.    "They are more interested in joint ventures with foreign  logging companies after the deadline expires," said the source.    Gen Tie Banh said permanent checkpoints between Klong Yai  and  Koh Kong, further south, and Chong Chom and Chong Anma, further  north, were also under consideration. [passage omitted]    The Joint Commission with Cambodia follows similar  frameworks  for cooperation with Laos and Vietnam.    Under a Thai Foreign Ministry proposal approved by Cabinet,  the Joint Commission with Cambodia is designed to facilitate  consultation and cooperation for mutual benefit in matters of  trade, science and technology, and social issues.    The Joint Commission is to meet once yearly in alternate  capitals and the agreement will be valid for five years.</p>

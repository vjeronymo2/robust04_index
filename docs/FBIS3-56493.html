Mykola Horyn  proposed an approach to this issue not from a political, but  from a technical and economic aspect, for nuclear weapons have  not only to be stored, but properly serviced too.    "These weapons have to be tested. But will Lvov and other  oblast councils give permission for underground nuclear  explosion tests to be conducted on their territories?" Mykola  Horyn posed the question.</p>

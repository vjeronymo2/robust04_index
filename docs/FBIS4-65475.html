			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irini Kakoulidou: "Greece Dependent on Turkish </F> Electric Energy"]    [Text]  <H5>  Obliged To Pay High Prices for Imported </H5> Electricity    At a time of critical importance for national matters, and  while it is busy with its numerous preelection commitments, the  government is energetically pushing through its project to  connect the electrical networks of Greece and Turkey, in spite  of having to accept disadvantageous terms for the Greek side in  doing so.    Last week, the executive committee of the Public Electricity  Corporation [DEH] discussed the project to connect the  electricity grids of Greece and Turkey, and decided to initiate  procedures with a view to signing the relevant agreement with  Turkey. One of the government's main arguments for the necessity  of this connection is that it will create an energy axis linking  Turkey, Greece, and Italy, in which our country will occupy a  central position. The connection between Greece and Italy will  be accomplished by an underwater cable whose construction has  already begun.    Because Italy is in need of large supplies of electricity  and  Turkey has considerable quantities of it available for export,  such an energy axis could be of great advantage to Greece. For  obvious reasons, nevertheless, Turkey does not wish to let its  Western exports be dependent on an intervening Greek network,  and is therefore pursuing the construction of an alternative  route which will link Turkey with Italy by going through  Bulgaria, Skopje, and Albania. (The agreement about this  connection between Italy and Albania -- which is to be  accomplished by underwater cable between the two countries --  has already been signed.) By means of such a northern energy  route, designed to link Turkey to the West and to the Balkan  countries in-between, Greece is deprived of its advantage.    Connecting the electricity grid of Greece to that of Turkey,  however, will have yet another, graver, repercussion. Given the  fact that our country is now facing a shortage of electric  energy and that this shortage is expected to keep growing until  at least 1998, the Turkish hookup will make us dependent on our  neighbor for energy. That means that the exclusive function of  the hookup will be to export Turkish electricity to Greece for  Greek consumption only, under terms -- as indicated by talks  between DEH and TEK [the Turkish electric company] -- very  unfavorable for Greece. During a meeting of representatives of  the two electric companies which took place in Athens on  February 23-24, TEK asked DEH to pay 6.265 cents for each  kilowatt-hour of imported electricity. This is almost twice the  present cost of 3.46 cents per kwhr produced by the large  oil-fired generating unit that DEH is currently using. The cost  of energy produced by large-capacity lignite coal units is even  lower than that. Of course, DEH has not yet made known its final  decision regarding the asking price, as this is scheduled to be  discussed at the next meeting of the representatives of the two  companies next month.    In any case, the bargaining position of DEH does not inspire  one with confidence. It is currently within TEK's discretion to  offer our country electricity at high prices because, on the one  hand, Greece faces serious difficulties in being supplied by  either the Yugoslav or the Bulgarian network and, on the other,  it has been too slow to install new electric generating  facilities with which to meet its steadily rising electricity  needs. During their meeting with representatives of TEK last  February, the representatives of DEH negotiated imports of  electric energy from Turkey equivalent to the output of one  generating plant of 180 mw capacity, functioning continuously  with lowered rates at night.    Through the connection of the two networks, therefore,  Turkey  achieves two objectives: In the first place, it makes our  country, and more especially the nationally sensitive region of  Thrace, dependent on Turkey for electricity. It is an undisputed  fact that the supplies of electricity from Turkey will be  channelled to Thrace, first because this border region does not  possess even a single electricity-producing unit, and second,  because any attempt to circulate imported electricity through  the entire extent of the Greek network would be financially  ill-advised. Even now, all the electricity imported from  Bulgaria is used exclusively by Thrace.    In the second place, it coerces Greece to pay excessively  high prices before it can satisfy urgent and extensive  electricity needs. In the opinion of some energy experts, the  reason for which Turkey is exacting such prices from Greece is  that it hopes, by so doing, to finance its plan of rendering the  Balkans dependent on itself for energy. The high tariffs it is  proposing to Greece will allow it to depress the prices at which  it can sell electricity to the other Balkan countries (all of  whom are also in urgent need of electricity imports),  facilitating in this manner their economic and political  dependence on Turkey.  <H5>  The Meetings </H5>   Turkey's coercive tactics toward Greece in regard to  electric  energy prices is evident in the way meetings between DEH and TEK  have evolved since 1990. In the first of these meetings  (Constantinople, 8-9 October 1990), there was no discussion of  prices but only of the theoretical rationale for the schedule of  rates, which were to be based on the cost of production per oil  unit (i.e., cost of oil plus operation and maintenance costs).  During the second meeting (Athens, 8-9 November 1990), the Turks  proposed a price of 2.93 cents per kwhr, while DEH countered  with 2.1 cents. At the third meeting (Smyrna, 19-20 December  1990), the two sides agreed on theoretical methods of  determining price, while postponing the practical and precise  determination of basic parameters until a later date. During the  same meeting, it was also mentioned for the first time that the  yearly quantities to be imported by Greece between 1991 and 1994  would be of the order of 1.2 to 1.4 billion kwhr. Two additional  meetings have taken place since: the first before the elections  on 24 September 1993 at Ankara, and the second on February 23-24  in Athens. At this last meeting, TEK representatives proposed  the markedly high price of 6.265 cents for each imported kwhr.    It must be noted that the price Turkey is asking is almost  double not only the production costs of DEH, but also those of  the cost of the notorious BOO facilities which the previous  government had negotiated with private interests. Analyses  conducted by DEH in regard to the offers made for the Lavrion  generating plants led to the conclusion that their production  cost would be between 3.5 and 4.0 cents per kwhr, inclusive of  the investment cost.</p>

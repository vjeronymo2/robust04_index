			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. STANCE AGAINST NORIEGA WINS BACKING BY 11 NATIONS; OAS TO MEET  </P> <P> The Bush Administration claimed an early advantage Friday in its contest with  Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega for international diplomatic support.  </P> <P> Also on Friday, the Pentagon said newly arrived U.S. troops will travel in  armed convoys on Panama's highways with orders to defend themselves if  attacked.  </P> <P> White House National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said the Administration  is content for the time being to follow the strategy of diplomatic and military  pressure that President Bush announced Thursday after Noriega's regime  nullified Sunday's disputed election.  </P> <P> However, Scowcroft said other steps might be tried later if Noriega retains his  grip on power.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Situation Under Review'  </P> <P> "There are a lot of things that we could do," Scowcroft told reporters aboard  Bush's Air Force One on a flight to College Station, Tex., where the President  the commencement address as Texas A&amp;M. "We will have the whole situation  under review constantly. There are more options that one could consider. . . .  We've looked over the range of things, and we've picked a package we think  suits the situation."  </P> <P> The State Department said that at least 11 nations and two multinational  organizations have condemned Noriega for attempting to steal the election in  favor of his preferred candidate. Noriega, who heads the Panama Defense Forces,  is his nation's de facto ruler.  </P> <P> In perhaps the most telling diplomatic event, Japan issued a statement  denouncing irregularities in Sunday's presidential election and the ensuing  violent attacks on opposition political leaders. Japan, which is Panama's most  significant trading partner, had never before publicly criticized the Noriega  regime.  </P> <P> Japanese Ambassador Jumpei Kato delivered a note to opposition presidential  candidate Guillermo Endara that described the regime's actions as "inadmissible  in a civilized society."  </P> <P> Also on Friday, the Organization of American States approved an American-backed  proposal for an emergency foreign ministers' meeting next week to consider the  implications of the election and its violent aftermath.  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: "Foreign reaction continues to  strongly condemn developments in Panama. Peru has issued a second statement  condemning the annulment of the elections. . . . President Oscar Arias  (Sanchez) of Costa Rica has said the Panamanian people were betrayed. . . .  </P> <P> "By latest count, I note 11 individual countries, in addition to the United  States, have issued individual statements. In addition, Colombia made a  statement on behalf of the Group of Eight (Latin American nations), and the  European Community's 12 nations have issued a statement."  </P> <P> As the vanguard of nearly 1,900 new U.S. troops began to arrive in Panama,  Richard L. Armitage, acting assistant defense secretary for international  security affairs, said the soldiers and Marines will not engage in provocative  action but will not be confined to U.S. military bases, either.  </P> <P> "If (American troops) have to get from Point A to Point B, they'll do so in  military fashion, without straggling," said Armitage, the Administration's  nominee for Army secretary. "These guys won't be looking for trouble or causing  trouble. But if the PDF (Panama Defense Forces) causes trouble, these forces  are the best suited to respond.  </P> <P> "If Noriega or his thugs are pestering or hurting American citizens, these  forces will be there to go out and clean up the situation," he added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carrier in Atlantic  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the aircraft carrier America steamed in the Atlantic less than 500  miles off the East Coast. The ship, which left its home port of Norfolk, Va.,  on Thursday, is bound for the Indian Ocean, but officials have stressed that it  could be diverted to Panama on short notice as long as it remains in the  Western Hemisphere.  </P> <P> The America carries a total of 40 planes capable of bombing strikes, as well as  helicopters and planes that could be used to evacuate American civilians.  </P> <P> In Panama, Noriega reacted with defiance. But there were persistent rumors that  he will ultimately accept asylum, perhaps in Spain, in exchange for his  departure from Panama. Asked if the United States has discussed such a deal  with Spanish authorities, Scowcroft said after a long pause: "I don't want to  get into specifics, but we have been talking to a number of our allies."  </P> <P> Noriega rejected just such a deal last year because U.S. negotiators refused to  promise to dismiss drug charges that are pending against him in Florida. Bush  said Thursday that the indictments will not be dismissed, although he hinted at  a possible compromise during his press conference, saying, "But look, I will be  open-minded about seeing what it might take to see him leave."  </P> <P> Boucher said half the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Panama City has been brought  home and that all remaining staff members and their families have moved into  secure housing on U.S. military bases. He said the U.S. government is urging  Americans to avoid travel to Panama and advising Americans traveling on ships  through the Panama Canal to remain aboard their vessels at all times.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Serious Crisis'  </P> <P> In unanimously approving a Venezuelan-backed resolution, the 31 member nations  of the Organization of American States called for a foreign ministers' meeting  Wednesday to debate the "serious crisis in Panama in its international  context."  </P> <P> Panamanian representative Carlos Russell, backed by Nicaragua, voted for the  debate, although he said the organization should consider the issue of U.S.  "intervention" in Sunday's election through clandestine funding of the  opposition.  </P> <P> Other delegates openly attacked the Noriega regime. For instance, Jamaica's  ambassador, Keith Johnson, declared, "The world has witnessed an absolute  betrayal of the democratic rights of the Panamanian people . . . a blatant rape  of democracy."  </P> <P> Boucher refused to say what the OAS -- which has no enforcement powers -- could  accomplish. But, he said, "We believe it's very critical for the OAS to speak  out in one voice in support of the democratic aspirations of the Panamanian  people."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Don Shannon, in Washington, and James Gerstenzang, in  College Station, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INDIAN LEADERS JOIN CAMPAIGN TO UNEARTH MORE OF 'LOST VILLAGE';  </P> <P> EXCAVATION: ENCINO SLOW-GROWTH GADFLY GATHERS SUPPORT IN BID TO DELAY  CONSTRUCTION OF TWO OFFICE BUILDINGS.  </P> <P> Arguing that the full extent of a major archeological find on Ventura Boulevard  has yet to be uncovered, an Encino slow-growth gadfly has rallied state Indian  leaders and an archeologist to his campaign to get city officials to delay  construction of two office buildings.  </P> <P> The core of the argument by Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino,  is that more of the "Lost Village of Encino," discovered in 1984, must lie  beneath two redevelopment sites on the north side of the boulevard between  Balboa Boulevard and La Maida Street.  </P> <P> To date, the presence of additional Indian remains is unconfirmed, but  archeologist Nancy A. Whitney-Desautels of Huntington Beach, who excavated the  "Lost Village," says she is certain it extended over a greater area than has  been excavated.  </P> <P> "For sure, there is an archeological site over there," she said. "It's part of  the same village complex."  </P> <P> The proposed redevelopment projects are on the same block as Los Encinos State  Historic Park and across the street from an office building erected on the  "Lost Village" site after it was excavated.  </P> <P> Silver, well known for opposing virtually any new commercial development, said  he is outraged that the two proposed office buildings have been cleared for  construction permits without having to complete preliminary archeological  surveys, and without soliciting Indians' comments.  </P> <P> To Silver's chagrin, both proposed projects were reviewed by the city Building  and Safety Department, which found there was no need for a full environmental  impact report (EIR) or a preliminary archeological survey.  </P> <P> Richard Holguin, chief of structural plan check for the building department,  said that under state law, if construction workers encounter signs of the  Indian village the developers will have to stop construction and a certified  archeologist must be hired to conduct a study.  </P> <P> The official who decided that no preliminary archeological surveys were needed  was on jury duty this week and unavailable for comment, an assistant said.  </P> <P> Silver alerted regional Indian leaders, Whitney-Desautels, and the state Native  American Heritage Commission -- all of whom are now expressing concern and  contacting city building officials.  </P> <P> Richard Angulo, a Chumash who is chief of the California Indian Council, said  he is not sure if anything lies under the controversial sites. But Angulo said  the area was a trading place for several tribes during the 17th and 18th  centuries, and that a preliminary archeological survey seemed logical.  </P> <P> "We're not saying there's a burial ground, we're saying that it's very funny  this is across the street from a great archeological find and all of a sudden,  they don't need an EIR," said Angulo, who is joining Silver and  Whitney-Desautels in appealing the city's findings to the Building and Safety  Commission.  </P> <P> "My feeling is this is an unfair burden the city is putting on the landowner,"  Whitney-Desautels said. "The city is putting the landowner in the position of  potentially having tremendous slowdowns during the actual construction phase .  . . Once he starts construction, whatever company he hires will get a daily  rate for equipment even if the project is stalled" by the state requirement to  complete an archeological study.  </P> <P> The first "lost village" dig suspended construction work for eight months.  </P> <P> Developers of both projects blamed Silver for stirring up trouble and said they  were perplexed he was raising the issue now, after they spent months meeting  with his group and another homeowners association.  </P> <P> "Mr. Silver is going to use any means at his disposal to delay it. This is just  the latest," said Gardena-based builder Jerry Katell, who plans a three-story,  140,000-square-foot office building on the Pic-n-Save site.  </P> <P> Maurice Cohen, whose family's Studio City company plans a three-story,  48,000-square-foot office building on the site of the former Mercedes-Benz  dealership, said, "I believe he is doing this -- and using very poor judgment  to use other people's culture and heritage -- as a means of getting his point  through."  </P> <P> "I'm not exploiting these people. All I did was alert them," Silver said.  </P> <P> Larry Myers, executive secretary of the state Native American Heritage  Commission, said his agency receives many calls from residents more concerned  about development than Indian history. But he said the commission checks out  every complaint anyway.  </P> <P> "Regardless of anyone's motives, if what they're saying is correct, we respond  to them. My only concern is to protect some of the cultural resources," Myers  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The first white men to come to the San Fernando Valley, the expedition of  Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola in 1769, described in their journals a large  Indian village near a spring in what is now Encino. Over the years, however,  the location of the village was lost. In 1984, however, workers excavating on  the southeast corner of Ventura Boulevard and Balboa Boulevard made a  discovery. Their find of Indian remains and other items led archeologists to  believe that the workers' discovery was part of the "Lost Village of Encino."  The excavation took eight months, cost the developer $1.7 million and led to  the discovery of more than a million artifacts and the remains of about a dozen  Indians. To date, the presence of additional Indian remains is unconfirmed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETERNAL FLAME FOR PEACE STILL WAITING FOR A HOME;  </P> <P> ATOMIC BOMB: ORGANIZERS OF EVENT HONORING JAPANESE VICTIMS OF HIROSHIMA,  NAGASAKI EXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT OF PERMANENT SITE. GIFT WAS GIVEN TO CITY SIX  YEARS AGO.  </P> <P> An "eternal flame for peace" that was to have been the center of a ceremony on  Sunday honoring the Japanese killed by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima  and Nagasaki 45 years ago remains homeless six years after it was donated to  the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Sponsors of the 1990 Hiroshima/Nagasaki Commemorative Peace Program had  expected Mayor Tom Bradley on Sunday to announce a permanent site for the  flame, which was donated to Los Angeles by the mayor of Hiroshima during the  1984 Summer Olympics.  </P> <P> But Bradley said there had been a misunderstanding and negotiations were still  under way to find a home for the tiny Hiroshima Eternal Flame for Peace that  has been kept alive in a brass lantern at the Koyasan Buddhist Temple in Little  Tokyo.  </P> <P> "The Board of Cultural Affairs has approved it (the plan for a site)," Bradley  said at a news conference during the program at the Los Angeles Baha'i Center  auditorium. "We're well on our way toward establishing a site . . . it's now a  matter of locating and placing it."  </P> <P> Organizers of the event, however, insisted that they were told by a spokesman  for Bradley to expect an announcement of a permanent home for the flame on  Sunday.  </P> <P> "On Friday, the mayor's office called us with a statement we could expect to  hear. What Bradley said today was not that statement," according to an  organizer who asked that her name not be used. "We aren't sure what happened."  </P> <P> "It is sad," added Kent Wong of Asian Pacific Americans for Nuclear Awareness,  which made arrangements for the flame to be hand-carried to Los Angeles by a  Japanese emissary with a pledge that it be kept burning at a permanent site.  "We really want a home for this flame."  </P> <P> The flame was only formally accepted by Bradley at last year's 44th  commemorative ceremony of the bombings.  </P> <P> Also among the disappointed was Kaz Suyeishi, who was a teen-ager when she was  knocked unconscious by the atomic blast in Hiroshima.  </P> <P> "Push him (Bradley) about this, please push him," said Suyeishi, of Pasadena,  who has devoted her life to the cause of fighting for peace. "This is not our  responsibility, it is the city's responsibility."  </P> <P> Earlier, Suyeishi, who is a hibakusha (atomic bomb survivor), broke down in  tears when she recalled the events of Aug. 6, 1945.  </P> <P> "Against a beautiful blue sky, I saw a B-29 that to me looked like an angel,  and a tiny white spot falling slowly beneath it," said Suyeishi, who wore a  black dress for the Sunday ceremony, part of which was broadcast live to Japan  by satellite. "Then there was a powerful flash of light.  </P> <P> "A moment later, heaven turned to hell and the blue sky turned gray. I heard,  'Help me, help me.' I saw the city in flames and people everywhere covered with  blood.  </P> <P> "We must not make the same mistake again," added Suyeishi.  </P></p>

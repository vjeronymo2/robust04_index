			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Observer: Overloaded When it comes to generating extra work for themselves, accountants traditionally win high marks. But Price Waterhouse's proposed scheme of arrangement for the creditors of Trinity Insurance deserves a special mention in dispatches. A six-page letter in an appendix comes out strongly in favour of the scheme suggested by the provisional liquidators, in preference to the alternative of liquidation. So who are the provisional liquidators to whom the letter is addressed? Partners at Price Waterhouse. And who wrote the letter? A firm of accountants called, er, Price Waterhouse.</p>

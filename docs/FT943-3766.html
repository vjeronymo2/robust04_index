			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Cancer fears shrugged off President Francois Mitterrand said last night he would resign if his prostate cancer were to make 'me more concerned about my fate than that of the state'. But he stressed that this was not the case and hoped to finish his term next May. The ailing 77-year-old French president quipped that he was 'very flattered' by all the stock market rumours of his demise or indisposition against which he said he was 'a bit armoured' or inured. So far, he said, the only interruption to his presidential duties had come last July when, two days after his second operation, he had had to skip one cabinet meeting. In a long television interview aimed at clarifying recent claims and revelations about his health and his association with the Vichy administration in 1942 and subsequently with some of its members, Mr Mitterrand said: 'I took the opposite path to most people in moving from right to left.' His bourgeois background, which he said he shared with 'most Socialist leaders', had initially inclined him towards conservative politics, and he admitted he had been 'a bit slow in my evolution' towards the left.</p>

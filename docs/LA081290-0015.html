			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> AND FINALLY: Our Band Name of the Week (baseball division) goes to the New  York-based group Honus Wagner (named after the great Pittsburgh Pirates  shortstop), who are in town Monday at Al's Bar. . . . And if you're if looking  for rap on the razor's edge, get a copy of "HollyWord," the new spoken-word  collection from Rhino/WordBeat Records. Masterminded by Harvey Kubernik and due  out this week, it features provocative patter from such rocksters as Jane's  Addiction's Perry Farrell, Fishbone's Angelo Moore and Paul Kantner (plus raps  from such unlikely TV-types as Gavin MacLeod, Katey Sagal and Patti  D'Arbanville).  </P></p>

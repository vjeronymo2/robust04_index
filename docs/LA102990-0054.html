			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHOOTING STARS: LINE MAKING SOME PROGRESS  </P> <P> Forget about the Charger offensive linemen being big, strong and steadily  getting steadier.  </P> <P> Tight end Rod Bernstine likes them because they can play hoops.  </P> <P> "In years past we didn't have a lot of athletic ability there," he said. "Now  we have guys who can go out in the gym and play basketball. So they're young,  but they're talented. If they stay together and stay healthy they're going to  be great."  </P> <P> Indeed, a sackless afternoon in Sunday's 41-10 victory over the Tampa Bay  Buccaneers at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium is evidence that this line can help  make things happen. But basketball? Are these guys good enough to compete with  those of you at the skill positions?  </P> <P> "Oh, they've got a ways to go," Bernstine said, smiling, "but I'm just saying  that they're not big, fat linemen. They can go out and shoot baskets and enjoy  life."  </P> <P> And in the meantime, players such as Bernstine, Billy Joe Tolliver and Marion  Butts can enjoy the games more, knowing they're not going to get clobbered  every time they get to the line of scrimmage. There was speculation early in  the season that playing behind this offensive line could land a guy in the  hospital.  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning opted to do a bit of reconstruction six days before the start  of the regular season. "During training camp, we just couldn't figure out what  to do at that the left guard position," Henning said. "After the Raider game, I  sat down with (offensive line coach) Alex (Gibbs) and looked at the film, and  we talked about it and he said it would be a tough decision to make. And I  said: 'Make it.' "  </P> <P> A day later, guard Dennis McKnight, a Charger for eight seasons, was waived  along with Larry Williams, his backup. Rookie Frank Cornish was moved to the  starting center position and Courtney Hall was switched to left guard.  </P> <P> And, sure, a lot of people thought Henning was nuts. The move even surprised  some of the remaining linemen.  </P> <P> "I questioned it, of course," tackle Broderick Thompson said. "We gave up some  experienced players. I can say that a couple of those losses could have changed  with that experience in there. You know it's a gamble that they took."  </P> <P> The eight remaining games will determine whether it was a jackpot or a long day  at the craps table. Up to now, the Chargers (3-5) have been inconsistent and so  has the offensive line.  </P> <P> Sunday was a step in the right direction. Consider the hole Bernstine ran  through in the fourth quarter en route to a 20-yard touchdown. And the  statistics sheet show that the Chargers have given up 11 sacks in eight games  to 19 through eight last season.  </P> <P> "I think we're seeing some fruits of (the) decision, but it's been a little  struggle here and there," Henning said. "We still have to get over the hump.  When we get behind . . . we have to have that protection."  </P> <P> These days, Tolliver is full of praise for the men up front.  </P> <P> "Oh yeah, they do a good job for us," he said. "Those guys are playing with a  lot of confidence now."  </P> <P> Which has helped Butts rush for 654 yards in 145 carries. And he's happy to  give away plenty of the credit.  </P> <P> "A lot of it can be attributed to the offensive line," Butts said. "I mean, you  stick me in front of 11 guys and what can I do? Without the offensive line I  couldn't get a yard. You'd be a fool to take on 11 guys by yourself."  </P> <P> Those who score touchdowns are quick to express their appreciation for blocking  services rendered.  </P> <P> "We never force a fumble," guard David Richards said, "we never make a sack.  But what we do is give Butts and Bernstine, Billy Joe and Anthony Miller the  opportunity to get to the end zone. They know we made it possible and that's  what's important."  </P></p>

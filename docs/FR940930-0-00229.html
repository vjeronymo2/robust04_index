			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.231&blank;Fouling Wires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is meant to assure the detection of a train  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating through turnouts located within the limits of train  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detection circuits. If one wire or rail plug were broken, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dangerous condition would be prevented if the other wire or rail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plug continues to be effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section as proposed requires that each set of fouling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wires located in a highway-rail grade crossing warning system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> train detection circuit consist of at least two discrete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conductors, and requires that each conductor be of sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conductivity and maintained in such condition to ensure proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of the train detection apparatus when the circuit is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shunted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The labor/management group recommended that the proposal be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified to accord with existing technology. The group stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ``certain train detection apparatus, particularly motion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensing equipment, is designed to prevent the system from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assuming the most restrictive state under certain conditions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including some instances when the train detection circuit is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shunted.'' We agree with the comments and, therefore, in lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring that the train detection apparatus be in its most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictive state, have revised the section to require that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conductor be maintained in such condition to ensure proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of the train detection apparatus when the train  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detection circuit is shunted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that each set of fouling wires in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highway-rail grade crossing train detection circuit shall consist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of at least two discrete conductors. The section requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each conductor be of sufficient conductivity and be maintained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such condition to ensure proper operation of the train detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apparatus when the train detection circuit is shunted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.233&blank;Rail Joints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision provided that each rail joint located within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the limits of a highway-rail grade crossing train detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circuit shall be bonded by means other than joint bars to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrical conductivity. The labor/management group, the only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party to comment on this section, recommended that it be modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reflect maintenance requirements. The group also recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this section be changed to reflect that it apply only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-insulated rail joints. FRA concurs in the recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has revised the section accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that each non-insulated rail joint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located within the limits of a highway-rail grade crossing train  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detection circuit be bonded by means other than joint bars and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bonds shall be maintained in such condition to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrical conductivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Equity Plans (21): If they go, they won't go quietly - Peps offer a tax shelter in which a married couple could by now have amassed joint portfolios of over Pounds 50,000. A pre-election boom seems likely, as Labour threatens to end them; so . . . JUST WHEN new opportunities are opening up in personal equity plans, the threat of political change looms large with the impending general election. But the Pep industry is gearing up for a pre-election boom. If Peps go, they will not go quietly. The personal equity plan was introduced by Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor of the exchequer, at the beginning of 1987. Peps formed part of the drive towards 'popular capitalism', which also involved incentives for small investors to buy shares in privatised companies. But it has always proved difficult to match up the political inspiration behind Peps with the administrative reality of running tax-sheltered savings plans of a fairly modest size. The Inland Revenue has insisted on imposing a bureaucratic structure of approved plan managers, to guard against abuse. But that has brought a heavy cost penalty. Ordinarily, private individuals who invest in shares face a big tax burden. They pay income tax at 25 or 40 per cent on dividends, and capital gains tax  -also at up to 40 per cent - on any gains of over Pounds 5,500 in any single tax year. The personal equity plan, however, offers total protection from income tax and capital gains tax. The income and capital gains can roll up tax-free. Over a period of years this can have a powerful effect in boosting the overall returns. It sounds simple and attractive, but for several years the Treasury dithered over how big to make the plans, and over the details of their contents. The politicians wanted millions of people of relatively modest means to use Peps to hold small parcels of shares in British companies. But the marketing reality was that Peps would not succeed in pulling in really large sums until relatively wealthy people could use them to hold significantly large portfolios, and moreover could invest conveniently in collective funds (that is, unit trusts and investment trusts) rather than in individual companies. So, after Pounds 480m had been invested in Peps in 1987, demand collapsed to Pounds 200m in 1988. Originally only Pounds 2,400 could be invested in an annual plan, and of that just Pounds 540 could go into collective funds. Subsequently, however, the scope has been greatly extended. Standard plans now range up to a maximum of Pounds 6,000, of which Pounds 3,000 can go into collective funds. In the 1990-91 tax year, 500,000 plans were taken out, worth Pounds 1.6bn, or an average of Pounds 3,200 each. In all, over Pounds 4bn has been invested so far. Interest has remained high. Investment trust companies, for instance, have discovered a loophole in the Pep rules, so that the whole Pounds 6,000 can be invested when a new trust is floated. This was successfully exploited, for instance, when M &amp; G launched its Income Investment Trust last autumn. Half of the Pounds 246m issue was 'pepped'. From the beginning of this year, too, an extra Pounds 3,000 allowance can be applied to a single-company Pep. These are restrictive vehicles, which may be more useful for employee shareholders than for the public at large, but nevertheless many companies are arranging facilities for the public to hold their shares in this tax-efficient way. One final significant change is being brought in. Until now, shares in Peps have been limited to those of British companies, but in future companies in other European Community member states will qualify, too. What it all adds up to is that, from modest beginnings, the personal equity plan has grown into a substantial and reasonably flexible tax shelter for investments. A married couple can invest Pounds 18,000 between them this financial year. If they had used up their maximum entitlements since the beginning in 1987, they could have amassed joint portfolios of over Pounds 50,000, with another Pounds 18,000 investible from April 6. The real significance of this could become evident if the Labout party wins the coming general election. Labour has said it will abolish new plans, but existing Peps will be permitted to run on indefinitely, benefiting as before from tax exemptions. At present, the tax advantages are marginal for most people. Although the income tax relief is worth, say, 2 per cent in extra dividend yield to a higher rate taxpayer, Pep charges will cancel out at least half of this. Standard rate payers probably do not benefit at all, compared with holding shares directly. As for capital gains tax, few people at present pay it. With a little care, and with some calculated bed-and-breakfasting, the Pounds 5,500 exemption limit (Pounds 11,000 for a couple) will suffice. But under Labour it could be very different, especially for the wealthy. The top rate of tax on dividends is set to shoot up to 59 per cent, and there would probably be a 50 per cent rate of capital gains tax on all profits above a reduced exemption limit. Suddenly Peps would become very valuable tax shelters indeed. There may not be any need to rush. New Peps would not be abolished immediately on a Labour victory - there would have to be a Budget - and Labour might not win anyway. Still, unit trust companies in particular will be hoping to benefit from any flurry this spring. In the first nine months of 1991, net sales of unit trust Peps amounted to Pounds 520m, possibly something like half of all unit trust sales direct to the public. But some unit trust groups have found Peps very difficult to administer, especially if they offer Pounds 3,000 direct-share portfolios to top up the Pounds 3,000 unit trust maximum to Pounds 6,000. One or two have been heavily fined by Imro, the investment management regulatory body, for failing to keep the details of the accounts in order. What was originally intended to be a simple tax incentive has turned into costly bureaucratic tangle. But if there is a change of government the personal equity plan may yet achieve its period of fufilment, albeit in circumstances which its Tory creators would not have chosen.  ----------------------------------------- PEPS' PROGRESS  -----------------------------------------                      Number                     of plans     Amount                      ('000s)   (Poundsm)  ----------------------------------------- 1987                   270         480 1988                   120         200 1989-90 (15 months)    580       1,600 1990-91                500       1,600  ----------------------------------------- Source: Inland Revenue  -----------------------------------------</p>

Amb. Kim Sam-hun and working-level aides will meet with  Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state and top U.S.  negotiator in the nuclear talks with Pyongyang, and other White  House and administrative officials to tune their positions.    The next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, expected soon  after Pyongyang agrees to resume inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will be the third  round of such meetings.    Seoul and Washington officials have said this meeting will  discuss overall issues related to completely solving the North  Korean nuclear problem, including U.S. relations improvement  with the Stalinist state.    North Korean Embassy officials in Vienna held a second  contact with IAEA headquarters Monday [10 January] and are said  to be nearing an accord on resuming the inspections, suspended  in March last year.    Another set of working-level talks between North Korea and  the United States will precede the high-level meeting, and Kim  will coordinate stances for both of these talks during his  Washington trip, officials said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/6/1994 -- During a news  conference on June 16, in Oradea, reformed Bishop Laszlo Tokes,  mentioned that the article speaking about him and issued  recently in the TINERAMA newspaper "seemed unrealistic, a  diversion built by the Securitate, in close connection with the  present power and the nationalist extremists."    In the article in TINERAMA, journalist Ioan Itu supposed the  former priest had belonged to the Romanian Securitate, and to  prove it, the journalist published in the above mentioned issue  the facsimile of Tokes' engagement paper with that organization.  The mentioned newspaper also told about a 20,000 lei-bill  handed over by Laszlo Tokes to a Hungarian secret service  officer.    On June 16, the Episcopal Reformed Diocese Office belonging  to Piatra Craiului also mentioned in an official statement that  the main reason for this slander is to discredit the [1989]  revolution started in Timisoara and to disgrace the heads of  revolution and the democratic opposition.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> CITY TO JOIN IN STUDY OF TRANSPORTATION  </P> <P> Brea officials have decided to join Fullerton in a study of potential mass  transit for those cities.  </P> <P> "Both cities contain a number of retail, employment and institutional centers,"  Brea City Manager Frank Benest said. "The study will determine where these  centers are and what kinds of modes of transportation would serve best."  </P> <P> Of primary concern is linking the resulting transportation system to other  systems around the county.  </P> <P> Although there has been no discussion of what form the transit system would  take, Benest said there was little doubt that it would go beyond buses.  </P> <P> "Buses are just not adequate," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Despatches: Whites face a coloured future - Franschhoe / Patti Waldmeir feels the winds of change in a South African town KAREL PEPLER stands unsmiling behind the counter of his immaculate butcher shop in the pristine white town of Franschhoek in the Cape, and tries to find something positive to say about Frank Arendse. He is the small, brown man who has just become the first non-white mayor of a white town in South Africa. It is obviously difficult for Pepler, a prosperous Afrikaner, to believe that a 'coloured' (mixed race) farm labourer's son now wears the mayoral chain of a town ruled by whites since Huguenot refugees first settled in this spectacular cul-de-sac of the Franschhoek mountains in 1694. He is not alone in this - either in Franschhoek or in the rest of South Africa, where local government integration will eventually mean black, brown or Indian mayors in almost all towns. History, of course, is on Pepler's side: his is the name recorded on the tombstones in the old church graveyard, where the frontier families who founded Franschhoek are buried, while the 'coloured' population rates hardly a mention in the official town history. It notes merely that, in 1875, 'it was decided to establish a separate coloured congregation' of the local church, and that the congregation's first pastor, the Rev. Haylett, 'had to use great tact in persuading the three remaining coloured families adhering to the parent congregation to join the mission (coloured) congregation.' Three-quarters of a century later, in the 1950s, Franschhoek's leaders abandoned tact altogether and removed coloured residents forcibly from their houses in the town - with its gables and its wrought iron, a gem of Cape Dutch architecture - to Groendal, a site about 1km distant where the houses are cheap and crowded and the streets are dirt or mud. Power and prosperity remained in the white town, with its lovely vistas of granite mountains and vineyards. Now, almost 300 years after the first Huguenot settlement, history has driven Franschhoek to find a new political centre of gravity: among coloureds, who outnumber whites by 3,500 to 1,000, and to whom power will pass in a post-apartheid South Africa. The whites of Franschhoek (along with most in South Africa) have seen the future, and they know it is non-white. They have little choice: in Pepler's butchery, the clients are coloured and the shop assistant is coloured. Only Pepler is white. He assures me that many town residents oppose the idea of a coloured mayor (his neighbours say he is one of them, although he is too clever to say so to a journalist). Pepler's argument is more subtle: Arendse is inexperienced, he says, dismissing the whole issue by arguing that it hardly matters who is mayor of Franschhoek, anyway - the real power lies with the town clerk. Arendse reckons, though, that about 80 per cent of whites support him, and a straw poll of whites shopping in the high street on a sunny afternoon this week suggested he probably was right. Certainly, there was nothing to force white Franschhoek to choose a coloured mayor: until one month ago, the town council was all-white and always elected a mayor from its ranks. Last month, however, the administrator of the Cape province granted Franschhoek permission to merge the white council and the coloured 'management committee' which advised the council on coloured affairs, creating one of South Africa's first multi-racial local councils. Arendse was elected from the enlarged council on September 28, with votes from six coloured councillors and two whites (probably those who are members of the liberal Democratic party). A modest man who smiles nervously when speaking publicly (especially in English, his second language after Afrikaans), Arendse says he feels keenly the pressure to perform. 'If I can't deliver the goods, then the whole idea of one (multi-racial) council can be a flop in other parts of the country. All the eyes are on me: can a coloured man run a town?' Most whites say they are happy for him to try - so long as he does not support the African National Congress (ANC). The new mayor has assured them that he is no radical - he was a prison warder for 13 years at the same jail where Nelson Mandela spent his last years in captivity, and has since built up his own liquor and disco business in the township - but his friends say his sympathies are with the ANC (which, to his annoyance, has condemned him as a puppet because he was not elected democratically. Still, Pepler thinks nothing much will change in Franschhoek: the white council already was spending 70 per cent of the town budget on upgrading the coloured township (whites fund three-quarters of the budget with residential and commercial rates), and Arendse says it will be difficult to spend more without funding from outside, perhaps from overseas. Grudgingly, Pepler concedes the new mayor could prove a success, especially as there are 'lots of people (ie, whites) on the council to help him.' Does that mean he is ready for a black man as president? 'That's another thing altogether,' says the butcher, demonstrating that even if one irrational prejudice can be overcome, others remain. 'We're used to coloureds,' he explains. 'But blacks? No, we're not used to the blacks at all.' And that means Nelson Mandela.</p>

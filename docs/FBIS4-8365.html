			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, April 12 (TANJUG) -- The republic of Serb  Krajina (RSK) and Croatia are successfully cooperating on the  implementation of the agreement on ceasefire and troops  disengagement, the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  representatives said on Tuesday.    The delegations of RSK and the former Yugoslav republic of  Croatia signed the agreement to end hostilities and disengage  troops in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on March 30. The  agreement has been effective since April 4.    UNPROFOR representatives in Sector South, Alan Roberts and  Lieutenant Colonel Paule Sautvel, told a news conference that  heavy weapons had been completely withdrawn, that the withdrawal  of troops from the lines of confrontation is soon to be  completed, and that the problems of the four outstanding  locations will be solved by joint committees.    The deployment of U.N. peace-keepers along the line of  confrontation is still in progress and Roberts and Sautvel said  and their taking over is further delayed by the slow mine  clearance operations [sentence as received].    The conflict between RSK and Croatia broke out in 1991  following Croatia's forcible secession from former Yugoslav  federation and an attempt to reduce the status of the Serb  people to that of an ethnic minority. RSK was proclaimed by  Serbs in their ethnic and historical territories within the  arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia.    RSK has been U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March 1992,  and  UNPROFOR mandate was extended for another six months in March.</p>

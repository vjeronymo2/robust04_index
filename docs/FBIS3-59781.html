On 4 November,  Niihama city decided to remove the plant stoppage order;  Sumitomo Chemical, which received that order, is expected to  restart operations in a day or two and to switch to a shipping  system in December over a trial operating period of about one  month. As a result, the prospect for shipping restart from the  end of this year to the beginning of next year is premature.    Since Sumitomo Chemical's orthocresolnovolak epoxy fire,  voices wishing for the early restarting of the semiconductor  sealing material market have strengthened. While operations to  restart the plant are advancing smoothly and the turmoil in the  market during this period was avoided because of shipping  support from another company in the same industry, the restart  time of this plant was noted. Because of the stoppage canceling  order of the local Niihama city, the operation of novolak  facilities was restarted. This month it is expected to switch to  trial operations to receive sample shipping and user evaluation  and to make full scale shipping at the beginning of December.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Samper and Andres </F> Pastrana, the defeated New Democratic Force presidential  candidate, at unspecified locations by studio announcers and  reporters; from the "QAP" newscast -- live]    [Excerpts] [Ines Maria Zavarain] Good evening. Ernesto  Samper Pizano is the new Colombian president-elect. He won over  his contender Andres Pastrana by a margin of more than 132,000  votes. He is our special guest this evening. Good evening, Dr.  Samper.    [Samper] Good evening, how are you doing?    [Zavarain] Very well, thank you. Tell us, when you awoke  this morning, what was the first thing that came to your mind?  Perhaps you thought it had all been a dream?    [Samper] Well, no. I felt as if a piano had been lifted off  my head and an organ had been placed there instead. [sentence as  heard] It was a sensation that is very difficult to describe.    [Zavarain] Victor Javier Solano has a question for you.    [Solano] Dr. Samper, I have a question on soccer and  politics. Your campaign, at the last minute, used the figure of  Pibe Valderrama, but it is obvious that that player was not able  to get the team ready to face Romania in the World Soccer Cup  game. How can you guarantee that you will get your team ready  with the best?    [Samper] Well, I think that what happened to Pibe was a bad  afternoon. Pibe continues to be the best soccer player in  Colombia. I will follow his guidance on how to form teams to  give the next Colombian administration a team of young people  who are capable and honest, a polytechnical team. In other  words, not only a technical team, but one that it will assume  political responsibilities.    [Martha Lucia Avila] [Words indistinct] can you tell us?    [Samper] I am sorry; I was unable to hear you well.    [Zavarain] Go ahead Martha, ask your question.    [Avila] Dr. Samper, we would like to know who you missed in  this campaign? Who would you have liked to share this triumph  with?    [Samper] That is a good question. Perhaps I missed my  father, from whom I learned a lot, such as his teachings about  honesty and values. Also, I missed Luis Carlos Galan, who is  permanently in my thoughts. I remember him with special  affection today.    [Zavarain] Maribel do you have another question for Dr.  Samper?    [Maribel Osorio] Yes, Dr. Samper. You called for and  received the support of the alliance for Colombia. Does this  mean that during your government, we will see a Conservative, an  Anapista, a Christian, a representative of the black sector, a  General Maza, or how will you resolve the problem of these  alliances?    [Samper] Well, the truth is that all of these independent  sectors that accompanied me did so very loyally. I think they  contributed to my victory yesterday. Of course, they will have  a place in the government. That place, however, is not only  that they will be able to have a representative position in the  government, but also they will share in the government's project  of social investment, of increasing productive jobs, of the  peace project, on which we started working this very morning.  They will be involved in the next administration's project.    [Osorio] Let us return to the topic of the ministers and we  will ask you to give us a name, of the government minister or  the defense minister, for instance.    [Samper] If I could give you these names, I would gladly do  so. The truth is that forming a cabinet is like playing chess.  If you miss one of the plays, you mess up your whole game, so  you are going to have to wait awhile to learn the names.    [Osorio] Dr. Fernando Botero, for instance, has come up as  defense minister. Is that right, can you tell us something?    [Samper] He meets all the conditions for an excellent  defense  minister.    [Zavarain] Dr. Samper, Adriana Larota has a question from  Los  Angeles. Go ahead, Adriana.    [Larota] Mr. President [as heard], good evening. Now that it  is almost time for the whistle to be blown to start the game,  what do you think? Are you going to be an offensive or a  defensive player?    [Samper] Well, I will be on the offensive, but not on the  basis of fouls, corners, side throws, or out of bounds, but a  clean offensive, like that carried out by our Colombian team,  with a lot of plays and passes to make many goals for the many  problems that afflict Colombians.    [Zavarain] Dr. Samper, continuing with the topic of soccer,  as Pibe Valderrama says, everything is fine. Is everything fine?    [Samper] Everything is fine, everything is fine.    [Zavarain] All right, Dr. Samper, we ask you to stay with us  because we will return to you later in the cast. [passage  omitted]    [Zavarain] We now welcome Dr. Andres Pastrana. Good  evening, Dr. Pastrana.    [Pastrana] Good evening.    [Zavarain] We have invited you to pay tribute to your  campaign. After all, you received 3.5 million votes, the  highest number of votes received by a conservative candidate in  our history. We would like to know what you plan to do with all  that electoral support.    [Pastrana] I will continue working. The Colombian people  have given me a mandate of 3.5 million votes, which is 50  percent of the vote. Those 3.5 million votes are sending us a  message. They say that change is possible, that it is possible  to defeat the old policy, the machinery. They are telling us  that the country wants to build a new Colombia. Therefore, we  will work hard with those 3.5 million Colombians, and many more,  to build the Colombia we want so much.    [Unidentified reporter] Good evening, Dr. Pastrana. Last  night, after acknowledging the partial results of the elections,  you made a statement that has given rise to many doubts. I  invite you to hear the recording.    [Pastrana] Let us hear it.    [Begin Pastrana recording] That is why I assured the country  that a president who has received money from drug traffickers  has no moral authority to lead Colombia. [end recording]    [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, what exactly did you mean?    [Pastrana] You know that since Friday I have been deeply  concerned because, a week ago, the international media -- TIME  magazine, and other U.S. media -- published reports hinting that  drug money was being used in the political campaign. During the  previous campaign there were 18 candidates, and I insisted that  we all should send a note to the U.S. Government demanding  clarification of who they were referring to. Later on, when  only Dr. Samper and I were campaigning, the media insisted on  saying that there was money from drug trafficking. Therefore, I  sent a letter to Dr. Samper to tell him -- as I said in my  letter -- that I have no knowledge of any funds from drug  trafficking used in my campaign. Therefore, I swear before God  and my conscience that I can say to Colombians that there were  no such funds. I believed a reply to my letter from Dr. Samper  was important to tell the world that there was no money from  drug trafficking in our respective campaigns.    [Reporter] You have specifically said that there was no  money from drug trafficking in your campaign, and that there  were only two candidates. Do you mean that Ernesto Samper has  no moral authority to lead the country?    [Pastrana] No, no. In my letter to Dr. Samper, I invited  him to tell the world that if it was confirmed that there were  funds from drug trafficking in either of our campaigns, that  candidate would resign from the Colombian presidency because it  would be an affront to the Republic and the nation.    [Reporter] Did you receive a reply to that letter?    [Pastrana] No, I have not received a reply, but I hope Dr.  Samper...    [Reporter, interrupting] Do you have proof that drug money  was used in the electoral campaign?    [Pastrana] No, no. I simply said that no such funds were  used in my campaign, that I could swear before God and my  conscience that those funds did not exist. I invited Dr. Samper  to do the same so the world and the media would know that in  Colombia there is no drug money in our campaigns.    [Reporter] Will you participate directly in Samper's  government?    [Pastrana] I have not really thought about that yet. I am  currently talking with our people. Whether we participate or  not is not the real issue. My message to Dr. Samper is: We  will support you in all the good things you do. Whenever we  think we should criticize and contribute with our ideas, we will  do so. We are not in favor of the old policy in the sense that  if we are given a ministry, we will participate in the  government. If the government does a good job and we believe  that the results are good, Dr.Samper can be sure we will support  him. We will also criticize the government when necessary.    [Zavarain] Thank you, Dr. Pastrana.    [Congote] Ines Maria, before going to more news, I would  like to ask Dr. Ernesto Samper a question. Good evening, Dr.  Samper; this is Gloria Congote. In view of Dr. Pastrana's  proposal and to eliminate any doubts Colombians may have about  you, would you truly be willing to resign from the presidency  should it be discovered illegal funds were used in your campaign?    [Samper] Gloria, I do not think resignation is the issue. I  think the doubts expressed by Dr. Pastrana are reckless because  they compromise, in one way or another, the entire country in  the eyes of the nation [as heard]. I interpret it as an attempt  to discredit the electoral results. Over the past few days, I  have said emphatically that no drug money was used in my  campaign.    As proof I described the ethics code that has guided us from  the very beginning of the campaign, not just now at the end, as  Dr. Pastrana suggested, but for the entire year. We implemented  this code to keep an eye on all funds entering the national  treasury. I want to invite any reporter or anyone at all who  wants to review our books to check the origins of all funds. We  adopted this institutional procedure a year ago to monitor where  our resources were coming from.    [Congote] Dr. Samper, why didn't you answer Dr. Pastrana's  letter?    [Samper] I answered it publicly. I received his letter two  days after the media received it [chuckles]. I answered it as I  told you, and I repeat: A year ago, ours was the first campaign  team to worry about money of doubtful origin or about the  concentration of resources in the campaign. That is why we  established these procedures so we can show anyone our books and  the origins of the funds.    [Reporter] Dr. Samper, you said you will govern without  rancor. Would you include Andres Pastrana in your cabinet?    [Samper] I would if the right political conditions are  present. What are those conditions? The movement headed by Dr.  Pastrana must decide if it wants to be part of the opposition or  if it wants to cooperate with the government. If the latter is  true, we would define the terms for this possible cooperation,  and as I said before the campaign, I would be pleased to have  Dr. Andres Pastrana.    [Reporter] Dr. Samper, given the very hectic campaign of the  past three weeks, what will you be doing in the days prior to  assuming office?    [Samper] I will plan the transition process this week. I  will tell you that we will hold the first transition meeting  between my campaign team and the government team at 1700 on 21  June. President Gaviria and I will participate. We will hold  three transition meetings this week. The government drafted a  document, which we are already analyzing, on carrying out a  trouble-free transition. We will continue working.    [Zavarain] Dr. Samper, will you accompany the Colombian  soccer team to upcoming games?    [Samper] Yes, I am thinking about accompanying the Colombian  team to Sunday's game; that is, to the definitive match when  everything is at stake.</p>

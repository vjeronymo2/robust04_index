Since 1981, the number of beds has fallen by more than  120,000, a decrease of 34 percent.    The number of hospital beds fell from 242,000 in 1991-92 to  231,363 in 1992-93,a drop by 4.4 percent.    South West Thames regional health authority suffered the  largest loss of beds, a total of 1,713, followed by West  Midlands RHA which lost 1,555 and South Western RHA which lost  1,149.    Mr. David Blunkett, Shadow Health Secretary, said: "These  figures confirm what we all suspected. The NHS is slowly being  whittled away. We now know why patients have to wait so long for  treatment or on trolleys in the corridors of hospitals.    "It is appalling that nearly 11,000 beds can be lost in just  one year. When is the Secretary of State going to provide for  the million people on the waiting list?"    Dr. Brian Mawhinney, Health Minister, said Mr Blunkett was  confusing the number of beds in the NHS with the number of  patients treated but there was no correlation between the two.    The number of patients treated was increasing because the  length of time they stayed in hospital was dropping and GP's  were carrying out more minor surgical procedures.    -- An extra &pound;83 will be available for health spending  on  each household as a result of planned increases in NHS spending  in the coming financial year, Mrs. Bottomley, Health Secretary,  says today in a New Year message to health service staff.</p>

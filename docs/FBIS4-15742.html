			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russia Intends To Join European </F> Union"]    [Text] At talks in Moscow with a delegation of U.S.  parliamentarians headed by Richard Gephardt, leader of the  Republican minority in the U.S. Congress, Russian Federation  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin reaffirmed the Russian  Federation's intention to seek the G-7's transformation at its  next summit in Naples into a G-8 with Russian participation.  Reporting on the conversation held behind closed doors Valeriy  Grishin, first deputy leader of the Russian Federation  Government's Press Service, said that the statement by the head  of the cabinet was met with understanding and support by the  U.S. parliamentarians.    V. Chernomyrdin also stressed that the Russian Government  has  not counted on foreign credits, and is not doing so. In this  context he noted that the question of the allocation to Russia  by the IMF of the second part of the system credits, worth $1.5  billion, "largely bears a political character." The head of the  cabinet remarked that there are forces in the United States  which are attempting to restrict the Russian Federation's access  to, and undermine its role in, world markets. The premier said  that Russia is not interested in privileges, but in equal  partnership opportunities in trade.    In V. Grishin's words, the U.S. congressmen expressed  support  for the course of reforms being carried out by V. Chernomyrdin's  government.    The statement by Russian Federation Government Chairman  Viktor Chernomyrdin that Russia is ready to submit its  application for membership of the European Union [EU] provoked  animated discussions at EU headquarters in Brussels. This  statement from the Russian premier at a press conference on the  results of his visit to Budapest was interpreted here as  sensational.    A press relations aide to European Commission Member Hans  van  den Broek noted in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent  that right now the union has no answers to a whole range of  questions linked to EU expansion. This is attested by the  difficulties over the accession of Austria, Finland, Sweden, and  Norway. He recalled that Cyprus, Turkey, and Malta have long  been waiting in line for EU membership. Talks on the further  expansion of the EU will hardly begin before 1996, when a  conference on bringing the union's institutions into line with  realities arising subsequent to the Maastricht agreements is  scheduled.    As for Russia, the EU representative stressed, it has  completely different dimensions to any other European country.  An agreement on EU cooperation with Russia should undoubtedly  be concluded. But the accession to the union of such a big  country with a mighty and extremely specific economy is hard to  envisage even in the long term. Even if the EU does somehow  manage to "swallow" Hungary and Poland, in the case of Russia  the question arises: "Who is to join whom?"</p>

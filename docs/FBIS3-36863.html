This  was a statistically substantiated conclusion made at a science  and practical conference, which took place in the Plavskiy  district of the Tula region on Tuesday. The conference was held  with participation of experts of the Moscow-based Academy of  Medical Sciences.    Although the Plavskiy district got the most significant  portion of the radioactive pollution in the Tula region, not a  single case of acute radioactive exposure was registered,  according to the statistics.    Moreover, according to the data on the regional spread of  various diseases, the situation in the district is even safer  than average in the region and in the districts with a good  record in this respect. There are fewer cases of child  mortality, diseases of the endocrine system and congenital  anomalities among its population.    However, the fact that inhabitants have come to apply to the  hospitals for medical assistance more rarely over the last few  years, casts a shadow of doubt over the reliability of the  statistics.    According to Yelena Kuznetsova, who works for the Regional  Committee for Environmental Protection, which studies the  problems of the Chernobyl aftermath, the statistics must be  treated cautiously, whereas the fact that the inhabitants of the  district neglect medical services causes serious concern.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Minister's threat puts Italian coalition in jeopardy The survival of Italy's three-party coalition government led by Mr Silvio Berlusconi was in danger last night, following the resignation threat of a senior cabinet minister in a worsening row over a decree curbing the power of magistrates. Mr Roberto Maroni, minister for home affairs and deputy to Mr Berlusconi, accused cabinet colleagues of trickery. He said he had been deceived about the contents of the decree, promulgated last week, which has already led to the release from jail of several well-known politicians and business people accused of involvement in the 'tangentopoli', or bribesville, corruption scandal. Mr Berlusconi said yesterday evening that Mr Maroni's accusations were not true. He demanded that his deputy make an unconditional withdrawal of the accusations or resign. The cabinet crisis and trial of strength between Mr Berlusconi and members of his government come at the start of a week when the government's economic policy is scheduled to be announced. Mr Maroni, who said he should not have trusted his cabinet colleagues when he sought assurances that the decree would not lead to the freeing of suspects, told his party, the populist Northern League, that he was ready to resign from government. However, the League's executive yesterday declined Mr Maroni's offer to resign from Mr Berlusconi's cabinet. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, said the deputy prime minister enjoyed the full confidence and support of the party. Mr Bossi said the decree should be withdrawn. He said the affair should not be used as an excuse for fresh parliamentary elections, which Mr Berlusconi has threatened to call on several occasions since assuming power two months ago. A firm line against corruption has been a fundamental part of the Northern League's policy. Any softening of this position would threaten the standing of Mr Bossi, and the release of those under investigation might be seen as a sign of weakening. Mr Bossi's call for withdrawal of the decree aims to reassure his party's followers. Similar calls were made this weekend by the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance party, government partners with the League and Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia. In common with the League, the MSI takes a strong line against corruption. With two of the coalition members expressing serious misgivings about the decree, Mr Berlusconi has been left isolated. Opinion polls suggest the public is against the decree and supports the Milan investigating magistrates who resigned in protest last week. Ministers trade blows, Page 2 Observer, Page 15</p>

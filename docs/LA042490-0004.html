			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO FILE: TORRES PROPOSES STATE-RUN AIRLINE TO FIGHT HIGH FARES  </P> <P> Unhappy with intrastate air fares? Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) has  introduced a bill that would create a state-run airline to provide low-cost  competition for the private air carriers.  </P> <P> Torres said his bill (SB 2900) is a response to consumer complaints about high  airline fares between such cities as Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and  Sacramento. He called it an outrage that, for example, air travelers between  Los Angeles and Sacramento -- of whom Torres is one -- have to pay up to $576  for a round-trip ticket.  </P> <P> "This fare-gouging inhibits the natural flow of commerce and tourist travel and  presents barriers to citizen participation in government," the Senator said.  </P> <P> His measure would establish a nonprofit state corporation financed by revenues  from transporting passengers, baggage and freight between major California  cities.  </P> <P> The legislative analyst's office has been asked to prepare a detailed report on  a proposed state-run airline by July 1.  </P> <P> GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Issued a proclamation designating April 22-28 as California Consumers Week.  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Floor Action  </P> <P> Telephones: Passed 50-14 and sent to the Senate a bill (AB 2889) by  Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) that would prevent telephone companies  from raising the cost of calls within communities where phone service areas are  divided by the addition of new area codes. "A local call before the area code  split will remain a local call after the area code split," Moore said. She said  the measure was prompted by the creation of a new area code -- 310 -- in the  Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Sales Tax: Passed 44-27 and sent to the Senate a bill (AB 3670) by Assemblyman  Sam Farr (D-Carmel) to permit counties to impose a 1/2-cent sales tax increase  with voter approval of only a simple majority rather than a two-thirds  majority.  </P> <P> More Taxes: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 61-2 vote a constitutional  amendment (ACA 3) by Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-Long Beach) to allow the  Legislature to increase the homeowners' property tax exemption from $7,000  upwards on a sliding scale basis for home buyers who change homes, depending on  when the home was purchased.  </P> <P> Women: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 45-26 vote a bill (AB 2678) by  Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) declaring it to be official state  policy that the percentage of women on appointed boards and commissions  accurately reflects the percentage of women in the state's population.  </P> <P> Parks: Passed and returned to the Senate for concurrence in Assembly amendments  on a 64-0 vote a bill (SB 752) by Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) asking for  a state study on allowing people over 62 years old to obtain park use passes at  a reduced cost.  </P> <P> Police: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 53-0 vote a bill (AB 2692) by  Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) to require anyone over 18 to come to  the aid of a nonuniformed law enforcement officer who requests such aid and  shows an official badge.  </P> <P> Capital Fact  </P> <P> There are more than 200 accredited members of the Capitol Correspondents Assn.,  who keep a collective eye on the 120-member state Legislature and inform the  public about its activities.  </P></p>

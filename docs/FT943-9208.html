			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Bonds Interest rate rises in Sweden and Italy yesterday set alarm bells ringing in bond markets across Europe. But the logic which suggests that other countries are bound to follow looks flawed. Sweden and Italy both face specific problems in reducing their budget deficits which are not replicated elsewhere. True, their moves are a reminder that a general turn in rates is inevitable once the recovery is firmly entrenched. But despite falls of over 1 point in the German government bond market, the Bundesbank is unlikely to tighten in the short term. Indeed if currency pressures on high deficit European countries intensify, a strong D-Mark may speak for delay.</p>

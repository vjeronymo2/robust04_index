			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: FMC and Harsco in Dollars 1.2bn military vehicle merger FMC, the diversified chemicals group, and Harsco, the equipment manufacturing business, plan to combine their military vehicle businesses in the latest example of a merger wave in the US defence industry. The two said the combined business would have estimated sales in 1993 of about Dollars 1.2bn and would be owned 60 per cent by FMC and 40 per cent by Harsco. FMC, with interests ranging from chemicals to machinery and equipment, will put into the partnership its Defence Systems group, which employs more than 6,000 people. Its best-known product is the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, a tracked vehicle armed with automatic cannon which saw extensive action with US troops in the Gulf war. Harsco will put into the group its BMY-Combat Systems division, which employs 2,000 people and makes tracked vehicles for artillery and combat support functions. The deal is part of a trend for US defence companies to merge their activities in a bid for greater efficiencies as the US defence budget shrinks following the end of the Cold War. Mr Malcolm Gambill, chairman of Harsco, said the two businesses were a natural fit and would be a 'powerhouse in tracked vehicles'. The deal would lead to some consolidation, with the removal of unneeded higher cost capacity. The new company will include FMC's naval systems division and its steel products division, which makes military track. However, Harsco will retain its BMY-Wheeled Vehicles division, which makes five-ton army trucks and has been suffering a dearth of orders.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-WESTERN CLERIC ELECTED IRAN SPEAKER  </P> <P> Iran's Parliament showed its radical bent Wednesday by electing a fiercely  anti-Western cleric to the powerful post of speaker.  </P> <P> The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report monitored in Nicosia, said Mehdi  Karrubi, 52, was chosen over moderate Ali Akbar Nategh-Noori by a 147-92 vote.  </P> <P> He will succeed Hashemi Rafsanjani, regarded as a centrist, who is to be sworn  in as president today. Rafsanjani reportedly backed Nategh-Noori.  </P> <P> Karrubi's election had been expected because of the balance of forces in the  single-chamber Majlis, where hard-liners favoring a militant foreign policy  strengthened their hold in April, 1988, elections.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani, 54, who won last month's presidential election by a landslide, will  be responsible to the Majlis, which sets the outlines of domestic and foreign  policies and has the right to impeach the president andministers.  </P> <P> However, Karrubi's election is viewed as unlikely to affect Iran's stance on  many key issues, such as the fate of Western hostages held by pro-Iranian  militants in Lebanon. Such issues traditionally have been decided by a handful  of top leaders in Iran.  </P> <P> Karrubi, who was deputy speaker of the Majlis for several years, led  anti-Western demonstrations in Mecca during the annual hajj pilgrimage in 1987.  Clashes with Saudi security forces resulted in the deaths of more than 400  people, most of them Iranians. Karrubi later blamed the deaths on "a calculated  plot designed by American and Israeli advisers."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Forty percent of claimants filing for disability benefits and polled in a recent SSA survey had filed for or received benefits from Aid to Families with Dependent Children, welfare or social services within the past year. Approximately three-fourths of them were granted this assistance and three-fourths of those grantees were still receiving assistance when they applied for disability benefits. SSA has the opportunity to develop productive relationships with these social service entities to improve the processing of disability claims for mutual customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technological advances such as personal computers, facsimile machines, electronic mail, and videoconferencing are increasingly available to our claimants, their representatives, medical providers and other third parties involved in the disability process. SSA can take advantage of these capabilities to offer expanded service options and to modernize the ways it interacts with providers of claims-related information and evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Current Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The procedures in the current process have not changed in any significant way since the DI program began in the 1950s, a time when caseloads, demographic characteristics of claimants, types of disabilities, and available technology were radically different. In the 1970s, Congress federalized State programs of cash assistance to the aged, blind and disabled into the SSI program and added this to the responsibilities of SSA. SSA adopted the DI disability determination procedures for SSI blind and disabled claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Slow, Manual Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the current process, a disability claim passes through from 1 to 4 decisional paths to receive a favorable decision. The initial claim, reconsideration, ALJ hearing and Appeals Council review levels all involve multi-step uniform procedures for evidence collection, review, and decisionmaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4190&hyph;29&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d639 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEN19SE94.068 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4190&hyph;29&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

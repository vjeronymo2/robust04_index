			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Ireland fund gets Pounds 40m EU boost A Pounds 40m boost for the Northern Ireland peace process was announced yesterday by the European Commission in a direct response to the IRA ceasefire. The money will go to the International Fund for Ireland over the next three years and is one-third more than had been planned. The commission said: 'This should be seen as a first, practical response towards helping the peace process.' Officials have already started consultations with the London and Dublin governments on how to tailor the aid in the wake of the latest peace moves. Northern Ireland in particular has qualified for huge payments from Brussels. It is one of the poorest regions of the EU and has one of the highest unemployment rates. Spending of about Pounds 1bn is already earmarked for Northern Ireland over the next six years.</p>

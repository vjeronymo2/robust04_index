			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Technology: Factory cranes get smart Factory cranes have long been taken for granted by industrial users, but the drive for increased productivity is prompting customers to seek more sophisticated solutions for their handling needs. Enter, the thinking crane. The trend towards more efficient stock control, smaller warehouses and just-in-time production, calls for faster, more productive and safer cranes, which, in turn, requires sophisticated controls of electric motors. In March, Cheshire-based Street Crane, one of the market leaders for electric overhead travelling cranes, responded by beginning Hoist 2000, a Pounds 500,000 project to develop the use of programmable logic controllers in hoists. The aim is to develop programmable speed control for cranes, incorporating changes of speed to accelerate the movement of components around a factory or distribution centre without compromising on safety. For the first time, Street has won support for its technology development from the Department of Trade and Industry, which is funding the most innovative parts of the project with Pounds 300,000. In its most developed form, the Hoist 2000 will incorporate in-built condition monitoring to record cycles of operation and events such as overloading. This will allow users to undertake planned maintenance, detect abuse of the crane and monitor safety of operation. The project is still under development, but Street is already selling cranes incorporating another PLC-based initiative called Smart Options. This embraces two developments, SC. Smartlift and SC. Smartdrive, which enable the crane's horizontal and vertical motions to be pre-programmed. SC. Smartlift monitors the speed 25 times per second.</p>

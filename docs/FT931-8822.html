			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Concession on asylum bill MINISTERS staved off defeat by an all-party coalition of peers yesterday over its proposed changes to asylum law, with a last-minute concession which would introduce a further safeguard into the system. Led by Lord Ackner, a law lord, many peers argued that there should continue to be a right of appeal against refusal of entry for a short visit or as a student, but that this would be streamlined by introducing a role for an adjudicator, who would decide whether someone should have leave to appeal. But Lord Ferrers, the Home Office minister, promised that at all the larger posts abroad dealing with immigration cases a new scheme would ensure that a senior manager would review at the end of each day all refusals by entry clearance officers, and where a decision was reversed a visa would be issued. An adjudication system would, he argued, be almost as cumbersome as the present 'appeals edifice' and was not really necessary for the problem it was aimed at addressing. Lord Ackner said that some form of filter was needed, because one in about five cases succeeded in appeal last year, and there was a risk that if there were no right of appeal the number of cases where entry clearance officers made a wrong decision was likely to rise to one in two or three. 'Without an opportunity to have a decision scrutinised,' he said, 'consciously or subconsciously, arbitrariness tends to become part of the decision process'. Baroness Flather, a Tory backbencher, said that unless there was a review procedure the powers that entry clearance officers would have would 'not be acceptable in a liberal democracy'. The government won the decision by 148 votes to 124.</p>

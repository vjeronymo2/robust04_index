			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yaroslav Falko, Zaporizhzhya: "The Motor-Sich </F> Aircraft Engine Plant Has Converted To Producing Ukrainian  People's Deputies"]    [Text] Adhering to a long-time Zaporyzhzhyan  conviction--The more atamans [chiefs] there are, the better it  is for the Cossacks--the voters in this oblast put up more than  200 candidates for the office of people's deputy; that is almost  15 candidates for each of the 18 election districts. And in the  Sich, at the very heart of European-type democracy--the  Leninskyy Rayon of Zaporizhzhya--the electoral commission  registered as many as 30 candidates. More than 100 persons had  originally been put up there. One contender has already died....  The activists in election matters complain that most of the  candidates cannot even write up their own biographical sketches  without making mistakes. They need to work on their A,B,C's....    An analysis of the pre-election lists leads us inevitably to  the following conclusion, which may seem paradoxical at first  glance: The nomenklatura of the local power structure has, in  effect, withdrawn itself from contention for the deputies'  seats. Not a single presidential representative is on the  ballot, nor are any chairmen of local or rayon councils. Not  even those bureaucratic officials of the state administration,  who have not withstood the temptation to scamper off to Kiev,  have any desire to beat their own bosses soundly. In a country  where elections are won by the group that organizes them such  behavior in Zaporizhzhya by the "party of Kravchuk" and the  "party of Plyushch" must seem surprising at the least. However,  their tactics may be easily explained: The nomenklatura here  does not wish to win the elections; it intends instead to lose  them. And that certainly does not require much effort. Inasmuch  as an outright victory by any one candidate on the ballot in  Zaporizhzhya seems highly doubtful in the first round, the  second round could indeed put an end to these elections with all  the hustle and bustle around them. The people in Zaporizhzhya  might very well ignore their obligation to go somewhere and vote  for someone for a second week in a row. And unless two-thirds of  the body of deputies has been elected after these two rounds,  the elections may be deemed a political nullity. In that case  the present-day Supreme Council would automatically continue its  powers of office--an eventuality which would fully suit the  nomenklatura of Plyushch and Kravchuk. At present they are more  concerned with the elections to the local councils--elections  for which they must, indeed, prepare. And in order to prepare,  they need a time-out....    Under such conditions the deputies' seats will be divided up  amongst themselves virtually without a struggle by the agrarians  and the clan of industrialists (if, indeed, the elections take  place at all). Judging from how very carefully the card game of  solitaire for the election districts has been laid out from the  "left-wingers," it has become understood that these elections  are being directed from a single center. This center is, without  a doubt, the headquarters staff of the "party of  industrialists"--the gigantic Motor-Sich Aircraft Engine Plant,  which is headed up by General Director V'yacheslav Bohuslayev,  who is also president of the Inter-Regional Association of  Industrialists. This association combines the industrial  structures of seven oblasts in the southern and eastern portions  of Ukraine. It claims the status of an independent organization,  although--at the same time--it is contriving to join up with the  Ukrainian Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.    It is interesting that the largest party organization in  Zaporizhzhya--the Labor Party--which was created, incidentally,  by the above-mentioned Inter-Regional Association of  Industrialists--put up only four persons as candidates. This  party's leaders have taken a different path. Taking note of the  fact that Zaporyzhzhyans have traditionally leaned toward  communists and socialists and that the Labor Party is little  known by the "work collective," they have recruited a large  number of recent party organizers from various enterprises.    Zaporizhzhya is probably the weakest link in the  Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms. Leonid Kuchma is regarded quite  coolly here, especially because he chose Volodymyr Hrynyov as an  ally. Furthermore, the Zaporizhzhyan industrialists have their  own influential leader--the above-mentioned director of  Motor-Sich, Bohuslayev, who has laid claim to primacy throughout  the entire southern region of Ukraine. As we have learned from  the corridors of political power, after Fokin's resignation,  Bohuslayev's name--along with that of Kuchma--was prominent in  the lists of contenders for the position of prime minister.    With regard to Volodymyr Hrynyov, he is an extremely  unpopular person in Zaporizhzhya--regardless of the fact that  this oblast is a Russian-speaking one, i.e., with quite a high  percentage of ethnic Russians. It is noteworthy that, when he  ran for the office of president, Hrynyov garnered less than 1.5  percent of the votes. He is not supported either by the  Zaporizhzhyan entrepreneurs or by the industrialists. Volodymyr  Hrynyov intends to rely on the president of the Zaporizhzhyan  Commodity Exchange, Kalika, although it seems the he does not  have very much support from that quarter either.    The national-democratic parties have virtually no chances in  Zaporizhzhya. They lack any dazzling, charismatic leaders. The  overwhelming majority of them live by old slogans, which are  quaint and ridiculous in the environment where the average  Zaporizhzhyan citizen lives. If in the Kam'yansko-Dniprovskyy  Rayon victory is gained by the candidate from Energodar--the  site of the Zaporyzhzhyan nuclear specialists, in the  Komunarskyy Rayon of the oblast center--by the Zaporizhzhyan  capitalist, Petro Saboshuk, and in the Leninskyy Rayon of  Zaporizhzhya--by the leader of the parliamentary faction of the  PDVU [Party for the Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine], Ukrainian  People's Deputy Serhiy Sobolev, then it can be considered that  the national-democrats will have succeeded in gaining 3 out of  the 18 seats involved here. The remainder of the "travel passes"  to the Supreme Council will be divided up approximately equally  among the "party of the state directors" and the agrarians. By  the way, that is also the present-day composition of the  Zaporizhzhyan body of deputies.</p>

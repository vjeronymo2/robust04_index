			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing in &sect;123.8(e) to exempt tags as defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.3(t) from the recordkeeping requirements of &sect;123.8. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the information on tags must be saved in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed requirements of this section and &sect;123.28(d), the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has tentatively concluded that it would be burdensome for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors to be required to retain the tags themselves for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended periods of time. NSSP now provides that processors are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to retain tags for 90 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;123.9 requires that each processor and importer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employ at least one individual who has successfully completed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training course on the application of HACCP to fish and fishery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products processing. The agency has tentatively concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training is critical to the successful implementation of HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems in the seafood industry. Based on experience obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the FDA/NOAA HACCP pilot programs in 1991&hyph;92, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that a significant portion of the seafood industry will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be unprepared to meet the requirements of a mandatory HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program without some training. As discussed earlier, the pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program revealed a general lack of understanding of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventive nature of HACCP, including misunderstandings about how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish critical limits, control measures, corrective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions, and recordkeeping procedures (Ref. 40).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A similar concern that the industry did not understand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of HACCP principles formed the basis for the training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in the agency's regulations for low acid canned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foods. Improvements in canning operations can be attributed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant measure to the success of the training programs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were established to implement that requirement (Ref. 54). NAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that the successful application of HACCP principles to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low acid canned foods was substantially the result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training requirement in the regulations for those products (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 36, p. 309). The CGMP regulations for foods in part 110 also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> call for training in appropriate food protection principles (&sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 110.10(c)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The often seasonal nature, remote location, and small size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of many seafood processors also support the need for formalized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training. All of these conditions result in difficulty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recruiting highly qualified management and supervisory staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, FDA has tentatively concluded that proposed &sect;123.9 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to ensure that seafood processors and importers employ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least one person who is familiar with HACCP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations propose to require at &sect;123.9 that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person or persons at each importing and processing establishment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who has received training be responsible for reviewing records of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control point monitoring, recognizing critical limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies, and assessing the need for corrective actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to the product in question and the HACCP plan itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While it is the intent of the agency to provide as much guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as possible to assist processors and importers, these activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require specialized training in the principles of HACCP, various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspects of food science, and the criteria of existing regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency anticipates that 2- or 3-day training sessions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modeled after the Better Process Control Schools currently in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place for low acid canned food and acidified food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, will be provided by various public and semiprivate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. The uniformity of this training can be assured by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a review of their contents and by periodic onsite monitoring by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency. Thus, FDA is proposing to require that the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of instruction be approved by the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While 2- or 3-day courses may well become the norm, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites comment on whether the training requirement could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied by different gradations of training, depending on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexity or size of the operation, or on the degree of risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> posed by the product being produced, without compromising the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes for which training is proposed to be required. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, could training for a small business with few hazards be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished in a shorter time and at a lower cost through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of a video? FDA also invites comment on whether training in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP received before these proposed regulations become effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as final regulations should be ``grandfathered'' as fulfilling the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

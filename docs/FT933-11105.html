			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: TSB deal hopes Rumours revived that BAT Industries may move to buy Hill Samuel. Sector specialists said the speculation was feasible, considering BAT's interest in finance via Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star. Hill Samuel is well known as being open to sale from its parent, TSB. One analyst said that while there appeared to be nothing visible to explain the recent bout of rumours, it would also not be a surprising event if BAT were to make a move. BAT moved up 13 1/2 to 459p in turnover of 6.2m shares while TSB added 4 1/2 at 205 1/2 p in volume of 5.8m. It was also enjoying some confidence from recent figures. The bank sector was generally strong in line with the market hopes on interest rate cuts. Barclays went ahead 8 to 487p and HSBC appreciated 10 to 649p, while National Westminster advanced 10 to 501p in very strong volume of 9m. Water shares enjoyed a bounce as investors were attracted to their high yields. All the stocks made significant gains on the day, with Anglian, Severn Trent and Thames Water favoured for buying by Smith New Court and SG Warburg. But although the premium yields, especially ahead of interest rate cuts and with gilts performing well, make the stocks gain strength, an industry specialist warned against letting confidence run too far in the sector. Ms Angela Whelan of BZW said the stocks had been due for a rise as they had recently lagged behind the performance of the regional electricity companies and their showing was not necessarily a sign of a significant turn. Anglian moved up 10 to 486p, Southern 22 to 512p, Severn 12 1/2 to 488 1/2 p, Thames 12 to 489p, Welsh 15 to 558p, Wessex 17 to 591p, Northumbrian 10 to 595p and Yorkshire 13 to 499p. Pharmaceutical group Zeneca, newly demerged from ICI, produced results at the top end of market expectations and the shares forged ahead 24 to 646p, its highest ever level. Turnover was a hefty 8.6m. Zeneca said sales of agrochemicals rose 10 per cent in the first half to Pounds 825m, but trading profit fell 11 per cent to Pounds 85m, reflecting tough competition in world markets. Total pharmaceutical sales increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 924m, with trading profit 34 per cent ahead at Pounds 302m. The market was also cheered by a better than expected dividend. Most brokers upgraded, Smith New Court lifting its profits figure by Pounds 63m to Pounds 650m for the full year. However, the house is cautious about the long term outlook for Zeneca and prefers SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome. Both eased a penny to 461p and 695p respectively. Profit-takers nibbled away at Reuters Holdings, which slipped 7 to 1432p, losing more of the advance it made early this week on its share buy-back programme. Unigate's decision to sell its Arlington Motors division to Lex Service for Pounds 49.5m was seen as positive for the dairy group and the shares finished 8 up at 354p. The company said the proceeds would be used to reduce debt. Lex jumped 18 to 411p. The German cut in the Lombard rate had direct impact on those stocks with large interests in Germany and Redland moved ahead 16 to 504p. RMC rose 11 to 797p. Following the same path was Hepworth, 7 higher at 364p. Both Redland and RMC have enjoyed a steady climb in recent sessions on the back of hopes over the rate cut. Happier forecasts for the car industry rubbed off on Laird Group, which strengthened 14 to 335p in moderate volume of 1.3m shares. The group benefited from a growth in orders from Volkswagen, and the good results from Ford Motor and Chrysler in the US. GKN is inspiring investor interest in anticipation of its results due next week. The shares rose 8 to 477p. Similar expectation pushed up Glynwed 11 1/2 to 306 1/2 p. Its results are also due next week. Bid mutterings surrounded the unusually large volume of 1.2m in Excalibur, the jewellery and engineering company, which put on 2 at 15p. One analyst said fingers were being pointed at Suter, which owns a large stake in Excalibur. The recent agreement on the Manchester Ship Canal continued to benefit Peel Holdings, which advanced 12 in a tight market to 261p. Hopes of enfranchisement and positive sentiment ahead of forthcoming results pushed Pifco 'A' limited voting stock up 25 to 493p. An analyst said the company had signalled it would like to get rid of its two-tier shares system.</p>

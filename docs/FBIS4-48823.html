			<p>BFN     [Text] Senate May 27 SAPA -- Discussions with rightwing  leaders had shown that there could no longer be talk about  extreme right- and leftwing radicals -- because they  complemented each other, president Mr Nelson Mandela said on  Friday. Replying to debate in the Senate on his opening address  to parliament, he said: "We are now coming together,  complementing one another in a stimulating environment. When I  think about the future of our country, I do so with the  realisation...all South Africans, black and white, are now  united in the enlightening job of building a new country."    Mr Mandela said leaders would have to counter many attacks  and criticism, some of which was justified. However, "we must  concentrate on nation-building, stress those issues which unite  us".    He said that when listening to debate in parliament, he had  been left with no doubt that the country had started a new era.  "We have reached the stage where we look at each other as  fellow South Africans." There had been fights in the past, but  it had to be buried and past wounds healed.    The majority of Africans coloureds and Indians had not had  the same education opportunities as whites. "You (whites) now  have knowledge skills and expertise. We cannot build this  country without that knowledge, skills and expertise. We want  you to take leadership in the new South Africa. "Your future is  secure, you can no longer...fear democracy."</p>

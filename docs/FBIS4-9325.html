			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Joint attacks launched by Karadzic's fascists and  Abdic's phalanges of traitors [Muslim forces of self-proclaimed  autonomous province of western Bosnia founded by Fikret Abdic]  were intensified today. Chetniks repeated their artillery  attacks on the central part of the Bosanska Krupa area this  afternoon [words indistinct].    Since last night members of rebel-traitor units [Muslims  loyal to Abdic] have been launching artillery attacks on the  Liskovac, Todorovo, and Varoska Rijeka areas. On several  occasions they were backed by chetniks from the so-called Serb  Krajina in shelling the areas mentioned. The focus of today's  attacks was the Medik medical equipment factory in Skokovi.  Several attempts at an infantry breakthrough were made during  the day and this afternoon a sabotage group from Trzac [town  held by forces loyal to Abdic] was destroyed. Many people were  wounded today and one person was killed. [passage omitted]</p>

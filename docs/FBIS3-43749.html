			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] in the Transvaal  says some Zulus will be staying away from work on Monday. The  Transvaal IFP leader Themba Khoza says the stayaway call has  been made by local traditional Zulu leaders and not the IFP.  Khoza was speaking at a news conference called to explain an  apparent clash between IFP national and the Transvaal region.  Reports have said that West Rand IFP leader Humphrey Ndlovu  called on Zulus to stay away and to go to Pretoria's Union  Buildings on Monday. That's because President F.W. de Klerk is  meeting Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. IFP national spokesman  Ziba Jiyane distanced the IFP from the call, now Khoza says  Ndlovu was misquoted.    [Begin Khoza recording] The entire operations rest on the  Zulu leaders, in other words, traditional leaders,  representatives of Amakhosi [chiefs] in these regions who met  yesterday and who actually issued the statement. The long and  the short of the story is that the IFP is not the one who is  doing the job. [end recording]</p>

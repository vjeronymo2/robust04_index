			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (25): What makes the top dogs tick A HEAD FOR BUSINESS by Corinne Simcock Kogan Page Pounds 16.95, 164 pages WHAT MAKES a top manager tick? Corinne Simcock has tried to find out by interviewing 13 senior British managers on how they have run their affairs during the recession. The best corporate survival strategy, it turns out, is to keep a firm grip on cash-flow. If costs have to be cut, the knife should go in clean, deep and early. That said, there is no single recipe for success. Sir Owen Green, outspoken chairman of BTR, is dismissive of the fashion for returning to basics or core business. He calls it 'hocus-pocus.' The core, he says, 'is 'that which is left after the apple is eaten.' By contrast, Christopher Lewinton, whose TI Group recently acquired the Dowty engineering concern, believes companies should concentrate on preparing themselves for slow growth for years to come. According to Sir Christopher Hogg of Courtaulds, 'companies survive because they do things for their customers which are distinctive and which their customers want. There's no other reason.' All this sounds like good common sense - but it is hardly original. Perhaps the fault lies in Ms Simcock's failure to draw her subjects out sufficiently. Nor, though, do the assembled great and the good sound particularly brilliant in their comments on everyday life. Sir Owen Green's reservations about Europe are the kind of chatter one could hear in any Home Counties pub. Sir Graham, admittedly, comes across as one of the most thoughtful of the business leaders. It is sobering to realise, as he points out, that the Rover group spends Pounds 30m a year more on training than would be needed if its employees had education up to German standards. What binds these people together is an enormous sense of self-confidence and, generally, of their own worth. Several have difficulty focusing on that part of their contribution which is intended to examine their weaknesses. The other factors are stamina and a sometimes astonishing dedication to the job in hand. Mr Jon Foulds, chairman of the Halifax Building Society, recounts that when he was at 3i, he started looking forward to Mondays as soon as it got to Friday night. Surely, Mr Foulds, there is more to life than that?</p>

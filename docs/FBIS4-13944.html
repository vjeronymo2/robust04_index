			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "We Will Not Tolerate Mistakes That </F> Affect Our Faith. Kingdom's Relations With Islamic World Are  Excellent"]    [Text] Jeddah, AL-HAYAH -- The Custodian of the Two Holy  Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz has stressed that his  government is not prepared to tolerate mistakes related to the  Islamic faith and that it has no intention of harming any Saudi  individual through his wealth. He spoke of the "strength of  Saudi relations with the Islamic states." He said: "We are the  friends of all within our capabilities and within mutual  interests."    In a comprehensive statement to the media on 22 April during  his inspection tour of the central station of the prophet's holy  mosque services in holy Medina, King Fahd said: "In the midst  of the bliss we are enjoying we should expect that someone would  come and try to spoil it, but nobody would be able to do that  because the people and all their institutions are unanimous in  preventing and deterring these things."    He emphasized that divine will, not human capability, was  behind the completion of his project for the expansion of the  prophet's holy mosque. He said: "Some people said that the  project would require 20 or 30 years to complete." He added  that he had made the decision and assumed the responsibility,  and the project was completed. He noted that "since the  beginning of work on the project, God's boons and favors have  increased for us." He said that oil production and prices have  increased.    In his statement King Fahd said that "God has blessed this  country. It has had no colonialism and no interference in its  affairs. It is fortunate that the people of this country  always, in private and in public, raise their hands to the  creator of the universe adhering to their true Islamic faith  that is free from blemishes, everyone doing his duty as dictated  by God. This a divine bliss and we should thank God for it day  and night, in good and in bad times, at all times."    He added: "We have had innumerable boons. There is no  better testimony than the facts. The facts speak for  themselves. Thank God, our relations with the Islamic world are  excellent. Our relations with the states with which we have  relations are also excellent. We have no bad relations with  anyone at all and we owe nobody any favors, except the almighty  God. That is why we should be grateful to the gracious almighty  God."    The custodian of the two holy mosques added: "Yes, we are  Muslims, thank God, and we adhere to our Islamic faith in letter  and spirit, but some things are not related to that." He added:  "We have human resources in our country today. If we look at  the students and experts of theology in this country, and those  entrusted with the affairs of Muslims for the purpose of  pronouncing Islamic edicts [ifta']...we would find very  excellent resources and raw material."    King Fahd added: "There can be no doubt that the theological  resources which educate the citizens, the judges, and the  Shari'ah courts -- the state has nothing to do with and does not  interfere in any of these things.... We do not want anything  from anyone. We only want to be friends with everyone. We do  not want to interfere in problems in any way, not international  problems, not Arab problems, not African problems, and not Asian  problems. We want to be friends within the limits of our  Islamic faith. We cannot, under any circumstance, swallow or  accept anything that runs contrary to the Islamic faith. Nobody  except God can impose his will on anyone. I say this because it  is a fact. It is a fact about this country dating back to the  fathers and forefathers."    He added: "The imams of Islam have long recorded, analyzed,  and explained this fact. The Koran and the prophet's teachings  are the constitution of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I do not  believe that anyone can claim otherwise. We are everyone's  friends within the boundaries of our capabilities and mutual  interests. We want nothing but friendship and respect from any  country in the world. As regards what has taken place in the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the form of construction and doing  one's duty, be it the citizen or the state, the projects speak  for themselves. We are perhaps the least pretentious and do not  try to project matters in the media or in a propagandist way,  but (projects) speak for themselves in a country which 20 or 30  years ago had no resources. I say that because I was there and  I know this very well."    He added: "Where else do resources come from, if not from  God. We have the oil. When oil was discovered the war broke out  and stopped everything. I can say that since 1953, or perhaps  1955, the oil began yielding an output, not the required output  but as the years went by that output began to enable the state  to launch projects."    He contined: "I was very happy that God enabled me to make  these extensions in the Mecca mosque, and in the squares and  buildings, and to make the roof improvements, and the same  applies to what we now see in Medina. That will not stop at any  limit. We will continue the good work in the interest of Islam  and the Muslims."    He said: "The best social system, as they say, is the  Islamic  system. It is unmatched. It has gentleness and kindness and it  has God's words." He added: "We have a wealth of theologians  who have performed their duties in the best required way, be it  in the Shari'ah courts, as imams in the holy mosque, in the holy  Medina, or anywhere else in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."    He continued: "Naturally, amid all these boons and graces we  are enjoying, we should expect that some would try to undermine  them but, by God, they would not be able to do so because all  the people and their institutions are unanimous in their resolve  to prevent or deter these things by legitimate means. We want  nothing from anyone. All we want is for the almighty God to  bless us and forgive the mistakes we unintentionally commit. I  beseech God to show us the way and to guide us to what would be  to his satisfaction. These projects we see now, whether in  Medina, Mecca, or anywhere else in the country, have penetrated  mountains as roads and reached the mountain peaks in 'Asir, and  have reached the sea. Some are open roads, others pass through  mountains. Roads have been built from north to south and east  to west. And I do not say that that is all we want to do."    In conclusion, King Fahd said: All this is a result of  adherence to the letter and spirit of the Islamic faith. As  regards mistakes, they have been mentioned in the Koran and in  the teachings of the prophet, may God's prayers and blessings be  upon him, and the Orthodox Caliphs. The correct path would not  have been known if there were no mistakes, but mistakes do not  last and the state will absolutely not tolerate mistakes related  to the faith. That will not be tolerated. There is no desire  to upset anyone or harm him through what he owns. The state has  never harmed anyone through his wealth. On the contrary, we  bless everyone and wish them well. We have now seen projects  which began some years ago and have now reached their peak....  They provide the evidence that God has enabled us and ordered  us to do that work. If I am to be credited for that work, I am  not alone in that." [closing quotation mark as published]. He  added: "I am only completing a mission. I hope God will help  me in any work I undertake in this country in the interest of  the public provided it does not violate the Islamic faith in any  way. We want nothing but good for everyone, but we will  absolutely not let anyone come and change our faith or our  organization of our Islamic faith because it is all good and it  is all bliss. We see now that our relations with the world are  at their best possible because we do not interfere in anyone's  affairs and do not want anyone to interfere in our affairs."</p>

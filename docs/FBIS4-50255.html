			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Governor Chen Huanyou met with Dr. Kissinger,  former U.S. secretary of state who is on a visit to Suzhou, on  the morning of 14 May. The two had a warm and friendly  conversation.    Chen Huanyou welcomed Kissinger's visit. He said: Dr.  Kissinger is a far-sighted politician. Some 20 years ago, as an  assistant to then U.S. President Nixon, you made major  contributions to opening the door of Sino-U.S. relations, and to  promoting normalization of relations between the two nations.  People in Jiangsu, as elsewhere, will never forget this.    Governor Chen briefed Kissinger on his recent visit to the  United States. Speaking of the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade  status, Governor Chen said: The United States has capital and  high technology, while China has a big market. It has always  been mutually beneficial for the two sides to develop economic  cooperation and trade. The ongoing annual debate on whether to  renew China's MFN status is deeply hurting the feelings of  people in China and the United States.    Governor Chen expressed the hope that Dr. Kissinger will use  his influence and make contributions to the development of  Sino-U.S. friendship, economic cooperation, and trade.    Dr. Kissinger thanked Governor Chen for receiving him in  spite of his busy schedule. He said: I have deep feelings for  China. Our friendship is built upon common interests.  Cooperation between our two nations should grow constantly.    After hearing with interest Governor Chen Huanyou's briefing  on Jiangsu's investment environment and development of bilateral  investment in economic cooperation and trade, Kissinger said he  would work hard to promote U.S. investment in Jiangsu.    Suzhou Mayor (Zhang Xisong) and others were present at the  meeting.</p>

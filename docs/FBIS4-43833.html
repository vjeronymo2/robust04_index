			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennaro Schettino: "Economic Package: Dispute </F> Within Government; Dini: Action on Taxes Essential"]    [Text] Rome -- The state budget situation looks very bad,  but there is already a dispute within the government on how to  reduce the deficit. On the one hand there are the "guardians"  of the state budget -- led by the treasury minister, and  including the League's ministers -- who want an immediate  substantial economic package. And they are not afraid to talk in  terms of new taxes to compensate for overspending. On the other  hand, however, there are those who are promising to reduce the  public deficit miraculously without any cuts or new taxes. This  team is headed by Transportation Minister Publio Fiori. It  seems that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi himself also belongs  to this band of "optimists." Yesterday the two alignments  engaged in an open confrontation, brandishing their weapons.    After a very heated day on the financial markets, Treasury  Minister Lamberto Dini -- who is officially responsible for  drawing up the economic package -- issued a note in an attempt  to calm the atmosphere. Dini stated clearly that the package  will be a substantial one and will affect this year's budget.  The treasury minister does not intend to allow the deficit to  exceed the established limit by a single lira.    How does he intend to do this? Very likely, by bringing  forward a large part of the 1995 Finance Bill, making some of  its measures effective this year. This will deal a blow to  pensions and health provisions in the second half of this year.  Dini was very explicit: He wants to prevent a currency crisis  from overwhelming the lira and the Italian Stock Exchange. Be  that as it may, the treasury minister interprets current events  on the financial markets as a temporary phenomenon. Short-lived  turbulence, Dini said, is inevitable in strongly integrated  markets, and sometimes leads to unjustified "excessive"  movements. The treasury minister warned, however, that people  must not have any illusions: Unjustified increases in public  expenditure "will be counterbalanced by specific measures to  increase public revenue." By so saying Dini reaffirmed that the  Constitutional Court's ruling on pensions will be complied by  means of ad hoc measures. But any other possible overspends  will also be counterbalanced by taxation. This, starting with  the 4-5 trillion lire needed this year to limit the deficit to  154 trillion lire. So Dini considers any unrest and tension  with regard to government bonds unjustified.    "The behavior of the international financial markets," the  treasury minister wrote, "has been countered in recent weeks.  There have been substantial increases in interest rates on  government bonds in all the major industrial countries,  accompanied by considerable fluctuations in the exchange rate of  the dollar against other currencies. Short-term fluctuations,"  the minister explained, "are inevitable in strongly integrated  markets that interact and sometimes produce excessive movements  in the exchange rates themselves.. Indeed, the major rise in  interest rates on long-term stock is neither explained nor  justified by the current or expected rate of inflation. The  lira and interest rates on government bonds," the treasury  minister continued, "have suffered as a result of these  disturbances. Apart from this, there have been a number of  internal developments liable to increase public spending that  will be counterbalanced by specific measures to increase  revenue." This was an unmistakable reference to the ruling on  pensions. The new taxes will not only serve to fill the 30  trillion lire INPS [National Social Security Institute] gap.  "The work on reforming public finance will continue," the  minister added, "through a corrective measure with respect to  the deficit for the current year and more especially for1995."  So Dini is clearly calling loudly for a substantial and rapid  action including measures that will hit Italians in their  pockets in the coming months. The League's Vito Gnutti, the  industry minister, spoke in a similar vein yesterday: "If there  is any overspending," he said in Bologna, "the response in terms  of the need for an economic package would be obvious."    A very different plan for public finances is being put  forward by the other side, which we could call the government's  optimists. "I have in mind," Fiori said, "a plan for 50  trillion lire involving no cuts and no new taxes. It will will  bring in the 50 trillion lire that we need to fill the INPS gap  and to resolve the most immediate public finance problems." The  transportation minister declined to say any more about his plan  to reform public finances. But he did issue this sharp verdict  on the treasury minister's plan: "I disagree with Minister Dini  about the need for an immediate package; we won the elections on  the basis of a distinct policy and we have never considered  constituting a second Ciampi government. I have clear ideas  about the Finance Bill. I expect," Dini went on, "not a drastic  bill, but a sensible one that will not misrepresent the  situation but that will aim to develop and revive the economy."  What is the nature of this plan? We will hear it from Fiori in  a few days' time. Fortunately, yesterday ended with some wise  remarks from Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio. We must  beware, he said, not to try to stray from the path of economic  reform with "coercive measures" affecting the public debt. It  is a long road, Fazio warned, and the only way to go is "an  incisive and gradual reduction of spending requirements."</p>

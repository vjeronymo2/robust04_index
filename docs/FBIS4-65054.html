			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Monica Sandback report: "Strong Growth Trend in Nordic </F> Countries -- But Sweden Has Fallen Behind"]    [Text] The trend points upward in the Nordic countries.  The upward trend is strongest in Finland, which is finally  coming out of a four-year-long recession and looks set next year  to be the fastest expanding of the Nordic countries. The pace  is slower in Sweden, while Denmark and Norway gained good  direction earlier on.    This is shown for instance in the Nordic Outlook survey  compiled by economists from S-E-Banken. Strong increase of  investments and hefty export figures are expected to give  Finland a growth rate of 4.5 percent in 1995. The country's  1-percent inflation rate, now the lowest in Europe, is also  expected to stay low next year. After this, it is less certain  whether the Finns can keep cost increases under control. A  dynamic domestic demand may tempt companies to raise prices, and  better profitability in the export industry may induce the  workers to demand high pay raises. But the 20-percent  unemployment rate, which is only expected to increase marginally  next year, limits the risk of an overly rapid pay-structure  increase.    On the political front, Finland has two elections coming up  -- European Union [EU] elections this fall and general elections  in March 1995. The outcome of the EU elections seems to be the  easiest to predict, with all opinion polls indicating that the  Finns will say yes to the EU.  <H5>  Full Speed Ahead in Denmark </H5>   Denmark too is facing new general elections, whose result  will be difficult to predict. The election date has still to be  set, but the elections must be held before 10 December this year.    The entry of the Social Democrats into the government  following Poul Schlueter's abrupt resignation in January 1993  may be a short interlude. If the Social Democrats get renewed  confidence, the explanation may be that the Danish economy  picked up speed already last year and continues to grow at a  good pace.    Soft financial policy and lower interest rates, according to  the economists of Enskilda Banken, are the main forces behind  the Danish recovery. Unemployment, which was a huge problem in  Denmark much earlier than in the other Nordic countries, now  seems set to drop from 12 percent this year to 11 percent next  year. The strong recovery of the economy may become visible in  the inflation statistics. A much more stringent financial  policy can therefore be expected next year as a measure to avoid  overheating.  <H5>  The Mainland Takes Over </H5>   Norway is also in a rapid-growth phase with strong exports  and rising private consumption. While the oil industry in  Norway has switched into a lower gear, mainland Norway has  finally gained the momentum that has been expected for many  years.    The mainland economy is now expected to achieve a growth  rate  of 3 percent in order to keep pace with the country's overall  growth rate -- for the first time in seven years.    Unemployment, which is lowest in Norway, is expected to drop  from last year's 6 percent to 5.4 percent this year.    Norway is the only one of the Nordic countries that does not  have general elections in the offing. The Norwegians got  through those last year. But this does not mean that Norway can  look forward to a politically calm period -- the coming EU  elections may become a real thriller in our neighbor country in  the West.    As for Sweden, the S-E-Banken economists predict a  2.3-percent growth figure for this and next year. This is the  slowest expansion rate among the Nordic countries considering  next year's expected growth figures of 4.5 percent for Finland,  3.4 percent for Denmark, and 2.8 percent for Norway.</p>

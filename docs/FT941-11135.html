			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Personal pension plans . . . - Insurance for life Personal pensions represent the most significant development in the life and pensions market in recent years, with more than 100 providers from which to choose and 5m plans sold since their launch in 1988. But after a six-year sales boom, worth billions of pounds, life offices have been reprimanded for widespread mis-selling of transfer plans to employees with company scheme benefits. Over the coming weeks, the Weekend FT will examine these providers and the quality of their products in terms of consistent investment returns and low, flexible charges. In this introduction to the series, Debbie Harrison explains what to look for when choosing a provider and what pitfalls to avoid. ***** Before taking out a pension you should take advice, preferably from an adviser who accepts a fee rather than depending on a single product. These advisers will arrange either enhanced terms with the provider or a rebate of commission. If the adviser is commission-based, the best arrangement is to pay a series of single premiums, all at once or as a 'recurring single premium' (RSP) contract. This should avoid high up-front commission costs, imposed on contributions in the early days of a long-term, regular premium plan. These result in hefty early termination penalties. You should check the amount of commission and charges under an RSP contract and make sure you are paying no more than you would under a one-off single premium. Not all of the providers covered in this series will offer products through independent advisers, while some of those that do may not be prepared to offer non-commission terms. In these cases, Weekend FT will provide details of the sales channels used and the effect on commission, charges and quality of advice. Life office charges In July, life offices are expected for the first time to provide illustration of the net benefits of an investment, based on their own charges. By 1995 this will be compulsory. Until then, if you ask for an illustration of what your pension plan could produce in, say, 20 years, providers will use standard charges devised by the Life Association and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro). But these are much lower than the industry average and serve little purpose other than to lead you up the garden path. Ian McKenna, a consultant with the independent adviser Blyth McKenna, says: 'Some advisers already have details of real charges on their computer systems, but the present rules prevent us from showing them to clients. We look forward to the day when we can give a clear statement of the real cost of charges and how these impact on the total investment return, the value of the policy at early termination, and at transfer.' The Weekend FT, however, provides an example of actual charges in each profile and compares these with the standard Lautro illustrations. As a rough guide, providers with charges at or around the Lautro basis are likely to offer good value for money. The combination of a product having low or no commission with a low-cost charging structure minimises the risk of financial penalty if you decide to stop paying into the plan or need to transfer the fund. One final point on flexibility: it is illegal under most circumstances to belong to a company scheme and to run a personal pension. If you change jobs and join the employer's scheme, you must stop your personal pension contributions. In these circumstances, watch out for the over-hyped feature of some personal pensions that allows you to convert to a free-standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) plan which acts as a top-up to the company pension. This is often a ploy to encourage you to keep paying your premiums to the life office. Few younger employees will be able to afford both company and FSAVC contributions. FSAVCs are an excellent idea but should not be a condition of stopping payment to the personal pension plan. Performance Look for consistency: over a period of five or 10 years, an outstanding result in one 12-month period can disguise an otherwise lacklustre performance. Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of the partnership pensions section of the actuary, Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'Probably the best guide to future performance includes the use of past performance statistics with a clear understanding of how past performance was achieved; an assessment of the present investment style of a management team; and a knowledge of whether the individuals responsible for past performance are still in place.' Financial strength The company's status is noted in the fact file. Mutual life offices do not have shareholders and are owned by their members. They cannot go to the stock market to raise capital as can proprietary offices. But status - whether mutual or proprietary - is no real indication of financial position. The FT profiles use the Standard &amp; Poor's UK life insurer financial strength rating, which is an opinion of the insurance company's financial capacity and flexibility to provide present and potential future policyholder benefits. The triple-A rating indicates that the company offers 'superior financial strength on an absolute and relative basis.' AA is 'excellent' while A is 'good'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FACT FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name:                        Equitable Life Assurance Society Status:                      Mutual Founded:                     1762 Market Position:             Largest life office in terms of new annual                              premiums, eighth largest in terms of fund                              size Financial strength rating:   Standard &amp; Poor's AA (excellent) Funds under management:      Pounds 13bn (at 31/12/93) Premium income 1993:         Annual pounds 320m; single pounds 1,046m Number of personal pension   plan clients:              250,000 Number of transfer plans   sold:                      37,000 Sales outlets:               Direct sales force remunerated by salary,                              part of which is related to quality and                              quantity of sales Commissions paid:            Nil to third parties Recurring single premium   contracts?:                All personal pension products written on                              this basis Charges on personal   pensions*:                 Good.

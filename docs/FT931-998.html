			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Warning on low skills of young workers BRITISH employers are competing for recruits in a much smaller pool of well-educated 16-year-olds than companies in most main competitor countries, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said yes-terday. The institute says in a report that low attainment in the UK produces low employer expectations of skill standards. It quotes a recruitment officer who, when asked what qualifications he would like machine operators to have, replied: 'We like them to be able to read and write.' The report's conclusions include: The proportion of British 16-year-olds attaining a standard equivalent to that in other industrialised countries in science, the native language and mathematics, was only half that of France, Germany and Japan, though it points out that national qualifications are not identical in curriculum coverage. The proportion of British 16-to-19-year-olds in full-time education and training was lower than in competitor countries. Fewer British young people aged 18-plus gained school or vocational qualifications than in France or Germany. Any substantial increase in the quality and quantity of youth training in the UK would impose consider-able additional costs on employers. The report attributes differences between countries to a range of factors, some related to internal features of the system such as curriculum design, and others related to the social context, including parental expectations.

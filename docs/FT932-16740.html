			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Sport: Trade winds blow Smith to Spain - Sailing / Keith Wheatley on a British skipper who has found his Fortuna LAWRIE Smith's appointment to skipper the maxi ketch Fortuna in the 1993/4 Whitbread round-the-world race is a breakthrough, although not everyone sees it that way. Partisan traditionalists say it is regrettable that Britain's top professional sailor could not have a boat designed, built and funded from his own country. Fortuna is sponsored by Tabacalera, the Spanish state-owned tobacco giant. In fact, Smith's link-up with Fortuna is probably the keystone in the arch as the Whitbread becomes totally international in the same way as Formula One motor racing. Dennis Conner, the world's best-known sailor, is entering his first Whitbread with a yacht funded by Winston cigarettes, built in Italy, and crewed largely by New Zealanders and Europeans. Chris Dickson, the New Zealander who skippered for the Japanese in the last America's Cup, has a Whitbread programme funded by a Tokyo advertising agency. His back-up skipper is young British sailor Stuart Childerley. The Ukraine has built and entered a yacht that is being fitted-out in Florida. 'I wasn't in the slightest bit bothered about whether it was a British team. I've always just gone for the best people around,' says Smith, who won an Olympic bronze medal in the Soling class in Barcelona. 'I would rather have started earlier with a new boat, but I think we'll have a few surprises by the summer.' Fortuna competed in the 1989/90 Whitbread and held the record of more than 400 miles for a single day's run. Smith describes it as 'an out-and-out speed machine but with a big weakness in light airs.' In those days it was a sloop but last year it was cut in half, lengthened, and a mizzen mast added to make it ketch-rigged. The work was carried out at Vision Yachts in Cowes, Isle of Wight. Smith has just brought Fortuna back from Spain to the same yard, and another nine-week programme of modifications will begin. Designer Ian Howlett, an associate of Smith's going back to the British challenge for the 1980 America's Cup, is tank-testing new keel and rudder models. 'I don't think we'll be aiming to make it look just like the other maxis. It's boring to copy and it probably wouldn't be effective. The fundamentals are the foils, moving the main mast, and a bigger mizzen sail area,' says Howlett, known throughout sailing as 'Boff' because of his preference for Oxford academic life over the gin and tonics of the south coast yachting set. The bulk of the Whitbread fleet will be in the new, W60 class of 60ft water-ballasted sloops. While the maxis are more than 20ft longer and carry far more sail, there is still considerable disagreement among sailors and designers about which will prove fastest around the 32,000-mile course. Sponsors of the bigger, more glamorous maxi yachts have invested considerable money and prestige in being first home, and race officials already have begun modifying sailing instructions (purportedly on grounds of safety) that will limit the amount of sail the W60s can carry in the Southern Ocean. 'I've always wanted the boat that will cross the finish line first,' says Smith. 'Joe Bloggs in the street doesn't care about anything else and that's what gives the sponsor his value for money and lets us all go racing.' Nevertheless, Smith, who skippered the game but slightly off-the-pace Rothmans in the last Whitbread, knows the velocity predictions for the two classes. Above 20 knots of wind, the W60s will be faster all the time. In some downwind conditions, they could be up to 100 miles a day quicker than the giant maxis. Upwind, and in the lighter airs where half the race takes place in the north and south Atlantic, the bigger yachts should have the upper hand. 'The best predictions I've seen say that, with average weather, the maxis will be 48 hours faster round the track,' says Smith, adding the proviso that a tiny meteorological change can throw the whole calculation into a reverse conclusion. Nevertheless, if he fails to do well this time, it will not be for lack of resources. In 1992 Fortuna, backed by Tabacalera, threw around Pounds 4m of sponsorship behind the Spanish sailing team at the Olympics. The return was an extraordinary four gold medals in 10 events, dwarfing more traditionally strong sailing nations.</p>

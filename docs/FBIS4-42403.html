			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi on Friendship, History, </F> at Dinner for Clinton"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 2 -- Premier Silvio Berlusconi  dwelt on the 50-year friendship between Italy and the United  States in a speech delivered after a dinner for visiting U.S.  President Bill Clinton, official sources said.    "This afternoon, a beautiful Rome day and Michelangelo's  Capitoline square...provided the perfect backdrop for bearing  witness to and celebrating a friendship which has lasted half a  century and which will certainly continue for more than half a  century into the future," said the Italian government chief.    With Berlusconi and Clinton due in Anzio tomorrow to attend  a  ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied landing  there, history also played a part in the premier's speech: "The  friendship between our countries and the alliance between our  democracies are born out of an act of liberation which laid to  rest fascism and Nazi totalitarianism in Europe."    Italy's commitment to democracy was underscored by  Berlusconi, who said "the new Italy which you see today, Mr.  President, is a country which has rediscovered a taste for  liberty and which is determined to defend tolerance and peace."    "We have learnt all that we should have learnt from our  joint  history," continued Berlusconi, "Now we feel free and we have  hope in our hands. We do not want to remain slaves to the  ghosts of the past. After many difficult years, a climate of  trust and optimism has returned."    Leaders of all the major political parties were invited to  attend the dinner, which took place at Villa Madama, but Umberto  Bossi of the Northern League turned down his invitation at the  last moment, citing previous commitments and sending League  number two, and Interior Minister Roberto Maroni in his stead.    In a comment to journalists, National Alliance Secretary  Gianfranco Fini, who was present for tonight's meal, recalled  similar incident which happened during a visit to Rome by former  U.S. President George Bush. "I was invited to see Bush while he  was in Italy and I did the same as Bossi: I said I was busy with  an election campaign. All lies: in fact, no one had warned me  he was coming." [passage omitted]    More details about this afternoon's talks between Berlusconi  and Clinton emerged this evening when the premier's press  secretary Antonio Tajani disclosed that Berlusconi had confessed  that he was known as the `Amerikano' in his youth. "I have  always been very close to the position of the United States.  They used to call me `Amerikano', written with a K, when it was  very difficult and not at all fashionable to be on the side of  the United States," Berlusconi told his guest.    Berlusconi's fascination with things American has either  died  down since then, or only went so far: when refreshments were  brought in during the meeting, the Italian premier opted for an  espresso coffee, while Clinton chose for a Coca Cola.</p>

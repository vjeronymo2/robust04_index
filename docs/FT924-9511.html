			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Arts: Our Song - Theatre Keith Waterhouse's new play is the kind of maudlin, sentimental piece that one sometimes forgets is still being written - possibly because there is so little time for a theatre critic to watch television. However, Our Song is very professionally crafted, is an ideal vehicle for Peter O'Toole and introduces a fetching new actress in Tara FitzGerald. After his success in Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell (also written by Waterhouse), O'Toole is enjoying an Indian summer on the stage. It is a great pity that he bowed out of John Osborne's Deja Vu because the text was too long and too complex. Still, here he is in a simpler play, dominating throughout. O'Toole plays an ageing advertising man. That is another sign of the datedness of the piece. One did not realise that they were still around, even less that people still wrote plays about them. He has to think up alliterative adjectives for things like Finnegan's Flakes: there are a lot of 'effs' in the Waterhouse script. Thus the character, called Roger Piper, strays is in falling for a girl called Angela. She is Ms FitzGerald, who describes herself as a 'freelance factotum'. She is always immaculately dressed, usually at someone else's expense, and Ms FitzGerald can certainly act. The affair lasted, as Piper never stops telling us, 16 months. It took a lot of lunches, and even more champagne, to get her into to bed. Consummation takes place in Edinburgh, shifts to Venice, and is continued in her bed-sit in Islington. There is a series of flings around Leicester, Nottingham, Cardiff and Brighton as Piper, having lost his partnership at the agency, accepts a part-time job as a contributor to some kind of good food guide. Angela is finally killed in a car crash on the road to Birmingham, Piper reflecting - among other things - that she was on the M25 when she should have been on the M1. The theme is Piper wondering if it was love and, if not, what was it? 'Our Song' is sung only once, and then only for a few bars. It was plainly a tempestuous affair, which did not leave much time for gentle smooching. O'Toole speaks in a slow drawl and moves in a stooping, slightly tortured way that in the end becomes compelling. He is writing about his experience on an old-fashioned Imperial Typewriter, which says a lot about the play. There is not much else. Piper has a very patient, attractive wife, stylishly played by Lucy Fleming. There is a little bit of poking fun at advertising, good food guides and restaurants, but remarkably few outright jokes. Our Song is directed by another old pro, Ned Sherrin. It makes for a pleasant enough evening, though even at little more than two hours may seem a shade too long. Ms FitzGerald we shall see again. The point about her Angela is that if she has any depths, we do not discover them. She conceals them with great skill. Apollo Theatre. (071) 630 6262</p>

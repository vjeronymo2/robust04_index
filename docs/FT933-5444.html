			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Exporters undaunted by Europe recession RECESSION IN Europe has not dented the confidence of British exporters, a survey disclosed yesterday. Two-thirds of exporters are optimistic about prospects for business over the next 12 months and 81 per cent described their order books as either good or very good, according to Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance group. The quarterly survey of UK Export Business Prospects, carried out last month, shows that almost 50 per cent of respondents have increased the numbers of export customers since the last quarter, while 63 per cent said sales inquiries had increased over the last quarter. The findings contrast with the latest news from the Confederation of British Industry. Its August survey of industrial trends found that export order books weakened over the summer. It concluded that modest growth in the US and Japan would be insufficient to mitigate the impact of recession in Europe on UK exporters. Trade Indemnity said Middle East, Asian and North American markets were more buoyant in the latest three months compared with the previous quarter. EC and other European markets were more sluggish in the latest three months. The survey showed that exporters fear a rise in bad debt and customer default in Europe.</p>

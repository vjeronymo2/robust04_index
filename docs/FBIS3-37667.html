			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev; place and date </F> not given -- recorded; from the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] A decision to make ground-attack and bombing strikes  against positions around Sarajevo would, of course, be bound to  have very unwelcome consequences. In the first place I would  say: the international prestige of the United Nations would be  undermined. That is certain. This action would look like a  unilateral action to punish the Serbs. Moreover, great losses  among the civilian population are inevitable.    Second, the inflicting of these strikes could trigger a  large-scale war, and, even worse, these strikes could act as a  trigger for other states, neighboring states, to be drawn into  this war.</p>

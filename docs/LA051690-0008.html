			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCDONNELL DOUGLAS UNION TO SELECT LEADER  MAY 22  </P> <P> A May 22 runoff will decide who will lead the largest union at McDonnell  Douglas Aircraft Co. at a time when Long Beach's largest employer faces  impending layoffs, peacetime cutbacks and debate over a controversial  Japanese-style management.  </P> <P> Doug Griffith, president of United Auto Workers Local 148, will face Richard  Rios for the union presidency.  </P> <P> With several challenged ballots still unresolved, preliminary results show that  Griffith received 39% of the vote and Rios 32% in the recent election. More  than 12,000 members chose among 205 candidates vying for 49 posts, including  six candidates for president.  </P> <P> One of the hottest issues of the campaign was the union-company liaison struck  by Griffith and opposed by some workers as union-busting. Griffith endorses the  company's Japanese-style management, which, among other things, encourages  employees to monitor each other's work habits.  </P></p>

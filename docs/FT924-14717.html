			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: SocGen breaks trend of sector with 8% advance SOCIETE Generale yesterday lightened the gloomy mood of the French banking sector by announcing an 8 per cent increase in interim profits to FFr1.98bn (Dollars 410m) for the first half of 1992 from FFr1.83bn in the same period last year. The robust increase in profits from Societe Generale bucks the trend among France's big banks, which have been badly affected by the competitive state of the domestic banking market and by the need to make steep increases in provisions on their property holdings and industrial investments. Credit Lyonnais last month disclosed that it had barely broken even in the first half of the year. Banque Indosuez, the prominent investment banking subsidiary of the Suez industrial group, reported a similarly steep fall in profits because of a hefty increase in its provisions. Paribas, another force in French investment banking, only avoided a dramatic decline in its interim profits because of the proceeds of its disposal programme. Paribas was yesterday clouded by its involvement with Ciments Francais, the troubled construction company now embroiled in a controversy over previously-undisclosed losses on off-balance sheet financial dealings. By contrast, Societe Generale, one of France's largest private-sector banks, managed to increase its profits at the operating level and to avoid a steep increase in provisions on its property and industrial interests. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said that Societe Generale had pursued a 'prudent provisions policy' in recent years. As a result, he said, it was able to limit the increase in first-half writedowns to 16.5 per cent, taking it to FFr3.05bn Societe Generale saw its net banking income increase by 5.5 per cent to FFr18.6bn during the first six months of the year. Its gross operating profits rose by 4.5 per cent to FFr5.75bn in the same period. Mr Vienot said the bank planned to 'maintain the strategy of diversifying into different areas of revenue' in the future. However he refused to make a profit forecast for the full financial year. Societe Generale, like other French banks, has been trying to counter the impact of competition by cutting costs. It announced a radical rationalisation programme for its French retail banking network, which will involve shedding 1,300 of its 23,000 staff within three years.</p>

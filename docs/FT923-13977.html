			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Observer: Out of the closet Signs of the times. Just as publishers Random Century have put the gag on chauvinistic references to foreigners in reprints of W E Johns's books about fighter ace Biggles, the borough council of Nuneaton and Bedworth has taken the wraps off condom-dispensers. It has evidently become the first UK council to abolish the rule restricting contraceptive vending machines to indoor sites such as the lavatories of public houses. Moreover, it has already put its new policy into practice. An open-access machine has been installed at Nuneaton's main bus station, and formally inaugurated by Councillor Mrs Mary Beaumont, chair of the council's environmental health committee.</p>

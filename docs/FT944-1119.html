			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Mexican devaluation hits region's markets Mexico's stock market fell heavily yesterday and short-term interest rates rose sharply following Tuesday's 15 per cent devaluation of the peso, pulling down other Latin American markets. Analysts said that while the devaluation was probably a good long-term move for Mexico's economy, there were immediate questions about new President Ernesto Zedillo's resolve to maintain a conservative monetary and fiscal policy. There were also worries about the amount of international reserves available to the central bank to support the peso. 'The government did something it swore it wasn't going to do,' said Mr Felix Boni of the Mexican brokerage firm Interacciones. 'Investors don't like surprises, especially ones like this which are difficult to assimilate.' In London analysts said investors were worried that the government might be forced to make a second devaluation. The IPC index, the main stock market indicator, closed down 3.1 per cent, recovering from its midday fall of 11.63 per cent. At the weekly auction of government paper, short-term interest rates rose 2.25 percentage points over last week to 16 per cent and moved as high as 30 per cent in secondary trading. The peso continued to trade at or near its maximum lower limit of 4.002 pesos to the dollar, settling at 3.997. In Argentina the Buenos Aires stock market's blue-chip index closed 5.74 per cent lower in reaction to the Mexican turbulence. In Brazil, shares on the Sao Paulo exchange fell 6.3 per cent and the central bank intervened repeatedly in support of the currency. The Mexican government had cited political instability related to the armed conflict in the southern state of Chiapas as one of the reasons behind the devaluation, rather than economic fundamentals. However, the afternoon recovery of the stock market was spurred by a international conference call placed to hundreds of foreign investors by Mr Augustin Carstens of Banco de Mexico, the central bank, and Mr Carlos Mendoza of Nafin, the state-owned investment bank, who said the devaluation had an economic basis as well, and the government would seek to raise additional revenues through an aggressive privatisation programme. Mr Carstens and Mr Mendoza acknowledged that the devaluation had also been intended to protect the country's international reserves, reported to have fallen to Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn, from Dollars 24.5bn at the beginning of the year. Analysts said a continued drop in the market would jeopardise reserves even further. Mexico's economic cabinet met Mr Zedillo late into the afternoon to define additional strategies. The government has at its disposal a Dollars 6bn credit line set up with the US and Canada in March to maintain currency stability. Finance Ministry officials denied rumours that the line had been used, but said that it was one of many options being discussed with the president.

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Singer &amp; Friedlander interested in Ansbacher SINGER &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property group, is in talks which could lead to a takeover of Henry Ansbacher, the small City merchant bank. Singer has been in discussions with Ansbacher and its majority shareholder, Pargesa, which is controlled by Mr Paul Desmarais, the Montreal financier, and the Frere Group of Belgium. Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman of Singer, confirmed there had been 'very preliminary conversations about a potential merger.' Ansbacher is likely to make a statement this morning confirming the discussions, although few other details are expected. It is understood the Bank of England has been informed about the talks. Pargesa first tried to sell its 61.6 per cent stake in Ansbacher in 1990, but failed to find a buyer at an acceptable price. It bought a 30 per cent interest in Ansbacher in 1984 and was later forced to inject a further Pounds 100m when the London bank ran into trouble. Since then it has seen the value of its investment fall considerably. Ansbacher's share price was 78p in 1990, valuing the stake at close to Pounds 90m. But the shares have since fallen, following losses last year of Pounds 8.23m, and closed last week at 29p, suggesting Pargesa's stake is now worth only Pounds 33m. If Singer bought Pargesa's stake, it would be forced under the takeover code to make a full offer to other Ansbacher holders. These include administrators of the late Mr Robert Maxwell with 10 per cent, the Kuwait Investment Office (10 per cent) and ADT, the security systems company (3.5 per cent).</p>

We will  also abandon the Kalmyk citizenship, Russia should have Russian  citizenship," Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov told a  parliament meeting here today.    "Russia is single and indivisible. Its revival is impossible  without the revival of national provinces and the revival of  provinces is impossible without the revival of the whole state,"  he stressed.    Ilyumzhinov suggested to terminate the validity of the  Kalmyk  Constitution on March 25 and form a delegation to meet Russian  President Yeltsin. He wants to ask "the president for an  instrument of ratification to give him or another official the  power to be named president, governor or head of the republic  for five-ten years. The decision is up to the Russian  president".</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Monrovia, 10 May (AFP) -- Two rival clans fighting  within one of Liberia's armed factions, the United Liberation  Movement (ULIMO), met here Monday [9 May] in a bid to settle the  two-month conflict. Two earlier attempts at ending the fighting  between the Mandingos and the Krahns, had ended in failure.  Several hundred people have been killed in clashes that have  mostly centred on the Bomi region to the north and west of  Monrovia.    ULIMO president Alhaji Koromah of the Mandingo clan and the  movement's military leader, General Roosevelt Johnson of the  Krahns, met at the headquarters of the West African peacekeeping  force ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. ULIMO secretary-general Isaac  Quawah said afterwards that there had been no breakthrough but  added, "We are determined to reach an agreement."    The feud centres on the distribution of posts of  responsibility within ULIMO, with the Krahns accusing Kromah of  favouring the Mandingos, although membership of the movement is  equally divided between the two. ECOMOG has been trying for two  months to disarm Liberia's warring factions, but has only  succeeded in disarming some 3,000 out of a total of some 60,000  combatants as the fighting goes on unchecked in ULIMO-controlled  areas.    Hostilities have also continued in central and eastern  regions under the control of ULIMO's rival National Patriotic  Front of Liberia, which has since last September been fending  off attacks by armed militiamen in the Liberian Peace Council.    NPFL head Charles Taylor accepted a proposition Friday by  the  LPC to start peace talks in Monrovia this week to negotiate an  end to the fighting under United Nations and ECOMOG mediation.  If the ULIMO clans can along with the LPC and the NPFL strike a  lasting settlement, that would provide the impetus for the UN  and ECOMOG to bring all the belligerent groups to the  negotiating table in order to end the conflict which has wracked  the country since December 1989.</p>

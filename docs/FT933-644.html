			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Heron aims to settle Pounds 125m debt early  -Asset disposals in UK exceed expectations HERON, which completed its refinancing last Friday, expects to pay a substantial part of a Pounds 125m debt repayment due on March 31 next year within the next month or two as asset disposals in its UK business have exceeded expectations in its business plan. Its UK arm has already made a Pounds 25m initial payment early. While Heron reports 'some improvement in market conditions in the UK' it is facing deteriorating conditions in the continental European property market. As a result, a pro-forma asset value of Pounds 12m shown in the refinancing document has been restated at a deficit of Pounds 109m. The difference on the balance sheet deficit is largely due to a Pounds 64m provision against Spanish properties, and a Pounds 33m provision against other continental European properties, mainly in France. Heron said: 'The market values of the group's Spanish properties have continued to fall significantly since the issue of the scheme document. The oversupply in the Paris office market has similarly affected the values of French properties.' In the pro forma balance sheet the group's debt falls from Pounds 1.19bn to Pounds 871m through the debt into equity swap. Heron has also deconsolidated its US division with effect from March 31 1993, its financial year end. Heron said it did not expect to recover any value from its investment in or loans to the US division 'due to the considerable shortfall in asset values available to meet existing liabilities to the creditors of the US division'. Heron has restated the results for the year to end-March 1992 which were shown in the refinancing document in unaudited form. Since the auditors did not approve the accounts until this month, any events up to that time had to be taken into account. As a result, the group pre-tax loss for 1992 has risen from Pounds 301m to Pounds 335m. The loss in 1993 was Pounds 172m, after exceptional items of Pounds 125m - including a foreign exchange loss on its borrowings of Pounds 134m - and interest charges of Pounds 77m. Net losses for 1992 originally shown at Pounds 693m rose to Pounds 826m - reflecting the fall in property values between April this year, when the figures in the refinancing document were agreed, and the date of the auditors' approval. In 1993 the net loss was Pounds 174m. The deficit on the 1992 balance sheet rose from an unaudited Pounds 328m to Pounds 461m, and by the end of the latest financial year was Pounds 640m. Losses were cut in Heron Motor Group and Heron Homes, while the property and other commercial activities increased profits.</p>

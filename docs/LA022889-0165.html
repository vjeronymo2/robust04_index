BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HOME SALES DOWN 7.4% IN JANUARY  </P> <P> Sales of existing homes fell 7.4% in January after a sharp jump in activity in  December, a real estate trade group reported today.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Realtors said existing single-family homes were sold at a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units in January after a 5.7%  rise in December.  </P> <P> The decline in sales did not dampen prices. The median price of a home sold in  January rose 3.2% from the December level to $91,500.  </P> <P> The January sales decline had been expected, given the level of activity in  December, when homes were being sold at the fastest pace in two years.  </P></p>

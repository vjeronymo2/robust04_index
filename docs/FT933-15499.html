			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lazard trust issues prospectus LAZARD High Income Trust, an investment trust which will buy convertible securities, has issued its prospectus, writes Philip Coggan. It is aiming to raise up to Pounds 35m via an offer for subscription of shares at 100p each. The trust is expected to offer an 8 per cent dividend yield, payable quarterly. It will have a fixed life of six years, a device designed to minimise the discount on which investment trust shares trade. In addition to the share capital, the trust will also borrow up to Pounds 15m via a banking facility from Midland Bank. The interest payable will be 1 per cent above Midland Bank's swap rate.</p>

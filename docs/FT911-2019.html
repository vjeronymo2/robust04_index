			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 3.6m rights as Cussins returns to its roots CUSSINS PROPERTY Group is to retreat from housebuilding in the south of England and from commercial property activities in a restructuring and refinancing program. The north of England-based group is terminating Cussins Green, the loss-making joint venture with Throgmorton Trust through which it entered the housebuilding market in southern England and selling its commercial property interests. ''We'll be a smaller company, but we are really going back to our roots,' commented Mr Peter Cussins, chairman. The group has also agreed a refinancing package with Lloyds Bank, providing an overdraft facility of Pounds 14.25m. In addition, it is raising some Pounds 3.6m through a 1-for-1 rights issue of 7.13m new ordinary shares at 55p apiece. The news accompanied results for 1990 which showed a loss of Pounds 4.04m (pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.75m), due largely to its share of losses at the joint venture of Pounds 8.06m (Pounds 1.94m). Turnover was Pounds 21.84m (Pounds 22.49m). Losses per share were 57.8p (earnings 26.2p) and the final is passed (5.5p), making 3.75p (9.25p).</p>

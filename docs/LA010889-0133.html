			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ROY MARBLE'S FREE THROW LIFTS IOWA PAST NORTH CAROLINA  </P> <P> Iowa used some aggressive rebounding and 23 points from Roy Marble to keep  North Carolina off balance Saturday at Chapel Hill, N.C. But it took a little  luck to put Marble on the free-throw line so the No. 9 Hawkeyes could beat the  No. 6 Tar Heels.  </P> <P> North Carolina's Jeff Lebo missed a short jumper with 22 seconds left that  would have broken a 97-97 tie, and a foul was called in a scramble under the  Iowa basket. Marble, despite North Carolina protests that he had not been  fouled, made a free throw with 11 seconds left to give Iowa (13-1) a 98-97  victory.  </P> <P> It appeared that Ed Horton, who missed 2 key free throws earlier, was the Iowa  player fouled, but Marble, who made his 8 previous free throws, got the nod  from officials after pleading: "It was me. It was me."  </P> <P> Marble missed the first free throw, but he hit the second.  </P> <P> North Carolina Coach Dean Smith did not take a timeout to set up a play, and  King Rice's long jumper was blocked.  </P> <P> North Carolina (12-2) trailed by 8 points at halftime but took a 68-66 lead on  a 3-point play by Rice with 13:41 left. It was the first of 14 lead changes in  the second half.  </P> <P> Oklahoma 94, N.C. Charlotte 86 -- Andre Wiley came off the bench to score a  career-high 29 points at Norman, Okla., including 8 in a late surge that helped  hold off the 49ers, enabling the No. 4 Sooners to extend their winning streak  to 10.  </P> <P> Stacey King scored 25 points and Mookie Blaylock added 24 for Oklahoma (12-1).  North Carolina-Charlotte (6-3) got 33 points from Byron Dinkins.  </P> <P> Oklahoma, averaging 113 points per game, went cold in the second half and went  6:44 without a field goal. A free throw by Henry Williams, who scored 22  points, capped a 19-4 run during the Sooner drought and made the score 78-75  with 5:18 left.  </P> <P> Wiley scored 10 straight Oklahoma points as the Sooners opened an 88-78 lead.  </P> <P> Duke 84, Virginia 76 -- Christian Laettner scored 13 of his 15 points in the  second half to rally the top-ranked Blue Devils in the Atlantic Coast  Conference game at Charlottesville, Va. It was Duke's 13th straight win over  the Cavaliers.  </P> <P> Virginia (7-5 overall, 0-1 in the ACC), which has not beaten Duke (11-0, 2-0)  since the first round of the 1983 ACC tournament, held a 38-35 halftime lead,  led by Richard Morgan with 22 points.  </P> <P> Morgan, a senior guard, finished with a career-high 31 points but was hampered  by foul trouble in the second half. He picked up his fourth personal with 18:31  remaining and the Cavaliers leading, 43-38.  </P> <P> Laettner, a 6-10 freshman, scored 12 of Duke's next 15 points, including 9  straight in one stretch. He capped the run with a lay-in and free throw that  put the Blue Devils ahead to stay, 53-50, at the 14:46 mark.  </P> <P> Syracuse 90, Seton Hall 66 -- Junior forward Derrick Coleman had 21 points to  lead a balanced Syracuse attack and the No. 2 Orangemen handed No. 10 Seton  Hall its first loss in the Big East game at Syracuse.  </P> <P> Syracuse, bouncing back after its first loss of the season Wednesday night  against Pittsburgh, never has lost to Seton Hall (13-1, 2-1) at the Carrier  Dome in 9 meetings. The Orangemen are 18-1 overall against the Pirates since  conference play began.  </P> <P> Syracuse (14-1, 1-1) used its pressure defense to start a 17-4 run that turned  a 13-11 advantage into a 30-15 lead with 7:30 left in the first half. Coleman,  who also had 15 rebounds, had 6 points in the run. The Orangemen closed the  half with a 9-1 run to take a 45-23 lead.  </P> <P> Illinois 71, Michigan State 54 -- Kendall Gill and Nick Anderson each scored 21  points to lead the unbeaten and No. 3 Illini over the Spartans in their Big Ten  opener at Champaign, Ill.  </P> <P> After building a 36-26 lead at the half, Illinois (13-0) scored just 19 points  in the first 15 minutes of the second half, and Michigan State (9-3, 0-2) got  to within 55-50 with about 5 minutes left. However, the Illini took control  with a 12-2 run.  </P> <P> Louisville 81, De Paul 67 -- Kenny Payne scored 8 points during an 11-0 run  late in the game at Louisville that enabled the No. 13 Cardinals to extend  their winning streak to 9 games.  </P> <P> Louisville (9-2) led, 67-62, with 4 minutes left when Payne made 2 short jump  shots, Pervis Ellison hit a jumper, Payne scored 2 more baskets before Tony  Kimbro capped the rally with a free throw at the 1:39 mark, giving the  Cardinals their largest lead, 78-62.  </P> <P> Ellison led Louisville with 21 points and had 11 rebounds. David Booth and  Stanley Brundy each scored 20 points for De Paul (8-7). Brundy also had 12  rebounds.  </P> <P> Georgetown 112, Miami (Fla.) 79 -- The No. 5 Hoyas, rebounding from a 94-86  loss to Seton Hall last Tuesday, led by as many as 40 points in the second half  at Landover, Md.  </P> <P> Freshman center Alonzo Mourning scored 15 of his season-high 26 points in the  decisive first half as Georgetown snapped Miami's 5-game winning streak.  Mourning also had 17 rebounds and 6 blocked shots.  </P> <P> Georgetown (10-1) took command early, using a 15-4 run to build its lead to  27-12.

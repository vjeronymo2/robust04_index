			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Drawn to the Border and East - Voluptuous paintings, sensuous music and sex on the Fringe as the Edinburgh Festival enters its second week / William Packer finds the city full of art and reviews the watercolours of David Wilkie and 'Visions of the Ottoman Empire' With the greatest controversy of Edinburgh's first festival week centred centring upon an issue that was nothing to do with the festival at all but manifestly to do with the of broader genuine national interest in the visual arts, one might almost have thought that at last painting and sculpture were again close to the festival's own deeply cultivated heart. Far from it. Timothy Clifford's unfortunate indiscretion which, by the cruellest irony, had put in jeopardy the acquisition of Canova's 'Three Graces' which he himself had fought so hard to secure, it seems has now been most magnanimously forgiven. Thank goodness for that, for the sculpture is a very great work of art. But it was all an involuntary smokescreen, and once the smoke has cleared, the festival's habitual cultural parochialism remains unchanged stands revealed as much the same, as ever, and the visual arts as peripheral to the festival's purposes as ever. The principal gallery directors say that there is no co-operation forthcoming from the festival organisers. Brian McMaster, the festival's director, has said that he wishes only for more a close closer an engagement with the visual arts, which this year was scotched  - if that's the word I want - by the museums and galleries themselves. Such is the current stand-off that the only concession is an undifferentiated listing in the festival brochure. That apart, exhibitions, officially, do not exist. Of course there is a great deal to see, and much of it of a very high quality, for those in charge of Edinburgh's exhibiting institutions are not fools all the time, and with the city full of visitors, what better time to give them a treat. Mr Clifford's own National Galleries of Scotland show the way with four strong and varied shows of which two, Monet to Matisse at the National Gallery, and The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990, split between the Royal Scottish Academy and the Fruitmarket Gallery, warrant the separate consideration I shall give them next week. Both of them have their faults, and not all of them inconsiderable, but that said, they both contain a remarkable proportion of rare and beautiful things. , and the last thing this critic, at least, would wish would be to persuade the potential visitor away. Go and take issue with the selection, the rationale or the installation of the show by all means, but go also to revel in the particular works for their own sakes. The other two shows are at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, and at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. The retrospective of the water-colours of Sir William Gillies at the SNGMA (Belford Road, until September 25: sponsored by Atlas Hydraulic Loaders) is modest enough in scale, but it draws attention to an artist of most distinctive quality who, as is so often the way with our painter knights, has suffered an undue neglect. That an institution of the SNGMA's international standing, not to say ambition, in the related fields of modern and contemporary art, should consider such an exercise in belated recognition worthwhile at such a time is indeed encouraging, at least to those of us who take a view broader than the immediate currency of the avant-garde. Gillies died in 1973 at the age of 74. His working life had been centred upon Edinburgh, where he had been the Principal of the College of Art, and latterly the Border landscape where he had made his home. That consideration alone is enough to have secured him his southern obscurity in the south. Brought up in the Scottish Colourist tradition, broadened by direct contact with the School of Paris and leavened by a natural expansive expressionism by no means foreign to the Scottish temperament, he produced work of a freshness and liveliness of handling, and directness of observation, that are at once charming and convincing. He loved the very act of painting, of filling the brush with paint and drawing it across the paper, which of itself, he said, led him back into a deeper consideration of the world he saw. The mood of the landscape, the very feel of the weather, were what stimulated and excited him, which we catch in his every scurry of the pen and drag and flick of the brush. His peers are such artists as the brothers Paul and, in particular, John Nash, Ivon Hitchins, Graham Sutherland, Keith Vaughan . . . The only pity is that this is no full retrospective by which he might claim his place among them. Some substantial oil paintings by him, however, are currently on view in The Colourist Legacy at the City Art Centre (2 Market Street until September 21), which draws on the City's own collections in following the Scottish Colourist tradition from the Glasgow Boys and the Colourists themselves - Peploe, Cadell and Fergusson - at the turn of the century, through the Edinburgh School - of which Gillies was a central figure from the 1930s to the '70s - and so down to the present day. Visions of the Ottoman Empire, at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery (Queen Street, until November 6: sponsored by Blackwall Green, the Hope Scott Trust, Martin &amp; Frost, Momart, Stanhope Palmer Charity), is a show of a very different kind, a dense but rewarding study of the response of artists, writers and travellers of the 18th and 19th centuries - and of writers, photographers and travellers, too, to both the myth and the reality of life and travel in the old Turkish Empire. The starting point, intriguingly, is taken with Watteau's exquisitely sensuous and mysterious 'Fetes Venitiennes' of 1719, with its youths and lovers flirting beneath the trees and the maturer stranger in Eastern dress paying court to the fine lady. So is established the image of the East, and with it the ideas of personal freedom, sensuality and danger that so exercised the Romantic imagination. Off they all went: Lady Hester Stanhope, Lord Byron, Robert Burton, and with them went the artist adventurers, William Allan, David Wilkie, David Roberts, J. F. Lewis, Edward Lear, Arthur Melville and the rest of them. Ingres dreamt up images of decadence and indulgence, Delacroix of passion and violence. The English and the Scotch Scottish were more down to earth, hinting at assignations and adventures perhaps, but set into a known and closely observed everyday, albeit exotic world. John Frederick Lewis, who lived in Cairo for most of the 1850s, is the undoubted star, though Roberts runs him close. Lewis has been dismissed too often as a mere decorator and illustrator in water-colour. He is much more than that, and it is good to see his oil paintings here beside the works on paper, to establish his scope. His accuracy is phenomenal, his psychological insight no less convincing, though set more perhaps to Victorian sentimental expectations, as his young girls flirt vicariously through the medium of the elderly scribe, than to the Oriental reality. Here is the fantasy of the harem: the girl pins her hair before the glass as her friend gossips at the window. The light streams through the latticed shutter. The silks and scarves hang softly down. The dream is complete.</p>

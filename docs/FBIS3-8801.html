			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Prague Radiozurnal Radio Network in  Czech at 1715 GMT on 15 March broadcast the regular Tuesday  interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, prepared by  correspondent David Stahlavsky. The program lasted 10 minutes.    Answering questions, the prime minister spoke about the  general reasons for unemployment in Western countries, the  allocation of privatization points by Czech people, and the  agricultural policy as approved by the government recently. In  this context, the prime minister said:    "I think that our merciless pressure to abolish  protectionism  in our exports, as well as lifting subsidies on Western exports  of agricultural produce to our country, is producing certain  results. When I was in Great Britain last week and then in  Brussels, I had talks with both Mr. Delors and Mr.  Christophersen, who is, so to speak, the European Union finance  minister. They both indicated that the problem of not  subsidizing the exports of agricultural products eastward is  suddenly becoming an issue. Originally, this problem was not  part of their vocabulary at all. This problem is now there, and  they are becoming aware that something has to be done about it."    While giving his opinion on the implementation of the  government's political program, the prime minister said:    "It would be a major institutional and political change if  we  established a senate in this country. This act or  decisionmaking on this matter and the pace of this step are  totally different, and I think it is useless to speed up  anything in this matter. I will bet that those who are trying  to speed up this process are doing so not because they are  ignorant of the pace of political life, as I am trying to  explain it here. They are not doing it because they think we  could not do without a senate tomorrow or the day after. They  are using this matter as political cards. They keep pulling out  these cards, and that makes it possible for these political  parties to say something more definite. They simply pull out a  card, and, by doing so, they get media space, the papers, the  radio, and so on. I cannot accept this. It is not possible to  turn the territorial setup and the Senate into substitute  problems that would be tackled at the cost of those problems  that are much more urgent."    The last question concerned the granting of citizenship to  former Czech aristocrats and the return of their property. The  prime minister said he hoped that all aspects of this complex  issue will have been taken into consideration when laws are  adopted.</p>

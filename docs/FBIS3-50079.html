The cardinal clearly  rejected the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. If a change of  Bosnia's borders by force were permitted, the borders of Croatia  and other countries would no longer be inviolable either. The  church is calling for a peace that does justice to all  nationalities, explained the cardinal, who sharply condemned  anti-Semitic media reports in Croatia only a few days ago.</p>

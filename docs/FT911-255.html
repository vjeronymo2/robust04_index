			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Regulatory regime in need of direction - The government must start to give its network of industry regulators a clearer purpose What do contraceptives and salt have in common with domestic telephone calls, the BBC television licence fee, commuter rail fares in the south-east, gas and electricity charges? The answer - after a decade of free-market reforms  - is that they all have their prices controlled by regulatory authorities. Regulation in the UK, as the diverse list of products and services suggests, not only lacks coherence but is seldom free of controversy. Regulators have sprung up in an ad hoc way, largely in response to political requirements, as government has privatised industries and opened them up to competition. The Broadcasting Act 1990 created no fewer than six regulators to oversee the television industry, for instance. All the regulators, from the Office of Fair Trading, the utilities - gas (Ofgas), telecommunications (Oftel), electricity (Offer), water (Ofwat) - aviation and television last week gathered for the first time to discuss their role at a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs. Having created a patchwork of regulatory bodies the government is starting to consider how to give them a clearer purpose. Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary is leading the way by addressing how his department's regulatory responsibilities should be made more coherent. To carry out a thoroughgoing review of the regulators' roles, particularly where the privatised utilities are concerned, Mr Lilley's advisers will have to tackle several questions: What criteria should be used to assess whether a regulator is working efficiently? In telecommunications, for instance, there have been complaints that it has taken Oftel far too long to determine the price and conditions under which BT should make its network available to other operators. Comparisons with regulation in other countries might be one way of judging British regulators; more comparisons between the domestic regulators may be useful. One possibility suggested at the conference by Mr Centro Veljnowski, an IEA economist, was to set up a Whitehall audit unit to examine the costs and benefits of regulation and deregulation. Do regulators need to be more activist to represent consumer interests? One of the regulators' main tasks is to protect consumers against utilities with monopoly power. Yet according to Mr Maurice Healey, director of the National Consumer Council, one of the main hindrances faced by regulators is that they can only react to plans proposed by the companies they regulate; they cannot suggest or stipulate what strategies the companies should follow. When BT proposed charging for its directory inquiries service, Oftel was not able to propose an alternative which consumers might have preferred. It could only comment upon BT's plans, says Mr Healey. What scope is there for the regulators to promote competition? Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of Oftel, recognises his task is considerably eased by new technology which is opening up areas of competition in telecommunications. Because of this he can challenge BT with the prospect of entrants coming into the market with new technologies such as mobile telephones or cable television. At the other end of the spectrum is the water industry, where there are no prospects of technology-driven competition. This has led Mr Ian Byatt, the regulator, to adopt so-called 'yardstick competition'. After comparing the performance and costs of different water companies, Mr Byatt will set prices so that all companies have to match the standards set by the best in the industry. As other regulators run up against the realistic limits to competition in their industries, they too may have to turn to 'yardstick competition' to assess the efficiency of the companies they regulate. What should be the responsibility of regulators in maintaining the social aspects of services provided by utilities? Take telecommunications. As a nationalised company BT ran a national network, charging uniform prices, with revenues from more profitable business services offsetting loss-making domestic and rural services. Promoting access to the telephone was part of a social policy sanctioned by governments of both parties. As a privatised company, which faces growing competition, BT's services are likely to become more tailored to different customer groups, which will be charged different prices. There are concerns among Labour critics and trade unions that less affluent, less profitable residential customers will be overlooked in the new world of competition. Oftel and the government will come under pressure to lay out a clear framework for the relationship between the commercial and social aspects of telecommunications markets and how these social obligations should be financed. All the regulators will face this question of balancing social and commercial demands once competition intensifies. Should the regulators be more open in the way they reach decisions? Agreements with the companies they regulate are often concluded in secrecy. Although all the regulators conduct extensive research into their industries, their conclusions are rarely published. Consumers cannot be sure that the regulator has not been quietly 'captured' by the company it regulates. This is one of the dangers of regulation: gradually the regulators 'go native' and start promoting the interests of the industry rather than those of the consumers. In the US, regulation is much more open with hearings held at state and federal level to inquire into company plans. The risk there is that this quasi-judicial system, in which companies give evidence to public hearings, makes the process adversarial and inflexible, says Mr Robert Osgood, a specialist in US regulation with legal firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. 'There is another problem,' says Mr Osgood. 'Judges do not make a coherent management team.' Even if such a judicial system is rejected there is a case for requiring greater openness from the regulators, perhaps modelled on select committee inquiries. The regulators could hold bi-annual reviews of a company's performance which would take evidence from interested parties. The background to important decisions such as significant changes to price caps should be made public. Mr Byatt at Ofwat is leading the way in consulting consumers. His office recently sent out 17m leaflets and held public meetings to seek consumer views on plans to change the way people pay for water services. Who should regulators be accountable to and how should they be held accountable? Regulators should serve consumers, yet their masters are really government ministers. There is the additional danger that if the regulators evade the influence of their companies, they may still be captured by politicians and encouraged to bend to the demands of political expediency. Yet, as the system of regulation is likely to remain a feature of these industries for many years, it would make sense for the regulators to have a power base independent of politicians. An alternative to appointment by ministers would be for subscribers to utility services to elect regulators on the basis of customer manifestos. Their power would then rest upon the relationship with the consumers they serve rather than with ministers. Should the regulators be brought together under one umbrella to create greater coherence in their policies? The idea of a regulator-in-chief has been proposed by the Labour party. It sounds plausible but is probably unnecessary. All the utility regulators rely on the support of the OFT and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Sir Bryan Carsberg says: 'The MMC's role as a backstop is very important to underline our powers.' In the gas industry, the MMC's inquiries in the industrial gas market were one spur for Ofgas to take more radical action than it had planned. One possibility would be for the MMC to be more active as an independent auditor of the regulators' performance. If the system has been successful with the privatised monopoly utilities, could it be extended to other areas of monopoly which remain in the public sector? According to Mr Healey, the most important priority for consumers is that responsibilities for owning a corporation and running a service should be separated from those of regulating it. He says: 'This really opens up significant new territory for consumers because it makes it much clearer where responsibility lies for running a service and setting the standards it should reach.' A corporation with a monopoly in a service, which also sets the standards of service it has to meet, is unlikely to set standards as exacting as those set by an independent regulator. British Rail and the Department of Transport between them own, run and regulate the railways. Consumers regard BR and the department as the chief culprits responsible for poor quality, only to find that these two organisations are also judge and jury of consumer complaints. Rather than wait for privatisation, why not establish Ofpost, for the Post Office, Oftube, for the London Underground or Ofrail for British Rail to give consumers a much clearer voice in decision making. After all, this would be a return to the roots of regulation. The US Interstate Commerce Commission, set up in 1887 as the first modern regulatory agency, was modelled on the British Regulation of Railways Act of 1873, a regulatory scheme which the House of Commons soon after declared to be a failure. For modern regulators to avoid such a fate they will need to be ready to reform themselves as well as the industries they regulate.

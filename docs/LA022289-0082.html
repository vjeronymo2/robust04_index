			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> San Francisco is losing the battle against crack cocaine, according to the San  Francisco Chronicle, which spent two months investigating the problem. Several  city agencies are devoting a majority of their time and money to the crime,  health and social problems created by the highly potent drug. Last year, San  Francisco spent about $72 million battling crack, an amount that was nearly  three times the general fund expenditure for acquired immune deficiency  syndrome, the newspaper said. Among other statistics, the newspaper found that  61% of felony cases filed last year by the San Francisco district attorney  involved possession or sale of the drug, and 77% of foster care cases handled  by the Department of Social Services involved parents addicted to crack.  </P></p>

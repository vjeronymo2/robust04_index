The decision was made during a regular cabinet meeting  on the same day.    The government also agreed to accept the Agriculture  Ministry's current policy of continuing the ceiling of beef  imports on an emergency basis at the current level of 680,000  tons annually, they said. The ceiling measures, agreed to by  Japan and the United States, will allow the government to raise  duties to 75 percent if beef imports surpass the level.    In the Uruguay Round talks, held under auspices of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Japan agreed that duties  on beef imports will be reduced to 38.5 percent from 50 percent  during the six years from 1995.</p>

The upper chamber, the Federation Council will meet at 10.00  Moscow time in the building of the former house of the press at  25, Bolhsaya Dmitrovka.    The lower chamber - the State Duma -- will convene at 36  Novy  Arbat Street, the building which used to house the COMECON  [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] headquarters and then  the Moscow mayor's office.    In accordance with the constitution of the Russian  Federation, the first meeting of the upper chamber will be  opened by the president. The constitution does not provide for  a joint opening session of the two chambers of the Federal  Assembly.

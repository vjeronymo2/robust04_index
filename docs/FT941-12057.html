			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Slimma flotation will raise less than expected Pounds 2.65m - Issue News Slimma, the women's clothing and outsize garments manufacturer, said yesterday that its forthcoming flotation would raise a lower than expected total of Pounds 2.65m for the company. When the Staffordshire-based group announced it was coming to the market last December, it expected to raise about Pounds 5m from the placing of 4.54m new shares. Mr Stephen Thwaite, chief executive, said the discrepancy arose because venture capital investors had decided to sell Pounds 1.5m of shares at the placing price of 120p. Existing directors intended to realise Pounds 750,000 from the flotation, he added. The placing - involving 48.1 per cent of the ordinary share capital - values the company at Pounds 11.4m, but leaves the management and Yorkshire Bank Development Capital, Slimma's venture capital backer, with a majority stake. Nevertheless, the company said the flotation would enable it to increase output and reduce gearing. Mr Thwaite, who led a Pounds 3.3m management buy-out from Tootal in 1991, said funds would also be used to redeem preference shares and 'continue Slimma's strategy or organic growth'. The board had decided to seek a listing - sponsored and brokered by Henry Cooke Lumsden - following a 'significant increase in profits', he added. In the 53 weeks to October 1, pre-tax profits reached Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 545,000) on turnover of Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 13.5m). Pro-forma earnings per share were 9.5p, putting the shares on p/e of 12.6 at the placing price. Dealings in the enlarged group are expected to start next Monday.</p>

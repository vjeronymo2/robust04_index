The masses announced their solid rejection for the blockade  and for any language of threats or warnings applied by the  western states against the Great Jamahiriya.    A statement was issued to express rejection, defiance and  the  readiness to defend the Great al-Fatah revolution and the Arab  nation against the lurking attacks of the vicious neo-crusaders.</p>

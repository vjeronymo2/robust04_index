			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share trade concern is valid Sir, I believe the Office of Fair Trading is correct to express concern over market-makers concealing trades in large blocks of shares from institutional investors ('OFT says stock exchange price secrecy uncompetitive', November 25). Institutions should operate broadly within the constraints of the Normal Market Size, just as everyone else does. Surely the solution lies in finding ways to boost liquidity, rather than attempting to engineer liquidity where it does not exist?

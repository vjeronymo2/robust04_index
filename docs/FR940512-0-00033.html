			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A limited number of manatees (about 15) used the springs in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1970's prior to the establishment of the Banana Island Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They seemed to tolerate and even enjoy some human contact. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``tame'' manatees readily approached divers and allowed themselves to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be petted and lightly scratched (Hartman 1979, Powell and Rathbun  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1984). By 1980, the number of manatees wintering in the bay had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased to just over 100. This increase was greater than could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounted for by reproduction, so it was apparent that some manatees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were immigrating from other areas (Powell and Rathbun 1984). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of manatees that chose to interact with the public increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only slightly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concern for the welfare of the manatees in Kings Bay increased,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> culminating in 1980 when the first manatee sanctuaries were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established. The authority to establish manatee protection areas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either refuges or sanctuaries, is provided by the Endangered Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1973, as amended, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codified at 50 CFR 17, Subpart J. Under Subpart J, the Director may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish, by regulation, manatee protection areas whenever he or she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines there is substantial evidence that there is imminent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> danger of a taking (including harassment) of one or more manatees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that such establishment is necessary to prevent such a taking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This regulation allows the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to regulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities in state waters to protect an endangered species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1983 the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge was created  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to protect manatees from any potential negative impacts of human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities. The refuge owns Banana Island, Warden Key and Buzzard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Island in Kings Bay, a house on the eastern shore currently being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used as the headquarters, and some other properties in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manatee use of Kings Bay during winter months now exceeds 240  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animals (FWS unpublished data). A majority of manatees currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the spring do not tolerate close human contact and leave the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warmer spring waters when humans approach too closely. Research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted during the 1988&hyph;89 winters indicated manatees spend a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate amount of their time in sanctuaries, in direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship to the number of boats present, regardless of weather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions (Buckingham 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Efforts have been made to make divers, snorklers, and boaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aware of the manatee harassment problem. Visitors have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructed through posters, brochures, and by dive shop personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they should not aggressively pursue manatees or drive them from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the springs. Most visitors to King's Bay have been very cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this regard. While most visitors conscientiously avoid outright  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harassment, many seek the manatees out, approaching them to observe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and even pet them. Although a few manatees tolerate and occasionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invite attention, most appear to find these interactions intolerable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and alter their behavior accordingly. At times, the large number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> humans concentrated in this relatively confined area forces all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manatees to seek less disturbing conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The largest manatee aggregations on Florida's west coast are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found during winter months on the ledges surrounding the refuge's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> main spring. Manatees often collect there in the evenings and remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the early morning hours. When few divers are present and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those few are quiet, manatees usually linger around the main boil,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly in colder weather. However, on days when divers arrive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in force soon after sunrise, those manatees least able to tolerate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human crowding begin leaving the spring and move into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctuaries. As greater numbers of divers arrive, more manatees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leave (FWS unpublished data). On days when the temperatures of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrounding waters are not excessively cold, this may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical, although it still alters the manatee's natural behavior.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On days when surrounding water temperatures are below 68 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presents a potentially serious problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although some manatees can tolerate limited exposure to waters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as cold as 56.3 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F (13.5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C) (Hartman, 1979) others become lethargic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and cease feeding at temperatures less than in 68 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F (20 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C) water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Campbell and Irvine 1981). Carcasses recovered following major cold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events showed atrophy of fat, emaciation, and an absence of food in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the gastrointestinal tract with no sign of disease; characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with death from hypothermia. Manatees appear unable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase heat production through metabolic activity sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counter losses to the environment. Manatees are tropical warm-water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammals. They feed on low-energy forage and have high thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conductance and exceptionally low metabolic rates (only 15 to 22  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of predicted values based on body size) (Irvine 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida is at the northern limit of their winter range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subadult manatees appear to be especially susceptible to death  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from hypothermia. This is probably a combination of their larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface to volume ratio and their lack of experience in finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermal refuges. The length of time a manatee can tolerate cold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water before its health is compromised depends on its condition_a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor which cannot easily be measured on free-ranging manatees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Experiments on Amazonian manatees ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. inunguis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) showed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underweight, nutritionally stressed, and fasting mammals have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drastically lowered capacity for heat production (Scrimshaw et al.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1968, Chandra and Newberne 1977:127&hyph;176).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During an extreme cold event in 1990, several manatees died in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brevard County, Florida. These manatees sought thermal refuge at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warm-water discharge from an electrical power generating plant on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banana River. Although the discharge raised the temperature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water approximately 10 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F, under those extreme conditions, it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient to keep them alive. There is probably no thermal refuge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Florida warm enough to guarantee the health of all resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manatees during an extremely cold winter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

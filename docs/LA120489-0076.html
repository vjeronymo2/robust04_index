			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chiat Fits Reebok: Rumors about athletic shoemaker Reebok's displeasure with  the Venice agency Chiat/Day/Mojo seem to have been put to rest. Reebok's  International Division based in England appointed the ad agency's London office  to work with it in the "development" of the Reebok brand outside North America.  The company did not specify the size of the business. Chiat/Day/Mojo's New York  office creates ads for Reebok in the United States.  </P></p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: SCA to sell clothes division SCA, the Swedish forestry products group, is to sell Melka-Tenson, a leisure and sportswear manufacturer, to William Baird, the UK textiles group. The Pounds 14.5m (Dollars 22.6m) deal - Baird's second acquisition in 10 days - is expected to lift the UK group's sales in continental Europe from about Pounds 20m this year to more than Pounds 80m by the end of 1995. SCA's Molnlycke subsidiary is selling Melka-Tenson, which has three manufacturing plants in Portugal, at a price 'slightly above' its net book value, which stands at about SKr185m (Dollars 24.7m). Baird, with annual sales of about Pounds 500m, produces chiefly for the UK market. It said it intended to keep Melka-Tenson as a separate unit within the Baird group, and maintain its present management. Mr Donald Parr, Baird's chairman, said Melka-Tenson would have a beneficial impact on next year's profits, although it would make only a minor contribution in the first half. He said the acquisition would leave the UK group with modest borrowings of about Pounds 3.5m. The deal is the second strategic move announced this week by Molnlycke. The company, with annual sales of SKr15bn, plans to strengthen its core operations in absorbent materials, tissue and clinical products. As well as disposing of Melka-Tenson, Molnlycke is looking to sell its toiletry division. Molnlycke's biggest operations are in so-called 'fluff products', disposable baby nappies, adult incontinence products and feminine hygiene products. On Wednesday, Molnlycke said it was spending SKr400m on buying up the balance of Scott Health Care, a 50-50 joint venture with Scott Paper in the US.</p>

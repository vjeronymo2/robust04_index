			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Arts: Hamilton's Gaslight shines as a melodrama Few British 20th-century writers can be undergoing such a rapid rehabilitation as Patrick Hamilton who died, even then almost forgotten, in 1962. Within the past year or so, there has been a new biography by Sean French, a successful revival of Hamilton's play, Rope, at Chichester, and now comes a thoroughly enjoyable Gaslight in Edniburgh. In the 1930s Hamilton was a considerable literary figure, admired by such fellow writers as JB Priestley, Noel Coward, Ivor Novello and Graham Greene. The only question seemed to be whether he would be remembered more for his novels than his plays. It was the plays that made him affluent. Hollywood picked him up and there were movies of both Gaslight and Rope. As his brother, Bruce, related in a biography published in 1972, it was partly the money that drove Hamilton to drink, or at least allowed him to drink to such excess in relative comfort. Clearly there were other factors. Hamilton developed a rigid attachment to Stalinism and was a close acquaintance of the writer, Claud Cockburn. He had strange ideas about religion and disliked abroad. Like many Englishmen, however, perhaps the key fact about him was that the second world war interrupted his career. When the war was over, just like Coward he went on writing. But the world had changed and reputations dipped. After a decent interval, however, we can begin again to respect the old crafts. Rope is a psychological thriller about a 'perfect murder' based on a real case. Gaslight was originally presented as a thriller as well  - at Richmond, then in London's West End in 1938. In Kenny Ireland's revival, Gaslight has become more of a melodrama, and is none the worse for that. Sometimes it comes close to comedy. Whenever anything dramatic is happening, there is a tendency for heavy cello playing in the background or the chiming of bells. It is not until the end that there is a real frisson. This is when it becomes quite conceivable, even if you know the text in advance, that the director will change it and Mrs Manningham will slit her husband's throat instead of just teasing him. The play was initially set in an unfashionable part of west London around the end of the last century. It was a brilliant idea to change the place to Edinburgh, which is even more appropriate, for much of the atmosphere is heavy, formal and dour, but not without manners. At least one passage might have been written for the Scottish stage. When Mrs Manningham is introduced to a new medicine by the kindly former detective Rough, she asks what it tastes like. 'Delicious]' Rough replies. 'Something between ambrosia and methylated spirits. Do you mean to say you've never tasted good Scotch whisky?' Mrs Manningham remembers that it is what her mother used to give her when she had a fever as a child: her appreciation comes back, and gradually her sanity. If there is a flaw, it is that the gaslights - which are central to the plot  -never go down quite dramatically enough when there is a prowler upstairs. Thus the really sinister element of the piece has been diminished. For the rest, the acting and direction are terrific. Vivien Heilbron, in the part first played by Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, is a superbly neurotic Mrs Manningham throughout. At the end, when she realises she is sane, she becomes almost frightening in the potential use of her power. John Fraser as Rough is an amiably Scottish former policeman, perhaps with too much of a doctor's bedside manner. And David Rintoul as Mr Manningham is as elegant a Victorian villain as you are likely to find. Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until Feb 5. (031) 229 9697.</p>

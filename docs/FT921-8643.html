			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Russian oil workers lower output to press demands STRIKING oil workers in Russia's northern region of Komi have halted one-tenth of their oil production to press demands for the freeing of energy prices, special tax benefits, and improved supplies of industrial equipment, food and consumer goods. Itar-Tass news agency said workers in the Komi autonomous republic, who began warning stoppages at 96 oil wells at the weekend, had decided to abstain from further action elsewhere until today, pending talks with the government in Moscow. The shortfall amounts to more than 3,500 tonnes a day. Oil workers in both Komi and Tyumen, by far Russia's largest oil producing region, have been threatening strike action for weeks. They say the government has failed to honour a promise by President Boris Yeltsin to let them sell one-tenth of the oil for their own benefit. The government has been working on a deal to raise workers' pay and eventually to free the domestic price of oil, currently fixed at Rbs350 a tonne for deliveries to the state. Russian oil output last year is estimated at 461m tonnes, 11 per cent down from 1990.</p>

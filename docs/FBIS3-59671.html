			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nakao Ishida, Chairman of the Cosmos Planning </F> Promotion Conference, Professor Emeritus of Tohoku University,  Doctor in the Medical Department of Tohoku National University]    [Text] The Tohoku Intelligent Cosmos Plan which covers the  seven prefectures in the Tohoku region including Niigata  prefecture was proposed in 1987, has proceeded smoothly, and six  years have already passed. Its intent is to make the Tohoku  region a major base of science, technology, and information as  well as a base to launch information overseas.    We see that 11 R&amp;D companies have been established in  each  region in Tohoku. Creative research organizations related to  communications, new materials, and biotechnology appeared one by  one. More than 50 patents have been applied for at the Low Power  High-Speed Communication Laboratory since research activities  began five years ago.  <H5>  1. Funding </H5>   Bases for basic and applied research can be established in  Japan outside of universities. Investment capital consisted of  the 70&percnt; which came from special industrial investment by  the  government and the remaining 30&percnt; of private capital.  Companies  with a particularly strong interest in the research items  provided funds and researchers to give rise to a new form of  research laboratory with money and people. It was proven that if  prominent researchers or research advisors are present, research  development is possible even outside university laboratories.  <H5>  2. Research period </H5>   One problem is the time limitation. Specifically, we would  like to think in terms of six years. As a consequence, the  research content is squeezed into an approach road until  establishment. Moreover, specifying the method for research  cooperation is crucial. Even when the objective is shared,  regular preparation such as adjusting the methodology is  required from the first year of the undertaking.  <H5>  3. Regional expectations and central expectations </H5>   The next obstacle posed is how are these results tied to  advanced industrialization. Not only specially licensed  corporations called base centers (Ministry of International  Trade and Industry and Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications)  which are in charge of investments, the biological research  organization (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries),  or the medical equipment fund (Ministry of Health and Welfare)  have the "desire to clarify the output," each private  corporation participating in R&amp;D imagines commercial  development  of the results. In addition, while thoroughly supporting the  ideas and substance of the plan in the Tohoku Intelligent  Cosmos Plan in the government's Tohoku Development Promotion  Plan which received Cabinet approval on March 22, 1991. The  expectation of obtaining results that fostered new industries  was clearly stated.  <H5>  4. Operation of future regional bases </H5>   The seeds chosen for R&amp;D were not begun without  sufficient  alignment with the needs of the companies or the country. In  addition, businesses generally do not have the boldness and  implementation strength to position themselves for new product  development and production. This is a dilemma of regional areas.  As a result, with industry, government, and academia continuing  to understand each others perspectives. The problems exposed by  people in the objective awareness of the level of academia, the  improvements in overall understanding by the government, and the  prerequisite investment by industry are being eliminated through  cooperation.</p>

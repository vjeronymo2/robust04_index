			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Stelco and Dofasco slip into red CANADA'S two biggest steelmakers, Dofasco and Stelco, suffered a combined loss of more than CDollars 160m (USDollars 136.7m) in 1991, exacerbated by a sharp deterioration in business conditions towards the end of the year. Dofasco's loss was CDollars 25m, or 73 cents a share, compared with a loss after writedowns of CDollars 679.2m, or CDollars 10.64, in 1990. The bulk of the 1990 loss came from the write-off of the company's CDollars 713m investment in Algoma Steel. Revenues dipped to CDollars 2.06bn from CDollars 2.36bn. Stelco suffered a net loss of CDollars 136m, or CDollars 3.05 a share, against the 1990 loss of CDollars 197m, or CDollars 5.96 a share. Revenues edged down to CDollars 2bn from CDollars 2.09bn. Dofasco's fourth-quarter loss was CDollars 1.5m, including an operating loss of CDollars 24.4m. Stelco said that an improvement in its financial performance in the first nine months of last year came to an 'abrupt' halt, which left it CDollars 38m in the red in the final three months. It blamed the fourth-quarter setback on a sharp price decline caused by the need to find new markets for higher-value products earmarked for the automotive industry. Dofasco said that demand for flat rolled steel dropped by 10 per cent last year, and 24 per cent below the peak of 1988. Total steel shipments dipped by 6 per cent in the fourth quarter to 872,000 tons.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 2 March  publishes on page 8 a 400-word article by special correspondent  Monica Vecco in Trujillo. The article notes that a high-level  delegation from LA REPUBLICA Publishing House Inc. visited  Trujillo to oversee the progress of a project to create regional  satellite editions of the newspapers LA REPUBLICA and EL  POPULAR, scheduled to go into circulation within 60 days.    Vecco reports that this project, which carries a cost of  $250,000, envisages the establishment of LA REPUBLICA regional  branches in Trujillo, Chiclayo, and Piura which, while having  "total technological and news support from Lima," will hire  local manpower and cover local news to cater to an increasing  readership. The newspapers will be printed in Chiclayo, but  there will be editorial offices in each city.</p>

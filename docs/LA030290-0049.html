			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> On Your Way Out: The major TV networks agreed Wednesday to jointly conduct exit  polls and project winners on Election Day to save money and lessen the  competitive pressure to call a race before the polls close in the West. CNN,  which has not conducted exit polls before, joined ABC, CBS and NBC in the  consortium, to be known as Voter Research and Surveys. The organization will  survey a random sampling of voters as they leave polling places each Election  Day, providing its findings on local, state and national races to the networks  and other media.

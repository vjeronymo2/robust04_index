			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Mercosur tariff 'delayed' PLANS to create Mercosur, a common market of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, by 1995 will now be delayed, according to Mr Guido Di Tella, Argentine foreign minister. He said in an interview that economic difficulties in Brazil, and its insistence on greater import protection of sensitive industrial products, will delay the full introduction of a common external tariff for imports into the region. Mr Di Tella said: 'I do not think we will reach 100 per cent of the common external tariff, but our estimation is that 80 per cent of products by value will be covered. On 20 per cent of goods, such as computers and capital equipment, we will have to accept these being exempted from the tariff, so we will have 80 per cent of a common market. We never thought we would reach 100 per cent.' Brazil would have higher tariffs on such goods for five to seven years. Argentina would not alter its lower tariffs, which would give it a competitive advantage, he said.</p>

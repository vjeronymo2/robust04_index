			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Khasbulatov in power bid Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the former speaker of the Russian parliament who was ousted in an violent struggle with the President Boris Yeltsin last October, yesterday stepped up his bid to return to power in his native Chechnya. Chechnya, which effectively broke away from the Russian Federation two years ago, is now gripped by a civil war between supporters of President Dzhokhar Dudayev and opposition forces which have turned to Moscow for support. Mr Khasbulatov, an ethnic Chechen, offered yesterday to mediate between the warring factions. This may prove unnecessary, however. Reports from Chechnya suggest that Mr Dudayev's forces still control most of the territory in the republic and Russia is proving to be a reluctant ally for the Chechen opposition. Reports suggest opposition leaders have lost popular support because of their open links with Russia.</p>

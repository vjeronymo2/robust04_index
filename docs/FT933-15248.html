			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cleggs sell Anglo Irish stake THE 14.98 per cent Clegg family holding in Anglo Irish Bank Corporation has been sold by Mrs Jayne Wright for about Pounds 10.8m. Mrs Wright is the half-sister of Mr John Clegg, once a director of the bank and the former managing director of Wace, the UK-based pre-press and specialist printing group. Mr Clegg departed Wace suddenly as the DTI investigated share dealings, conducted in the name of some of his relatives, in Parkway, a Wace acquisition. Mr Willie McAteer, Anglo Irish finance director, said there had been 'no encouragement' to Mrs Wright to sell - indeed there had been no contact with the Clegg family for 12 months. The shares had been bought by a number of Irish, UK and US institutions. He said that in 1984 the family viewing the bank, then known as City of Dublin Bank, as undervalued, had bought a stake of about 17 1/2 per cent. They had since subscribed for all their rights, not allowing the stake to dilute. Mr McAteer said they had taken up their rights on 9m shares in this February's 1-for-1 issue at 46p. However, he did not know the cost of the original stake. He added that it would not now be possible to acquire such a stake. In 1984 rules were imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland outlawing holdings of more than 10 per cent by individuals without approval. He suggested that Mrs Wright had always been the owner of the shares and Mr Clegg was the stake's representative on the board.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / ANC condemns Buthelezi plan THE African National Congress yesterday condemned Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's plan for autonomy in Natal province, which is rapidly emerging as a stumbling block to multi-party negotiations on a new constitution. The ANC said yesterday it would boycott any referendum called to test the plan, under which the KwaZulu black homeland and white-run Natal would form a new state with strong autonomous powers within a federal South Africa. But Chief Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha party, brushed aside condemnation from the government and the ANC and said he would proceed with the poll nonetheless. The ANC said Chief Buthelezi's purpose was to sabotage national negotiations. The chief 'has chosen the path of conflict and confrontation which can lead to intensified violence,' it said, adding that his plan amounted to 'enforced balkanisation on the model of the apartheid past'. Meanwhile, the ANC and the government met for a second day at a secret venue for constitutional talks, while the radical Pan Africanist Congress Youth League threatened to kill whites if PAC leaders were arrested in connection with the murder of four whites in a terrorist attack at a golf club last weekend. The PAC's armed wing has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>

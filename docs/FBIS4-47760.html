			<p>BFN     [Text] Port Elizabeth SAPA May 2 -- The 30,000-odd votes  disputed in Port Elizabeth's KwaZakhele township would be  counted but not included in the final tally for the Eastern Cape  metropole, political parties and electoral officials agreed on  Monday [2 May] evening.    A criminal investigation of electoral fraud is under way  after police alleged Independent Electoral Commission (IEC)  officials had tampered with the ballot on the second day of  voting last week. The claim is that 30 of the boxes were  improperly sealed or hinged. The docket must still be forwarded  to the attorney-general. The IEC has not conceded that  tampering occurred.    The IEC and all political parties announced in a joint  statement that one ballot box was no longer in dispute, after it  was examined in their presence and monitored by foreign  observers.    The result for Port Elizabeth is expected within the hour.  The KwaZakhele votes would be recorded separately and the  ballot would be stored in an isolated area until the IEC had  reached a decision.    IEC official Rob Midgley said he could not comment on how  soon the IEC's final determination would take but said: "This  will be done as soon as possible."    The National Party [NP] has formally requested the IEC  declare the KwaZakhele vote invalid. The joint statement  confirms the NP's "formal complaint" will be forwarded to the  commission for final determination.    IEC officials and party agents were locked in a meeting all  day to settle the dispute on the KwaZakhele ballot boxes.  Counting of the KwaZakhele votes haz now started.</p>

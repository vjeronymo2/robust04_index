			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Big rise in US consumer confidence: Bond prices fall sharply on fears over pace of economic expansion US consumer confidence leapt this month to its highest level for four years, alarming stock and bond markets which had assumed that consumer spending and the pace of expansion would cool in the months ahead. The Conference Board, a New York-based business grouping, said its widely watched monthly index jumped to 101.3 in November, up an 'imposing' 12 points from October. The index, based on a survey of 5,000 households, showed sharp increases in confidence levels in all regions of the country except the south, although even there confidence improved slightly. Financial markets took fright at the signal of economic strength, which comes despite the Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates by an unexpectedly fierce  3/4 of a percentage point on November 15. Bond prices fell sharply yesterday just after the board's announcement, while the dollar rose. In late trading, the 30-year Treasury bond was half a point down at 94, yielding 8.026 per cent. The stock market ended flat, although earlier in the day it had followed declines in the bond market. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 1.01 down at 3,738.55. Most economic forecasts predict a slowdown in growth next year after the Fed's 2 1/2 -percentage-point increase in short-term rates so far this year. But Mr Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research centre, said the level of the index suggested that the economy would continue expanding. 'The latest consumer confidence readings strongly suggest that fears of an imminent slowing of the economy are unrealistic,' he said. A survey of 47 economists published yesterday by the National Association of Business Economists forecast that gross domestic product would grow by 2.5 per cent in 1995, slowing from 3.8 per cent this year. However, some Wall Street economists voiced caution about the reliability of the consumer confidence signal. Mr Bruce Steinberg, manager of macroeconomic analysis at Merrill Lynch, warned that consumer confidence had not proved to be a very accurate predictor of consumer spending trends or economic activity in recent years. 'While it may reflect mood shifts, it doesn't necessarily anticipate spending shifts,' he said, noting that the most obvious explanation was the election result.

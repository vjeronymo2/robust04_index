Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BALTIC AUTONOMY PLAN APPROVED  </P> <P> Legislators today gave final approval to a plan putting the small Baltic  republics on the road to economic autonomy from Moscow next year and possibly  issuing their own currencies.  </P> <P> Deputies from the tiny republic of Estonia stood and cheered after the Soviet  Parliament approved the measure on a vote of 296 to 67. Thirty-seven deputies  abstained.  </P> <P> A final vote on the bill had been delayed Friday after a sharp debate on  whether the move amounted to an effort to tear apart the Soviet system.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev supported the bill as a step toward economic  reform.  </P> <P> Tass press agency said the law goes into effect Jan. 1 and gives Lithuania,  Latvia and Estonia "the right to engage in independent economic activity and  envisages equal participation in union activity."  </P></p>

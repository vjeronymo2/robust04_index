			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Bell Atlantic buys cable TV company for Dollars 22bn BELL ATLANTIC, the US regional telephone group, announced an agreement yesterday to buy Tele-Communications Inc, the largest American cable television company, for up to about Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14bn) in a deal that will radically change the US communication industry. It will also be one of the country's biggest takeovers. The deal would be the first full merger between a US telephone company and a cable business while the two industries are converging to create a single, multi-media inter-active entertainment and information business. Bell Atlantic, the Baby Bell telecommunications group serving part of the US eastern seaboard, has been one of the most aggressive telephone companies trying to enter the video industry. TCI, based in Denver, has been built up by Mr John Malone, its chief executive, over the past 20 years into a company serving one in five cable homes. The share swap deal would also include Liberty Media, a cable programming company that TCI spun off in 1991. It announced plans to re-acquire the business last Friday. Yesterday's pact may have implications for the takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications. Liberty Media is an important shareholder in QVC Network, the home shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, which is making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount, in competition with a Dollars 7.5bn agreed bid from cable company Viacom. Analysts said the Bell Atlantic deal may help strengthen QVC's position. Mr Malone said yesterday that the QVC bid was peripheral to the Bell Atlantic deal. Viacom, which has launched a legal suit trying to block the QVC bid because of Mr Malone's alleged 'monopolistic intentions' called on Congress to 'take a hard look' at Mr Malone's record. The Bell Atlantic deal will face close regulatory scrutiny. Ms Janet Reno, the US attorney general, said last night that the Justice Department and the House of Representatives telecommunications subcommittee would look into the acquisition. Under the 1984 cable act, regional telecommunications companies are forbidden to buy cable companies where they operate telephone services. To get round that, TCI's cable service operations in the Bell Atlantic region would be spun off. In addition, Bell Atlantic's acquisition of TCI and Liberty's cable programming assets have to be cleared by the court that oversaw the creation of the Baby Bell companies in 1984, when American Telephone and Telegraph was split up. Wall Street welcomed the deal, with Bell Atlantic's stock closing at Dollars 65 7/8 , up Dollars 5 7/8 , while TCI's A shares rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 31 3/8 and other cable stocks rallied on expectations of a spate of bids.

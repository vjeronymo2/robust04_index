			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Foreign Ministry Spokesman's Statement"] </F>   [Text] Tirana, May 25 (ATA) -- Albanian Foreign Minister  Alfred Serreqi received on May 24, 1994 the ambassador of the  Greek Republic, Khristodhoulos Tsalikis, on the request of the  latter.    Greek ambassador set forth to the Albanian foreign minister  a  demarche of Greek Government on the accuses of the authorities  of the Albanian Public Order Ministry, against six people of  Greek minority, for illegal possession of arms and for illegal  activity against Albanian territory, in collaboration with Greek  secret service. In the Greek Government demarche, among others  is said, that in such a situation is impossible to hold the  foreseen meeting between the Albanian and Greek officials, and  let alone the meeting between the two foreign ministers.    Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi turned down the  Greek demarche, considering it as a premature reaction and as an  expression of good will lacking on the part of Greek Government,  to develop a constructive and bilateral dialogue. He pointed  out that the above-mentioned statement is not issued by the  Ministry of Public Order, but by the Tirana Attorney's Office,  and we are amazed by the fact that Greek Government confounds  these two institutions, which in Albania are separate by law and  independent from each other.    Minister Serreqi pointed out that the Greek act or demarche  is completely unacceptable and constitutes an interference to  the interior affairs of the independent Albanian judges and  attorneys offices, which will hold a just and no-one sided  judgment, in conformity with the laws of the Albanian state.    Between other things, Minister Serreqi pointed out to the  Greek ambassador that the Albanian state doesn't base the  treatment of its citizens on the ethnic belonging. He said that  during the judgment, which will be opened, proofs will be  presented, which will be treated by the independent judge's body  with objectivity, professionalism, and full transparency. The  Greek side has no right to prejudice the Albanian justice.    The Albanian Government confirms its readiness to contribute  even in the future to the solution of all the disagreements  between the two countries through the bilateral dialogue. The  Albanian Government will be opened to the commissions or  missions of the CSCE, EU, and the Security Council or other  international institutions which are interested to give their  contribution to their solution.    The spokesman expresses the doubt that the undevelopment of  the meeting between the two foreign ministers, proposed by the  Albanian side and accepted by the Greek side many days after the  detention of the six accused people, the usage as a pretext for  that by the Greek side of the announcement of the Tirana  Attorney's Office, considering it as an announcement of the  Ministry of Public Order, has more to do with the interior  problems and the elections fevers in Greece and it is an  expression of a constant nervousness of the Greek Government to  the intensive attempts of the Albanian Government for a broader  cooperation and stability in the region.</p>

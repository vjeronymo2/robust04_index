			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER OF SLAIN GIRL SEIZED IN DRUG RAID;  </P> <P> NARCOTICS: WOMAN AND TWO OTHERS ARE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT NEWHALL HOME. HER  DAUGHTER HAD BEEN SEXUALLY MOLESTED AND MURDERED LAST YEAR.  </P> <P> A woman whose plight gained statewide attention last year after her missing  7-year-old daughter was found sexually molested and strangled in a neighbor's  house was charged Thursday with drug possession, authorities said.  </P> <P> Linda Hodges, 43, of Apple Valley and two others were arrested Tuesday night  when Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies raided the Newhall house where she  formerly lived with her daughter, Sara Nan. Hodges was visiting the home at the  time of the raid.  </P> <P> The deputies seized a quarter pound of methamphetamine, a gun and $5,000 in  cash, said Deputy Gabe Ramirez. Arrested with Hodges were Don Hall, 38, and his  sister, Mary Alexander, 39, who live in the home in the 24900 block of  Alderbrook Drive.  </P> <P> Deputies said they found a small quantity of methamphetamine in Hodges' purse  and she was charged with possession of the drug, commonly referred to as speed.  Deputies said they believe the larger quantity of drugs belonged to Hall and  Alexander, who were charged with the sale of methamphetamine. An investigator  said there was no evidence Hodges was involved in the sales of drugs at the  house.  </P> <P> Hodges and Hall pleaded not guilty Thursday in Newhall Municipal Court.  Alexander's arraignment is set for Monday.  </P> <P> Hodges lived with Alexander in the Alderbrook Drive house in March, 1989, when  her daughter disappeared while playing outside. She became the subject of a  massive search by deputies and community volunteers for three days before her  body was found March 26 in a neighbor's home.  </P> <P> The girl had been sexually molested and strangled and her body was stuffed  behind the headboard of a water bed. Fourteen-year-old Curtiss Cooper was  arrested, later pleaded guilty to killing the girl and was sentenced to 25  years to life in prison.  </P> <P> The disappearance and death of the girl touched the community and dozens of  strangers helped search for her, attended her funeral and contributed to a fund  to pay her funeral costs.  </P> <P> Four months after the tragedy, Sara Nan's father, Wallace S. Mann, who was  separated from Hodges, committed suicide on the girl's grave. Investigators  concluded that Mann, 36, was distraught over his daughter's slaying and the  breakup of his marriage.  </P> <P> Deputies said Linda Hodges' arrest this week came after a two-month  investigation of activities at the house on Alderbrook Drive. A narcotics  investigator said the investigation was begun after deputies received numerous  complaints from neighbors that drugs were being sold at the house.  </P> <P> An investigator, who asked not to be identified, said Hodges was often seen at  the house during the investigation and was believed to have remained close  friends with the two other suspects after moving to Apple Valley last year. The  investigator said Hodges was doing yardwork at the house at the time  investigators arrived Tuesday night with a search warrant for the property.  </P> <P> He said Hodges was arrested at least once before for drug possession.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Brad Stone said deputies found three-tenths of a gram of  methamphetamine and a bag containing cotton balls soaked with liquid  methamphetamine in Hodges' purse.  </P> <P> "She had a good usable quantity but not enough to imply sales," Stone said.  </P> <P> The quarter pound of the drug found in the house could be worth as much as  $3,750 if sold on the street, deputies said.  </P> <P> Hodges, who has one other daughter, was being held at the sheriff's station  jail in Valencia in lieu of $5,000 bail. No bail was set for Hall because his  arrest violated his parole for a conviction of possession of narcotics for  sale, deputies said.  </P> <P> Alexander was released on $15,000 bail. Her husband, Robert Alexander, was shot  to death by a sheriff's deputy in 1983 after a struggle erupted when he was  arrested on suspicion of possession of narcotics paraphernalia.  </P></p>

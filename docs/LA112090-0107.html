			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> YOU KNOW IT'S FAKE: Milli Vanilli has 'fessed up to singing not a note of its  top-selling album "Girl You Know It's True" and is returning its Grammy award  (A1). . . . "Good for them," says Jon St. James, La Habra-based  producer-manager of hit pop artists Stacey Q and Bardeux. . . . "It was an  embarrassment that they won it in the first place. Everyone pretty much knew  what they were doing. . . . I don't see how they had the nerve to do it." Jim  Newton and Jerry Hicks  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Colonel Anatoliy Belousov report: "No Such Thing As Bad </F> Weather When It Comes to Combat Training. There Are Problems,  But Even They Are Surmountable. Summer Training Period in  Russian Armed Forces Began 1 June"]    [Text] The winter combat training period was more  difficult than ever before. Judge for yourselves: Reform of  the Armed Forces continues, troop groupings and infrastructures  are being set up on Russian Federation territory, the withdrawal  of troops to Russian territory is being completed, and mobile  forces are being created.... And all this is going on when  funding for military programs is clearly inadequate, there is a  huge personnel shortage, and the social problems dogging  servicemen are in practice insuperable today.    Nevertheless, due credit has to be given to the Army and  Navy: Despite all these difficulties, they demonstrated during  the winter period that they remain wholly battleworthy and  controlled. On the whole, they fulfilled the training plans.  And, a particularly important point, they proved their mettle  quite well in command-staff training drills at both the  strategic and the operational-strategic levels, and also in the  "Baykal" and "Northwest" command staff exercises and in  exercises for collective peacemaking forces and Border Troops on  the Tajik-Afghan border and others. Defense Minister Army  General Pavel Grachev noted that the weightiest successes were  attained by the Strategic Missile Troops, Moscow and Leningrad  Military Districts, the Group of Russian Troops in the  Transcaucasus, and the Leningrad Naval Base. Matters fared  worse in the Pacific Fleet.    So what were the specific results with which the troops and  naval forces arrived at the halfway mark? What will the  emphasis be on in the summer combat training period?  <H5>  Strategic Missile Troops </H5>   As Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Dolinin, our permanent  correspondent for the Strategic Missile Troops, reports, during  the winter half of the year the troops resolved a triple task,  as it were. New regiments equipped with "Topol" missiles were  brought into the effective combat strength, old missile  complexes which had served double their recommended lifetime  were removed from alert duty, and the testing of the new "Topol  M" missile progressed vigorously at the test range in Mirnyy.    However, alert duty did not cease even for a minute against  the backdrop of this extensive and complex work. Planned combat  training is also progressing smoothly. Russian Federation  Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev, Ivan Rybkin, and  Vladimir Shumeyko, who visited the Strategic Missile Troops this  year, made a high assessment of the missilemen's combat  readiness.    When it comes to the plans and tasks for the summer training  period, Lieutenant General Viktor Yesin, chief of the Strategic  Missile Troops Main Staff Operations Directorate, stressed, then  the triple task which was being resolved in the winter training  period remains for the summer too.  <H5>  Ground Troops </H5>   The tasks for the winter period were on the whole fulfilled  by the Ground Troops. Although only 70 percent of the planned  number of exercises were conducted during the winter training  period. The problems of maintaining combat readiness, improving  the combat skill of troops, and bolstering discipline and law  and order are now being tackled. Questions of manning units and  combined units remain acute. At present primary officer posts  are just over 60 percent filled, and the shortfall in the  numbers of soldiers and sergeants is even greater. So it is  planned to hire 90,000 men on a contract basis this year.  <H5>  Air Forces </H5>   An effective summary of the results of the winter training  period, Colonel Gennadiy Lisenkov, press center chief, reports,  was the "West-94" command-staff exercise conducted under the  leadership of Air Force Commander-in-Chief Colonel General of  Aviation Petr Deynekin. This exercise involved strategic  bombers, fighters, frontal aviation, and practically all Air  Force communications centers, and combat engineer service  subunits and rear services subunits.    The crews performing alert duty proved to be up to the mark.  The large strategic formations commanded by General V. Kozlov  and General A. Vasilyev were commended.    But the airmen also have plenty of problems. The improvement  of existing aviation formations, which are left with only  "fourth generation" combat equipment, has been set for the  summer training period and the period through the year 2000.  New hardware has to be mastered quickly. However, there are  shortages at every step here. The dearth of aviation fuel,  spare parts, and specialist equipment used at airfields is being  felt keenly....  <H5>  Navy </H5>   The substantial changes in the foreign and domestic  situation  required that the entire system of views on the organizational  development and utilization of naval forces be radically  revised. A fitting concept was elaborated. By the end of the  winter training period substantial measures to reform the Navy  and give it qualities consonant with present conditions were  completed. Combat service and alert duty remained the most  important indicators of the real status and activity of the  Navy. These were implemented according to plan by the forces of  all fleets in the light of the actual situation and operational  need. Daily combat service at sea and alert duty at bases was  performed by several dozen ships, and almost one half of these  were submarines.    According to the plans, in the summer training period ships  will continue to resolve tasks at sea, including in the Indian  Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and also the Barents and Okhotsk  Seas, and in the Atlantic Ocean.  <H5>  Air Defense Troops </H5>   During the last training year the only regiment in Russia's  Armed Forces to be deemed excellent was the Air Defense regiment  under the command of Colonel Anatoliy Akulinin. It is too early  to say what the situation will be this year, but the fact that  the leaders inspired others in their wake is indisputable.    As Commander-in-Chief Colonel General of Aviation Viktor  Prudnikov stressed, though numbers were cut, the quality and  reliability of the Air Defense Troops were maintained.    The "Northwest" and "Repulse-94" command staff exercises  tested and rehearsed the principles of the organization and  control of various types of Troops and air defense systems.  During the training period 31 exercises were carried out, and  five surface-to-air missile units and seven aviation regiments  conducted live fire. Those serving under Lieutenant General  Anatoliy Bochkov were deemed to be the best. Particular  attention will be paid during summer combat training to the  system for monitoring Russia's airspace and to improving the  missile early warning system. The principle for structuring the  air defense system is also to change. It will become  territorial.    The main efforts will be channeled into developing teamwork  and coordination and training crews and subunits for action in a  complex, rapidly changing situation, making maximum use of the  combat potential of hardware and arms. Exercises will be  conducted jointly with units from other branches of the Armed  Forces.    But, our permanent correspondent for the Air Defense Troops  Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Ivanov reports, unless it proves  possible soon to rectify the situation regarding the provision  of units with resources making it possible to carry out combat  training systematically, combat readiness may decline.    As we can see, it has not yet proved possible in all  branches  of the Armed Forces to organize the training process the way it  should ideally be. The country and the Army are going through  only too difficult a time. So all the more respect is warranted  by those military districts, combined units, and units where, in  the face of objective difficulties, people are finding a way of  retaining a planned and systematic approach and carrying out the  necessary drills with command personnel and training exercises.  The combat readiness of the Army and Navy is based on such  military formations, and they primarily determine the face of  Russia's present Armed Forces.</p>

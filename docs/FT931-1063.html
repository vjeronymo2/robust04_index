			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: Paris guessing game for hopefuls - Uncertainty over the final result is fuelling debate on the cabinet FRANCE'S national election debate is fast giving way now to the Paris parlour game about who will get which cabinet jobs in the new centre-right government next week. It is not yet a betting man's game because there are still too many uncertainties. It is not absolutely sure - though very probable - that the neo-Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR) will get more seats than its Union for French Democracy (UDF) partner in Sunday's run-off ballot. If it does, it seems certain that President Mitterrand will have to pick an RPR prime minister. The clear choice is Mr Edouard Balladur, a former finance minister, rather than Gaullist leader, Mr Jacques Chirac. The latter clearly does not want to repeat his 1986-88 stint as prime minister and wants to keep his hands free to reach for the presidency itself. If, perchance, the UDF were to come out of Sunday's run-off level with or above the RPR, then its leader, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, would be in the same predicament as his rival, Mr Chirac, and would probably also steer clear of the Hotel Matignon, the premier's residence. Another uncertainty is what, if any, influence President Mitterrand has on cabinet jobs, especially those in foreign and defence policy where the constitution gives the president a role. In 1986, when he was far stronger politically, Mr Mitterrand was said to have vetoed Mr Francois Leotard, leader of the Republican party affiliated to the UDF, as defence minister. But according to Elysee officials, Mr Chirac exaggerated the president's reservations because the RPR prime minister himself preferred to have a technocrat rather than an ambitious political rival such as Mr Leotard in the defence job. The reality may thus be that Mr Mitterrand's influence will depend on divisions between the new governing parties. Mr Balladur would ideally like someone apolitical such as Mr Jacques De Larosiere, the present Bank of France governor, as finance minister so as to exert maximum influence himself over that post. But there are too few good jobs to satisfy a power-hungry coalition for the second most important post in the government to be filled this way. The finance portfolio is thus likely to go to the UDF federation. Mr Edmond Alphandery, who recently refused Mr Mitterrand's offer of one of France's European commissionerships, wants the job. But he may have to fight the leader of his Christian Democrat party, Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, for it. Another prominent UDF politician, Mr Alain Madelin, has ruled himself out of the finance ministry by advocating a floating of the franc, but may wind up with labour or transport. Whoever wins the finance ministry will not lord it over the ministers of budget and industry in the way that Mr Pierre Beregovoy once did as Socialist finance minister; individual budget and industry fiefs could well go to the RPR. More important, the foreign and defence ministries look like ending up in RPR hands. Mr Alain Juppe, secretary general of the RPR, fancies the Quai d'Orsay, despite Mr Chirac's desire to stay in his present job to organise the Chirac presidential campaign. A crustier Gaullist, Mr Charles Pasqua, is touting himself for defence. With perhaps the 1986 precedent in mind, Mr Pasqua has been moderating his tone in recent weeks towards Mr Mitterrand. It is, in theory, of some importance to France's EC partners that the UDF, the more pro-European wing of the new governing coalition, should control agriculture and the junior Quai d'Orsay job of responsibility for EC affairs. It may well do so. Mr Philippe Vasseur, a former economics journalist, is gunning for the former, and Mr Bernard Bosson, mayor of Annecy, would like another crack at the EC affairs post he filled in Chirac's government. But in practice, the predelictions of the UDF and some of its members may have to take second place to the tough rhetoric against the European Commission's farm and trade policies, on which Mr Chirac has fought the parliamentary elections and will be conducting his presidential campaign.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The number of  emigrants from Hong Kong to Western countries dropped by almost  20 percent in 1993 in spite of a prediction of higher proportion  of emigration as 1997 approaches.    According to government provisional figures, 54,000 local  residents left Hong Kong for overseas last year, putting the  emigration figure below 60,000 for the first time in more than  four years.    "The largest factor in the drop was the relatively poor  economies of the most popular destination countries," said  Acting Deputy Secretary for Security Keith Kwok.    On the contrary, he added, "the Hong Kong economy is still  developing and growing while some who have emigrated have found  it difficult to find work abroad."    Statistics showed only 5,925 were able to emigrate to  Australia from July 1992 to July 1993, down from 13,000 between  July 1991 to July 1992.    There was also a decrease in the number of people emigrating  to the United States: 13,142 in 1993 against 14,882 in 1992.    But emigration to Canada rose to 31,200 in 1993 from 29,900  in 1992.    Over the past few years, Canada, the United States and  Australia were regarded as the favorite destinations of 90  percent of Hong Kong emigrants. Most of those leaving the  territory were young professionals, 30 to 40 years old.</p>

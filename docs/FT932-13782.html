			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Trade News: Taiwan delays N-plant deadline TAIWAN has postponed the deadline for bids on a 2,500MW nuclear power station, the country's fourth. Taipower, the state utility, is understood to have ordered the delay - the deadline was yesterday - because of uncertainty about the bid price mechanism. Nuclear Electric, Britain's state-owned generator of nuclear power, is bidding for the project in partnership with Westinghouse of the US. Their design would be identical to that of Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised water reactor which the companies have nearly completed. Taiwan currently has a nuclear power capacity of 4,924MW supplied by six units, and 38 per cent of its electricity comes from nuclear power. It is one of a number of Asian countries which could provide export markets for the nuclear power industry in coming years, given rapid economic growth which is putting increasing strain on infrastructure. Nuclear Electric says success for its bid in Taiwan would produce Pounds 1bn in export orders for UK industry and could provide 10,000 British jobs. It says its bid is competitive in spite of the high costs of the Sizewell B plant which were driven up by factors such as licensing. The Taiwan plant would also benefit from economies of scale. Westinghouse invited Nuclear Electric to be its partner in the Taiwan bid immediately after the British company issued the design of its planned Sizewell C unit last year.</p>

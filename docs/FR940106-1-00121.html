			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento splittail have declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This species has been extirpated from portions of its range. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary during the past 2 decades, the entrapment zone, associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the important nurseries for splittail, has been more frequently shifted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upstream to a confined area of greater depth as a result of drought  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, water management schedules, and the continual and increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand for water exports and diversions. These factors will continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely affect all life stages of splittail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Threatened status is proposed for the Sacramento splittail because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of several factors. The population has declined by 62 percent within 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. The historical and current range of the species is constricted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes in water salinity and the reverse flow of water has shifted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of individuals upstream and has caused the fish to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vulnerable to State and Federal pumping plants. The death of these fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to pumping continues at present and is likely to continue in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future. Water exports also threaten the quality and quantity of habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at present and for the future. Because Sacramento splittail are long-lived, their decline has been gradual, and extinction is not imminent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing the splittail as endangered would not be appropriate. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this species is not in imminent danger of extinction at this time, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the evaluation of all available information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abundance, present distribution, and threats to this species, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service has determined that proposing to list the Sacramento splittail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as threatened is appropriate at this time. Critical habitat is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinable for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurrently with proposing a species to be endangered or threatened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service finds that designation of critical habitat for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento splittail is not determinable at this time. Regulations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 CFR 424.12(a)(2) state that critical habitat is not determinable if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not sufficiently known to permit identification of an area of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat. The Service's efforts to gather information on the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of designating critical habitat for splittail may lead to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion that designation of critical habitat is not prudent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations at 50 CFR 424.12(a)(1) state that a designation of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat is not prudent when the species is threatened by taking or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to increase the degree of such threat to the species, or when such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation would not be beneficial to the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

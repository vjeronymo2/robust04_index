			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A lack of steel in Germany FT-SE Index: 2,560.2 (-11) The unexpected resolution of the German steel dispute leaves the markets slightly wrong-footed. The avoidance of a strike is evidently good for German industrial output, which is scarcely robust at present. On the other hand, an increase of 6.4 per cent for a crippled industry such as steel scarcely augurs well for the rest of the wage round, even if it is argued that the settlement is a hangover from last year. It seems highly unlikely that the Bundesbank will raise rates at this early stage, if at all. But the postponement of a rate cut until the second half of the year looks still more likely than before. The implications for the UK economy are correspondingly glum. Whatever hopes were raised a week or two ago about a cheeky pre-election cut in base rates, it is worth recalling that three-month money rates never fell below 10 9/16 per cent. That is, the market always rated a rise as fractionally more likely than a cut. Granted, since the rate technically expresses expectations of average base rates over the next three months, it has to balance the chances of a Budget cut against the possible effects of a Labour victory in an early election. If the equity market were to follow the same logic, it should not be unduly sanguine about economic recovery.</p>

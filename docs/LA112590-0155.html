			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> INSURANCE WAR FADES, BUT NEW ISSUES EVOLVING  </P> <P> At a recent gathering of insurance underwriters in San Francisco, Allstate  counsel Michael McCabe had a welcome message for the hundreds of industry  loyalists present.  </P> <P> "The era of unfettered insurance company bashing has come to an end," McCabe  said. "The next stage of the debate over insurance issues here in California  and elsewhere in the nation will be characterized by dialogue."  </P> <P> There are signs McCabe has a point. The furor engendered by the 1988 "war of  insurance initiatives" is fading and demands for rollbacks approved by the  voters that year in Proposition 103 are getting less attention.  </P> <P> But insurance issues continue to stir emotions in California, and likely  impending developments -- rate hikes, further restrictions of insurance  availability, inauguration of a new insurance commissioner -- may ignite new  controversy, not only in auto insurance but in health insurance.  </P> <P> Since the Allstate executive spoke two weeks ago, no less a basher of the  companies than Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield seemed to validate what  he said.  </P> <P> Rosenfield has announced that his Voter Revolt organization has failed for the  second time to get enough petition signatures to put on the 1992 ballot an  initiative that would lead to the creation of a nonprofit state auto insurance  company and the ouster of private auto insurers from California.  </P> <P> He said his financially hard-pressed group simply does not have the money to  gather the signatures.  </P> <P> Perhaps of more immediate importance, Rosenfield disclosed that he has  encouraged Insurance Commissioner-elect John Garamendi to try to negotiate  compromise solutions on auto insurance directly with the insurers.  </P> <P> Rosenfield acknowledged such talks would have to be private.  </P> <P> Rosenfield and his longtime mentor, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, had just a  few days before sent a lengthy report to Garamendi, summarizing the status of  key elements of Proposition 103 and urging him to notify the companies that  they will get no rate increases in California until they stop litigation  against the measure.  </P> <P> Rosenfield said in an interview that in a subsequent meeting he assured  Garamendi of a cooperative attitude on his and Nader's part while Garamendi  tries to settle matters with the companies.  </P> <P> Garamendi has declared that he is eager to pursue such talks and then perhaps  seek legislative solutions to the state's insurance problems. He already has  met frequently with ranking representatives of all three groups most interested  in the insurance issues -- insurers, trial lawyers and consumers -- seeking  whatever common ground there is.  </P> <P> Does this mean the fire is out in California's insurance crisis after a  two-year fight? Not exactly, say a number of those close to the situation,  although the rhetoric may have been replaced by a desire to cooperate.  </P> <P> Still, impending developments could disturb whatever tranquility exists,  experts say.  </P> <P> "I don't think the industry is out of trouble," said Jeff Shelton, chief staff  consultant to the state Assembly's insurance committee. "I've asked a number of  persons in recent weeks: 'Has public opinion changed? Has the anger toward the  companies dissipated?' And all said no."  </P> <P> Shelton said he believes the comparative quiet over auto insurance issues will  last only until the first new rate increases. There was word last week that  some readjustment of rates, which will entail big increases for some drivers,  may be in the works for January.  </P> <P> State Farm officials, expecting approval early next month from outgoing  Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, confirmed that their company intends  to raise rates by more than a third for the 13%, or more than 400,000, of their  3.3 million policyholders who are considered "bad" drivers -- those with two or  more citations or one or more at-fault accidents in the last three years.  </P> <P> While the officials said most of their "good" drivers, 87% of their customers,  will get slight decreases under the new pricing plan, the prospect of such a  shake-up nettled some State Farm agents.  </P> <P> "We will not get notes of appreciation from those getting the slight  decreases," said one agent, who asked not to be named. "But we will hear bloody  screams from those getting the increases."  </P> <P> Another aspect of the State Farm readjustments would be to restrict the ability  of the "bad" or "problem" drivers, and in some cases younger drivers, to  purchase new policies.  </P> <P> If, as expected, the departing Gillespie authorizes other companies to follow  the new sales policies of State Farm, many more of these drivers may find  themselves able to buy auto insurance only through the assigned risk system,  which offers only liability coverage and not the collision and comprehensive  coverage that many finance companies require new car buyers to carry.  </P> <P> Some agents warn that such rule changes, which they regard as being highly  likely to win Gillespie's backing, could so restrict the availability of  insurance that the new car market will be depressed. They say that bad drivers  who are unable to buy collision or comprehensive coverage will usually be able  to afford only older, used cars.  </P> <P> Gillespie last week declined to say what she would do. Her special counsel for  Proposition 103 implementation, Karl Rubinstein, hinted strongly that the  commissioner would act favorably on State Farm's plan as well as similar ones  of other companies.  </P> <P> Gillespie did not confide her plans to Garamendi when the two met recently,  leaving the commissioner-elect saying, uneasily, that he could not formulate  his own policies until he knew "what kind of playing field" he would be left.  </P> <P> Other developments may also roil the waters in auto or health insurance:  </P> <P> * On Jan. 1, stringent enforcement provisions of the state's mandatory auto  insurance law are being allowed to lapse as a result of legislative inaction.  No longer will police who stop motorists over violations be required to demand  proof of insurance. Consequently, no longer will those unable to show such  proof have their licenses suspended until they buy it.  </P> <P> Although the law will remain on the books requiring drivers to submit proof of  insurance when they have accidents, there is still expected to be a  considerable surge in the numbers of uninsured motorists. The surge eventually  will bring increases in uninsured motorist premiums for those continuing to buy  coverage.  </P> <P> * Thousands of Californians have been sent scurrying to buy from unlicensed and  unregulated out-of-state carriers because of restrictions approved earlier this  year on the ability of good drivers to buy assigned risk coverage and an 85%  average statewide increase in assigned risk rates authorized by Gillespie.  </P> <P> A leading insurance legal expert, Douglas Hallett, recently sued Gillespie for  stricter enforcement of rules limiting sales by out-of-state firms, contending  that many such carriers will default on their obligations.  </P> <P> * Recent hearings into health insurance conducted by Assemblyman Burt Margolin  (D-Los Angeles) have demonstrated, as have numerous published and televised  reports in recent months, that health insurers increasingly are cutting off  coverage, or raising the prices for it astronomically, especially for people  with individual or small group policies who become sick and make costly claims.  Industry attempts to confine affordable health insurance mainly to healthy  persons is engendering resentment from the growing number of persons who either  cannot buy it or cannot afford the costly premiums.  </P> <P> During his campaign and in recent days, Garamendi has stressed his willingness  to seek compromise solutions to such insurance problems. He also indicated,  under certain circumstances, a willingness to pursue radical solutions.  </P> <P> For instance, Garamendi came out during the campaign in favor of "community  ratings" in health insurance. This would mean selling health coverage to  everyone within certain wide regions of the state at the same price, no matter  what their health or the size of their claims.  </P> <P> The industry, moving the other way toward cost-based coverage or no coverage  for the very sick, is expected to resist such proposals.  </P> <P> Garamendi has also said that should the companies be unwilling or unable to  provide either minimal auto or health coverage to everyone who wants it, he  would favor legislation that would set up a state company to provide such  coverage.  </P> <P> "The Legislature did that last year in earthquake insurance," the  commissioner-elect recently pointed out. "I have 90 days to set up a state  company that will provide at least $15,000 coverage for every homeowner to be  financed by a surcharge on their homeowners policies. This could be a precedent  for the state moving to provide other kinds of minimal coverage."  </P> <P> The period of "unfettered insurance company bashing" referred to by McCabe of  Allstate thus may be over. But there are indications that major reform  proposals may lie ahead.  </P></p>

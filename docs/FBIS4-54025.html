			<p>CSO     [Text] The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development  Organization (NEDO) recently selected a contractor to handle the  transfer of environmental technology to developing nations under  the project titles of "model projects for energy conservation"  and "projects to assist in the introduction of coal utilization  systems compatible with the environment." The energy  conservation projects will be handled by five firms including  Nippon Steel, while the coal utilization projects will be  handled by seven firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.  The respective firms have targeted fiscal year 1996 as the time  by which they will demonstrate the commercial feasibility of  technology for recycling heat produced as a by-product and  removal of sulfuric contaminants, environmental technologies  tailored for developing nations.    The energy-conservation model project will involve the  effective use of heat generated in the use of coal at steel  plants to operate power-generating plant boilers. Japanese firms  to participate in the project will include Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy Industries and Chiyoda Corporation, in addition to Nippon  Steel.    Coal utilization technology will involve the development of  low-cost sulphur removal systems and high-efficiency boilers to  be installed in China, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Technical  development work will be handled by seven firms, including  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and  Ebara Corporation.</p>

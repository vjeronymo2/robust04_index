In an official statement on his refusal, Yuriy  Meshkov accused his opponent of using state media funds to  discredit other candidates for the post of president. In  Meshkov's opinion, this propaganda machine is now aimed at him.  In addition there have been threats against him and his family.  In such conditions, Yuriy Meshkov believes, it is impossible to  take part in a discussion at the same table as Nikolay Bagrov.</p>

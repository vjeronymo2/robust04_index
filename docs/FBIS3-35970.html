The sum is approximately the same as in the current  fiscal year. Commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov:    When this announcement was made, some congressmen asked  themselves the question whether the already planned program of  cuts in defense spending would be possible. The program  provides for reducing defense allocations by $120 billion within  the next five years. The congressmen began to analyze President  Clinton's words that the United States must not cut defense  further. They came to the conclusion that the adopted plan of  cuts in defense spending remains in force, and the word further  meant there would be no more cuts except those already planned.  Senator Sam Nunn reacted positively to the conclusion.    The most important thing is that the U.S. military budget is  least of all linked with the relations between Moscow and  Washington. Russia and the United States, the two great nuclear  powers, do not consider each other as an adversary. Cooperation  in the military field replaced confrontation. This showed  itself in the agreement on the reduction of strategic arms and  in the U.S. assistance in dismantling the Soviet nuclear  arsenal. The level of mutual understanding is characterized by  the recent agreement, under which Russian and American nuclear  missiles will not targeted at each other's territory or any  other country.    So what's the reason for Washington's intention to cut the  Pentagon's budget even more than it was previously planned?  This is obviously attributed to difficulties of the military  conversion process. There have been a number of reports in the  American media on behind-the-scenes activities of congressmen  from the military industrial regions.    New threats is probably another reason: These are regional  conflicts. John Murtha, chairman of the House of  Representatives Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, believes  the United States may face a dangerous conflict on the Korean  peninsula, a conflict even more dangerous than Haiti, Bosnia, or  Somalia. In the meantime, the Pentagon insists on a strategy  calling for a military force ready to fight two major regional  conflicts simultaneously.    According to the mass media, there is no unanimity in the  Congress to give up cuts in defense spending. According to  experts and research institutions in the United States, the end  of the cold war and military confrontation between Moscow and  Washington has created a unique chance to direct material  resources to civilian programs, the more so since regional  conflicts can hardly be compared with the threat to life on  earth.    That was a commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov.</p>

In addition, January 1969 was the apotheosis of our  country's  lunar program. The unmanned Zonds were launched to the moon, one  after another; it was necessary to overtake the Americans, the  first to send an astronaut flying around the moon. And another  modification of this same ship, designated the Soyuz, had to be  tested in circumterrestrial orbit on an accelerated schedule.    The Korolev Design Bureau began to work on the Soyuz -- a  lunar ship and the future universal "carrier" -- virtually  simultaneously with the successful flights of the first  cosmonauts. On 23 April 1967 -- 1 1/2 years prior to the first  manned Apollo flight -- Vladimir Komarov piloted the first  Soyuz. On the very next day the "solemn tribute" to the  anniversary of Lenin's birth ended in a tragedy. The Soyuz was  hastily prepared for launching and it was launched (an  unprecedented act!) despite the categorical refusal of Vasiliy  Mishin, replacing Korolev, and it literally "came apart at the  seams." Engineer-colonel Vladimir Komarov perished.    For 1 1/2 years the Soyuz stuck in the mind. Yuriy Gagarin  was forbidden to fly in the second vehicle. And in October 1968,  this time without linking it to glorious anniversaries, Georgiy  Beregovoy, an assault aircraft pilot during the Great Fatherland  War, successfully landed the third Soyuz. To be sure, prior to  this not being able to dock the ship with the automatic Soyuz 2.    It all boiled down to this; not being able to perform  docking  in orbit, it was better not to push on to the moon. Both Soviet  and American lunar ships while "in flight" had to link up with  the cabin with cosmonauts or astronauts "lifting off" from the  moon. If a docking did not take place, only a miracle could save  those who had trodden on the moon. Accordingly, on our country's  lunar ship the docking system was simplified to the limit. The  pilot of the lunar Soyuz in one way or another had to insert the  docking unit shaft into one of several openings in the receiving  unit, the "meat grinder," as the strange holey structure was  called, of the lunar cabin. After linking of the ships the lunar  cabin pilot returned "home" through open space.    This had to be done by Aleksey Yeliseyev and Yevgeniy  Khrunov  on 15 January. They put into orbit the Soyuz 5 under the command  of Boris Volynov, and there Vladimir Shatalov already waited in  the Soyuz 4.    Unfortunately, we can visualize the world's first docking of  two manned ships only from drawings and models. It is easy to  understand that there was no one to photograph the cosmonauts  creeping along the handrails. It was decided to correct this  during the next launchings. Three Soyuz ships -- 11, 12 and 13  -- were launched in October 1969 with an interval of one day.  Two of them were to make a docking, whereas the third was to  approach them as close as possible and survey all the  "acrobatics." Alas, the ships could not approach one another and  the attainments of the "cosmic escadrille," in addition to a  hitherto unprecedented "population density" in orbit, were  limited to the world's first welding experiment in space, which  was performed by Valeriy Kubasov.    The first docking was a happy event for its participants.  None of them, other than Yevgeniy Khrunov (who, according to  some information, headed a secret detachment of cosmonauts for  flights in the Spiral spaceplane), never again headed into  space. Boris Volynov became a strong commander of a detachment  of a new group of cosmonauts. Vladimir Shatalov received the  stars of a general and headed the training of Soviet cosmonauts.  Aleksey Yeliseyev directed flights at the Flight Control Center,  but later at Moscow Higher Technical School imeni Bauman.    Although the Soyuz did not deliver cosmonauts to the moon,  it  remained virtually "eternal." Thereafter it was repeatedly  modified -- it was designated the Soyuz T and the Soyuz TM; was  launched in a cargo variant as the Progress; as a small module  for orbital stations under the name Gamma. It remains on line  even now, delivering cosmonauts to the Mir station. And the  Americans, who have successfully developed and operated the  heavy Space Shuttle, proceeding right up to construction of the  Freedom orbital station, have begun to negotiate with the  Russian NPO Energiya on use of the Soyuz as a rescue ship.</p>

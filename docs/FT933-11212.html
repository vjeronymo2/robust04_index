			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Italian bribes Pounds 54m alleged: Payments linked to Enimont chemicals venture, says magazine ALLEGATIONS that bribes worth L130bn (Pounds 54m) were paid to Italy's top politicians and businessmen during the 1989-90 reorganisation of the chemicals industry last night injected an explosive new element into the country's 18-month-old corruption scandals. The payments were allegedly made on the orders of the late Mr Raul Gardini, then chairman of Montedison, the Ferruzzi group's chemicals arm. The details were released by the weekly magazine L'Espresso, which will publish a full account at the weekend. The magazine's revelations were partly backed up yesterday by a series of warnings issued by investigating magistrates to politicians and businessmen involved. The alleged payments were first related to Mr Gardini's efforts to gain control of Enimont, the chemicals joint venture with Eni, the state oil concern. Further bribes were paid when Montedison received the L2,805bn payment for its 40 per cent stake in Enimont from Eni, as well as over the way Eni agreed to buy the outstanding 20 per cent of shares, largely in the hands of Mr Gardini's supporters. The politicians involved include most of the then senior figures in the ruling five-party coalition - Mr Arnaldo Forlani, then leader of the Christian Democrat Party; Mr Bettino Craxi, then leader of the Socialist Party; Mr Claudio Martelli, then Socialist deputy premier; Mr Cirino Pomicino, a senior Christian Democrat minister; Mr Carlo Vizzini, then leader of the Social Democrats; Mr Renato Altissimo, then leader of the Liberals and Mr Giorgio La Malfa, then leader of the Republicans. Until now magazine extracts relating to the corruption scandals have been accurate and apparently unofficially endorsed by the investigating magistrates. Both Mr Forlani and Mr Pomicino yesterday admitted they had been warned they were under investigation for the Enimont affair. Mr Forlani was alleged in the warning to have received L35bn on behalf of his party. Mr Forlani claimed the allegations were false as did Mr Craxi, Mr La Malfa and Mr Pomicino. Mr Craxi was alleged to have received L1.5bn. According to L'Espresso, 70 per cent of the bribes were split between the Christian Democrats and Socialists, with the rest going to individual politicians, middlemen and employees of Eni. Among these was allegedly the late Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman who committed suicide in jail two weeks ago. Mr Gardini also committed suicide. In testimony to Milan magistrates, Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the then chief executive of Montedison and Mr Carlo Sama, another senior management figure - both currently in jail - are alleged to have said Mr Gardini was obliged to pay the bribes to ensure the success of the deal for Montedison.</p>

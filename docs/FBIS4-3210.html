			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by intern reporter Yang Fan (2799 1581): </F> "Smooth Progress Made in First 100 Days of the Year of Reform --  Interview With Feng Bing, Deputy Secretary-General of the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economic System"]    [Text] Beijing 9 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--The year 1994, a "year  of reform" to Chinese officials, is a crucial one in which the  reform of the market economic structure will be conducted in a  comprehensive way. In the 100 days from 1 January to 10 April  1994, how have things been going with the various reform  measures newly presented? What are the social effects? Facing  these questions, Feng Bing, deputy secretary-general of the  State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System answered:  "Generally, the implementing of various reform measures has  been very smooth, and the assessment from top to grass roots is  very high."    Feng Bing indicated that over the past 100 days, reform in  the macroeconomic regulation and control system has been  conducted, including finance, taxation, banking, foreign  exchange, foreign trade, and planned investment.  <H5>  Tax and Fiscal Reform Is in Period of Fine Tuning </H5>   He said measures for tax and fiscal reform are basically in  operating normally and in a period of fine tuning. From the  angle of effects, internal financial revenue in the first  quarter markedly increased. Taking January and February for  example, internal financial revenue was 50.7 billion yuan, up by  32.1 percent over the same period last year; financial  expenditures were 49.15 billion yuan, up by 29.1 percent.  Income was 1.55 billion yuan higher than expenditures.  Conditions for the issuance of 12.92 billion yuan of national  bonds were sound, and people were vying for their purchase.    In the course of reform, the phenomenon by which some  localities and enterprises arbitrarily raised prices by taking  advantage of taxation reform surfaced for a time. Aiming at  this phenomenon, the State Planning Commission and Taxation  Administration jointly published the "Circular on Banning Price  Rises By Taking Advantage of Tax Reform," with the State  Council's approval, while augmenting propaganda about and  explanation of the new tax system and removing some people's  misunderstanding of taxing price subsidies, thus enabling a  prompt solution to the problem.  <H5>  Sound Condition in Foreign Exchange Reform </H5>   The main contents of reform in the banking structure this  year are, namely, augmenting central bank's functions, and  implementing separation of banking of a policy nature from  commercial banking. Work in this arena is actively under way.  As Feng Bing disclosed, at present the central bank is fast  recovering banknotes from circulation, with 90 percent of the  banknotes issued before the spring festival recovered, and the  condition of monetary operation is sound.    Foreign exchange and foreign trade restructuring with the  merger of the two-track exchange rates and implementation of the  system of foreign exchange settlement and selling of foreign  exchange as the main contents were originally a cause of anxiety  because of many uncertain factors and greater risk. However, in  the 100 days since the new structure was implemented, progress  has been smooth, and conditions are better than expected. The  only trouble came in foreign exchange coupons; because of  insufficient consideration of the issue, some stores allowed a  price hike of goods to be purchased with foreign exchange  coupons exclusively. This resulted in a run on foreign exchange  coupons and panic buying with them. Later, responsive measures  were adopted, and the problem was promptly pacified. The market  exchange rate has all along been kept at the comparatively  rational level of 8.7 yuan against the dollar. Feng Bing  believes that in view of the import-export situation and the  revenue and expenditures in foreign exchange, it is entirely  possible to stabilize the exchange rate at the present level  through regulation of the foreign exchange market.    The planned investment structure is under reform according  to  the original plan. The "change from fund allotment to loans" is  being converted to the "change from loans to investment." The  train of thought of plural investment bodies has already been  set, with major foundation work completed. However, it will  take some time to shape the system.    Reform of the modern enterprise system has not yet spread on  a wide scale as of today, and is still in an experimental phase,  with 100 enterprises carefully selected for the experiment. The  chief hurdles to enterprise transition to the modern enterprise  system are, first, excessive social burdens; second, excessive  overstaffing; and third, heavy debt burdens. Feng Bing believes  the solution to those problems primarily calls for the  enterprises' own efforts; however, support and help from  governments at all levels are also indispensable.    Consumer Prices on the High Side Calls For Attention    The deputy secretary-general believes the smooth going of  various reforms is based on stability, especially economic  stability, namely being free of vicious inflation.    He said the price rise range in China in March was 30  percent. The price level was on the high side, which calls for  our attention. He denied that the price rise was related to  reform in the macroeconomic regulation and control system,  especially tax reform. He said that the general level of tax  burden has remained unchanged and would not push prices up. It  might lead to some readjustment in individual enterprises, but  the effect on the general price level is insignificant. He  stressed that inflation did not result from reform; on the  contrary, reform of the macroeconomic regulation and control  system is the most effective means to reduce inflation.    Feng Bing attributed the price rise to two major causes,  first, expansion in the scope of investment in fixed assets.  Last year, the general input was 110 billion yuan, up by 50  percent from the previous year; this year, the input was 130  billion yuan, up by 20 percent from last year. Too many  projects broke ground last year; because they were behind  schedule, they helped in expanding the investment in fixed  assets this year; consequently, they became the direct cause for  increased issuance of banknotes. And second was the expansion  in consumption funds, which also resulted in pushing up prices.    Besides, the general price level has remained high; this  condition is connected with the aftermath of price reform and  price readjustments as well as price rises in farm produce.  However, he believed that all this did not pose an absolute  threat to consumer prices, because the aftermath of price  readjustment almost ended by the end of last year. In addition,  there was a good harvest in grain last year, with a  comparatively ample supply of such farm and sideline produce as  meat and eggs.    Based on the aforesaid facts, Feng Bing said that so long as  a good job is done in resolving the excessive scope of  investment in fixed assets and the expansion in consumption  funds, in addition to maintaining steady growth in agricultural  production and adopting measures to promptly ease social  psychological pressures, vicious inflation will be avoided.    At the same time, if China can insure the down-to-earth  implementation of reform measures in the course of operation  without distortion, the prospects of various reforms in China  will be very bright.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In light of the current situation and its  developments since the signing of the document of pledge and  accord in Amman, an official source has made the following  statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA':    Following the signing of the pledge and accord document, and  amid the joy and happiness which prevailed throughout the Yemeni  homeland on this occasion, the masses of the people were  surprised at the refusal of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  leadership to return to the capital of the homeland and to  convene the state legislative and executive institutions to  embark on the practical implementation of the document  provisions. Instead of showing concern for the immediate  implementation of the document following its signing, the YSP  leadership paid visits abroad that were not agreed on and  without the knowledge of the state presidency or the Foreign  Ministry which are charged by the Constitution with running the  foreign affairs of the Republic of Yemen.    This shows that the YSP leadership is not interested in the  immediate implementation of the pledge and accord document.  Instead of ending the crisis, this would further escalate it  and continue its dangers despite the fact that all have agreed  that the signing of the pledge and accord document came to put  an end to the crisis and to immediately move to the practical  implementation of all provisions of the pledge and accord  document.    As we reiterate our full concern to develop and reinforce  the  ties of fraternity, cordiality, and joint cooperation between  the Republic of Yemen and all its sisterly and friendly states;  and as we reiterate our commitment to expand these relations --  despite all that could be created by the contacts of the YSP  leadership -- any effort that does not stem from constitutional  legitimacy and common responsibility cannot yield fruit.    As we greatly appreciate the good intentions with which  these  sisterly countries welcomed some leaders of the YSP, proceeding  from their strong fraternal relations with the Republic of  Yemen, this stand by the party blatantly conflicts with the  interests of the homeland and with the provisions of the pledge  and accord document. This also coincides with the military  escalation represented by moving the al-Wahdah Brigade from the  Hadramaut Governorate and the subsequent move of 30 tanks from  the city of Aden to the Abyan Governorate which took place on 21  February. This is despite the fact that instructions and orders  have been issued by the chairman of the Presidential Council and  the supreme commander of the Armed Forces not to move any  military units in compliance with the Constitution and the  provisions of the pledge and accord document to save the  citizens of the Abyan Governorate from the suffering they have  been experiencing as a result of this military escalation.    All this confirms the existence of premeditated intentions  aimed at foiling the implementation of the pledge and accord  document and at obstructing all good offices aimed at ending the  bloodshed, protecting the unity, and reinforcing democracy.  This also reiterates the existence of these premeditated  intentions before and after the final signing of the document as  well as the objective of harming the homeland's unity,  sovereignty, security, and stability.    This requires all members of our people, our Armed Forces,  and security organs to be on maximum alert to prevent the  realization of these suspicious intentions that are covered by a  media campaign, which employs deception and trickery, and  incites sectarian, fractional, and tribal problems aimed to  divide Yemen after this great unionist achievement was realized  for our people on 22 May 1990 in a peaceful and democratic  manner.    The document of pledge and accord emphasized that its  implementation requires a strong political will that is united  in words and deeds, fulfillment of promises, honesty, and  commitment. All of this urges everybody to respect the  responsibility of their signatures before the public opinion  inside and abroad.    Regrettably, we see the YSP's leadership behaving in a  different manner than what had been agreed on. Since the first  moments after the signing ceremony in Amman, this leadership  followed a policy based on disavowal of the pledge and accord  document and disassociating itself from commitment to the  people's collective will and the democratic option. This  behavior harms the unity of the homeland and people at present  and in the future.    Our national duties and responsibilities call on us to  continue to adhere to unity and democracy, and to inform the  masses and all political parties and organizations, scholars,  and social figures of the seriousness of the current situation,  for which the YSP's leadership bears complete responsibility  since the beginning of the crisis on 19 August 1993. This  leadership practically emphasizes its rejection to commit itself  to the document of pledge and accord, and its insistence on  escalating the crisis and situation, and on keeping the country  suffering from the political crisis. This will only serve the  enemies of unity and democracy.    We will not spare any effort to keep the public opinion  informed of all facts and developments.    We pray God to guide all to the right path, He is the best  Lord and supporter.</p>

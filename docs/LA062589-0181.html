			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANCHISING AMERICA;  </P> <P> JAPAN'S CHANGING ECONOMY AND PASSION FOR U.S. GOODS AND SERVICES DRIVE  LICENSING FEVER  </P> <P> Mark and Christina Huckins were pretty sure they had a good thing going, but a  phone call last year caught them by surprise.  </P> <P> The Huckinses, owners of the Original Mr. Miniblind Inc. of Irvine, began  franchising their miniblind sales and installation business in January, 1988.  By September, they had signed up 20 dealers, all in California.  </P> <P> Then they got a call from Nobu Hatanaka, executive vice president of Idea Link  Japan Inc., an international matchmaker based in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Less than six months later, they signed a deal to sell master franchise rights  for Mr. Miniblind Japan to LEC Inc., a Tokyo housewares firm that Hatanaka  calls the "Rubbermaid of Japan." As a master franchisee, LEC can franchise Mr.  Miniblind to other firms in Japan. The Huckinses won't disclose exact terms,  but said they received a cash payment in the high six figures and will get  royalties from the Japanese operations.  </P> <P> Not too long ago, American companies wanting to franchise in Japan needed to be  big, well-known and patient. Deals such as the franchising of McDonald's or  Kentucky Fried Chicken took years to hash out  </P> <P> But as the Huckinses learned, that is no longer the case.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Healthy Japanese Market  </P> <P> Changing economic and social conditions in Japan have created a healthy  Japanese market for franchise rights offered by small and mid-sized U.S.  companies. And the Japanese, who have a reputation as slow and formal  negotiators, are snapping up deals at a pace that starts some entrepreneurial  hearts afluttering in the United States. Experts believe that the number of  master franchises sold by American firms in Japan has increased to about 100  from 69 at the end of 1986, making it the No. 2 foreign market for U.S.  franchises.  </P> <P> Franchising specialists say increasing Japanese interest is driven by the  decline in the value of the dollar, a need to diversify and a fascination with  new products and services offered by American businesses.  </P> <P> In addition, some big Japanese companies are trying to reconcile the need to  streamline their work forces and the traditional policy of lifetime employment.  Buying franchises from U.S. companies is one way they can take care of a  growing corps of under-utilized middle managers, said Candace Brosowsky, a  spokeswoman for the International Franchise Assn. in Washington.  </P> <P> The 29-year-old trade group conducts several trade missions to Japan and other  Asian countries each year. Under a federal privatization program, it recently  took over most of the international franchise marketing duties once performed  by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  </P> <P> One reason the Japanese are eager to acquire franchises from U.S. companies is  that the dollar has lost almost half of its value against the yen over the past  five years, allowing Japanese buyers to acquire more for their money. "They  effectively get a 50% discount when they buy an American franchise," Brosowsky  said.  </P> <P> When Profusion Systems Inc. of Aurora, Colo., sold a master franchise in Japan  for $850,000 after a 14-day whirlwind courtship last year, the exchange rate  was half of what it was in 1984. "It was like we were the Mexico of the world,  and they were taking advantage of it and buying up as much as they could," said  William Gabbard, president and founder of the high-tech plastics repairing  firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growth of High-Tech  </P> <P> In addition to favorable currency trends, a lot of the big trading and  manufacturing companies in Japan are becoming more efficient and productive  than they once were. As a result, they can produce more with fewer people.  </P> <P> "But at the same time," Brosowsky said, "there is a cultural practice in Japan  of lifetime employment. Buying a U.S. franchise becomes the perfect way to  build a new business into which they can plug these under-utilized workers -- a  lot of them in middle management -- without the costs and headaches of creating  a business from scratch."  </P> <P> Another reason for the growing Japanese hunger for U.S. franchises has been the  maturation of Japan's high-technology industry, according to Pacific Rim  observers.  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, growth in the technology sector slowed in Japan, said Idea  Link's Hatanaka. A number of smaller technology firms were acquired by bigger  companies, while others simply went out of business.  </P> <P> "A whole new era of business development dawned in Japan in 1985, with a  dramatic acceleration of Japanese companies looking for opportunity to  diversify or expand into various specialty niches," Hatanaka said. "With the  high-tech companies gone, Japanese investors started looking into the niche  businesses, the service businesses and franchising."  </P> <P> Many of the Japanese investors are large corporations, said Anne Yumi Hayashi,  assistant vice president of LCA-International, a New York-based competitor of  Idea Link.  </P> <P> "They are looking for new types of businesses they can put their older  employees into so they don't have to lay them off," she said, "and they also  are looking for new businesses, especially service business, that aren't in  Japan yet."  </P> <P> That has been important for the success of U.S. franchise sales in Japan, said  John Emery, chairman of the finance department at California State University  at Fullerton.  </P> <P> "Japanese companies are very market-share oriented," Emery said. "They want  position in the market and aren't concerned about short-term profitability.  Buying the master Japanese franchise for a U.S. business gives them 100% of the  market right from the start."  </P> <P> All of that has made Japan the second-largest foreign market for U.S.  franchises behind Canada, according to the International Franchise Assn.  </P> <P> Through 1986, the last year for which hard data exists, 69 U.S. firms had sold  master franchises in Japan, the Department of Commerce reports, mostly for  restaurants and other prepared food retail outlets. As of the end of 1986,  those 69 master franchises had set up a total of 7,366 outlets throughout  Japan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Identifying Hot Prospects  </P> <P> Although more recent statistics are not available, several experts agreed that  the number of U.S. firms with master franchises in Japan has grown to about  100, a 44% increase in less than three years. And service businesses make up a  growing percentage of the total, they said.  </P> <P> The market has become so important that two Japanese consulting firms have  financed U.S. operations whose sole function is to identify hot franchising  prospects and introduce them to prospective buyers in Japan: Idea Link and  LCA-International.  </P> <P> Idea Link, with an office in Los Angeles and a 49% owner in Japan, has arranged  seven successful deals since it was founded in 1985. It is about to close three  more, said president and 51% owner Ichiro (Roy) Fujita.  </P> <P> Its completed franchise deals include California Closet in Woodland Hills, the  El Pollo Loco chain owned by Denny's Restaurants in La Mirada, Graphic Gallery  art prints in Newport Beach and Johnny Rockets, a group of 1950s-themed diners  based in Westwood.  </P> <P> Fujita said his firm is about to complete franchise sales for the Sizzler  steakhouse chain owned by Collins Food International in Los Angeles, the Office  Club warehouse outlets headquartered in Concord and the Medieval Times  theater-restaurant in Buena Park.  </P> <P> To help market its American clients, who don't pay a fee unless a deal is  signed, Idea Link publishes a hot prospects magazine in Japan.  </P> <P> Until late last year, the magazine was a Japanese-language licensee of  Irvine-based Entrepreneur magazine. Entrepreneur's owner, Peter Shea, also owns  Stained Glass Overlay and has sold a master Japanese franchise for the firm  through LCA-International. Shea's franchisees use a proprietary process to make  regular glass windows look like stained glass.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Experience Typical  </P> <P> Shea, who has studied the Japanese franchising scene for several years, said  his experience with Stained Glass Overlay is typical of other small firms  marketing franchises in Japan.  </P> <P> Shea sold the master franchise to a mid-sized Japanese company in the food  market business. That firm, in turn, sold separate licenses in Japan's 47  prefectures, or states, Shea said.  </P> <P> Buyers included Nippon Steel and Ashai Glass, both giant manufacturing  companies. "They bought the prefecture licenses so they could sell individual  franchises to mid-management employees who wanted to retire early or whose jobs  were being phased out," Shea said.  </P> <P> Service businesses like Mr. Miniblind or Ceiling Doctor, a Canadian firm that  cleans acoustic ceilings, are popular in Japan in part because of the  increasing Westernization of that country.  </P> <P> The desire to emulate American concepts and practices, including construction  techniques, is creating a need for services that had no place in the Japan of a  decade ago, said Hayashi of LCA-International.  </P> <P> Her company, a franchise matchmaker similar to Idea Link, has put together  about 20 deals in four years, she said.  </P> <P> By traditional yardsticks of Japanese-American business negotiations, the Mr.  Miniblind franchise sale was a pretty fast transaction. While it spanned nearly  six months, it required only three negotiating sessions with LEC's president,  Sadao Ishikawa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Requires Little Investment  </P> <P> Christina Huckins said the buyer was intrigued by the business because it is  mobile and requires little investment in real estate, which is extremely  expensive in Japan.  </P> <P> "But besides our concept being solid, I think he (Ishikawa) liked us," she  said. "He said he started his business with his wife and liked it that Mark and  I are in business together."  </P> <P> Ishikawa, whose firm makes rubber and plastic household accessories sold in  some 40,000 Japanese stores, told the Huckinses that he plans to offer Mr.  Miniblind franchises to Japanese store owners who are looking for additional  business opportunities.  </P> <P> One unusual aspect of the deal was that all negotiating sessions with Ishikawa  were conducted at Mr. Miniblind's tiny Irvine office. The Huckinses were never  asked to travel to Japan, which may indicate how eager LEC was to close the  deal.  </P> <P> The people at Environmental Air Protection in Spokane did go to Japan, but  their franchising deal may have set a world record for speed.  </P> <P> The company, which franchises a system for sanitizing air conditioning and  heating system ducts, had a one-hour meeting with a prospect in Osaka during a  trade mission to Japan and Taiwan last month.  </P> <P> Two days later, company officials signed a letter of intent to sell a master  franchise to a mid-sized real estate development and building maintenance firm  in Japan called Active Co. They also received a $1-million check.  </P> <P> "And since we've been back, we've gotten half a dozen calls from  representatives of other Japanese companies who met with us," said Richard  Moore, vice president of operations for Environmental Air.  </P> <P> Even though the dollar has regained some of its strength, franchising  specialists don't expect much dampening of the Japanese appetite for U.S.  franchises.  </P> <P> In fact, said Brosowsky of the International Franchise Assn., a secondary  market for franchises has begun to develop in Japan.  </P> <P> "It is not a trend yet," she said, "but we are seeing the growth of individual  entrepreneurship in Japan. Some of the younger people no longer see working for  Sony or Mitsubishi for their entire careers as the ultimate goal."  </P> <P> Idea Link's Hatanaka agreed that the Japanese are undergoing profound changes  in attitudes.  </P> <P> "It is no longer true for everyone that to be successful is to work for all  your life for one big company," he said.  </P> <P> "Some younger Japanese are looking to entrepreneurial business careers. And  franchising can be better than starting a business from scratch because it is  lower risk. You get the know-how and support of the franchiser. And buying an  American franchise, you also get the American image."  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. FRANCHISES SOLD IN JAPAN  </P> <P> Some U.S. companies that have sold master franchises in Japan in the past four  years.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.20IN:3.43IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Company  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Headquarters  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> El Pollo Loco  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> La Mirada  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mr. Miniblind  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Irvine  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fantastic Sam's  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Memphis, Tenn.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> California Closet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Woodland Hills  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Graphic Gallery  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Newport Beach  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Johnny Rockets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Westwood  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ride 'N Show Engineering*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> San Dimas  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Stained Glass Overlay  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Irvine  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Le Croissant Shop  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> New York  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Zack's Famous Frozen Yogurt  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Metairie, La.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Carol Block Ltd.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> McHenry, Ill.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> C.J.

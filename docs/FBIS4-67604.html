			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 22 (BTA) -- Heart disease is the  major cause of death in this country, while respiratory diseases  have the highest incidence, according to statistics of the  National Health Information Centre, quoted in today's KONTINENT.    Heart disease and related conditions such as heart attack,  stroke and kidney failure, have caused 60 to 63 percent of  deaths over the last ten years, mortality figures show. The  steady increase in their proportion is attributed to the aging  of the Bulgarian population. Cancer, mostly of the lungs, skin,  breasts and stomach, accounts for 13 to 14 percent of deaths and  ranks second in death statistics.    Up to 5 percent of deaths are caused by respiratory  diseases,  which have the highest incidence in this country and constitute  30 percent of all registered diseases every year, according to  statistics.    Nervous disorders such as neuroses, phobias and depressions  are also widespread. They have accounted for about 16 percent  of all registered diseases over the past ten years. Doctors say  there are four people on antidepressants to every patient who  has seen a doctor about his or her neurosis.    Prophylactic checkups among school students reveal alarming  tendencies. 53 percent of primary school students have  scoliosis. 34 percent of secondary school students have impaired  vision, 9 percent have neurosis and 10 percent suffer from high  blood pressure.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Life company hits trouble Whenever an organisation says 'business as usual', the immediate reaction is that if this really were the position, there would be no call to say so, write Alison Smith and Tracy Corrigan. Even with that caution, the statement yesterday from Confederation Life in the UK that it was carrying on as normal, despite the intervention by Canadian regulators in its Toronto-based parent company, does contain some information to comfort UK customers. First, there is the knowledge that most of the 250,000 UK policyholders come under the control of the British operation. This is ring-fenced from whatever happens to the Canadian company. Then, there is the prospect that the UK operation is about to be sold to what Confederation Life describes as a 'large financial services company of significant financial strength'. That announcement was made earlier last week, although negotiations began a few months ago. The talks, which are now in the hands of the Canadian regulators, are expected to be concluded very soon. There are, however, about 35,000 people who took out policies from the UK branch when it was still part of the Canadian operation, before 1990. While they fall within the ambit of the parent company, the Canadian regulators intend to include this group as part of the sale of the UK subsidiary. Both the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bank of England have been kept informed about the progress of disposing of the UK operation, which includes Confederation Bank. This offers residential mortgage loans and deposit account facilities. While the bank has often featured in our Highest Rates table, the life operation has been one of those named by the Office of Fair Trading as giving poor values to customers who give up long-term savings policies at a very early stage. The main focus of its business is pensions and it is one of the leading providers of pooled pension products for medium-sized companies. It made pre-tax profits in 1993 of Pounds 27.9m against Pounds 14.2m in 1992. If the worst were to happen and the UK company failed, the policyholders' protection scheme - set up in 1975 as a safety net for customers - would come into play and the priority would be to transfer the business on a working basis. It would be wound up only as a last resort. Bondholders have also been left in a state of uncertainty. Dealers yesterday stopped making prices in Confederation Life bonds, which means that investors are unable to sell bonds at any price. In the sterling market, the group has a Pounds 100m issue of 9 1/2 per cent notes due 1997, arranged by SG Warburg, and a Pounds 100m issue of subordinated bonds due 2003, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Some dealers said yesterday that the subordinated bonds are being viewed as worthless, as they will rank below other types of debt when any pay-out is made.

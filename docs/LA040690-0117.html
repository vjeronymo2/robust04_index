			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CAPRIATI BEATS NO. 5 SANCHEZ EASILY  </P> <P> Jennifer Capriati continued to impress crowds and her opponents Thursday,  beating French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez to advance to the quarterfinals of  the Family Circle Magazine Cup.  </P> <P> Playing in her third tournament since turning professional last month,  Capriati, 14, took only 45 minutes to defeat Sanchez, seeded second and rated  fifth in the world, 6-1, 6-1 on the green clay at Sea Pines Racquet Club on  Hilton Head Island, S.C.  </P> <P> Capriati, who is not seeded and has not played in enough pro events to be  ranked, is 11-2 as a professional and 3-1 against top-10 opponents.  </P> <P> She was both precise and powerful in beating Sanchez, rated fifth in the world.  </P> <P> "I thought this was one of the best matches that I've played so far," Capriati  said. "I mean it wasn't so easy. I had to keep playing well. I think I just  didn't give her a chance to come back into the match because I was playing  well."  </P> <P> Capriati lost only four points on her serve in each set. She had 12 unforced  errors to 18 for Sanchez.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Brad Gilbert advanced to the quarterfinals of the Prudential-Bache  Securities tournament in Orlando, Fla., and No. 2 Aaron Krickstein withdrew  after suffering a torn right hamstring.  </P> <P> Gilbert, one of three seeded players remaining in the quarterfinals, beat Jimmy  Brown, 6-2, 6-1.  </P> <P> "I was striking the ball a lot better tonight," said Gilbert, who will meet  Joey Rive, a 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 winner over Miguel Nido of Puerto Rico, in today's  quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Krickstein's injury put Alex Hombrecher, a Stanford University freshman ranked  on the lowest rung of the computer at No. 1,095, into his first professional  quarterfinal. He will go against David Pate.  </P></p>

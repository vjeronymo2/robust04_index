			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 14 May (EFE) -- Venezuela will not support  a military intervention in Haiti, a Foreign Ministry spokesman  said today in Caracas. The government, however, supports  pressure tactics to restore democracy in that Caribbean nation.    According to the spokesman, Venezuela will not join any  armed  multinational force or support a unilateral decision by the  United States if that country decides to intervene in Haiti.    Venezuela is the only Latin American country that belongs to  the Group of Friends of Haiti, which comprises the United  States, France, and Canada.    The possibility of an armed intervention in Haiti has gained  strength after the military who toppled head of state  Jean-Bertrand Aristide appointed a puppet president. This week  the military, led by Raoul Cedras, who headed the coup,  appointed Supreme Court Justice Emile Jonassaint president,  something the United Nations and the OAS have rejected. The  United Nations agreed to tighten the economic sanctions on the  Haitian military regime as of 21 May.</p>

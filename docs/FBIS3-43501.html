On the occasion, the head of  state delivered a message that he described as "a message of  peace and security for all," even if meetings are held during  which some people threaten to disrupt peace in Cote d'Ivoire.    "No social trouble will be tolerated," Mr. Bedie warned,  when  answering the speech made by Mr. Jean-Baptiste Angama, the  chairman of the PDCI-RDA teachers federation.    President Konan Bedie refrained from any lengthy speech on  schools with regard to the period of mourning we are observing  in Cote d'Ivoire. He nonetheless stressed the essential role  played by teachers in the training of the youth, a role the head  of state is willing to "support and facilitate any time the need  arises and when we have the necessary means to help."    In view of the current situation, the president of the  Republic called on his visitors to above all "strive to  safeguard what has already been achieved and of which peace is  the first victory." "Cote d'Ivoire wants to live in peace," he  insists. "We should not play with peace. Peace should be an  attitude. We should mobilize to ensure peace at all times." He  added, "Oh, I know pretty well that a lot of nonsense is now  circulating in Abidjan spread by irresponsible people, and what  they are saying does not contribute to a sense of peace. We are  regularly briefed on their meetings, which take place night and  day in Abidjan, with plans to disrupt the peace Ivorians are  enjoying....    I can assure you that, before or after the funeral of  President Houphouet-Boigny, Ivorians always want peace and a  peaceful atmosphere. I would also like to say that no  disturbances will be tolerated.    Let us suppose that a plot exists in that sense. We would  resolutely crush the plotters. We have an eye night and day on  these meetings, wherever they are held."    In conclusion, the head of state praised the exemplary sense  of patriotism showed by the members of the PDCI-RDA teachers  federation. [passage omitted]</p>

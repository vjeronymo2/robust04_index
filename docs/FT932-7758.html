			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Molson suffers downturn MOLSON, the Canadian brewing and retailing group, says that strength in its brewing and overseas special chemicals operations were more than offset by difficulties in retailing and other problems in North America in the year ended March 31. The company reported a fall in net profits to CDollars 113.7m (USDollars 89.3m), or CDollars 1.90 a share, for the year compared with CDollars 126.2m, or CDollars 2.25, in fiscal 1992. Sales and other revenues rose by 6 per cent to CDollars 3.1bn, from CDollars 2.9bn. Including a special gain of CDollars 51m after tax from the sale by Molson of 20 per cent of a brewing subsidiary to Miller Brewing of the US, total profit for the latest year was CDollars 164.7m, equal to CDollars 2.76 a share. Mr Marshall Cohen, president, said that conditions were difficult in some markets and management is taking corrective steps. Molson's brewing profits rose 3.8 per cent to CDollars 167.6m. The recession and a poor summer season were offset by higher prices and more efficient production. Molson Breweries is now 40 per cent owned by Molson, 40 per cent by Foster's of Australia and 20 per cent by Miller. The link with Miller would raise sales of Molson brands significantly in the US, said Mr Cohen. Operating profits from Diversey, Molson's special chemical business, rose 39 per cent, but its North American operations were affected by the recession and problems with absorbing an acquisition. Diversey's sales were flat at CDollars 1.3bn and operating profits fell 9 per cent to CDollars 70m but US operations are being rationalised and European marketing strengthened, said Mr Cohen. Hardware retailing was restructured and took a special CDollars 83m charge. Molson's new Aikenhead warehouse store subsidiary reported a CDollars 9.9m operating loss, but should be profitable this year. It plans 28 stores in Ontario and western Canada by fiscal 1998. Aikenhead is Molson's answer to the invasion of the Canadian market by Home Depot of the US. The sports and entertainment activities recorded a fall in operating profits to CDollars 2.9m from CDollars 8.3m.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Argentaria denies it will be forced to drop Banesto bid Argentaria, the state-controlled Spanish banking corporation partially privatised last year, has dismissed speculation that it would be forced by political pressures to drop out of today's auction to acquire Banesto. The auction is the final chapter in the crisis sparked by the Bank of Spain's intervention in Banesto last year. Banesto, the fourth biggest domestic bank, has since absorbed some Dollars 4bn in one of the largest support operations ever mounted for a financial institution. The conservative opposition party, Partido Popular, has expressed reservations about an Argentaria bid. The party maintains that it would amount to a nationalisation of part of the banking system - Banesto has a 10 per cent share of the financial sector - and would give the state-controlled institution a clear lead over private institutions. There has also been concern than an Argentaria acquisition would allow Mr Felipe Gonzalez's socialist government to muzzle its media critics. Banesto has considerable shareholdings in the private television station Antena 3, in the news weekly Epoca and in the Madrid newspaper El Mundo, all of which have been at the forefront of a recent spate of corruption exposures. Argentaria said it was unaware of any pressures from the economy ministry's corporate holding, the Patrimonio del Estado, which owns 50 per cent of its equity. 'We operate as commercial bank in a free market and we have a free hand to bid,' it said. Argentaria's board - and those of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, and Banco Santander, the rival contenders for Banesto - will meet today to vote on a price for the bid. The sealed bids, likely to be in the Pta220bn-Pta240bn (Dollars 1.6bn-Dollars 1.74bn) range, will be delivered to the Bank of Spain just before the Madrid market closes. The winner will be announced before the markets open on Tuesday.</p>

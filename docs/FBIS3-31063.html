			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Tibor J. Keri report: "Horn: We Have More Than One </F> Suitable Prime Ministerial Candidate"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Gyula Horn [chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] said that a year ago they had  asked citizens various questions: What are their views on the  current government? What suggestions do they have to remedy the  social and economic problems? Whom would they welcome in the  new parliament and government? In 1993, the social dialogue  continued and the party's expert program was drawn up. At the  same time, the MSZP began to select its individual candidates in  1993, in which the local organizations's views were most  decisive. The same principles were used when the county lists  were drawn up. The party's national organizations only had the  right to express their views but could not directly influence  the selection. [passage omitted]    Horn admitted that the MSZP's national list was drawn up  after fierce debates. He said that the place of Laszlo Bekesi  and others were also debated. According to Horn, "it is very  difficult to form a view on people because everyone is bound to  be biased to a certain extent." As for Bekesi, he is a  distinguished representative of the MSZP and has a determining  role in the party's economic policy, Horn said. On the national  list, even according to the original suggestion, Bekesi was  ahead of many leaders of the party. However, the fact that he  now is on the third place of the draft national list was a  result of the discussions. "This is one of the ways in which we  expressed the importance of economic policy and of Bekesi," Horn  said, who considers internal debates in the party perfectly  natural. Answering our question, he said that he could even  imagine Bekesi as the MSZP's prime ministerial candidate, but it  will not be up to Horn to decide this. [passage omitted]    The Socialists have many times stated that they did not want  to tie themselves down before the elections. "In other words,  we are open to all democratic forces and at our congress [at the  end of February] we wish to draw up the conditions for opening  subsequent talks on forming a government, if the MSZP gets into  this position," Horn said. He also explained that in this view,  Hungary does not need a chancellor type prime minister because  it is very likely that a number of parties will jointly form the  next government. If the parties decide in advance who the  members and the leader of the government should be, then it will  be very difficult to reach a coalition agreement. He added  that, rather than insisting on posts, the MSZP wants the best  representatives of the given area to be in the positions.  Therefore, these people will not necessarily come from the  coalition parties. [passage omitted]    To the assumption that, even in case of a successful  election  performance, the MSZP would find Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial  candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats, suitable as prime  minister, and the Socialists would occupy the key ministerial  positions, Horn said that Kuncze is not the MSZP's prime  ministerial candidate but they are open even to him. However,  all this depends on the election results and the coalition  talks, he added.    About the danger of the so-called left-wing bloc, Horn said  that some form of election cooperation between left-wing parties  is natural in all democratic countries. However, this is not  the case in Hungary, he stated. The MSZP does not wish to work  together with the Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP] or  the Labor Party. "In the past four years, we have not had any  contact with the MSZDP and, as for the Labor Party, we have not  even talked to each other," he said. Therefore, everything that  is said about the danger of the left-wing bloc is mere  speculation and has nothing to do with reality, Horn confirmed.  [passage omitted]</p>

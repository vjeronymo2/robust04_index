			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / French prepare for Maastricht debate FRANCE'S Socialist government yesterday adopted a draft law to revise the constitution, a critical step towards ratifying the Maastricht treaty on European union. The draft was immediately sent to the National Assembly for debate; the government said it hoped revision and ratification could be completed before the summer holidays. However, the constitutional changes will be the object of a political barrage from the Socialist government's conservative opponents, even those who in principle support Maastricht objectives. Mr Francois Bayrou, secretary general of the centre-right UDF umbrella grouping, while declaring that 'there is no other possible destination for France than Maastricht', said his party would demand and obtain amendments. The main aspects of the treaty dealt with in the new constitution law but disputed by the opposition are plans for a single currency and the provision for residents from other EC countries to vote and be elected in local elections. The government's problem is that the Socialist party does not command an absolute majority in the National Assembly. The Communists are hostile to the treaty and, on the right, the Gaullists are hostile to the government. The government should make good the shortfall with the help of the centrists and UDF members, most of whom support the EC. But the UDF, together with the RPR Gaullist party, plans to set conditions for its agreement in parliament, which could create uncertainties for the parliamentary arithmetic. President Franc,ois Mitterrand has made clear he wants the constitutional revision enacted in a purely parliamentary process. In the first phase, the two houses would pass the legislation by a simple majority. In the second, the two houses sitting together in Versailles in a so-called Congress would pass the same revision by a three-fifths majority. As an alternative second phase, the government can put the constitutional revision to a referendum. In either case, the second phase could be risky for the government. If the Gaullists mobilise additional support for restrictive conditions, they could prevent a three-fifths majority in Congress. But if the government opts for a referendum, it would put on the line not just the treaty but also the position of President Mitterrand, whose popularity is at a record low. In the last resort, the Gaullist party will be reluctant to take responsibility for bringing down the Maastricht treaty. Mr Jacques Chirac, Gaullist leader, has this week started to back away from his demand for a referendum. If the constitutional revision does go through, parliamentary ratification is likely to become a foregone conclusion. Reuter adds from Luxembourg: The government yesterday urged the Grand Duchy's parliament to approve the treaty without a referendum. Mr Jacques Santer, prime minister, said the referendum as demanded by the main opposition group could turn into a vote against the 113,000 foreigners living in Luxembourg. As in France, debate in Luxembourg centres on the clause allowing residents from other EC states to stand and vote in local elections. Recent polls show support for European union in Luxembourg dwindled from 83 per cent to 35 per cent in the year to March. Final push, Page 22</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / GKN fails to secure Westland agreement: 'Unbridgeable gap' develops between helicopter maker and engineering group GKN's Pounds 497m hostile takeover bid for Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, moved towards a climax yesterday after a meeting between the chairmen of the two companies broke up without agreement. This leaves the engineering group with just two days in which to revise its 290p-a-share offer. Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, had a 'friendly but frank' 35-minute discussion with Sir David Lees - his GKN counterpart - but is understood to have firmly rejected the bid. After the meeting, the rival executives issued a joint statement: 'In all matters relating to Westland, there is an unbridgeable gap between us.' Throughout the bid, Mr Jones has criticised GKN, which controls 45 per cent of Westland, for undervaluing its order prospects and potential profits. Those prospects were enhanced yesterday when McDonnell Douglas Helicopters, the US manufacturer, announced it had reached agreement with EH Industries - a partnership between Westland and Agusta of Italy - to market the partners' EH101 helicopter in North America. McDonnell Douglas said it would seek orders from the US Navy, which has a requirement for more than 500 'medium lift replacement' helicopters. The contract could exceed Dollars 7.6bn (Pounds 5.2bn). The US company would manufacture the EH101 under licence at its plant in Mesa, Arizona. Mr Erv Hunter, vice-president of military programs at McDonnell Douglas, said the first US EH101s could be delivered in 1999. Any sales in North America would be an invaluable fillip for Westland, which has so far secured 44 firm orders for the EH101. Mr Jones said: 'The way forward for Westland is increasingly through collaboration with other helicopter manufacturers.' During the bid, he has warned that Westland's ability to forge such alliances would be compromised if GKN won full control. GKN is understood to be considering a revised offer of around 320p a share, but that would not be enough to overcome the Westland board's objections. Forecasting increased profits and dividends earlier this week, Mr Jones said the company was worth more than 400p-a-share to GKN. Westland shares remained unchanged yesterday at 325p.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANS FOR ECHO PARK BRANCH LIBRARY ON AGENDA FOR COMMUNITY MEETING  </P> <P> Los Angeles library officials will hold a community meeting Monday to discuss  plans for a new Echo Park Branch Library and ways to improve services.  </P> <P> Representatives of the Los Angeles Board of Library Commissioners, library  administrators and Los Angeles Councilwoman Gloria Molina will take part in the  meeting at 6:30 p.m. at Angelus Temple, 1100 Glendale Blvd.  </P> <P> April passage of the library funding proposition has provided money to replace  the overcrowded branch, which has been in leased quarters at 515 N. Laveta  Terrace since the old branch was damaged in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and  later demolished.  </P> <P> The library's Branch Facilities Plan recommends a building of 12,500 square  feet on a street with heavy retail activity. The meeting will cover the process  of acquiring a site and preparing or constructing a building.  </P> <P> A second part of the meeting will focus on a state library program called  Partnership for Change. Echo Park has been selected as one of three libraries  in Los Angeles to be part of the $3-million study of program changes oriented  toward specific ethnic and racial populations within their areas.  </P> <P> Library officials will outline the steps in the study, which begins with a  community needs assessment.  </P></p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (6): No duds above the Pounds 15,000 level - See how they go: Stuart Marshall finds himself spoilt for choice An honest motoring correspondent has to admit that sorting out the wheat from the chaff among the current crop of new models is not easy. Why? Because they are all good. Some are slightly better than others, though much depends on what the user is looking for. What one can say with confidence is that there is no such thing today as a really dud car. Excutive-class motorists rightly take it for granted that a car will be reliable, quiet, comfortable, adequately roomy, have power-steering and ABS brakes and look nice. So, what else is there to take into consideration? Ignore for the moment the minority with individual requirements for sports coupes or luxuriously appointed four-wheel-drive, on-off road vehicles as company cars. It then comes down to a mix of personal taste and tax liability, coupled with the finance director's thoughts on retained values. Within these parameters, I reckon most executive users would be happy with the performance of practically any four- or five-door priced over Pounds 15,000. Petrol-engined cars of particular appeal to me in the lower price brackets - say from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 18,000 - would be: a highly specified Renault Laguna RXE 2.0, for its refinement; a limited edition Citroen XM Premiere 2.0-litre turbo, for exceptional value and aclass-beating ride; a Vauxhall Cavalier 2.5i V6 for large engined relaxation; a spacious Vauxhall Omega 2.0i 16v; a quiet and elegant Rover 620i, with its traditional British interior; and a comfortable yet sporty Saab 900 S 2.0i 5-door. All can have automatic transmission; I would not consider an executive car without it. Moving up the price scale, I could be seduced by the BMW 520i or a Mazda Xedos 6 2.0i V6 for their multi-cylinder refinement. The 5-cylinder, front-wheel driven Volvo 850 GLT 2.0 is equally fanciable. A Mercedes-Benz C-180 Elegance has the timeless appeal of any car with the three-pointed star. In the Pounds 24,000 to Pounds 30,000 class there is an embarrassment of riches, but saloon cars I have found particularly satisfying include the Jaguar XJ6 Gold, Mazda Xedos 9, Toyota Camry V6 GX and Mercedes-Benz C-280. Over the Pounds 30,000 mark, the BMW 5-Series with 3.0-litre or 4.0-litre V8 engines are as urbane as they are muscular, particularly with 5-speed automatic transmission. The Lexus LS300 and LS400 have few rivals for sheer silence. Enter the sky-is-the-limit price level and, among large saloons, it is really a Mercedes-Benz S-Class benefit. These exceedingly roomy and comprehensively equipped cars set standards of safety, technology and - surprisingly - driving joie de vivre that no other large luxury cars can match. The Jaguar Daimler Double Six is beginning to show its age, but its V12 engine's power delivery is Dom Perignon to a normal car's sparkling blanc de blanc. And the Bentley Brooklands, for less than Pounds 100,000, is the best value product Rolls-Royce has offered in years. And what of the minority choices - the estate cars, sports models and on-off road four-by-fours? Many an executive whose family includes a horse-mad daughter and has to transport all the gear that goes with equestrianism opts for an estate, such as a Volvo 940 or 960, Citroen XM, Ford Scorpio or Mercedes-Benz 300T. They offer saloon-car comfort with bulk carrying capacity. The Citroen's height-adjustable, self-levelling suspension can be a boon. A new rival, with petrol engines ranging from two to three litres, plus a 2.5-litre 6-cylinder BMW-sourced diesel, is the Vauxhall Omega. It is up among the leaders for room, refinement, comfort and equipment at highly competitive prices. BMW's 5-Series Touring and the Audi 100 estates have a sporting demeanour and carry bigger loads than a saloon, though they cannot match the large Citroen, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Vauxhall or Volvo estates for sheer bulk load capacity. One of the best sports cars for an executive user-chooser is Ford's new American-built Probe, V6 engined, very civilised to drive and able to take four people when required. Of the 4x4s, the Range Rover is still king, though the Mitsubishi Shogun runs it close for status. Independent front suspension gives the Shogun a better ride. The Land Rover Discovery offers practically all a Range Rover's benefits at a much lower price, and posh versions of what used to be the Isuzu Tropoper but is now the Vauxhall Monterey are equally pleasant on and off road.</p>

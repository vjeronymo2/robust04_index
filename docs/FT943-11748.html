			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel lifts second-term earnings MacMillan Bloedel, the Canadian forest products group, lifted profits in the second quarter. The group said a strengthening market for paper and wood products would enable it to absorb higher stumpage and royalty costs in the second half. Second-quarter profit was CDollars 48.3m (USDollars 35m), or 37 cents a share, up from CDollars 22.5m, or 19 cents, a year earlier on sales of CDollars 1bn, against CDollars 899m. First-half net profit was CDollars 62.2m, or 47 cents, compared with CDollars 68.8m, or 57 cents, on sales of CDollars 1.9bn, against CDollars 1.7bn. Canada's two biggest publishing groups continue to recover from the recession. Southam's second-quarter net profit was CDollars 11m, or 14 cents, up from CDollars 3.2m, or 4 cents, on revenues of CDollars 292m, against CDollars 288m. Half-year profit was CDollars 13.2m, or 17 cents, against a loss of CDollars 4m, or 6 cents, on revenues which edged ahead to CDollars 565m from CDollars 561m. Torstar's first-half profit was CDollars 21.9m, or 55 cents a share, against CDollars 8.1m, or 20 cents, on sales of CDollars 489m against CDollars 459m. Stelco, one of Canada's two biggest steelmakers, posted second-quarter profits of CDollars 26m, or 21 cents, against a loss of CDollars 13m, or 21 cents, on sales of CDollars 730m, up 15 per cent.

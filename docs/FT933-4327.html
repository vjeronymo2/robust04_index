			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Modernising the TUC THE OBSTACLES standing in the way of the re-launch of Britain's trade union movement were on full display at the TUC Congress in Brighton yesterday. The first big speech by Mr John Monks, as general secretary-elect, was partly eclipsed by the threat of a walk-out from left-wing unions over the return of the electricians union to the TUC. The speech was also preceded by a violently worded debate opposing human resource management techniques, something which wiser heads in the trade union movement are trying to influence rather than reject. Mindful of such constraints, Mr Monks's speech betrayed only glimpses of the modernising spirit which he seems to represent. It was an address concerned firstly to establish his standing with the delegates in the hall and only secondly with the outside world. Yet the arrival of Mr Monks is to be welcomed. He will speed up the transition of the TUC itself from a redundant civil service of the labour movement to a 'centre of excellence' concentrating on a few issues like occupational pensions and safety at work. He will also try to distance the unions from the Labour Party - a process which Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, may have slowed with his effusive speech to the Congress. The arguments in Mr Monks's speech yesterday about how employment insecurity contributes to a broader social instability were aimed at Conservative MP's who cherish family values. Turning the TUC into a more politically neutral lobbying organisation trying to establish new coalitions over workplace issues is worthwhile, regardless of whether Mr Monks can strike up a productive relationship with Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary. Constructive relationship The latter says he has 'an open door' for the TUC, which almost certainly promises more than it will deliver for the unions. Indeed, although both Mr Hunt and Mr Monks have their own reasons for wanting to establish a constructive relationship, it is difficult to imagine what they can usefully talk about at present, with the possible exception of training. But to deserve an audience, the TUC must prove its continuing relevance to employers and employees across a reasonable spread of the UK economy and that it has realistic proposals for reforming the labour market. There was little in Mr Monks's speech to indicate much progress on either count. The insecure workplace is not, as might be expected, causing a resurgence of trade unionism in Britain and there is no evidence that 'the tide of opinion is turning . . . to regenerate British trade unionism', as Mr Monks asserted. Workplace insurance Elsewhere he has spoken about appealing to the middle managers of 'middle England', but this requires more than talking to the government instead of the Labour Party. It means developing a concept of trade unionism that transcends collectivism. Some unions are tackling this by providing support for the negotiation of individual contracts and legal backing for individuals over redundancies and grievances. Such individual workplace insurance is not appropriate for all workers, but it could be made attractive to many more if unions did not hold so many negative associations for them. Mr Monks must show he has something relevant to contribute to the public policy debate beyond denunciation of the new labour market realities. His speech showed only nostalgia for the age of the steady job, without discussing the irresistible forces behind greater labour market mobility. Britain has always had a relatively deregulated labour market, the effects of which used to be softened for many workers by membership of strong unions. With the decline of those unions and the rise of more varied forms of work, there is a case for new forms of labour regulation that combine minimum standards of protection for employees without placing job-killing restrictions on employers operating in volatile and flexible markets. The government is evidently unclear about whether it wants another round of employment legislation in the near future. But it may be persuaded that new thinking is required to establish a better combination of flexibility and security at the workplace. The TUC should be part of that debate.</p>

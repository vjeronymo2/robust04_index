			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Smith Corona hit by decline in demand SMITH Corona, the US typewriter manufacturer 48 per cent-owned by Hanson group of the UK, yesterday reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings for the three months to end-March. The company made Dollars 3.8m after tax, compared with Dollars 6.1m in the same period a year ago. This leaves net income for the first nine months of the financial year virtually halved at Dollars 17.3m from Dollars 34.4m. The company's shares eased by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 10 1/4 . The group, which has been badly hit over the past 18 months by falling demand and strong pricing pressures, suggested it was pleased. 'The weak consumer spending environment as well as the ongoing product mix shift favouring lower-priced models continues to affect sales and earnings,' said Mr Lee Thompson, chairman. At the operating profit level, Smith Corona reported Dollars 5.2m against Dollars 11.1m, while sales slipped from Dollars 110.6m to Dollars 80.9m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has presented Stefan  Kawalec the document dismissing him from the post of deputy  minister of finance. The reason, according to the prime  minister, was the work of the deputy minister in its entirety,  and in particular the methods of privatization of the banks and  reform of the insurance system. These clarifications did not  satisfy Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and minister of  finance, who did not grant his consent to the dismissal of his  deputy minister.    [Unidentified correspondent] The government press office  reported the dismissal of Stefan Kawalec yesterday. Marek  Borowski, the direct superior of the deputy minister, expressed  surprise and requested a clarification of the reasons for this  decision. This morning, Waldemar Pawlak invited deputy minister  Kawalec for a meeting.    [Begin recording] [Kawalec] The prime minister handed me my  dismissal. He informed me that Minister Borowski had not  consented to this dismissal, which is why the prime minister  took the decision independently. The prime minister told me  that the cause is an evaluation of my work in the Ministry of  Finance, inter alia the concepts for privatization of banks and  insurance societies.    [Correspondent] Did this reply satisfy you?    [Borowski] No, of course it does not satisfy me, since no  analysis of the work of Deputy Minister Kawalec was actually  carried out. For matters to be clear, I here neither defend him  nor attack him. I myself addressed the Supreme Chamber of  Control with a request for an inspection. I feel that it was  not appropriate to make such a decision before the results of an  inspection.    [Correspondent] Marek Borowski requested the prime minister  to give a wider justification for this decision in writing by  Tuesday. Waldemar Pawlak said that the document is already ready.    [Pawlak] I quite simply do not wish to reveal the details  before it is received by Deputy Prime Minister Borowski. [end  recording]    [Announcer] In the prime minister's view, the dismissal of  Deputy Minister Kawalec will not be the cause of any sort of  troubles within the government coalition.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Have you in this situation  considered the possibility of resigning, and if so in what  circumstances?    [Borowski] Well, unfortunately, this question I must leave  without comment, and without reply at this moment.    [Correspondent] But is it appropriate to expect such a  reply, and if so when?    [Borowski] As I said, I am waiting until Tuesday, for the  prime minister's reply .    [Correspondent] Stefan Kawalec, dismissed today, had held  his  post for four years. He was one of the closest colleagues of  Leszek Balcerowicz. Among other things, he undertook the  negotiation of the reduction of our foreign debt and the  introduction of the convertibility of the zloty. He was also  responsible for the reform of the banking system. Most  recently, he supervised the privatization of the Bank Slaski.  [end recording]</p>

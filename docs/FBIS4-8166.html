			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pawel Wronski and Wojciech Zaluska: "They Are </F> Arguing About the Presidential RBN; Coalition Versus Belweder  Again"]    [Text] The dispute between the coalition and the  Belweder over Rosati has not yet completely subsided, but there  is another one looming on the horizon. This time, it is over  the National Security Council [RBN]: Is it supposed to be Lech  Walesa's advisory body, or is it supposed to strengthen the  president's powers?    "To clear up the situation, a Walesa-Pawlak-Kwasniewski  summit meeting is necessary," leaders for the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] kept saying yesterday. But they refused to  comment on the president's two preconditions, which Lech Walesa  says must be met before talks can be conducted: Give up Rosati  and establish the RBN.    "There cannot be any preconditions," Oleksy said.    Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy refused to reveal yesterday  whether  the coalition has a new candidate for finance minister in lieu  of Professor Rosati, whose candidacy was rejected by the  president. Oleksy kept saying that Rosati is still the favorite  of the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party. Aleksander  Kwasniewski, who returned from his foreign trip yesterday, kept  repeating the refrain: "Rosati is still our candidate."  <H5>  A Dangerous President? </H5>   Oleksy was also critical of his party colleague [Labor  Minister] Leszek Miller, who told journalists that the SLD has  found a new candidate. "Miller has extraordinary inspirations  sometimes," Oleksy joked. But we learned unofficially that the  SLD leaders tried to persuade Bank Handlowy Chairman Cezary  Stypulkowski to take over the Finance Ministry. But  Stypulkowski does not want to change jobs.    In the meantime, the SLD leaders, irritated by Walesa's  position, are coming back to the idea of amending the Small  Constitution so as to prevent the president from being able to  interfere with personnel decisions in ministries. They tried to  talk the prime minister into this, but without success. Pawlak  does not want an open conflict with the Belweder.    But, during confidential talks with the opposition  (Democratic Union) before a vote on the president's veto  regarding neo-popiwek [wage-controlling legislation], Pawlak  tried to convince his interlocutors that Walesa constitutes a  threat to democracy and that parliament should resist him.  <H5>  A Dangerous Council? </H5>   But, instead of peace at the top, as had been expected,  there  emerged a new dispute between the coalition and the Belweder.  Sejm Speaker Oleksy has said that he does not know what the  president meant when he talked about the RBN being a forum for  meetings between the coalition and the Belweder ("We talked in  different languages," the Sejm speaker said), but Andrzej  Drzycimski's statement following a Walesa-Oleksy meeting was  perceived to be yet another precondition set by the president.    Since November of last year, the Belweder has been demanding  that the RBN be established as the supreme state organ  responsible for the country's security. The council would be  headed by the president, while its executive organ would be the  Council of Ministers' Committee for Defense Issues [KSORM],  headed by the prime minister.    Initially, the idea was that the RBN and KSORM were to be  established in the spring, thanks to "speedy legislative  proceedings." But then the coalition withdrew its support for  the idea. "According to the coalition, the establishment of the  RBN in this form would mean introducing a presidential system  through a back door."    The RBN's existence is provided for by the Small  Constitution, but it is only described there as the president's  advisory organ. "A council such as this may be set up at any  time, just like KSORM," Oleksy declared. "But, if this is to be  the kind of agency the Belweder wants it to be, there is simply  no issue."  <H5>  An Agency or a Plane? </H5>   Other politicians have also criticized the Belweder's idea  of  the RBN as a forum for president-coalition meetings. "It does  not include, for instance, Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of  the SLD Sejm Deputies Club. How is one supposed to have  political debates then?" asks Jerzy Szmajdzinski, a secretary  general of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic.    "It is absurd for Lech Walesa to regard the supreme state  agency for the country's security as a plane for political  games," says Tomasz Nalecz, of the Union of Labor.</p>

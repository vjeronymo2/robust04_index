			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Inkatha firm on poll boycott South Africa's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party said yesterday it would not take part in the country's first all-race elections in April, but left the door open to further negotiations, Reuter reports from Durban. Inkatha said it would reconsider its boycott if its demands for greater regional powers and fiscal autonomy were met by the South African government and by its arch-rival, the African National Congress. Inkatha, led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has been holding bilateral talks with the government and the ANC about its demands and is due to meet them again before January 24.</p>

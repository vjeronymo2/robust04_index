			<p>CSO     [Text] Tehran, 23 Farvardin [12 April] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News  Service -- To do marketing and create facilities to develop  nonoil exports, trade attaches will soon be stationed at all the  Islamic Republic of Iran's embassies, with the cooperation of  the Foreign Ministry.    Engineer 'Ali Sa'idlu, deputy minister of commerce for trade  and chief of the Iran Export Development Center, announced the  above at a gathering of news reporters. He said: In this regard  talks have been held with Foreign Ministry officials, because  trade attaches in the embassies will help develop exports.    He discussed the provisions the government has made to  support exporters of nonoil goods. He said: Based on a measure  enacted by the Money and Credit Council, the share of credits to  be provided for exports is increased from last year's  6.5-percent figure to 8.5 percent for the current year, with a  commission rate of 18 percent.    Engineer Sa'idlu also added: The Supreme Exports Council,  which met recently chaired by President of the Republic Hojjat  ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani and attended by a  number of ministers working in economic affairs, will soon  prepare a comprehensive export program.    He explained that the measures enacted by this council,  along  with the new activities of the exports guarantee fund, will  solve the problems in the export sector.    Engineer Sa'idlu noted that imports of goods must be done in  exchange for exports. On this same basis, the Export Development  Center sets prices on export goods and gives an affidavit to  that effect to the exporters. Using these affidavits it is  possible to import the goods needed by the country.    In conclusion, he said that holding an international  exposition all over the country depends on obtaining  authorization from the Export Development Center.</p>

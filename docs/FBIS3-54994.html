You  are well aware that, by a decision of the city commandant's  office, the curfew was lifted in Tbilisi on 1 and 2 January.  Commandant Zaza Chachua will speak about the results of this  move.    [Begin recording] [Chachua] People kept shooting and walking  in the streets. There were road accidents and other things.    [Kobaidze] What can you envisage in the long run?    [Chachua] In the long run? The curfew must become as strict  as possible and the administrative bodies must handle everything  more firmly. [passage omitted]    [Kobaidze] How long do you think Tbilisi will need a curfew?    [Chachua] Some more months. At least six months I think.  This is the least. [passage omitted, new year greetings and  wishes] [end recording]</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market focus on Zeneca Well received first-half figures from Zeneca combined with previous hints in the market that the former pharmaceuticals arm of ICI could be a bid candidate, giving a healthy boost to the Zeneca share price. The company announced profits of Pounds 351m after a Pounds 100m exceptional charge. They were below the previous year's numbers but above the range of analysts' forecasts. Mr Andrew Porter of UBS said he remained a strong buyer but the 10.75p dividend was slightly disappointing. The market had forecast 11p. Mr Paul Krikler of Goldman Sachs said: 'The results were clearly above expectations and driven forward by very strong margins in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.' Analysts upgraded full-year forecasts by between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m to a range of Pounds 760 to Pounds 790m. There was some debate over how much of the exceptional charge had been anticipated in the market. The shares reflected concern at the initial announcement, opening 8 lower. However, there was also debate over how much the final net rise for the stock of 24 to 795p was attributable to the profit figures. Traders said heavy London buying in the sector had been driven largely by speculative interest following the recent Dollars 8.5bn bid for American Cyanamid in the US.</p>

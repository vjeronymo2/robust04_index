The installed capacity of urban telephones has reached more  than 200,000 lines, eight times that of 1988, when setting up  the province, as well as designating it as the largest special  economic zone in China, was approved by the State Council.    The capital city of Haikou now has 27 telephones for every  100 people, ranking among the top of China's provincial capital  cities.    At present, automatic telephone service has been put into  operation at or above the country town level. The province is  thus on line with more than 1,400 cities at home and 195  countries and regions in the world.    Various advanced communications facilities related to  digital  micro-wave, optical fiber, satellite, program-control, mobile  and paging functions are in service in the province.    During the six-year period, the capacity of switchboards in  the province's rural areas increased by 90 percent.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Arts: Southerne's 'The Wives' Excuse' - Theatre Here is a fascinating new old play - one not seen since it was new at Drury Lane just over 300 years ago; it failed then, but succeeds now. It tells a new old tale of men working to manipulate women for their own sexual gratification, and of women resisting those manipulations and exercising what independence they can. The title is The Wives' Excuse, the subtitle Cuckolds Make Themselves; and the author, Thomas Southerne, is better known for his tragedy Oroonoko. Though parts of the highly complex plot are bewildering, what emerges powerfully is a vivid, serious Restoration Vanity Fair in which liaisons dangereuses flourish. The characters repeatedly look vice in the face like their old familiar, and yet most of them retain a disturbingly sharp moral sense. And while all too many of the men voice a view of women so narrow as to be more or less misogynistic, enough of the women - in very different ways - struggle to maintain their own worth. While almost all the cream of current Stratford actors are occupied in Adrian Noble's concurrent production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, the director Max Stafford-Clark has achieved here such excellent ensemble that not even the weakest individual performances puncture it for an instant. In this production, he achieves results far finer than in his previous RSC stagings of A Jovial Crew and The Country Wife (the latter currently playing at the Pit) - no doubt because he has found a play here that best sparks his flair for social and sexual criticism. From the first moment, he creates a convincing and multi-faceted world of refined manners and crude desires. And, best of all, he makes it fast. True, details of the plot whirl past so rapidly that we cannot keep up with them, but this does not matter, for everything shows us a world onstage that rattles along at its own rate and with its own inner life. He even transposes the play into Regency costume to good effect, turning its male rakes into bucks and beaux who play upon its Empire-lined heroines. One performance stands out: Lesley Manville as Mrs Wittwoud, the most cynical and least virtuous woman in the play. This performance, a model of economy, has wit, danger and complexity. It reaches its peak in a brief soliloquy in which Mrs Wittwoud reflects on the dilemma of being known for wit rather than virtue. ''Tis not enough for a woman to be handsome; there must be a probability of making that handsome woman kind, to make a man in love with her . . . Now, from one of my character, who have impertinently prated away so much of my time - in setting up for a wit, to the ruin of other people's pleasure and loss of my own - what encouragement for probability can there be, but that, as I have lived a fool, I ought to die repenting, unpitied, and a maid? If I had died a maid, 'tis but what I deserved for laughing off their charitable design of making me otherwise.' What a speech] - and how freshly delivered. Without any sacrifice of period style, Manville makes us see Wittwoud as clearly as if she lived today, and makes her a study in the perils of feminine wit to be set beside those in Congreve, Austen, Trollope, or Wilde. The cast is large. It would be easy to pick at flaws in various other performances - some of the better-behaved female characters should have as much force, intelligence and inner conflict as Mrs Wittwoud - but one's main sensation is of excitement in following so lively and serious a sexual comedy. Purcell songs are sung, albeit with too little confidence or grace, before and during the play, and they beautifully heighten its elegant climate. Julian McGowan's set marvellously looks as if it were built into the Swan Theatre. And the action is so well focused that it reminds me again that of the RSC's five regular theatres the Swan is the most actor- and audience-friendly.

Julian Rizo Alvarez, first  secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Camaguey Province,  at a meeting with rural leaders expressed the opinion that every  Basic Cooperative Production Unit in cane agriculture should  have a tractor and a plow with which to prepare the land. He  explained that he defends this idea because plowing must be done  rapidly for cane recovery.</p>

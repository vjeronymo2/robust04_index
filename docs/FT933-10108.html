			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Greek privatisation bill delayed Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis was forced yesterday to back off from presenting a bill to privatise the state telephone company after members of his conservative party threatened to vote against the sale, Reuter reports from Athens. Mr Mitsotakis said: 'The draft bill is not ready yet and I can't tell you when it will be tabled in parliament.' Earlier government officials had said the bill would be presented this week and voted on by August 12.</p>

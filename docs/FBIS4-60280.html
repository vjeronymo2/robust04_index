			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sakher Abou Eloun] </F>   [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, May 22 (AFP) -- The new  Palestinian intelligence chief for Gaza and Jericho emerged  Sunday from 27 years in the shadows, but said he was "too tired"  to talk and scrapped a welcome home party.    Brigadier-General Misbah Hanafi Rushdi Saqr returned to his  wife who believed he was dead after he went missing during the  1967 Middle East war.    An AFP correspondent spotted the moustachioed general on  Sunday walking to a Gaza City cemetery where his mother and  father were buried.    But the intelligence chief for the autonomous areas, who  looked drawn and pale in his olive-green uniform of the  Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), said: "I'm too tired to talk."    His family said they learned on Saturday that he would be  coming home and had prepared a welcoming party with other  relatives.    But the general maintained his awesome reputation for  discretion after, according to Palestinian police officers,  living half his life clandestinely in Israel under a false name.    He apologized saying he was exhausted and asked for the  celebrations to be cancelled. Journalists were told to leave  the family home.    A brief announcement from PLO headquarters in Tunis last  week  that Saqr was to head the intelligence service stunned even  those closest to the man, who all believed him dead.    PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat "announced to us, a few days ago,  that he would be the next chief of the intelligence services,"  an officer in the Palestinian police force told AFP.    Born in Gaza in 1943, Saqr graduated as an officer from the  Cairo military academy in the late 1950s. He was PLA commander  for the Khan Yunus area of Gaza in 1967, when he disappeared  without a trace.    A nephew, taxi-driver Bashir Saqr, said the head of the  Palestinian police force had contacted the family directly.    "General Nasr Yusuf sent two of his men to my house ... and  asked my mother: 'Where's your brother Misbah?' The poor woman  replied she had no idea," the nephew said.    "Then I met a deputy to the general who asked me what I knew  of my uncle Misbah, and I replied that he was dead.    "He replied: 'No. Your uncle is alive and is living  somewhere nearby. If he turns up or calls, tell him that  president 'Arafat wants to speak to him or that he should come  to our offices.'"    Some people believed General Saqr had drowned swimming the  Jordan River from the West Bank to Jordan.    But his brother Hamis said he had never really believed  Misbah was dead. "I didn't wear black in mourning. I asked the  International Committee of the Red Cross but they never found  him in Israeli prisons."    He also investigated in Amman and Beirut as well as with the  PLO, who said the general had died a martyr for the Palestinian  cause.    "When I found out he was still alive, I burst into tears,"  said the brother, a merchant in Gaza City.    Even the general's wife, Nismat Barzak, who runs a school,  had no contact with him throughout the Israeli occupation,  according to the family.    Their two grown-up sons, who work abroad in Arab countries,  also never saw their father and "only know his face from old  photographs," said Hamis.    A large crowd gathered at the family home in Gaza's  up-market  Rimal neighbourhood, but they were disappointed as Saqr did not  appear.    He was seen sitting quietly at the back of the house which  was protected by a large number of armed bodyguards.    Gun-wielding Palestinian guerrillas of the Hawks, armed wing  of the mainstream PLO movement Fatah, were also kept away.    "I do not have authority to talk to anyone," Saqr told AFP.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Static year for Spandex Profits of Spandex, a USM-quoted supplier of sign-making equipment, were virtually static at Pounds 4.2m pre-tax for the year to end-December. The figure, which compared with Pounds 4.3m for 1990, was struck from turnover some Pounds 10m higher at Pounds 52m. The increase in sales reflected organic growth and expansion into continental Europe. A proposed final dividend of 4.1p makes a 6p (5.5p) total. Earnings fell 4p to 20.4p per share.</p>

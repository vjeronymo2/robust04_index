			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: London regeneration plan Southwark Council and the London Institute have chosen proposals put forward by AMEC for a regeneration scheme to be carried out at the Elephant and Castle in south London. The Pounds 57m scheme involves redevelopment of an area currently occupied by the Elephant and Castle leisure centre and its adjacent car park - the largest council landholding in the area. AMEC's proposals include provision of a leisure centre for use by the community; together with a new teaching block and student residential accommodation for the adjacent London Institute. St Mary's Churchyard, a nearby open space, will also be improved in terms of layout and appearance as part of the overall develop-ment. AMEC has proposed a four-storey leisure centre, constructed as an important landmark for the area. Facilities will include competition, training and leisure pools, a health spa, squash courts and a 36.5m x 32m multi-purpose sports hall. A dance studio, community rooms and a spectator area will be also be provided, as will a library/exhibition area and a weight training room.</p>

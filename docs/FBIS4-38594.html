			<p>BFN     [Text] Dnepropetrovsk [no date as received] -- Ivan  Plyushch, a candidate for the post of president of Ukraine,  noted at a news conference yesterday that "Ukraine needs tough  decisions now in order not to resort to brutal ones tomorrow."  In his opinion, the main shortcoming in the state system is the  dichotomy between executive and legislative authorities. One  should either grant the necessary powers to the prime minister,  or the president should head the Cabinet of Ministers, Ivan  Plyushch said. He is inclined to the second option.    Regarding the current composition of the Supreme Council,  the  former Speaker observed that he does not find it significantly  different from the previous one. True, he said, new tendencies  have appeared in the parliament's work, and if they are allowed  to develop, the Supreme Council could turn into an  administrative body. "Something like the central committee, but  a worse version," Ivan Plyushch explained, and added that "the  shift to the left" in society and parliament is not a terrible  thing. He believes that one should not fear communists, but  Bolsheviks, whose aim is first to destroy, and only then to  build. With regard to Ukraine's economy, the former Speaker  noted, it now needs liberalization and evolutionary reforms.</p>

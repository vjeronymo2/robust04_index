			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Gas Natural completes Enagas deal Gas Natural, the Spanish domestic natural gas distributor which is controlled by the partially-privatised Repsol energy and chemicals conglomerate, has completed the delayed takeover of Enagas, Spain's government-owned monopoly gas importer. The acquisition, priced at Pta51.2bn (Dollars 379m) for 91 per cent of Enagas, turns Gas Natural into a leading participant among European gas companies. The takeover had first been signalled nine months ago but had been delayed over pricing disagreements - the government had sought Pta80bn-Pta120bn for the sale of Enagas - and by Repsol's insistence that it would not take on the burden of a pipeline that Enagas was constructing between Spain and the Algerian gas fields. To complete the deal, Enagas has put the Pta300bn pipeline project into a separate company that remains under public ownership and which Gas Natural has an option to buy in 2000.</p>

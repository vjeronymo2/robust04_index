			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Israelis kill Hizbollah chief: Helicopter rocket attack on Sheikh Abbas's convoy in Lebanon SHEIKH Abbas Musawi, leader of Lebanon's Shia Moslem fundamentalist organisation, Hizbollah, was killed yesterday in a rocket attack by Israeli helicopters as he was travelling in a convoy of vehicles in southern Lebanon. The attack, 30km from the Israeli border, ended a weekend of violence in Israel and Lebanon which seemed bound to escalate political tensions ahead of the next round of Middle East peace talks due to open in Washington early next week, involving Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians. Nevertheless, Syria and Lebanon said within hours of Sheikh Abbas's death that they would attend the talks, an announcement likely to be welcomed by Washington as a sign of the durability of the peace process, despite continuing violence on the ground. The killing of Sheikh Abbas, a key figure in the negotiations last year for the release of western hostages, followed earlier Israeli aircraft and helicopter strikes on Palestinian refugee camps in south Lebanon. These were reprisals for the killing of three Israeli soldiers at an army camp in Israel late on Friday night. At least four civilians were reported killed in the air attacks on the refugee camps. Sheikh Abbas's wife, six-year-old son and at least five bodyguards were also killed in the attack. The Israeli army said the Hizbollah leader had been in the village of Jibsheet meeting a number of Hizbollah officials responsible for organising attacks on Israeli forces. Israel made no connection between Hizbollah and the death of the Israeli soldiers. The assailants were believed by Israel to be Palestine Liberation Organisation activists who escaped into the occupied West Bank. But it was clear that even if not a direct reprisal, the operation to kill Sheikh Abbas offered the government and the defence establishment, embarrassed by Friday night's security lapse, added opportunity to mount a show of force. Mr Moshe Arens, the Israeli defence minister, said last night: 'This is a message to all the terrorist organisations that whoever opens an account with us, we will be the ones to close the account. This is true for all the bands, for all the terrorist organisations, for all the leaders.' Mr Arens also said that Sheikh Abbas was a man with 'lots of blood on his hands. This was an attack intended to hurt Hizbollah.' In Washington, the State Department said the US 'was concerned at the rising cycle of violence' and urged all sides to 'exercise maximum restraint'. Sheikh Abbas was secretary-general of Hizbollah, the Iranian-backed group best known in the west as the primary Lebanese organisation involved in hostage-taking. He was regarded by Israel as being behind a persistent guerrilla campaign against Israeli forces and their allies in southern Lebanon where Israel occupies a 'security zone' along the northern side of its border. The strike was the most dramatic attack by Israel on Hizbollah since it kidnapped Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid in mid-1989 in a failed attempt to secure the release of Israeli servicemen held by Lebanese militia. Yesterday's action may have been prompted by the collapse of United Nations efforts to obtain the servicemen's release. However, one side effect may be further to complicate efforts to free two remaining German hostages. International condemnation has not deterred Israel from continuing to make armed incursions deep into Lebanon. It brushes aside complaints that it violates international law by saying the Lebanese authorities are incapable of preventing attacks on Israel from their own soil, and are manipulated against Israel's interests by Syria.

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Repsol to raise Dollars 500m with share placing REPSOL, the Spanish state-controlled energy group, is to raise at least Dollars 500m through an international issue of shares that will reduce the government's ownership of the company to less than 50 per cent. The share placing, which is likely to go ahead within three months, will be the first of several disposals of state shareholdings scheduled for this year as the government seeks to reduce its budget deficit by asset sales. Repsol said yesterday that Lazards was advising in the design of the share offer and that issue managers would be decided shortly. The placing, aimed at institutional investors, is likely to be marketed aggressively in the US, Europe - notably in the UK - and Japan. In a circular last month inviting bids to lead the placement syndicate, Repsol indicated it was seeking to raise more than Dollars 500m. At current market prices - Repsol is trading at Dollars 24 a share, which is close to its historic high - the conglomerate would be putting some 7 per cent of itself on the market and the state-held equity in Repsol would fall from 54.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent. The placement has been made possible by last year's repeal of legislation that had made majority public ownership of Repsol mandatory. Similar legislation has been approved that allows public ownership of Tabacalera, the domestic tobacco producer and distributor in Spain, to drop below the 50 per cent mark. Under the framework of the 1993 budget, the Spanish exchequer aims to raise Dollars 1.3bn through the partial privatisation of state-controlled companies. Analysts believe the Repsol placement will be followed by share offerings in Tabacalera, which is 53 per cent state-owned, and by Endesa, the large electrical utility, which is 67.5 per cent owned by the state.</p>

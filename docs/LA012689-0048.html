			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> USAir Group's 1988 profit was off 15% to $165 million. Operating revenue rose  to $5.7 billion, up 90%. The Washington-based operator of USAir, Piedmont  Aviation and four commuter airlines credited the results to one-time expenses  related to merging Pacific Southwest Airlines with USAir last April and  establishment of a $33-million reserve to reduce the company's investment in  its BAC 1-11 aircraft and related spares.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: NEW KIDS: DELIVERING CHRISTMAS PACKAGE;  </P> <P> NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK "MERRY, MERRY CHRIST MAS." COLUMBIA ** 1/2: POP STARS  ***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR *** GOOD VIBRATIONS **  MAYBE BABY * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> Most music fans over 18 probably wouldn't be caught dead listening to anything  by these idols of the early-teen set. But this collection of old and new  Christmas tunes might win over some skeptics. It's not great, but it's much  better than you'd expect.  </P> <P> It's hard to ruin a Christmas album. Any singer with a shred of talent can  handle foolproof holiday standards. But New Kids do it the hard way, with only  three standards -- "The Christmas Song," "White Christmas" and "Little Drummer  Boy." The core of the album is the new material, co-written by  producer-arranger Maurice Starr, which ranges from the rowdy "Funky Funky Xmas"  to the catchy, cozy ballad "Merry Merry Christmas."  </P> <P> This album deserves high marks for the vocals, particularly Jordan Knight's  soaring falsetto, and Starr's sleek production. Conspicuously absent on most of  the songs is the amateurish quality of the vocals on the Kids' first two  albums.  </P> <P> Their sound is still recycled soul -- borrowed from groups like the Stylistics  and Contours -- that's been spruced up with pop harmonies. But the sound has  been considerably upgraded. Maybe these Kids are growing up. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

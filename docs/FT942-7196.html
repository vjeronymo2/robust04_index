			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Russian carmaker secures Dollars 100m loan Avtovaz, the Russian carmaker which produces the Lada, yesterday signed a Dollars 100m medium-term loan facility from Standard Chartered Bank. The loan is the third Avtovaz has negotiated with western banks over the past year, bringing its total western borrowing to Dollars 350m. Avtovaz, which produces some 7 per cent of Russia's GNP, was the first Russian manufacturer to borrow directly from western banks without Russian government guarantees. Yesterday's loan is a seven-year revolving facility and is secured against Avtovaz's exports. Mr Nikolai Glouchkov, deputy general-director of Avtovaz, said high inflation and interest rates in Russia compel domestic companies to seek western financing for medium or long-term infrastructure projects. The transaction was structured and arranged by European Capital, a UK merchant bank. Standard Chartered Bank is providing Dollars 100m to LM International Finance, a private Luxembourg company, jointly owned by Avtovaz, Mannai Corporation, a private Middle Eastern company, and Avtovazbank. LM International Finance will then lend the money to Avtovaz.</p>

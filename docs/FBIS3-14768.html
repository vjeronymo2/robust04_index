The 43-year-old candidate of technical sciences  was adviser to Vladimir Shumeyko when he was first deputy  chairman of the government. He has also had considerable  experience of working in the Supreme Soviet.    In reply to deputies' questions about guaranteeing their  parliamentary activity, Vladimir Nikitov said, in particular,  that the question of deputies' badges had not yet been decided.  The matter is being held up because of their cost: The proposed  draft badge containing precious metals will cost half a million  [currency not specified].</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television An almost impossibly packed evening. BBC2's excellent series about technology, White Heat, turns its attention to war machines (8.00). Another batch of Cracker begins, one of ITV's few triumphs from its first year under the government's demented new broadcasting laws. Robbie Coltrane again plays the talented police psychologist with drink and sex problems (9.00). The Nick, is yet another elephant-on-the-floor series about police work which, surprisingly, received some good notices for its first episode (9.00 C4). In Panorama Peter Jay reports on 'job insecurity', the big anxiety for parents in the 90s who see their children employed (if at all) as temps and via agencies and not in proper full time jobs (9.30 BBC1). BBC1's new comedy Nice Day At The Office has a remarkable cast including Anna Massey, John Sessions and Timothy Spall (10.10). ITV starts another series of The Good Sex Guide, presented again by Margi Clarke (10.40). BBC1's 'Movie Classic' is Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney unforgettable in the title role (11.10). Jeremy Isaacs' interviewee in Face To Face is Salman Rushdie (11.15 BBC2).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There are clear signs that relations between Lisbon  and Tel Aviv are improving. Miguel Coimbra reports:    [Coimbra] Portugal has had diplomatic relations with Israel  since 1977, but it only opened an embassy in Tel Aviv two and a  half years ago. Since then there have been successive high  level visits and meetings between leaders of both countries.  These meetings have resulted in excellent cooperation relations  and in the development of a variety of activities --  entrepreneurial, scientific, and commercial. Israel has become  in the last few years, OECD countries aside, Portugal's second  trading partner, after Angola. The good relations are also  demonstrated by the two direct weekly flights between Portugal  and Israel and by an accord to abolish entry visas for citizens  of the two countries. In addition to strengthening bilateral  understanding, the two governments are at the moment working on  the consolidation of cooperation on a trilateral level,  including the PALOP's [Lusophone African countries], and on an  international level with a focus on the Middle East peace  process and on a new economic accord between Israel and the  European Union.</p>

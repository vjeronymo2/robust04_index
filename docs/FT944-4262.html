			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: All-Americas free trade zone 'by 2006' Leaders of 34 countries in the western hemisphere are expected to agree plans to create a free trade area from Alaska to Cape Horn by 2006 during the three-day Americas summit which starts today in Miami. Just a week ago it seemed likely that no date would be set for completing negotiations on setting up the free trade zone, but, barring any last-minute veto when the leaders discuss trade tomorrow morning, a 2005 deadline for agreement will be included in the summit declaration on Sunday. A draft summit declaration calls for 'the conclusion of negotiations on the Americas Free Trade Area no later than the year 2005' and for 'concrete progress towards attainment of this objective by the end of this century'. President Carlos Menem of Argentina said yesterday the next 12 years would see further hemispheric summits to follow up the decisions made in Miami so that a free trade zone came into effect by 2006. US officials said the summit would lay down a schedule of official and ministerial meetings to begin work immediately on the progressive elimination of barriers to trade and investment, as well as a substantial work programme for the Organisation of American States and the Inter-American Development Bank. The draft declaration says that free trade and greater economic integration are key factors in raising living standards, improving working conditions and protecting the environment. While some countries had been reluctant to pin down a year, others, led by Argentina, argued that it would be a severe setback if the Americas summit were unable to agree on a date, when leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum last month had accepted a target date of 2020 for establishing a free trade zone in the Pacific. Argentina wanted the Americas Free Trade Area to be established by 2001, but other countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, had resisted such an ambitious target. Mr Menem said the best way to hemispheric integration was initially to cement regional trade groupings, such as Mercosur - which groups Argentina with Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. However, progress towards the final goal depended on the speed with which the North American Free Trade Agreement could be extended - and that largely hung on the disposition of the US Congress. The declaration of an Americas Free Trade Area is expected to be accompanied by the announcement that Chile will be invited to begin negotiations early next year on joining the US, Canada and Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said: 'I think we have to take a lead. If we don't work with our hemispheric partners in building this relationship on trade with the Americas, then we're going to find that the Japanese and the Europeans are going to work to be their partners.' The Miami summit is the first western hemisphere summit to be hosted by the US - something that would have been difficult in earlier decades when the US was viewed as a domineering imperial power by many Latin American countries. Unlike previous regional summits in Panama in 1956 and in Uruguay in 1967, this summit will be attended only by popularly elected leaders. The only country not to be invited is Cuba.</p>

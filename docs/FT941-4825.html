			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fourth-quarter rise boosts Varity shares Shares in Varity rose sharply yesterday after the US automotive, agricultural and industry machinery group reported a big improvement in fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 27m, or 59 cents a share, on a fully-diluted basis. A year ago, Varity earned Dollars 11.2m excluding extraordinary charges. The results were well above Wall Street analysts' expectations, and Varity shares leaped Dollars 4 1/4 to close at Dollars 48 3/4 (a new 52-week high) on the New York Stock Exchange. The strong final quarter took 1993 profits to Dollars 76.3m, up from Dollars 33.4m a year earlier. After taking a non-cash charge to cover changes in accounting principles, however, the company recorded a net loss of Dollars 71.5m in its latest fiscal year. Mr Victor Rice, chairman and chief executive, said the accelerating recovery in the North American automotive industry - the chief market for Varity's brake products - was the main factor behind the earnings improvement, while cost containment measures continue to help the group weather the impact of the recession in Europe. Among its three business segments, the automotive products business, Kelsey-Hayes, made the biggest contribution to earnings growth in the final quarter, posting operating income of Dollars 22m on sales of Dollars 297m. Last year, Kelsey-Hayes earned Dollars 16m on sales of Dollars 249m.</p>

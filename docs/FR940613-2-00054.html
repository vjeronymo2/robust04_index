			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Were we required to decide this issue without legislative guidance, we would prefer to see all benefits to employees of insured institutions be delivered as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> compensation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We would certainly endorse the creation of an ESOP immediately after conversion. If the conversion process has entailed extra effort on the part of some (or all) employees, they may be entitled to bonuses. And if conversion entails a radical reduction in job security, it may be appropriate to adopt a severance policy consistent with standard industry practice for stock institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Focussing on the top few executives and non-executive trustees, it is certainly the case that their jobs become harder and less secure following conversion. They may be entitled to significant raises. It may be appropriate for a few senior executives to receive employment contracts. Again, all such steps should be evaluated within the context of ``compensation.'' We believe that for individuals who control the conversion transaction to lay any claim, in their capacity as managers and trustees, to a portion of the value being transferred creates a conflict of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is currently common practice for converting institutions to create stock option plans. We believe it is appropriate for stock institutions to have incentive compensation plans of this type. As indicated in the FDIC proposed rule mentioned above, we agree with the OTS that such plans should, at the earliest, be adopted at the first stockholders' meeting following conversion and that the exercise price for any such options should be set at that time, rather than being based on the conversion price. The latter practice, which had been common, gave those who controlled the transaction an incentive to underprice the shares, and masked transfers of value to those executives receiving options, which, if properly measured, and viewed as compensation, would have been deemed excessive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A ``Government'' Share?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several individuals and organizations have suggested that a share of the existing value of converting mutuals should go to one of the deposit insurance funds, or to the U.S. Treasury, or to the government of the state which chartered the institution. We are uncomfortable with the first suggestion. Converting institutions have been paying premiums, just as stock institutions have. No one would lay claim to a portion of the latter's net worth. The FDIC should not do so with regard to mutuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some have advanced the argument_based on the cost of the savings and loan crisis_that taxpayers generally, through the medium of the Treasury, should get a portion of the value that conversion releases. As a fairness matter, we believe this argument is flawed: Institutions now converting have  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  failed, and have  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  cost taxpayers anything. Most state savings banks, whose conversions fall under our jurisdiction, are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, which taxpayers have not had to support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another argument for conveying the value of converting mutuals to the government_whether state or federal_is that ``no one owns them,'' and that the fairest course is therefore to avoid giving the value to anyone in particular. We will have more to say on this topic later in this Notice, but would observe that if the form of transaction suggested below is adopted, many of those who receive the value of the institution will get cash, and will pay taxes on it as income, giving government its ``share.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Fulfilling Mutuals' Original Purpose?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated earlier, mutuals were created for reasons that have now largely disappeared. Ordinary citizens have plenty of places to put their savings. A host of private- and public-sector entities facilitate home-ownership. The trustees of a mutual savings institution having regard for their fiduciary duties might liken their situation to that of the board of the March of Dimes, which had to redefine its mission after polio ceased to be a major threat. From that perspective, it may be appropriate for a portion of the value of a converting mutual to be transferred to one of more community organizations or charities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

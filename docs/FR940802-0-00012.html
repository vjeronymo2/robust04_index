The agency is taking this action to assess further the availability of equipment necessary for compliance with the regulation for items of labeling (other than immediate container labels) and to address concerns about the scope of a particular provision of that rule in partial response to two citizen petitions that were submitted to FDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The final rule published at 58 FR 41348, August 3, 1993, is effective August 3, 1994.

Partial Extension of The Compliance Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41348), FDA published a final rule that amended the CGMP regulations to require that certain special control procedures be instituted if cut labeling is used. One of the options available under these procedures requires the use of ``appropriate electronic or electromechanical equipment to conduct a 100-percent examination for correct labeling during or after completion of finishing operations***.'' (21 CFR 211.122(g)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 4, 1994, FDA received a citizen petition from five trade associations requesting that the agency take a number of actions including, but not limited to, extending the August 3, 1994, effective date of this rule as it applies to labeling (other than the immediate container labels) as defined in section 201(m) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 (m)). The petition states that additional time is needed because of the unavailability of bar code or machine readers as well as other equipment necessary to orient the labeling codes properly, and the petition also requests that FDA reopen its administrative record to reassess the scope of a certain provision of the regulation, as discussed in section II. of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 6, 1994, the agency received an additional petition from a trade association that requested, among other things, a 1-year stay of the effective date; the petitioner stated that additional time is needed to locate, install, and validate scanning equipment and other necessary equipment to orient items properly for bar code scanning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, appropriate electronic or electromechanical equipment primarily consists of systems that scan identity codes printed on labeling. If an incorrect code is detected, the defective labeling is ejected from the labeling line. FDA has contacted vendors of this equipment and has not found a general shortage of system hardware. The agency has determined, however, that there may be a shortage of contract engineering firms that are employed by some drug manufacturers to evaluate, select, purchase, install, qualify, and validate labeling verification systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA believes that proper validation of electromechanical labeling control systems is vital to the effective operation of such systems and the prevention of potentially dangerous labeling mixups. The agency is, therefore, as discussed in section II. of this document, extending to August 3, 1995, the compliance date of &sect;211.122(g) as it applies to items of labeling other than the immediate container label in order to assess further the availability of equipment necessary for compliance with the final rule and to evaluate adequately other issues raised by petitioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Reopening of The Administrative Record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first petition also requests that the agency reopen the administrative record to receive additional comments on the application of &sect;211.122(g) to items of labeling (other than that of the immediate container label) as defined in section 201(m) of the act. Both citizen petitions contend that final &sect;211.122(g) expanded the proposed scope of the provision from immediate container labels to all drug product labeling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although FDA disagrees with these assertions, it is willing to receive comments on this issue and to evaluate those comments in light of the existing language in &sect;211.122(g). After assessing the comments, FDA will provide notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the agency's decision on whether or not to retain &sect;211.122(g) in its current state. If the agency decides to retain the current provision, compliance will be required on August 3, 1995. FDA notes that the proposed rule is replete with references to ``labeling;'' &sect;211.122(g), in fact, expressly addresses ``packaging and labeling operations.'' FDA notes that it expressly directed its proposal to control a method of printing, gang printing, because the cut labeling that necessarily results from such a method has been implicated in a number of recalls. Moreover, in the proposed rule, FDA announced its intent to ``revise certain  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> labeling <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control provisions. The changes are intended to reduce the frequency of drug product mis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> labeling <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'' (54 FR 26394 (emphasis added)). Immediately following, in the summary of the proposed rule, FDA focused on the practices targeted for control, stating ``The proposal specifies conditions for the use of gang-printed or cut  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> labeling <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ***.'' (54 FR 26394 (emphasis added)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, in the proposal, FDA described the control procedures to be used by `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> labeling <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and packaging'' lines and in proposed &sect;211.122(g)(1), referred to one of the special control features as the ``Dedication of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> labeling <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and packaging lines to each different drug product * * *.'' (54 FR 26394 at 26395 (emphasis added)). Likewise, FDA referred to the second special control feature in proposed &sect;211.122(g)(2), which provides for the ``use of appropriate electronic or electromechanical equipment to conduct a 100-percent examination for correct  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> labeling <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ***'' (54 FR 26394 at 26395 (emphasis added)). Despite such explanations in the proposal, FDA will, nonetheless, accept and review comments addressing the scope of &sect;211.122(g) with respect to its application to labeling, as that term is defined in section 201(m) of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also reiterates its explanation of the terms ``cut labels'' and ``cut labeling'' in the preamble to the final rule: ```Cut labels' and `cut labeling' are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> items of labeling <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that have been detached from printed stock material prior to being brought to a labeling line***'' (58 FR 41348 at 41350 (emphasis added)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This partial extension of the compliance date and limited reopening of the administrative record grant, in essence, the requests of the citizen petitions to have additional time for compliance with one aspect of the final rule, while reserving judgment on the underlying issues pending FDA's receipt and review of any comments. Compliance with the remainder of &sect;211.122, including &sect;211.122(g) as it applies to labels as that term is defined in section 201 of the act, is expected on August 3, 1994. It is important to note, however, that &sect;211.125 makes a waiver of labeling reconciliation conditional on a 100-percent examination for correct labeling performed in accordance with &sect;211.122(g)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may on or before October 4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments on this final rule.

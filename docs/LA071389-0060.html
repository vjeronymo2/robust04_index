			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLY TOUCHDOWN;  </P> <P> THERE'S A FLAG ON THE PLAY, BUT LA CANADA CARTOON MAP'S CREATOR GETS POINT  ACROSS  </P> <P> The statue of an unnamed Christian, hands reaching skyward 85 feet above  Foothill Boulevard, commands the La Canada Flintridge business district with a  gaze of stark piety.  </P> <P> To the less reverent, however, the statue in front of Lutheran Church is known  as the "Holy Touchdown."  </P> <P> "La Canada is just begging to be made fun of," said artist Lee Littler, 18, a  La Canada High School graduate paid $200 to draw an official cartoon map of the  city of 20,000.  </P> <P> The city is distributing 6,000 copies of the 3-foot-long map to libraries and  shopping centers to be used in a coloring contest for children. City officials  and Littler will judge the entries, which must be submitted by Aug. 15. The  winner will receive $100.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Statue Appeared as Referee  </P> <P> But the version of the map the city's children are coloring is not exactly as  Littler conceived it. On the original drawing, now filed in City Hall, Littler  dressed the town's most prominent landmark in a referee's jersey. And his  reference to the statue as the "Holy Touchdown" set off whistles from city  officials.  </P> <P> "We felt that with it being a city project, some of the things didn't belong in  it," said Katy Daunis, coordinator of the project for La Canada Flintridge.  </P> <P> But Littler seems to have done an end run. A close look at the map shows  several pinstripes up and down the garb of the religious figure.  </P> <P> "And the locals will still get it," he said. " 'Church of the Holy Touchdown'  is an affectionate pet name, not an insult."  </P> <P> However, he said of the city's insistence that he change the drawing: "The  censorship was very frustrating."  </P> <P> While admitting that his misspelling of some of the business names on the map  was partially responsible for revisions he was forced to make, he maintained  that some of the changes came about because of "La Canada's preoccupation with  money, which is sometimes healthy and sometimes sickening."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bank Drawn in Larger Scale  </P> <P> In early drafts of the map, not enough of Foothill Boulevard was depicted to  suit city officials, he said. In the final version, a strip of stores and  businesses along Foothill is so detailed that virtually every business is  represented by name. He also noted that he was required to draw the Bank of  America building too large on the map.  </P> <P> "I'd come out of there with white-out all over my hands saying, 'Here, is this  OK?' " he said of meetings with city officials. "They were pretty adamant about  getting all of the businesses in."  </P> <P> On the map, small signs saying only "Residential Area" mark the much larger  portions of the community where people live.  </P> <P> Editing aside, Daunis said the city is happy with the map. She said Littler's  offbeat humor "wasn't difficult to deal with."  </P> <P> And Littler said he is glad to have had the job and hopes it will help him  become a syndicated cartoonist.  </P> <P> La Canada Flintridge decided to commission the cartoon map last fall. Littler  was recommended for the job by Karen Mealiffe, an artist who teaches at La  Canada High. Mealiffe had discovered Littler in a pottery class during his  junior year.  </P> <P> He wasn't doing very well in school, Mealiffe said. He did not respond to  formalized art classes and only wanted to draw, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suddenly Flourished  </P> <P> "High school for me was four years of trying to find acceptance," Littler said.  </P> <P> Mealiffe enrolled the reluctant student in an independent study program where  "he just flourished," she said. "He was just very intelligent, and I don't  think any of his teachers realized it."  </P> <P> Mealiffe said she had no problem recommending Littler for the job, even though  the city is considered staunchly conservative.  </P> <P> "Some kids have wheels and some kids don't. Lee has wheels," she said. "A  person can draw, but if he doesn't have wheels -- ideas -- he won't make it."  </P> <P> Mealiffe, 45, said she empathizes with Littler's struggle against civic  orthodoxy. "An artist doesn't always do what the public wants," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Reformer who is a natural baby-kisser: Contenders line up for next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections A discovery of the Russian election campaign has been that Mr Grigory Yavlinsky is a politician. He is good at the glad hand, the impromptu speech and the ready quip, writes John Lloyd. At his meetings, he works the crowds, senses their mood, plays to it. If baby-kissing were to come into vogue (it is far too cold) he would be good at that, too. He is the only candidate outside the ranks of the government with a reputation both in Russia and outside. His reformist credentials were displayed in market reform plans - co-authored with Mr Stanislav Shatalin in 1990 and produced with a group of Harvard economists in 1991 - which were both shelved by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. Briefly a deputy prime minister after the August 1991 coup, he worked frenziedly to get agreement between the Soviet republics on an economic union. For the past two years, Mr Yavlinsky has run a consulting company, EpiCentre, and kept his name in the public arena. Earlier this year, he was the first to declare that he would stand for the presidency as soon as he could. The party he has formed to fight these elections, called Yabloko (apple) - an acronym of the surnames of the leading candidates' surnames, being Mr Yavlinsky, Mr Yuri Boldyrev and Mr Vladimir Lukin - is presently running second in the polls after Mr Yegor Gaidar's Russia's Choice. He says he is confident of taking a large bloc of seats in the new parliament, but co-operation with Mr Gaidar, he says, will 'depend on Gaidar: he will have to recognise our strength and come to terms with what we stand for'. What Yabloko stands for is a much more active state - but a state dedicated to the creation of a market which renders it quickly redundant, 'by rapidly breaking up monopolies, by the promotion and protection of competition, by careful land reform, by clarifying and regulating property relations and by widening the area of the private sector'. He has advanced a consistent critique of Mr Gaidar's economic programme as being misdirected, by putting financial stabilisation before the development of a competitive market. Freeing a monopolistic economy from state control does not necessarily create a competitive economy, he argues. He himself professes the instincts of a liberal, even a libertarian. 'People must depend on the authorities as little as possible . . . the more they are independent of the state, the stronger is civil society. The stronger civil society, the more secure is life itself.' His strength and weakness is that he is a loner, and something of a prima donna. That has kept him free of alliances and outside government: it will also make it hard for him to compromise if and when he is called on to do so. He is given to high-profile and dramatic interventions - as when he appealed to Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president, to end his self-imposed captivity in the Russian parliament in September - and he is relentlessly self-confident and egotistical. Mr Yavlinsky is in the power-struggle for the long haul: it will be surprising if his period out of power lasts much longer.</p>

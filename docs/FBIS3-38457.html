The decision to  grant him a visa marks a reversal of President Clinton's ruling  last November. Then Mr Adams was refused entry on the grounds  that he was involved in devising IRA strategy at the highest  level -- that as, a terrorist. Since then things have changed.  But an underlying consistency can nevertheless be discerned.    For a start, the visit takes place under tight constraints.  Mr Adams is in New York to attend a conference on Northern  Ireland organised by the National Committee on American Foreign  Policy, whose honorary chairman is the former U.S. Secretary of  State Henry Kissinger. (The other sides in the Ulster conflict  have also been invited, although Unionist politicians have  refused to attend.) Mr Adams is not allowed to engage in  fundraising and he is barred from travelling more than 25 miles  from New York.    While the Sinn Fein president no doubt hopes to persuade the  Irish-American lobby to put pressure on the Clinton  Administration to intervene on behalf of the republican cause,  pressure can also work the other way. A conference such as the  present one provides a prime opportunity for interested American  parties to make clear to Mr Adams that present developments  provide a chance for peace which should not be wasted. Mr  Clinton's original plan to send a peace envoy to the province  was rapidly watered down after the presidential elections in the  face of resistance from the British Government. The permission  for Mr Adams to attend the New York conference may be a sign  that Washington is adopting a more subtle approach. Last  November the speaker of the House of Representatives, Tom Foley,  noted that Sinn Fein could be part of constitutional talks if  there was a genuine and convincing repudiation of paramilitary  violence. It is a message which must be repeated to Mr Adams.  He is seen now as a possible instrument for peace -- but he  must also be reminded that he is an obstacle to it as well.    The Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneux boasted in his  interview with THE SCOTSMAN that he had succeeded in removing  all the meat from the Downing Street declaration. If that claim  is to be gainsayed, the U.S. may have to lean on Mr Major and  persuade him to begin turning the sentiments expressed in the  document into reality: Their task will be made that much easier  if they have first gained concessions from Adams.</p>

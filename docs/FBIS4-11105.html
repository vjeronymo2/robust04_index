			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to El Salvador presidential  run-off elections scheduled for 24 April 1994.    Armando Calderon Sol, Nationalist Republican Alliance,  ARENA,  candidate for president, said on 16 April that, if he comes out  the winner in the elections, he will combat government  corruption even more strongly than Alfredo Cristiani's  administration. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish  0300 GMT 16 Apr 94)    Reacting to Ruben Zamora, candidate for president for a  coalition of three leftist parties who said Calderon Sol's  eventual election victory would be "very dangerous," the ARENA  candidate on 19 April asserted that he will comply with the  pending peace agreements because they "are a national commitment  and must be complied with to consolidate a true state of law."

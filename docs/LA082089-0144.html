			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AVALON'S CURE FOR ITS GROWING PAINS;  </P> <P> 15-YEAR REDEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD CHANGE MUCH OF TOWN THAT'S BURSTING AT THE  SEAMS  </P> <P> By boat, the view approaching Avalon presents a trio of vivid images, each  rising from the morning mists like a post card come to life.  </P> <P> First, the Hamilton Cove condominiums, tier upon tier of gleaming white  buildings hewn into a hillside of the rugged Santa Catalina Island terrain.  </P> <P> Then, the landmark Casino Ballroom, a round, domed Art Deco structure, perched  on a showy vantage point of land jutting into the blue Pacific.  </P> <P> Finally, rounding the curve into Avalon Bay, the town itself, exuding Old World  charm and a Mediterranean-like ambience. Picturesque houses with red-tiled  roofs line the steep, winding streets, overlooking a white sand beach and the  boat-filled harbor.  </P> <P> Even ashore, Avalon lives up to its idyllic image.  </P> <P> It is a town where many residents are on a first-name basis, where townspeople  pick up their mail at the post office because there are too few residents to  justify the expense of home mail delivery, and where locals often can recite  their post office box numbers more readily than their street addresses.  </P> <P> Crescent Avenue, a pedestrian mall of souvenir shops and restaurants with  quaint names like Buoys and Gulls and the Busy Bee, retains a small-town  flavor, though year-round residents tend to avoid it in summer months because  of the throngs of tourists.  </P> <P> But even in picture-perfect Avalon, there are problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Room for Improvements  </P> <P> In surveys conducted over the last year by the Santa Catalina Island Co.,  residents and visitors alike identified a number of ways that life in Avalon  could be improved.  </P> <P> Basically, the city of about 2,500 is bursting at the seams.  </P> <P> Avalon suffers from a shortage of housing for permanent residents, and would-be  workers in the year-round tourist industry often have trouble finding a place  to live.  </P> <P> Traffic congestion and a shortage of parking space are critical issues. Even  though many residents tool around the hilly streets in space-saving golf carts,  and the city strictly limits the numbers of cars and other vehicles, summer  traffic often collects in a bottleneck at downtown intersections.  </P> <P> For residents, tourism is both an economic boon and a hindrance to day-to-day  life. As many as 15,000 tourists from "overtown," as the mainland is called,  flood the 1.25-square-mile town daily, providing lucrative profits for Avalon  merchants but straining the town's already taxed freshwater resources, streets  and sewer system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tourist Headaches  </P> <P> Twice weekly, the tourist tide swells when cruise ships are moored offshore and  hundreds of vacationers are ferried to the Pleasure Pier for a few hurried  hours of sightseeing.  </P> <P> Longtime Avalon resident John W. R. Windle, who arrived on the island as a  6-year-old in 1910, reveres Avalon's small-town charms but says the city's  growth and its increasing popularity as a year-round tourist attraction cause  headaches for permanent residents.  </P> <P> "Some things need fixing, there's no doubt about it," said Windle, 85. "And  it's getting more commercial, it really is. Sometimes I get to feel like a  stranger in my own town."  </P> <P> To ease the problems, officials at the Santa Catalina Island Co., which owns  much of the land in Avalon, have unveiled a sweeping, 15-year plan aimed at  redeveloping much of the town in three-year phases.  </P> <P> The plan -- still at a conceptual stage -- is intended to address some of the  most pressing issues facing Avalon, including lack of year-round housing and a  water supply so limited that salt water is used to flush toilets and to douse  fires.  </P> <P> The plan proposes new moderate-cost apartments and homes for year-round  residents; a new transportation center to consolidate ticket-buying and other  travel functions now spread out over the town; a desalination plant; three new  hotels with a total of about 200 new rooms, and a general sprucing up of  Avalon's streets and parks.  </P> <P> Island officials are uncertain how much it will cost to implement the plan and  how any future development costs will be divided among the Island Co., the city  and private developers. A desalination plant alone will cost $3 million,  officials estimate.  </P> <P> Many residents, although acknowledging that the changes are overdue, say they  want to preserve Avalon's small-town quality.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought in 1919  </P> <P> Therein, Island Co. officials say, lies a major dilemma: how to upgrade Avalon  without altering its charm.  </P> <P> "Avalon's now 75 years old, and a lot of the things that were convenient and  appropriate 75 years ago are no longer convenient and appropriate," said Island  Co. Vice President Ron Doutt. "They are, as a matter of fact, contributing to  these problems."  </P> <P> Santa Catalina Island was purchased in 1919 by the family of chewing gum  magnate William Wrigley Jr. through the Island Co. The company now owns about  two-thirds of the land in Avalon and about 20% of the city's buildings. In  1975, the company deeded about 86% of the island to the nonprofit Catalina  Conservancy, which maintains the pristine interior.  </P> <P> Some of Avalon's buildings date from the early part of the century. City Hall,  for example, a wood frame, stucco-covered structure built into a steep  hillside, was constructed around 1917.  </P> <P> The cramped council chambers, with green, plastic-covered benches, hold a  maximum of 36 people. If a large turnout is expected at a council meeting, the  location is switched to the school auditorium.  </P> <P> Elsewhere at City Hall, office space is so limited that some city workers share  desks in the council chambers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Facilities in 3 Buildings  </P> <P> City Manager Chuck Prince said the city "has facilities strung out over three  buildings." Offices for the city clerk and the city manager, for example, are  about a block apart.  </P> <P> "If any of those locations were sufficient, that would be great," Prince said.  "But they're not. They're old, accessibility's difficult, and there's no  meeting space. If more than three people want to get together, generally they  have to borrow space from a local bank."  </P> <P> Space is at an even greater premium at the Avalon fire station, just across  from City Hall on Metropole Avenue.  </P> <P> "Oh, it's unbelievable," said Fire Chief Jack Goslin. "We don't even have a  ramp to pull out the trucks and work on them." During daily maintenance checks,  the trucks must be pulled out onto Metropole, partially blocking the  thoroughfare, he said.  </P> <P> Other problems at the station include a leaky roof and living quarters crammed  into a converted garage under City Hall -- a space about 12 by 22 feet, shared  by two on-duty firefighters. When an alarm sounds, firefighters must dash  across the street to get to the fire trucks, Goslin said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fumes in Sleeping Quarters  </P> <P> "Right next door to (the living quarters) is where the ambulance is," Goslin  said. "When you start that up, all the fumes come in to where they sleep."  </P> <P> A new fire station -- proposed for a site on Avalon Canyon Road near the school  and Avalon Municipal Hospital -- could provide training and classroom space for  the department's 25 volunteer firefighters, Goslin said. Also, the proposed  site is more level than the present one, allowing easier access to Avalon's  main streets, he said.  </P> <P> "I would love to see it done," Goslin said.  </P> <P> A few residents have expressed dismay that the plans will take 15 years to  complete. "It's not fast enough," one resident wrote on an Island Co. survey.  </P> <P> But Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith called the plan "workable and doable" and said he  supports the Island Co.'s plan to proceed "a step at a time."  </P> <P> Island Co. officials say developing the project over 15 years will minimize  disruption to Avalon's tourists and residents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Massive Plans  </P> <P> Another reason for developing over a long term, officials said, is because the  plans are so massive. The plans call for:  </P> <P> Construction of 50 units of housing a year over 15 years. The additional  housing is planned for three locations: Las Casitas, the site of a former  bungalow-style hotel where the Chicago Cubs held spring training until 1951,  now used for housing of Island Co. employees; Bird Park Canyon, the site of a  former aviary, once the home of a private collection of exotic birds, and Quail  Canyon, on the outskirts of Avalon.  </P> <P> Construction of a civic center, including a new City Hall, fire station and  day-care facilities for children, to be built on part of the seven-acre Las  Casitas site.  </P> <P> While the new housing is being built, a desalination plant will be under  construction near the Southern California Edison power plant on Pebbly Beach  Road to provide a source of fresh water for new homes and apartments.  </P> <P> Three new hotels, including a high-quality hotel and public-access beach at  Descanso Bay, a 16-acre site between the Casino Ballroom and the Hamilton Cove  condominium development. A second hotel would be built near a city park at the  west end of Crescent Avenue, the town's main street. Also, the Atwater Hotel  would be razed and a new hotel built on the site.  </P> <P> A plan that would make land owned by the Island Co. available for lease and  eventual purchase by permanent residents to build single-family homes. Island  officials said the plan is new and that they are still unsure how it will work.  </P> <P> A central commercial area for residents, to include a new 15,000-square-foot  grocery store and a new post office, providing a location for residents to shop  and check their mail away from the onslaught of visitors on tourist-crammed  Crescent Avenue. Nearby would be a "transportation hub," where tourists would  validate cross-channel transportation tickets, check in baggage and purchase  tickets for tours into the interior. Such arrangements are now done at various  locations, including Cabrillo Mole on Pebbly Beach Road and the Island Plaza on  Sumner Avenue.  </P> <P> Reducing traffic by relocating many service-oriented businesses away from  tourist areas.  </P> <P> General sprucing up of the city's parks, possibly adding landscaping along  Sumner and Metropole avenues, based on the same architectural theme as the  pedestrian mall on Crescent Avenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $8-Million Annual Budget  </P> <P> Island Co. officials said it is difficult to estimate how much the new  developments could bring the city in revenue from hotel and business taxes, but  one official ventured a rough estimate of $1.7 million annually, when all the  projects are completed. Avalon's current annual budget is about $8 million.  </P> <P> Some aspects of the plan have been in the works for at least 20 years, said  lifelong Avalon resident Malcolm Renton, a retired vice president of the Island  Co. For example, building a grand hotel at Descanso Beach has been the  company's goal since the St. Catherine Hotel, an elegant structure where  Hollywood stars including Clark Gable, Mary Pickford and Cecil B. De Mille once  stayed, was razed in 1966.  </P> <P> "The plan was always to keep that a choice hotel location," said Renton, 81,  whose father also worked for the Island Co.  </P> <P> In June, the Island Co. presented conceptual plans to residents at a town  meeting, and reaction was mostly favorable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 41% Approved Unconditionally  </P> <P> Of 67 residents who responded to an Island Co. survey after the presentation,  25 residents, or about 41%, unconditionally approved the overall concept. Only  two residents didn't like the plan. More meetings are planned over the coming  year.  </P> <P> In interviews, residents seem confident that the plan will succeed.  </P> <P> "It's a beautiful setup," said Lolo Saldana, owner of Lolo's Plaza Barber Shop  on Sumner Avenue.  </P> <P> "I'm absolutely impressed with it," said Lita Mulvihill, an Avalon resident for  17 years, who said the plan "is renovating and restoring and bringing things  back to life that used to be, like the old St. Catherine."  </P> <P> Wayne Griffin, executive director of the Catalina Chamber of Commerce, said the  chamber is unlikely to take a formal position on the Island Co. plans. But  Griffin said he approves of the plans and the Island Co.'s solicitation of  response from the town.  </P> <P> "I thought it was great," Griffin said. "They're being very up front about what  they're doing and asking people what they think. It's refreshing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Due for an Uplift'  </P> <P> Patricia Moore, director and curator of the Catalina Island Museum, said the  timing couldn't be better. "I think our town needs to take a good hard look at  ourselves because we're outgrowing ourselves," she said. "I think we're due for  an uplift."  </P> <P> Bringing off the development plan hinges largely on one crucial element: water.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we can't build any of these projects without water," said island  spokesman Doutt. "We've reached our maximum at this time."  </P> <P> Currently, Southern California Edison supplies Catalina consumers with about  300,000 gallons of fresh water daily during the winter and more than a million  gallons during the summer, officials said. The island's main freshwater source  is Middle Ranch Reservoir in the interior, which collects rainwater.  </P> <P> The reservoir, which has an 1,143 acre-foot capacity, is currently at about 635  acre-feet, said Keith LeFever, Edison district manager for Catalina. An  acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons.  </P> <P> When the water supply drops to 600 acre-feet -- which could happen in  mid-September, according to LeFever -- water restrictions will be imposed,  including restricting the use of water for washing streets, cars and boats and  watering lawns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flash Distillation  </P> <P> To get enough water to carry out their development plans, island officials hope  to use a desalination method known as flash distillation, which involves  condensing seawater to remove the salt, company spokesman Doutt said.  </P> <P> A feasibility study of a desalination plant, commissioned by the Island Co., is  about 90% completed, LeFever said.  </P> <P> "What we're doing right now is reviewing the different desalination  alternatives to determine what will be the most cost-effective for them to  pursue," LeFever said.  </P> <P> Another desalination plant, using reverse osmosis technology to filter  impurities from the water, is scheduled for construction at Hamilton Cove  within the next year, LeFever said.  </P> <P> For some residents, a more immediate problem is housing -- or the lack of it.  </P> <P> Avalon officials have attempted to alleviate the problem with such measures as  a 1981 city ordinance requiring new hotel developers to provide housing for 50%  of the people they employ during the peak summer season, and residential  developers to make 20% of their units available for low- and moderate-income  housing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Obstacle  </P> <P> Still, finding an apartment remains a major obstacle for would-be islanders.  </P> <P> "Essentially, the (rental) vacancy rate is zero," City Manager Prince said.  </P> <P> "Every year the situation gets worse," said five-year resident Ann Marshall.  Residents who find a job in Avalon but can't find a place to live soon  discover, Marshall said, that "you don't always get a warm welcome when you  come to Catalina."  </P> <P> The housing shortage is so severe, said Marshall, that "some people read the  obits to see who died, just to see what apartment is coming up."  </P> <P> Recalling her own difficulties finding housing when she moved to Avalon,  Marshall who is the city's director of community services, said she "bends over  backward" to help new city employees in search of housing, sometimes letting  them stay at her two-bedroom apartment for a few days, sleeping on the sofa or  camping out on the floor.  </P> <P> Mulvihill, who owns a women's clothing store, said many business owners --  herself included -- work short-handed during the busy summer season because  potential employees can't find housing.  </P> <P> "All of us have just suffered," Mulvihill said. "We don't have a choice of  employees. We don't have young people coming (to work) in the summer like we  used to, the college kids. There's no place for them to live."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Daily Visits to Post Office  </P> <P> The Post Office Arcade is another point of concern for some residents. Because  mail is not delivered to homes, a daily visit to the Post Office Arcade is a  necessity -- and often a pleasure -- of life in Avalon.  </P> <P> A few residents want it to stay where it is.  </P> <P> "At the moment, I don't think there's a necessity for moving it and a lot of  people don't that I talk to," said longtime resident Windle.  </P> <P> But others, including postmaster Lydia Saldana, are ready for a bigger, better  postal facility. The present building dates from the 1920s.  </P> <P> "Definitely we need a new post office," Saldana said. "This one's a little old,  and with the planned growth we'll need a few more boxes." About 1,800 of the  facility's 2,000 boxes are currently rented, she said.  </P> <P> Island Co. official Doutt said the old post office building -- part of the  Atwater Hotel complex -- will be demolished in the last phase of the plan, but  that the company hopes to recapture some of its flavor in the architectural  design of the new postal facility and commercial complex.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Small-Town Feel'  </P> <P> "We want to preserve the feel of the arcade," Doutt said. "You go in there and  you buy your PTA raffle tickets and you buy your Girl Scout cookies and you  socialize and get your mail and get caught up on how families are. It's really  a neat small-town feel."  </P> <P> The new post office arcade will be located near the new grocery store and other  service-oriented businesses, officials said.  </P> <P> Some residents questioned how much the plan will cost and who will pay for  what.  </P> <P> "Can the city afford it?" one anonymous resident asked on the survey.  </P> <P> "I have no idea what all of this would cost," said island spokesman Doutt.  "We're not even close to breaking ground on any of this."  </P> <P> City Manager Prince said a new City Hall "is going to require substantial  (financial) commitment from the city. Today, we don't have the financial  resources. . . . Three to five years down the road, we may."  </P> <P> One option, Prince said, is seeking voter approval for a general obligation  bond to finance a new City Hall. The City Hall site -- which is owned by the  city -- itself presents another option: The building sits on valuable  commercial property that could be sold to help finance the cost of a new  building on a less expensive site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Historical Value Cited  </P> <P> How the City Hall building will be used after a new one is constructed remains  undecided, Mayor Smith said. Many residents may want to keep the building  intact because "there's a lot of historical value associated with the present  City Hall," he said.  </P> <P> City officials have held preliminary discussions with the Island Co. and hope  to have worked out a development agreement by the fall of 1990, Prince said.  </P> <P> "It would be a long, far-reaching document," Prince said, "but probably the  best way to deal with this would be in a long development agreement that  undoubtedly . . . would be amended many times" over time.  </P> <P> The city's role in that process would remain unchanged whether the individual  projects are done by the Island Co. or independent developers, Prince said.  </P> <P> "The process is the same with respect to evaluation of the project and making  sure it conforms to Coastal Commission requirements and (city) planning  ordinances," Prince said.  </P> <P> Island Co. President Paxson (Packy) Offield said the plan "is going to have to  be reviewed in an environmental impact study, (and) impacts to the  infrastructure will have to be addressed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Development in Phases  </P> <P> Once a development agreement is reached, island officials envision a phased  plan that, during the first three years, would see construction begin on  employee housing and the desalination plant, land would be made available for  lease purchase, and construction of the hotel at Descanso Beach would begin.  </P> <P> The construction of a new City Hall, fire department, more employee housing and  more hotels would begin in later phases.  </P> <P> In light of the island company's ambitious plans, optimism for Avalon's future  is running high among townspeople.  </P> <P> "I'm delighted that they're looking at their property from the point of view of  how we all can benefit," said museum curator Patricia Moore. "It will certainly  change the town, but generally speaking, I think it will change it for the  better."  </P> <P> In the meantime, islanders say, the pleasures of life in Avalon more than make  up for any shortcomings.  </P> <P> "I can't think of a better place to live and work, and, if you're going to have  problems, to have them," said Mulvihill. "I'm sure there are very few places  like Avalon. Our world is wonderful over here."  </P></p>

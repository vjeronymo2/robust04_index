			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LASZLO &amp; GARY PUT PARODY TO MUSIC  </P> <P> Instead of dropping coins into a jukebox at their booth, a duo who parody  Top-40 songs can create their own tunes at a Sherman Oaks '50s-style diner.  </P> <P> " 'Duke of Earl' could be 'Quart of Oil,' " says Gary Kleinman, 36, who looks  like a skinny version of actor Ted Danson.  </P> <P> " 'Dream Lover' would be 'No Such Thing,' " says Kleinman's partner in parody,  Charles Laszlo, "and 'Chantilly Lace' could be 'I Lost the Race,' for the L.A.  Marathon."  </P> <P> Laszlo &amp; Gary, who became known for their parodies in 1985 with  "Su-Sushi-O," a takeoff on Phil Collins' "Sussudio," are anticipating another  hit during National Secretary's Week, which begins Monday. "My Boss Is Lazy," a  parody of the Fine Young Cannibals' song "She Drives Me Crazy," is being  considered for morning-drive play on local contemporary and rock music stations  such as KQLZ-FM (100.3). The parody already has aired on KLSX-FM's (97.1) "The  Dr. Demento Show," as well as that show's nationally syndicated version.  Between gulps of a chocolate malt, Laszlo, a 36-year-old Reseda resident with  the rapid-fire wit of a teen-age class clown, explains the plight of morning  drivers. "People drive and think, 'I've only got 26 years, eight months and  three days before retirement, I've got to pay electric bills, etc.' We want  people to laugh instead."  </P> <P> "Everyone can identify with this song," adds Gary, who lives in Canoga Park. "I  don't care how high up the ladder you are, you think you have a boss that is  lazy."  </P> <P> The song features hapless employee Doodlesby, whose voice reminds one of Radar  O'Reilly, talking with his employer, Mr. Calhoun. The belligerent boss demands  that Doodlesby work out for him as well as fax his briefcase. Lyrics include:  "He's a lazy dweeb/ He wrote the book/ He needs two desks/ One for his foot."  </P> <P> Dr. Demento, a.k.a. Barry Hansen, praised the song and its creators. "It's a  good song, and the response to it has been good," he said. "I put Laszlo &amp;  Gary in the class of professional jobs. I get all kinds of songs sent to me,  like people who just sing along with Michael Jackson."  </P> <P> Laszlo &amp; Gary record all parodies from scratch, rather than recording over  someone else's music, which is why "My Boss Is Lazy" took about 50 hours  instead of about four to produce. They write their pieces together. Laszlo  performs the character voices, and Gary handles the music and singing voices.  Occasionally, putting together parodies drives them to extremes.  </P> <P> "One Sunday, we were doing a parody and needed the sound of a Mack truck," Gary  says. "We needed the sound effect by Monday morning. We followed a Mack truck  for 90 minutes down the freeway, trying to get him to blow his horn. He finally  did it."  </P> <P> The two got together in 1978 when Detroit-native Laszlo -- who majored in  radio, TV and film production at Wayne State University -- answered an ad Gary  placed in a magazine. He moved west to create a radio commercial with Gary, who  earned a bachelor's degree in finance from Cal State Northridge in 1974. They  wrote radio jingles and performed as stand-up comics until 1985, when they  decided to concentrate solely on song parodies. Since radio stations do not pay  them for their work, they also have day jobs.  </P> <P> "We won't tell you what they are," Laszlo says. "But we're either waiters or  corporate executives."  </P> <P> The key to a successful parody, both agree, is an excessive familiarity with a  popular song. "It should be a hit record that stations have played almost too  much," Gary says. "Listeners can sing the lyrics, and then you hit them with  something funny."  </P> <P> Laszlo &amp; Gary are preparing their first record album, which will combine  parodies of popular songs with original creations. "We'd never do an album of  all originals," Gary says. "They'd have to be exceptionally funny, since they  aren't familiar." Gary says that three small pop/rock/urban record companies  are interested in making the album.  </P> <P> One song scheduled to be included, "I'm a Sensitive '90s Guy," a pop takeoff of  Christine Lavin's "Sensitive New Age Guys," parodies the touchy-feely crystal  age. "I like to cry at weddings/I think Rambo is upsetting," the song broods.  </P> <P> And once they exhaust Top-40 songs and their original ideas, what will Laszlo  &amp; Gary parody? "Probably marching bands and sound effects," Gary says.  </P> <P> But his partner has other ideas. "Sports fishermen and parodies with  subtitles," says Laszlo.  </P></p>

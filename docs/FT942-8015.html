			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Indian delays Travellers in India are likely to suffer delays and cancellations of flights on Indian Airlines, the main domestic carrier, because of industrial action by the airline's flight engineers, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. The engineers, who started their work-to-rule a week ago, are demanding improvements in their pay and conditions on the state-owned airline. They claim they have fallen behind their counterparts working for India's newly-launched private airlines. Travellers are advised to change their reservations to the private airlines wherever possible.</p>

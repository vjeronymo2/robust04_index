			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Accountants scorn takeover standard: Principles 'destroyed', says Hundred Group The Accounting Standards Board was accused yesterday of 'destroying' one of the basic principles of accounting after it issued two new standards covering acquisitions and mergers. The ASB, which decides how financial information is presented in the UK, said the new rules 'call for a more objective, neutral and informative approach' in accounting for business combinations. The board said the new codes were designed to restrict the use of merger accounting and outlaw abuses in the reporting of acquisitions which became notorious during the climate of creative accounting in the late 1980s. But the Hundred Group, which consists of the finance directors of companies in the FT-SE 100 share index, described parts of the new standard on acquisitions as 'completely illogical'. Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief financial officer with Reed Elsevier and chairman of the Hundred Group, said the standard 'destroys one of the basic principles of accounting under which capital and revenue costs are kept separate'. The group calls for abuses to be dealt with by tightening existing accounting standards and 'proper policing' by auditors 'not by distorting basic accounting concepts'. The dispute between the Hundred Group and the ASB marks the first open disagreement between the standard-setters and industry since the board was set up in 1990. In addition, the standard on acquisitions was passed by a majority on the ASB of 7-1, marking only the second dissenting vote in its history. Mr Donald Main, a director of Forte, dissented from the majority view. He said he agreed with many aspects of FRS 7 but hoped it would be reviewed after a full debate on the general principles of accounting. Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, said: 'The new standards favour neither one side nor the other . . . and I believe that they will restore much needed credibility in the reporting of acquisitions.' Sir David said most professional accountancy bodies, auditors and financial institutions had backed the standard. Reaction from companies had been 3-1 against. The ASB's new standards, known as FRS (financial reporting standard) 6 and 7, are designed to stop the improper use of merger accounting to enhance earnings and to curb the abuse of pre-acquisition provisions. FRS 7 is designed to limit the costs that a company can meet through setting up a reserve on its balance sheet when it buys another company. In the past such devices have been used to stop costs appearing on the profit-and-loss account and so boost headline profits. The new standards will start next year and would normally not be reviewed for two to three years. Curbing creativity, Page 12 Editorial Comment, Page 23 Lex, Page 24</p>

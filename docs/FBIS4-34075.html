			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Press conference by Marcel Laniado, president of the </F> National Modernization Council; place and date not given]    [Text] "We are not going to fall into the trap of  reorganizing social security. That is not the wise thing. The  people of Ecuador need an answer," Marcel Laniado, the president  of the National Modernization Council (CONAM), has said.    Laniado has announced radical changes in this sector so that  those insured "will have basic choices, with guaranteed future  pensions and medical care for themselves and their families when  they are ill."    In a lengthy discussion with the publishers, editors, and  reporters of HOY, Laniado defined the six major priorities in  the launching of the reorganization in the state sector. They  pertain to social security, telecommunications, airports,  customs, the Civil Registry, and maritime ports.    At the same time, he announced that both public and private  activity will be demonopolized. To this end, a code is being  drafted to provide these two sectors with a body that will  provide them with adequate service and will denounce any  irregularities or abuses.  <H5>  The Six Priorities </H5>   -- Emphasizing the social security issue, the president of  the CONAM indicated that the accusations made about the quality  of care in social security indicate that those who are managing  this sector do not value life.    "What social security has done to us is unforgivable. The  workers are contributing 23 percent, but they are not receiving  any benefits. Even the widows cannot obtain aid funds promptly,"  he stressed.    After noting that the social security institution is totally  disorganized and has had no accounting system for the past 10  years, Laniado announced that plans have been made to establish  a parallel system. With this system, the members will know what  is guaranteed them, how much they will receive per month, where  they and their families can go for medical care, how much it  will cost them, and what they will be able to save for their  retirement.    He said, the system is not so simple, however. This is  because it requires a decision on the part of the insured party  as to where he wants to deposit his funds, his contributions, in  order to obtain the best guarantees and insurance. "I do not  know if a project like this can be launched in just two, three,  or four months."    -- On the telecommunications issue, the president of the  CONAM said the entity in charge of this sector is one of the  most backward. "This is a corrupt sector, as a result of  tremendous disorganization. We do not have adequate technology,  and there is an insufficient number of lines."    With a view to structural change, finding the best possible  solutions, and putting the chaos behind us, bids will be  solicited from consulting firms. Concessions for providing  services will be granted to international enterprises, and they  will bring in new capital and technology.    Laniado hopes that this will enable Ecuador to enter the  world of technology and telecommunications within a short time.    For the modernization and management of the airports in  Quito  and Guayaquil, similar bids will be solicited, and specialized  firms will execute this project in association with domestic  groups, using the current infrastructure. "Glorified projects  are not required in order to provide decent service," this  official emphasized.    Maritime port services will also be given concessions. What  is wanted is for the vessels to have "an adequate system, one  that is not corrupt, as is the case now."    According to the president of the CONAM, the ports in  Ecuador, and that in Guayaquil, in particular, are not  competitive with the ports in the neighboring countries. The  vessels arriving at ports in Ecuador face fees that are higher  than normal. "There is theft, carelessness, and delay in  unloading goods."    "There will be a veritable shakeup in the customs service so  as to change the current smuggling system, which is one of the  speediest paths to illegal enrichment."    Marcel Laniado announced that four internationally known  enterprises established in the country will be responsible for  certifying the invoicing of all the products imported into  Ecuador. Each importer will be able to sign a contract with one  of these enterprises, which will be paid one percent of the  total value of the goods imported.    The importer's invoice will have to show certification by  this firm, which will calculate the taxes and pay the amount  owed into any bank.    This mechanism will eliminate import permits, as well as the  22 steps that must currently be completed in order to effect an  import. At the same time, it will make it possible for the  release of goods from customs within four hours of their arrival  in the country.    The president of the CONAM warned that any irregularities  for  which the importer is responsible will entail serious criminal  penalties. At the same time, the customs appraisers and  assessors, and any possibility of bribery, will be eliminated.  "This is a way of making the system honest. The country will  benefit from the income generated by the customs duties  collected on imported goods."    The same procedure will be applied for exports.    Prior to the reorganization of the Civil Registry structure,  a study was undertaken. Now complete, the study reveals the  critical situation in this sector.    Laniado announced that as of 31 May, a call for bids will be  issued, after which certain enterprises will be allowed to  manage the issuance of identity cards and other certificates on  a concession basis.    It is possible that notaries will continue to provide the  certified copies of birth and marriage certificates. To this  end, standard offices managed by businessmen interested in  providing this service will be established.    This, however, will entail an increase in the fee paid from  the laughable sum of five sucres currently being charged for a  birth certificate to some 5,000 or 6,000 sucres.    The system will be automated so as to make it possible for  citizens to obtain identity cards in any part of the country.    The computer center will be located in Quito, and it will  have three sections, with their respective officials -- the  Civil Registry, the Supreme Electoral Board, and an  internationally qualified auditing department.  <H5>  Defining Modernization </H5>   The concepts of modernization and privatization are being  confused, Marcel Laniado, the head of the CONAM, says. Most  people think that modernization means privatization.    He said what is to be privatized is all of the enterprises  that fail to serve a social function, and those in which the  state has no involvement -- the cement enterprises, for example.  This would involve initiating the disinvestment process, which  is being pursued by the National Financing Corporation (CFN) and  the National Development Bank. The state is selling all of its  shares in the enterprises in whose activities it has no  involvement.    Where the other sectors are concerned, this official  emphasized that their activities will be parceled out on a  concession basis. For example, the Paute hydroelectric plant  will not be sold, but will be entrusted as a concession to an  enterprise that will manage it and guarantee its maintenance.    Similar steps will be taken in the communications, oil,  airport, and other sectors.    Laniado explained that modernization does not in any way  mean  unemployment. When efficient private enterprises take the  responsibility for providing services, these services will  expand, and more manpower will therefore be needed. In the  telephone sector, for example, a larger number of lines will be  made available, and the number of workers needed to install them  will increase.    In Laniado's opinion, the private sector could offer better  service and management than the state institutions, which have  no channels for filing claims.    According to this official, there is talk of modernization  in  the country because there is backwardness in every respect. The  lag does not just exist in comparison to other industrialized  countries, but in comparison to the country's neighbors, as well.    "Our educational system is disastrously behind the times. It  cannot even be compared with the educational systems in other  parts of Latin America. Thus the situation needs to be changed,"  he explained.    There is also a lag in the technology sector, but the  problem  here can be resolved more quickly with the influx of foreign  investment the country is expecting, which will be accompanied  by technological renewal.</p>

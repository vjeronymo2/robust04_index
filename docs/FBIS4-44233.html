			<p>BFN     [Text] Lefkosa [Nicosia], June 27 (AA) -- Turkish Republic  of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] President Rauf Denktas said today that  a federal solution in Cyprus is not possible any more.    He said that the U.N. Security Council was making a great  error and bringing the two communities together by a superficial  agreement would lead to an `inevitable disaster.'    He was welcoming a delegation of 30 journalists in his  office  at the TRNC capital.    He recalled that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis, in  his speeches to the world, spoke as if they were the sole and  legal government of Cyprus.    `This shows that we are just losing time,' Denktas said.    `We have arrived at a turning point and we are obliged to  make an evaluation of the situation, together with Turkey,' he  said.    Denktas also recalled that former Cyprus envoy of the U.N.  secretary-general, Hugo Gobi had also said that if the two  communities are forced to come together under a federation,  Cyprus would to be another Bosnia-Herzegovina.    `The Security Council is trying to bring together, by  superficial means, the two communities, on an island which has  been in peace for 20 years,' he said.</p>

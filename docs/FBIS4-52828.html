			<p>BFN     [Text] An international monetary source on 12 May disclosed  that the financial and monetary authorities of Japan, the United  States, and European nations are basing their actions in  coordinating policies on interest rates and intervention in  currency markets on a secret agreement made at a meeting of  finance ministers and presidents of central banks of the seven  industrialized nations (G-7) on 24 April. The source said that  the G-7 nations, with the strong U.S. request in mind, agreed  that to prevent confusion in the world monetary and securities  markets caused by a possible slump in the dollar, it is  necessary to keep the dollar's international value from sliding.  It is unprecedented in recent years for the G-7 to take  coordinated action on currency markets and interest rates, and  in the meeting, the G-7 nations confirmed their intention to  tighten their unity to promote the stabilization and growth of  the world economy.    Concerning currency markets, they agreed to intermittently  intervene in currency markets to buy the dollar and sell the yen  so that the dollar's exchange rate against the yen will not  break 100 yen. On interest rates, the G-7 agreed that European  nations--including Germany, which is required to lower interest  rates--will cut interest rates; that Japan, whose official  discount rate is the lowest it has ever been, will induce  financial organs to lower short-term interest rates; and that  the United States will allay concerns about possible inflation  by inducing lower interest rates and cutting the discount rate  and apply the breaks to an upward tendency in long-tern interest  rates.    In this way, the current monetary policies of Japan, the  United States, and European nations reflect the agreement  explained above, and there is a growing view that the G-7 states  have tided over the dollar crisis for the time being.    On 24 April, a chairman's statement was issued, although it  was not issued at the past two meetings of G-7 finance  ministers. The source said that the release of the statement  reflects the G-7's positions.    At the G-7 meeting of finance ministers in April,  discussions  focused on the fact that the exchange rate of the dollar is  falling not only against the yen but also against European  currencies such as the German mark.    The source said that at the meeting, finance ministers and  presidents of central banks expressed strong concern about the  downward trend of the dollar's exchange rate because there is a  possibility that if this trend should develop into a slump in  the value of the dollar, this will lead to a worldwide drop in  stock prices, thus having a harmful impact on the overall world  economy.</p>

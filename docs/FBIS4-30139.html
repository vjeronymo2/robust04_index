			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Key Tech Center Reports </F> Japan-U.S. Cooperation Essential for Development of  Next-Generation Telecommunication Satellites"]    [Text] The Japan Key Technology Center, a special  corporation chartered by the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and  chaired by Gaishi Hiraiwa, recently completed a report titled,  "Survey Concerning Next-Generation Intelligent Satellite  Technology." The report suggests there will be an increased  demand for services via "intelligent satellites" capable of  high-level communication functions as a result of rapid  expansion in the use of multimedia and cellular telephones. It  recommendsefforts toward developing essential technology under  an international cooperative effort between Japan, the United  States, and Europe.    The report predicts that the early 21st century will witness  fixed stations on earth that are linked by high-volume  communication optical fiber cable networks, and a much higher  level of importance for communication satellites because of a  rapid expansion of demand for cellular telephones, personal  communication systems and multimedia. It also suggests the need  to develop multifunctional satellites capable of handling image  transmissions for multimedia and cellular phone services.    The report analyzes that the key to development of  "intelligent satellites" with such capabilities will involve 1)  Technology to operate repeaters at a low voltage; 2) Technology  to transmit and process image signals efficiently, and 3)  Standardization and mass production of parts. The report also  covers the importance of launching many low-orbiting satellites  to build a network. The report also stresses the need for  international coordination among advanced nations to promote  standardization and the effective use of satellites, although  that Japan, the United States, and Europe currently are  developing next-generation communication satellites  independently.</p>

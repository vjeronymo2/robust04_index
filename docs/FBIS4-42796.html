			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that if an  attempt is made for diversion, that is continuing with the  confidence-building measures [CBM's], after the UN report, we  will not follow this course. He added: We believe that such a  development is absolutely unjustified following the content of  the UN secretary general's significant report.    In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]  this  morning, Mr. Mikhailidhis noted that continuing the discussion  of the CBM's cannot lead anywhere, it detracts from the report,  and it can only cause damage. Mr. Mikhailidhis also said that  some people believe that there is still room for the CBM's and  reiterated categorically that we would consider it a fatal blow  to the entire process if we continued something which is already  obsolete.    Concerning a letter that Rauf Denktas conveyed to the United  Nations, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that Denktas is starting with a  premise that ise absolutely unacceptable to us and are in  complete opposition to the UN resolutions. He stressed:  Neither our side nor the United Nations, through its  resolutions, have ever accepted the fact that Cyprus can be  anything but a unitary sovereignty, a unitary citizenship. Mr.  Mikhailidhis also pointed that Denktas reiterated in his letter  his well-known demands for partnership, equal participation, and  separate rights.</p>

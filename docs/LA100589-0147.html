			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: ARCHITECTS BUILDING ON THEIR SOCIAL CONSCIENCE  </P> <P> Early in his professional career, architect Arnold Stalk was troubled by the  plight of the homeless. The fate of families forced to survive on the street or  crowded into overpriced Skid Row hotel rooms oppressed his soul and challenged  his sense of responsibility as a neophyte designer.  </P> <P> Unlike many architects, who feel they ought to do more than build homes for the  rich but never come to grips with their troubled consciences, Stalk took  action.  </P> <P> In 1983 he co-founded the Los Angeles Family Housing Corp. as a nonprofit  agency dedicated to the creation of low-cost housing for economically deprived  families. Increasingly, LAFHC's projects that range from temporary shelters to  permanent apartments for the homeless have begun to attract national attention  as economical yet thoughtfully designed architectural models.  </P> <P> "We could use a multitude of Stalk clones," said John Ochoa, executive director  of the Greater Los Angeles Partnership for the Homeless. "Failing that, we must  find ways of getting more designers involved in finding clever and attractive  ways of housing displaced victims of social, economic and political changes  over which they have no control."  </P> <P> Two recently completed LAFHC projects illustrate how Stalk and his architect  wife, Michelle, design their way out of lean budgets and rigid building codes  that regulate everything from the quality of finishes to the sizes of rooms.  </P> <P> Triangle House, on a shabby side street off Brooklyn Avenue in Boyle Heights,  contains eight apartments arranged in an imaginative complex that could grace  any upscale Westside neighborhood. The upper level units have mezzanine  sleeping lofts instead of separate bedrooms to increase the sense of  spaciousness. And an air of avant-garde elegance, rare in subsidized housing,  is induced by touches such as the galvanized pipe railings and the eccentric  skyline silhouette.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Style on Minimal Budget  </P> <P> In the Pico Union district, Villa Nueva's 20 apartments are designed on two  levels around a central courtyard. Its neat, pitched roofs, cross-pane windows  and fine sand-finished stucco lifts the visual depression of its dilapidated  downtown district. Intended for families with very low incomes, the publicly  funded project rents its units for about $250 per month, demonstrating how  minimal budgets need not dictate mean architecture.  </P> <P> "Architects can do a lot to raise the quality of life for people desperate for  shelter," Arnold Stalk said. "We can use our expertise as designers to  dissipate the almost Victorian stigma of charity and ugliness that still clings  to public housing of any kind. We can create environments that are as pleasant  as they are cheap."  </P> <P> The Stalks search out potential locations for LAHFC projects by driving the  streets all over the city. They find funding from a mixture of government  agencies such as the Community Redevelopment Agency and the federal Department  of Housing and Urban Development, and from private charities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Privately Funded  </P> <P> As a privately funded project, Triangle House was subject to fewer design  restrictions and delays than housing built with public money. Its construction  cost, at $39 per square foot, is roughly half the average cost of $60-$70 for  most subsidized residential developments, and its completion within a year  contrasts with an average of three years for publicly financed projects.  </P> <P> Triangle House contractor John Bohling attributes the project's remarkably low  construction cost to a mixture of professional dedication by the Stalks and a  plethora of donated materials and services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'More Collaboration'  </P> <P> "The project ends up a lot nicer than many a Marina del Rey apartment complex I  have built with twice the budget," he said. "There's less tension and more  collaboration here, and therefore things go much faster and much happier."  </P> <P> But the Stalks can even create imaginative public housing on a budget.  </P> <P> Funded by the CRA, Casa Familia, an eight-unit complex on East Adams Boulevard  completed in 1984, followed a familiar Angeleno architectural tradition of  two-story townhouses grouped around a courtyard. But in a neighborhood of tough  streets, the courtyard also served as a relatively safe place for kids to play  while parents watch from kitchen windows.  </P> <P> Constructed at a modest cost of $50 per square foot, the units rent at about  $300 per month, way below the market rate for rentals in the crowded area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Administers Project  </P> <P> "Although we are in the midst of an urban battle zone, surrounded by dangerous  street gangs and drug dealers, we have managed to maintain a strong community  sense in Casa Familia," said Noelle Sweitzer, president of Housing Development  Services, the contract agency that administers the project.  </P> <P> The Stalks' inventiveness in finding ways to create housing ranges from  converting historic buildings such as the 100-year-old Strong Mansion, moved  from its site near the expanding Convention Center earlier this year, to  conjuring up "quick build" demonstration projects such as the Gentry Village  apartment complex in North Hollywood, to be erected between this Thanksgiving  and Christmas Day.  </P> <P> The architects are also excited by the idea of constructing homes over the  city's 140 municipal parking lots, which they see as an under-used resource of  vacant land in a crowded urban scene.  </P> <P> Many architects might wonder how the Stalks can afford to spend so much time on  homeless housing projects, which pay a professional fee of less than half what  a designer might command in the commercial housing market. Considering the  extra red tape involved in any operation controlled by public agencies, plus  the complexity of the official housing codes, few designers can make a profit  in this specialty.  </P> <P> The Stalks balance their public work with a practice in custom-designed homes.  Designers Plus, their private design firm, operates out of the ground floor of  their Woodland Hills home. The link between the architecture of their designer  homes and the LAFHC projects is a Cubist simplicity of style and a predilection  for muscular materials like galvanized steel pipe railings and stark white  stucco surfaces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paid Their Dues  </P> <P> "Arnie and I have paid our dues, putting in much sweat and long hours bringing  low-cost housing projects to completion," Michelle Stalk said.  </P> <P> "We've learned to punch our way through brick walls of bureaucratic  obstruction, or find ways around obstacles, while struggling to survive as  professionals. We feel the profession as a whole should be more involved in  helping to house the homeless, rather than leaving it up to a few dedicated  people."  </P> <P> A big beetle-browed man with gentle brown eyes, Arnold Stalk believes most  architects feel uneasy about this issue, even if they do little or nothing to  appease their consciences.  </P> <P> "I lecture at SCI-ARC, and find a deep concern among my students about the  homeless," he said. "I keep telling them, and any other architect who'll  listen, that we can solve the homeless housing problem, if only we're willing  to bring our energy and imagination fully to bear.  </P> <P> "Sure, it's exhausting and unglamorous, and bad for your bank balance. But  designers simply must get involved. In the long run, much of our professional  repute depends upon how we respond to this painful human emergency."  </P></p>

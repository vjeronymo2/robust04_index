			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / PowerGen calls for N-levy cut POWERGEN, the privatised generator, has joined some of the UK's biggest companies in appealing to the government for a cut in their electricity bills through a reduction in the 11 per cent 'nuclear levy' on bills to large users. Large energy consumers have intensified their warnings in recent weeks that without lower electricity prices they will not be able to compete with overseas companies. PowerGen said yesterday that it has been discussing one possible solution to the problem - removal of the nuclear levy, the subsidy electricity users pay to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator - with large consumers and the Department of Trade and Industry since before the general election. The DTI is considering the proposals and is understood to have become slightly more receptive than it was before the election. Observers believe that may be due to the arrival of Mr Michael Heseltine as trade and industry secretary. PowerGen says large users, who enjoyed subsidised electricity prices before privatisation, are the one group that has failed to benefit from the government's power sell-off. Nuclear Electric, which receives Pounds 1.2bn from the levy, increased its profits this year by 48 per cent to Pounds 482m. This, say PowerGen and other campaigners, shows there is scope for reducing the levy. Mr Alf Roberts, PowerGen commercial director, said large users could pay a reduced levy, or be allowed to enter into lower-priced contracts. The second option, by tying up a significant amount of Nuclear Electric's output in the industrial market, would raise demand in the market for coal-generated electricity, and could give a boost to the coal industry as it prepares for privatisation.

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: Grand Hotel - Theatre Grand Hotel was originally a German novel by Vicki Baum published in 1929. It came to fame in the early 1930s as a Hollywood movie starring among others Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo, and was the vehicle for Garbo's celebrated line 'I vant to be alone'. Since then there have been remakes, including one called Weekend at the Waldorf with Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon. Much more recently the musical diversion has been a widely acclaimed hit on Broadway. The show opened with a different cast at London's huge Dominion Theatre yesterday. Since a large part of the audience plainly appeared to enjoy it much more than I did, I shall be gentle. For every criticism I make, there is probably a perfectly reasonable response. The adjective that most immediately comes to mind about Grand Hotel is 'heavy'. The hotel is grand in the sense of big, not splendid, rather as the Germans tend to have grand rather than big coalitions. Moreover, the difficulty in trying to portray elegance in a stage musical is that Hollywood does it so much better. It might be said that this is Berlin 1928, so what do you expect from central Europe at that period? Well, I would have liked a few more jokes, a bit more sharpness and perhaps even some satire. The only direct reference to one of the problems of the time is that some jews are more acceptable than others, and even then the jew in question manages to adapt to the hotel quite easily: he does, of course, have money. There is very little plot to speak of. Again it might be claimed that that is precisely the point. As the doctor/narrator says of the hotel 'guests come, guests go, new guests arrive.' True enough, but it is still pretty thin for a story line. It is also odd to play a musical as big as Grand Hotel without an interval. To be sure, the show last only 2 1/4 hours, but that is a long time for one sitting, and there is certainly room for a natural break. Possibly the task of getting the audience back to their seats in such a large theatre was thought too daunting. Apart from that, how does one enjoy the music? The answer is not a great deal. Grand Hotel, with songs by Robert Wright and George Forrest, seems to me to lack the subtlety and sustained sweep of the best of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, by which I mean Evita and Phantom, both of which have stories to go with them. There are, however, some fine performances. Liliane Montevecchi in the ballerina part once played by Garbo takes a while to warm up, but you can see the attraction of the role. In the one scene that is remotely dramatic, Lynnette Perry distinguishes herself as the secretary whose seduction by her boss threatens to get out of hand. Brent Barrett is an effective, poverty-stricken baron, seven months behind with his hotel bill. Many people will admire Barry James as the jewish book-keeper who ends a happy man, though for my part sentimentality is never far away from the whole show. The dancing, foxtrot, Charleston, ballet and waltz, is good. Grand Hotel is directed and choreographed by the appropriately named Tommy Tune. Dominion Theatre, 071 580 8845</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a joint declaration signed yesterday  afternoon by Foreign Ministers Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner and  Sergio Abreu Bonilla, Paraguay and Uruguay have begun to  negotiate an agreement, which should be signed as soon as  possible, establishing the two countries' reciprocal assistance  in recovering stolen cars. The signing of this document will  contribute to repressing this illegal activity, and will help  speed up the process of returning stolen cars.    The joint declaration was signed at the Foreign Ministry. It  was the Uruguayan foreign minister's last official activity in  Paraguay. Abreu is scheduled to return to his country this  morning after a 3-day official stay in our country.    In the joint declaration, the foreign ministers also  recognized the increase in the consumption rate and illegal  trade in narcotics, which constitutes a grave threat to our  peoples' health and well-being and obligates all nations to  share in the responsibility of repressing it.    The ministers ratified the importance for the two countries  -- in the context of the Parana-Paraguay waterway -- of the work  to eliminate existing obstacles to the effective use of port  facilities granted to Paraguay in Montevideo and Nueva Palmira.  Port authorities and operators from the two countries will meet  in Montevideo during the second half of July.    The Uruguayan foreign minister returns to his country on a  private plane at 0900 this morning.</p>

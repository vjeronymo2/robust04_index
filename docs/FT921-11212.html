			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Barbaric times - Radio RADIO 4's Monday evening play, Don Taylor's When the Barbarians Came, covers the Roman reaction to the Goths' entry of the city in AD 376. Wealthy, idle Marcus (Norman Rodway) and his mistress Julia (Frances Barber) see the plebs' welcome on their television. Theatre director Adrian (Peter Woodthorpe) gradually accedes to new demands until, under a Goth assistant, he has a hit with an Oedipus genuinely blinded, a Richard III actually put to the sword. Antony (Colin MacFarlane), a captain in Intelligence, appears to take sides with anti-barbarian students, though continuing his intelligence work; and Augustus, a quasi-Emperor, pulls out, selling his property to the Goths. The political reactions are shown only among the middle and upper classes. It would have been interesting to hear a voice from the plebs, to know for instance, how the common people, so free from revolt, felt about the slave-camps set up for the unemployed and homeless, and later about National Sacrifice Day, with five citizens killed to music. ('I'd rather watch it on television,' Marcus says.) Antony comes nearest to a public opinion. Why accept barbarians? There's been no uprising. Our society is based on barbarism, it's the people's hearts that must change. Neither Rome nor the Goths is specifically mentioned, and the play seems as much concerned with the historic association of Romans and Visigoths as with any analogy with our own day. I found it a fascinating piece, and stayed awake half the night thinking about Germany, Northern Ireland, the Caribbean and elsewhere. Jeremy Howe was the director. On Sunday Radio 3 gave us Louis MacNeice's Christopher Columbus, with the Walton music. There is excitement in Columbus's first voyage (in the play's second hour), but we wait a long time while he argues with this duke and that bishop, achieving merely a charge of heresy. Only victory over the Moors persuades Queen Isabella to give him a ship; then he demands to be Viceroy and Governor-General over the places he finds, with one-tenth of the treasure and one-eighth of the lands and revenues. If I had been the Queen I'd have handed him over to the Inquisition. MacNeice's lines are not alluring, and Walton's music, recorded by the BBC Singers and Symphony Orchestra under Simon Joly, seemed to me useful but little more. Alan Howard's playing of Columbus matched the occasional vividness of the words, and indeed the company, directed by Ian Cotterell, truly suggested the consciously aristocratic Spanish nobles Columbus had to persuade. (Tomorrow morning on Radio 4, you can hear What if . . . ?, in which American academics discuss with Dr Christopher Andrew the differences, on each side of the Atlantic, we should see if Queen Isabella hadn't changed her mind.) Drama of another kind came on Radio 5 on Monday, with the first part of Groosham Grange by Anthony Horowitz, adapted by Stephen Sheridan. It is a farce for teenagers about a schoolboy, sacked from Beaton, and sent to the weird eponymous academy. The headmaster was playing Verdi's Requiem when we joined. 'Yes, it's something you can really dance to,' said the hideously deformed caretaker. So you see where we are. At least this won't be as middle-class as boys' school-stories tend to be. There are two more instalments to come, no matter what the Radio Times says. Saturday night was Burns Night, and Radio 2 gave us A Tribute to Robert Burns, with songs by Kenneth McKellar and readings by Tom Fleming. McKellar is a favourite Scottish singer; and Fleming gave a reading of 'The cotter's Saturday night' that - speaking as a Sassenach - I thought splendid. Radio 3 competed with 20 minutes from Jamie McGee, the legendary (sic) one-armed blues bagpiper, something you don't hear every day.</p>

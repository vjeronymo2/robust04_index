			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Federated Stores 48% ahead Federated Department Stores, the US retailer trying to gain control of the bankrupt R. H. Macy group, yesterday reported a 48 per cent jump in net profits from Dollars 21.7m before extraordinary items to Dollars 32.2m for the first quarter, ended April. Some of the rise came from a 4 per cent increase in sales from Dollars 1.59bn to Dollars 1.65bn, but most resulted from efficiency improvements. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell from 34.9 per cent of sales last time to 32.8 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 17 cents before extraordinary items to 25 cents. Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said the profits increase was largely due to progress in reducing expenses, derived in part from investments in technology that had brought improvements in productivity. 'We are pleased with our ability to continue to get more productivity out of the business, which is integral to our efforts to drive sales by offering better assortments, selections and value to our customers,' Mr Questrom said. Federated operates 220 stores in the US. including the Bloomingdale's and Abraham &amp; Strauss (A&amp;S) chains. It believes a takeover of rival R. H. Macy would provide long-term profits growth because merging the two empires would provide opportunities for productivity gains. R. H. Macy is currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and Federated has filed a rescue plan that would give it control of the company. But its plan has to compete with others submitted by Macy's existing management and the official bondholders' committee, and it is not yet clear which will succeed. Mr Cyrus Vance, the court-appointed mediator between Macy's creditors and those putting forward the rescue plans, is holding discussions between the parties in the hope of lining up support for a single reorganisation plan that can then be put to a vote.</p>

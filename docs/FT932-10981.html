			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: BAT BAT's shares have fallen by nearly 9 per cent since Philip Morris put a torch to the cigarette price war. As the battle is unlikely to spread beyond the US, and only 20 per cent of BAT's operating profits come from its domestic US tobacco operations, that looks excessive. Yet until Philip Morris's strategy becomes clearer and the impact on discount as well as premium brands better understood, tobacco companies may remain under pressure. The turn in the insurance market may thus not be reflected in BAT's share price for some time. But with a 50 per cent yield premium to the market and dividend cover climbing back towards two, further falls must surely be limited.</p>

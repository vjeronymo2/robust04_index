			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> YELTSIN BACKERS HOLD RALLY  </P> <P> Thousands of Muscovites, some urging the removal of President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev, protested in the Soviet capital over the exclusion of  anti-Establishment hero Boris N. Yeltsin and other reformers from the new  standing Parliament, the Supreme Soviet. About 8,000 people at a rally shouted  and cheered as human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov condemned what he  called the authorities' manipulation of the new Congress of People's Deputies.  The congress elected a predominantly conservative 542-member Supreme Soviet,  which will meet for eight months a year to ratify or reject all acts of the  government.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by station Correspondent Dao Nguyen: "The Door to </F> Cooperation Between Vietnam and Malaysia Is Wide Open"]    [Summary] Malaysia is considered to be one of the economic  dragons in Asia. To this end, Malaysia has exerted efforts to  make its presence felt. The principle of opening one's door to  the outside world without losing one's own traits is strictly  applied to everyday activities in Malaysia. The country  consists of people of different races with Malaysians accounting  for 53 percent of the population and Chinese, Indians, and other  foreign nationals representing the rest of the population.  Although Malaysians belong to different religions, they all get  along very well.    Malaysians regard Vietnam as a true friend. Therefore, on  the very first day of their visit, General Secretary Do Muoi and  other Vietnamese guests were invited to attend the 10th General  Meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.    Reporting on this event, major newspapers in Malaysia  carried  headlines saying that this was a unique dialogue. At that  meeting, General Secretary Do Muoi answered many questions  raised by the delegates. In response to a question posed by a  famous British film producer as to whether Vietnam, while  implementing its open-door policy, is worried about the  influence of foreign cultures on its national traits, General  Secretary Do Muoi emphatically said: We welcome mankind's  cultural quintessence and cultural activities that help promote  friendship, enrich the sense of aesthetics, and perfect the good  personality of the Vietnamese people.    Before leaving Malaysia, General Secretary Do Muoi granted  an  interview to correspondents of the Voice of Vietnam and the  Vietnam Television Network on the results of his visit to  Malaysia. He said:    [Begin Do Muoi recording] It can be said that my visit has  yielded very encouraging results. Our Malaysian friends have  accorded the Vietnamese delegation a very warm welcome. We  witnessed many building projects everywhere we went. I am  convinced that by the year 2020, Malaysia will achieve its  economic objectives of turning itself into a developed  industrialized country. Our Malaysian friends highly value the  renovation process in Vietnam and hope that our country will  reach a relatively quick growth rate within a short period of  time. His Excellency Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and I are  pleased to note that so far, the friendship and cooperation  between the two countries have developed very well. Both of us  hope that together with the recent visits by Vietnamese Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir  Mohamed, my current visit will contribute to consolidating and  strengthening bilateral cooperative ties a step further. His  Excellency Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed said: It is  necessary for Vietnam to move forward, effect changes for the  better, and enrich itself, thereby helping create conditions for  Malaysia and other neighboring countries to score better  development results.

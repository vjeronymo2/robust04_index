			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Electricity regulator's bid role under fire Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, was yesterday embroiled in political controversy after the disclosure that Trafalgar House's idea to offer a rebate to Northern Electric customers originated from a meeting with him. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's trade spokesman, questioned whether Prof Littlechild had behaved with 'proper conduct'. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, he asked: 'Under which of his responsibilities does he advise companies engaged in hostile takeovers of regional electricity companies?' Trafalgar has launched a Pounds 1.2bn hostile bid for Northern. Swiss Bank Corporation, advising Trafalgar, said yesterday that Prof Littlechild had asked at the meeting a month ago what benefits there would be for the consumer of a potential bid. 'We formed the view that it would be easier for (Prof Littlechild) to consider a (regional electricity company) bid that contained in its terms a tangible benefit for the consumer, over and above the tariff reduction that was published in August.' Following the meeting, Trafalgar decided on a rebate of Pounds 20 per customer, costing Pounds 26m, if the bid was successful. 'The choice of a special rebate and the determination of a sum of Pounds 20 was not discussed with (Prof Littlechild) at any stage prior to the bid being announced.' Prof Littlechild's office had no specific comment yesterday. In a letter to Mr Derek Foster, opposition chief whip, he confirmed the meeting took place on November 25 and that he had asked the company how customers would benefit if the acquisition went ahead. 'The particular proposal which Trafalgar House have since made was not discussed.' Mr Cunningham said if the regulator thought there was potential for rebates 'why is he letting Northern charge customers more than seems necessary?' Mr Cunningham asked Mr Heseltine for his views on 'a number of disturbing aspects' to the bid. Mr Cunningham said it was important that Mr Heseltine 'urgently clarify' his view of matters including the role of the regulator and his statutory duties. The Department of Trade and Industry said it was considering the letter. London shares, Page 36</p>

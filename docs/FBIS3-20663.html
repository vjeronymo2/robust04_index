			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese, </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Yunshi [1728 0336 0087] and Chen Jun [7115 </F> 6511] of the Institute of New Energy Materials Chemistry, Nankai  University, Tianjin 300071: "Research on Nickel/Metal Hydride  Battery," supported by grant from 863 Plan; MS received 11 Sep  93, revised 12 Nov]    [Abstract] By applying the nation's abundant rare-earth  resources, a new type of hydrogen storage electrode alloy--and  from it, a high-performance AA-size sealed nickel/metal hydride  (Ni-MH) battery--have been developed. This new high-tech  product, the subject of competitive research and  commercialization in the U.S., Japan, Germany, and other  advanced nations, has several advantages over Ni/Cd batteries,  including higher capacity, avoidance of Cd pollution, and  larger-current charging and discharging. The 863AA Ni/MH  battery developed by the authors has the following key  performance indicators: nominal capacity exceeds 1000 mAh, 5-A  discharge-to-0.8-V average capacity exceeds 950mAh (95 percent  of rated capacity), low-temperature (-18C) 0.2-A  discharge-to-1.0-V average capacity is 835 mAh (83 percent of  rated capacity), seven-day self-discharge is 15 percent, 28-day  self-discharge is 29 percent, and lifetime is over 500 cycles  (based on 1.75-h 400-mA charge, 1.25-h 400-mA discharge test).  These parameters meet international standards, and  low-temperature performance is state of the art. The authors  have completed batch trial-production, and have constructed an  intermediate-testing base with a single-shift annual output of  500,000 units [for details, see JPRS-CEN-93-006, 23 Jun 93, p  23].  The one figure, not reproduced, is a graph of voltage drops over  time for five different charge levels ranging from 200 mA to  5000 mA. There are no tables.  References    1.

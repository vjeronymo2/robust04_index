			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDIS TO RAISE OIL GOALS FOR 1990S, INVEST BILLIONS  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, plans to spend $15 billion in  the next six years to maintain its supremacy in the oil market, regional  bankers and oil industry analysts said Thursday.  </P> <P> "Saudi Arabia wants to remain a market leader in the 1990s," one oil industry  manager said. "It also does not want its share within OPEC to erode as world  demand grows."  </P> <P> Oil industry sources in the Gulf said the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco)  wants to push the kingdom's oil output capacity to 10 million barrels a day by  1995 from the current 6.5 million.  </P> <P> The sources said the company was expected to finance the scheme from oil  revenue. Because the payments would be spread over a number of years it would  not create any strain on its budget, they added.  </P> <P> One industry executive predicted that the Saudis could reach an  8-million-barrel-a-day output capacity by 1992 under the scheme. Current Saudi  output is estimated at 5.2 million barrels a day.  </P> <P> Gulf members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries expect their  world market share within the 13-nation group to rise by the turn of the  century, in line with a projected increase in world oil demand and a decline in  production elsewhere.  </P> <P> Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia's plan to expand output was a clear  warning to some of its OPEC partners, and to independent producers who might be  planning expensive oil development schemes beyond the year 2000.  </P> <P> "Would you contemplate a new investment in the North Sea if you heard the  Saudis will double what they are producing now by 1995?" an oil industry  executive said.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia reached the 10-million-barrel-a-day mark in 1980 and 1981, just as  the rise in oil prices to $40 a barrel turned the world off its addiction to  cheap oil.  </P> <P> But as demand plummeted, Saudi Arabia's oil production dropped to as low as  3.04 million barrels a day in 1985, at the cost of a permanent loss of capacity  at some fields, the sources said.  </P> <P> Saudi Aramco is already recruiting workers and staff for the new expansion  scheme at its headquarters in the eastern province of the kingdom where its  vast oil fields are located, they said.  </P> <P> "Saudi Aramco opted for a development scheme scattered over a long period," one  industry executive said. "The job could have been completed in a shorter  period, but the costs would have been much higher."  </P> <P> Oil industry sources said the scheme would bring some older field equipment  back into operation, increase recovery rates at some fields and probably  develop some new fields.  </P> <P> As its production capacity grows, there will be no problem of exporting the  crude because the kingdom's existing oil loading facilities have a capacity of  14 million barrels a day, Oil Minister Hisham Nazer recently said in an  interview.  </P> <P> Saudi Aramco plans to shoulder most of the development project but may use some  specialized international oil industry service companies during the six-year  program, sources said.  </P> <P> "The first phase of the project bringing back into production existing  machinery will be quick and cheap," an oil industry source said.  </P></p>

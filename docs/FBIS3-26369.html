Very early in the morning, Jiang Chunyun,  secretary of the provincial party committee, came to Qihe  County, with which he had established ties, to visit local  cadres and people. He also visited villages and households to  learn about peasants' production and life and to hear their  voice, opinions, and suggestions.    Secretary Jiang first went to the (Maozhuang) Village of  (Shouzhong) Township. The economy of the village was rather  backward and people's life rather difficult due to its  saline-alkali soil and the influence of the Huang He water  diversion project. Secretary Jiang visited the home of an old  woman (Ma Chuanwei) at a little pass nine in the morning. With  deep concern, he asked about the old woman's health and asked  her whether she had difficulties. The old woman said: You,  provincial leaders, have come to see us despite your tight  schedule. I am so moved that I do now know what to say. The  income of my family declined this year because of the cold  weather. However, we still earned more than 1,000 yuan and have  more than 2,500 jin of grain. Our life is not so bad. Please  do not worry about us.    Secretary Jiang said with a deep feeling: We will work out  ways to address whatever difficulties you have so that you can  achieve affluence as soon as possible.    At the home of (Zhu Zhaoshi), who had difficulty in life,  (Zhu's) wife told Secretary Jiang: We have wheat and cabbage.  Although we have little money at our disposal, our life is not  too bad. We have no problem in spending the Spring Festival.    After visiting (Maozhuang) Village, Secretary Jiang again  came to (Dayang) Village. This village became prosperous thanks  to greenhouse cultivation of vegetables in the past few years.  The secretary of the village party branch said to Secretary  Jiang happily: Our village, which has a population of more than  1,000, has built more than 83 greenhouses to grow 200 mu of  (?fine vegetables) and 320 mu of (?ordinary) vegetables. Our  per capita net income was 1,630 yuan in 1993.    Hearing this, Secretary Jiang smiled and said: Let's go to  your greenhouse. At the vegetable greenhouse, Secretary was  very happy to see the fresh cucumbers. He said: When delivered  to Jinan, the cucumbers can be sold at good prices. The more  you earn, the happier we will be. You may grow strawberries and  [word indistinct] in the greenhouses to increase your income.    After visiting the greenhouse, Secretary Jiang came to the  home of villager (Yang Chengming). He asked whether the village  had collected plenty of accumulation funds. (Yang Chengming)  answered: No. We, a family of four members, earn 9,000 yuan a  year. Each of us pay merely 70 yuan as the village's  accumulation funds.    Secretary Jiang said: The more prosperous the village  becomes, the less the masses have to pay as the accumulation  funds. Grass-roots cadres must do more solid work for the  masses, attend to the two civilizations simultaneously, firmly  embrace the mass viewpoint, and maintain close ties with the  masses. In doing work, they should attach importance to methods  and refrain from doing work in an oversimplified and crude way  or through administrative orders. When the cadre-populace ties  are good, it will be easier to do work.    After shaking hands with the people who came to say good-by  at (Dayang) Village, Secretary Jiang continued his trip to  another village.</p>

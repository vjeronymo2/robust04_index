			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (5): Dissonant voices raised over opt-outs  -The country must shortly re-examine its attitude towards Europe. Hugh Carnegy sets the scene Over the next year, Denmark's awkward relationship with the European Union is likely once again to become an awkward and potentially divisive domestic political issue. Most Danes must have hoped that the EU would slide out of the political frontline for some time to come when they voted in May last year, at the second time of asking, to accept the Maastricht treaty on European Union. Denmark had thrown the EU - or the EC as it then still was - into turmoil in June 1992 by rejecting the treaty in a referendum, threatening to derail the whole project. A year later, after securing a series of 'opt-outs' on key Danish objections to Maastricht, Copenhagen managed to save its own blushes and the blushes of Brussels by winning a Yes vote in a second plebiscite. But the EU's intergovernmental conference (IGC) in 1996, which will review Maastricht and set a course for the Union to follow into the next century, means Denmark's politicians must shortly grapple once more with the question of the country's role in Europe - and, specifically, reopen the debate on Denmark's 'opt outs' from Maastricht. The debate will be influenced by the recent referendum decisions in Sweden and Finland to join the Union - 22 years after Denmark joined the then European Economic Community. Danish public opinion is likely to be more susceptible to deepening the country's integration in the EU once its Nordic neighbours are also members. The three Nordic applicants (including Norway) have fully accepted the terms of Maastricht. If, on November 28, Norway also votes to join, it will strengthen the hand of those arguing that Denmark should drop its opt-outs. In order to win the second Maastricht referendum, Copenhagen won the agreement of its EU partners to opt out of four of the treaty's provisions. These were the drive towards European monetary union (Emu) and a single currency; closer defence co-operation (specifically, Denmark reserves the right not to become a full member of the Western European Union); measures on European citizenship; and legal and home affairs matters. The present Social Democratic-led government of prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, formed after September's general election, said in its inaugural policy statement that these opt-outs, agreed at the EU's Edinburgh summit in December 1992, remained the basis of Danish EU policy. Mr Ove Fich, the Social Democratic chairman of parliament's Europe committee, says a contract was made with the electorate last year on the opt-outs that had to be honoured. He sees no need to reopen the debate on the exemptions, believing the IGC in any case will concentrate on central and eastern Europe. 'The main issue will be enlargement - all other discussions will be seen in that light,' he says. But there are other voices, both within government ranks and in opposition, which argue that the Edinburgh opt-outs - although unchallenged by any of Denmark's EU partners - are unsustainable for Denmark in the face of the IGC, and that the country should prepare to drop them. The differences are such that the all-party consultations that Mr Nyrup Rasmussen intends to hold next year with the intention of achieving a pre-IGC Danish consensus are set to be fraught. What makes the issue more difficult is the necessity to hold a further referendum if any or all of the Edinburgh opt-outs are to be dropped - a step which few politicians would take lightly, given the experience of 1992. The strongest advocate of dropping the opt-outs is Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the right-wing Liberal party. Ironically it was he, as foreign minister at the time, who negotiated the Edinburgh deal. But he did so only out of political necessity, not because he thought the exemptions were in Denmark's best interests. Mr Ellemann-Jensen argues that Denmark should aim to be a 'hard core' member of Emu (it will be one of the first countries to meet the convergence criteria for Emu) and, as a member of Nato, should quickly become a full member of the WEU (it has observer status at present) to put itself at the heart of Europe's evolving security structures. If not, the country could be left on the fringes of the EU. 'What we lack is the political courage to go out and tell the Danes: these are the facts,' he says. 'We are not holding the internal debate to prepare Danes for what is going to happen at the IGC, and that is dangerous.' Denmark's new EU Commissioner, Ms Ritt Bjerregaard, a prominent Social Democrat, is among those within government ranks who thinks that eventually the opt-outs should be dropped. But she points out the difficulty for a minority government in adopting such a position when it relies to a large degree for parliamentary support from the Socialist People's party. The latter, though not anti-EU, is under pressure itself from the stridently anti-EU Unity List which won election to the Folketing for the first time in September. The Social Democrats also know that many of their own supporters are cool towards the EU, and are still smarting from a humiliating showing in the EU parliamentary elections in June when the party slumped to just 15.8 per cent of the vote. 'Because of this, the government has to be extremely careful,' says Ms Bjerregaard. 'It says it is sticking to the exemptions - but it is not promising never to change them.' Her hope is that the whole range of issues facing the EU will have shifted sufficiently by 1996 to present a different scenario to Danish voters. For example, the WEU is likely to be more clearly defined as an integral part of Nato; enlargement of the EU to the north, and the planned integration of central and eastern European countries (popular in Denmark) may change the emphasis on the pace and method of EU integration. 'If we can convince people that lots of things have changed and that we cannot stand still, then things can be different. There might be many things to include in a referendum as a result of new negotiations,' Ms Bjerregaard says.</p>

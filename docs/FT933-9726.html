			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Tawny times in summer's dog days - Giles MacDonogh plumps for a lighter style of port for hot-weather drinking PORT HAS been in the news again since a few of the famous houses have come out to declare the 1991 vintage - the first declaration since 1985. One or two companies have held back - notably Taylor and Fonseca  - and it now seems likely that they will declare a 1992. So, if you have a child or godchild who was born last year, hang on: you might find something more suitable for laying down next spring. It is possibly a personal prejudice, but vintage port strikes me as a wintry thing: a decanter circulating round a polished walnut dining table while the logs crackle in the grate. But in summer, tawny port is my personal preference. In Portugal the shippers chill them to make them more welcome in the baking summers of the Douro Valley. In the cold snaps of a Douro spring the bottles are, however, placed before the fire, as I remember from a visit to Cockburn's Quinta de Tua more than a decade ago, when a torrent of icy rain surprised us in the vineyards and the port provided a warming reviver. Some of the best old tawnies come from the so-called Portuguese houses, a term used to separate them from the British houses which are household names to port drinkers in the UK. However, not all are Portuguese by any means: there were sizeable groups of Dutchmen, Germans and Scandanavians who settled in Oporto from the 17th century onwards and plied the trade in salt cod and wine. Sadly, some of these old wood ports can be hard to come by: neither Quinta do Noval nor Niepoort is easily available at the moment, as the former has been acquired by AXA, the French insurance company, and the lovely wines of Niepoort have been temporarily blighted by the demise of their British agents. On the other hand you may find Ramos Pinto, Burmester, Krohn and Calem and all four are worth a punt when it comes to their old tawnies and colheitas. All the port houses make tawnies, the younger ones being generally a blend of ruby and white port to give them the distinctive tawny hue. Moving up the scale there are the premium tawnies such as Warre's Nimrod (Pounds 14.49, Fulham Wine Company, London, 071-371 0196) which retains something of its youthful aggression. Real quality, however, starts with 10- or 20-year-old wines. To comply with the standards set by the Port Wine Institute a tawny must present characteristics of a 10-, 20-, 30- or 40-year-old wine. In reality the contents of the bottle will be a blend of wines averaging out at marginally more than the stated age but some very young port will have been used to give the wine some 'grip' on the finish; a dollop of pepper and fresh raspberries which prevents it from going to sleep on the tongue. This is an important counterbalance in wines of 20 years when wood ports become particularly mellow. Two of the best available are from Portuguese houses: Burmester and Ramos Pinto. The former (Pounds 27.55 from branches of Barwell and Jones) is a highly individual, almost medlar-scented wine, while the Ramos Pinto is a rare single-estate tawny from the Quinta de Bom Retiro (Pounds 25 from Harrods, London, 071-730 1234) which is distinguished by its firm finish. The best of the 'British' 20-year-olds also have this fruity sting to their tails: Sandeman's Imperial (Pounds 19.95 from Waitrose) Cockburn's (Pounds 17.99 from branches of John Harvey of Bristol), Graham's (Pounds 24.25, Harrods; Pounds 22.99, Selfridges, London) and Taylor's (Pounds 23.99 from branches of Threshers or Unwins). The Taylor is possibly the fruitiest of the lot. As they grow older, wood ports develop creaminess and this is a mark of 30-year-olds. Dows' (Harrods Pounds 40), Graham's (Lay &amp; Wheeler, 0206-764446 and Taylor's (for stockists 071-222 2522) all make lovely 30-year-olds, but the best of the bunch is the bicentenary bottle put out by Sandeman's last year. It is a lively wine with a taste reminiscent of nuts, figs, violets and liquorice (Pounds 95 from Oddbins Fine Wines in the City of London, 071-236 7721) Portuguese houses make vintage tawnies under the name colheita (literally 'harvest'). Unlike tawnies these are unblended and their detractors point out that old colheitas can taste a little tired without the young port they need to beef them up. This is very much a question of taste. For the open-minded there are some marvellous colheitas to be had. Krohn makes a good '76 (the '78 does indeed taste tired) and a simply gorgeous 1963. Vintage buffs will recall this as one of the best years since the war. (Pounds 11.75 for the '78 and Pounds 27.95 for the '63 from Richmond Wines, 081-948 4196). Calem is another house which specialises in colheitas. The 1962 may lack that spicy finish but it has a delicious mellow nuttiness (Pounds 328.37 for six bottles from Original Wines, 071-401 8664). There are few 40-year-olds about, but Taylor's makes a vibrant example with a rich, strawberry-like character (Pounds 63 from Harrods). Tawny ports have the advantage that they are ready to drink when you buy them and will not go off too quickly. This is not the case with vintage port unless you opt for the so-called single quinta wines which are released on to the market when the shippers feel they are right for consumption. As their name implies they are mostly - but not all - the product of one farm or estate and they are always made in years when no vintage is declared. This does not mean they are always worse than vintage. There have been occasions - 1975 was a case in point - when the wisdom of declaring the vintage has been called into question. For anyone who does not appreciate the taste of wood port and who wants something for drinking now I can recommend the following: 1982 Quinta de Cavadinha from Warre (Pounds 17.09 from branches of Thomas Peatling) with an enchanting chocolate-and-fresh-fig character; 1978 Quinta de Vargellas from Taylor (Pounds 27.99 from branches of Threshers or Victoria Wine) with its peppery, raspberry character typical of the house style; and Fonseca Guimaraens 1976 (Pounds 18.95 from Lea &amp; Sandeman 071-376 4767), which is very powerful indeed. My only quibble is that it is so splendid it would do no harm to lay it down for a few years to get the very best from it.</p>

Hainan asked me to serve as an advisor. The  center gave recognition.    After returning to Hong Kong, I immediately wrote a letter  to  Deng Xiaoping and the CPC Central Committee, relating the  inspirations I got from Li Ka-shing's intention to invest in  Hainan, my feelings generated by the visit to Hainan, and the  views of the CPC special economic zone committee; I suggested  that Hainan be made a province, thereby becoming a large special  economic zone which would allow the free entry and exit of  goods, people, and capital and become a second customs territory  (it was necessary to use barbed wires in Shenzhen and create a  "second line" zone, whereas Hainan was an island in the first  place), and that goods flowing to or from the hinterland could  be treated as exports. I especially suggested that Hainan be  turned into a large special economic zone and a free port  through consulting the experience of Hong Kong and utilizing  Hong Kong's capital and trained personnel.    Deng Xiaoping referred this letter to Zhao Ziyang, asking  Zhao Ziyang to dispose of the matter. Zhao immediately referred  it to Gu Mu [6253 3668], asking him to form more concrete ideas.  Zhao wrote some comments on my letter: (the gist) agree with  Xu's idea; already thought about making Hainan a province; it is  now proper to consider establishing a special economic zone and  a province; before the large special economic zone becomes  reality, it is proper first to restore the preferential policies  originally granted to Hainan. Soon afterwards, the center  ordered the preparatory group for the establishment of the  province headed by Xu Shijie [6079 1102 2638], former secretary  of the CPC Guangzhou Municipal Committee, and Liang Xiang [2733  3276], former secretary of the CPC Shenzhen Municipal Committee,  to enter Hainan. The news that Hainan would be made a province  and a large special economic zone caused a sensation at home and  abroad. Waves of people making investment-related  investigations, conducting business negotiations, and seeking  jobs crossed Qiongzhou Strait continuously. Before becoming a  province, Hainan was already bustling with activity.    After Hainan was officially made a province on 25 April  1988,  the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee and the Hainan Provincial  government formally asked me to serve as an advisor, and the  center also gave recognition. Regrettably, policies on the  special economic zone have never been fully implemented, and  there has been no progress in regard to Li Ka-shing's investing  in Hainan.    The process of putting forward the idea of developing Hainan  Island was the process in which I first came to understand Hong  Kong and then realized that it was necessary to fully utilize  the entity and experience of Hong Kong. After I came to work in  Hong Kong, I gradually came to realize the importance of the  issue of the need to fully utilize Hong Kong in China's reform  and opening up. The change from believing at the beginning that  Hong Kong only served as a channel and springboard for imports  and exports to utilizing Hong Kong in an effort to attract  overseas funds, to understanding the need to consult Hong Kong's  economic development experience, to consulting the British Hong  Kong government's successful ruling experience in the process of  formulating the Basic Law, and to utilizing the unique mixed  Chinese-Western culture of the people of Hong Kong constituted a  process of gradual development over several years.    Consulting Hong Kong's experience involves many spheres  ranging from economics to politics and culture, and the exercise  will have rich contents. It is now still rather difficult to put  all the relevant understandings in a clear form. But I believe  that in the process of economic and political reforms in China  in the late 20th century and early 21st century, fully utilizing  Hong Kong's experience is an issue which warrants great  attention. The earlier and more deeply people come to  understand its value, the sooner and more extensively it will  contribute to the development of the hinterland and Hong Kong.    Note    The Hainan Automobile Incident: In January 1983, the CPC's  central leaders such as Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, and Gu Mu  inspected Hainan Island, and decided to accelerate the reform  and opening up of Hainan Island; the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council approved and circulated the document, "A  Summary of Discussions of the Issue of Accelerating the  Development of Hainan Island," in April, and issued the Eight  Rules on Expanding Hainan's Autonomy on External Economic  Relations and Trade of the CPC Central Committee in October of  the same year.    Under the Eight Rules, Hainan Island could independently  decide to import 17 state-controlled commodities, of which the  main one would be automobiles. This was a special privilege that  the other special economic zones did not have. In addition, it  was also stipulated that Hainan Island be allowed to keep all  the foreign exchange earned from the exports it delivered. This  rule was also more favorable than enjoyed by other special  economic zones. For instance, Shenzhen was allowed to keep 70  percent, and had to hand over 30 percent.    The Eight Rules did not clearly stipulate that the 17  commodities imported by Hainan Island not be resold to the  hinterland areas of the mainland. As there were no customs sites  between Hainan and the hinterland areas of the mainland, Hainan  was able to import state-controlled commodities and then resell  them to the hinterland areas of the mainland, thereby acquiring  a way of getting rich in a smooth, unhindered manner.    Reselling automobiles could result in huge profits. At that  time, the import price of a 12-passenger van-truck was $5,000,  and reselling it could produce a net profit of $12,000. For a  time Hainan Island became the "paradise" of automobile trading  of the country, and tens of thousands of automobiles were being  resold.    The huge profits from automobiles were also accompanied by  huge profits from foreign exchange arbitrage. The foreign  exchange used by Hainan Island to import automobiles was all  bought at high prices through arbitrage. According to newspaper  reports, a unit in Hainan withdrew 1 million yuan in cash from a  bank all at once, and used an automobile to transport the money  to places such as Shenzhen to be used in foreign exchange  arbitrage. Black market trading in foreign exchange was even  more prevalent on Hainan Island.    At the time of the climax of Hainan's activities of  reselling  imported automobiles, Liang Lingguang [2733 7227 0342], governor  of Guangdong, reported to the center on the disorderly situation  in Hainan. In December 1984, a task force headed by Vice Premier  Wan Li investigated the automobile incident, and promptly  formulated emergency measures, which required, among other  things, that the automobiles already shipped to Hainan be  immediately frozen and then shipped away under arrangements made  by the center, that the center buy automobiles from Hainan on  the basis of the listed uniform rate (1 U.S. dollar to 2.8  yuan), that free trading be prohibited, that implementation of  all automobile purchase contracts concluded with foreign  businesses be suspended, that the issue of compensations  demanded by foreign businesses be handled by the center in a  unified manner, and that there be investigations into the  sources of foreign exchange used to buy the automobiles which  had already been sold and into the tax matters related to those  automobiles.    After the emergency measures were implemented, Hainan's  foreign trade came to a complete halt. Automobiles and imported  materials were being stockpiled; high-price automobiles were  appropriated by the center. The center would only pay the amount  calculated according to prices based on parity exchange rates.  As a consequence, companies in Hainan suddenly lost all the huge  gains made through reselling automobiles.

The 1988 trip to North America was very fruitful. Within  three weeks I visited a dozen or so cities in the United States  and Canada, thereby greatly enlarging my horizon in terms of  getting to understand capitalist countries. I saw the positive  as well as negative social impact on people produced by the  social welfare policies followed by capitalist countries, and  some aspects of a situation where, under a democratic political  system, political parties cared only about the present and did  everything possible to win votes in their efforts to come into  power, while giving little consideration to the consequences.    At that time the United States was in the midst of the  presidential election held once every four years. Reagan, a  Republican President, was no longer running, and made Vice  President Bush the presidential candidate. We visited over 10  metropolises along the east coast as well as the west coast of  the United States, and met with executives of several dozen  large industrial, commerce, and financial enterprises and some  experts and scholars of economics and finance, some of whom were  Republicans, while others were Democrats or independents. When  discussing which party was likely to win in the general  election, most of them, including a few Democrats, expressed the  belief that Bush of the Republican party would win. Several  large enterprise executives, who were Democrats, even took the  initiative in openly saying that they would vote for Bush of the  Republican party for the reason that they "like Bush's  platform." The frankness was beyond my understanding.    During my trip to the United States, a Hong Kong tycoon, who  was a Consultative Committee member, accompanied me when I  visited Washington and New York. He and Bush were friends. He  got Bush to agree to meeting me on a private basis. At that time  the campaign was gradually entering an intensified stage. That  tycoon, who was a Consultative Committee member, met Bush first.  When discussing the presidential election, Bush himself said  that he was not very confident, for most of the several previous  Vice Presidents who had run had failed. Bush believed that he  himself was unlikely to become an exception. But as it turned  out, he won.    Later there were some changes in regard to Bush's plan to  meet me. According to a source, the U.S. State Department argued  that the meeting had to be an official one. I was asked about my  opinion on the matter. I said to myself that an official meeting  had to be approved by the State Council in Beijing and that  there was not enough time. Thus the plan was shelved. Later,  after being elected, Bush sent me a letter, expressing his  regret for not being able to meet me and giving me two small  gifts emblazoned with his name to serve as souvenirs.    My impression of the U.S. presidential election was: only by  making its platform in line with the wishes of the majority of  the people and the electorate, would a political party have the  possibility of coming into power. Surely, platforms used during  the campaigns often are not or cannot be implemented, and some  have even to be fundamentally altered, as candidates often break  their promises after being elected. Nevertheless, voters are  very practical and short-sighted, resulting in the defect of  campaigning parties' writing a great deal of "checks" in order  to win votes while disregarding all consequences. In order to  win votes, political leaders pay great attention to having  contact with all sectors of society, whether in ordinary time or  during election campaigns. Bush's letter to me seemed to have  been drafted and typed by his secretary and signed by him; the  small gifts might have been specially prepared. He treated, in  such a manner, someone whom he did not know and had had only an  indirectly set appointment, and made appropriate responses to  people, whatever social strata they belonged to--all this gave  people the impression that he was courteous and respectful to  people. Generally Chinese leaders would not handle things in  such a manner. It is said that generally American leaders give  responses to their own countrymen in the same manner. This not  only shows their respect for their voters, treating them as  equals, but also serves to increase "resources" for election  campaigns. This is a phenomenon demonstrating the superiority of  democratic politics.  <H3>  The June Fourth Storm. -- An Angry Tide of Patriotism (Part  One): Sending Videos of the Student Movement, Made by the Hong  Kong Media, to Zhao Ziyang </H3>   In January 1989, Fang Lizhi wrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping,  demanding the granting of amnesty and calling for the release of  Wei Jingsheng, who had been arrested for involvement in the  Xidan Democracy Wall activities. During February and March, some  well-known cultural figures and a number of first-rate natural  scientists at home wrote their respective joint open letters to  the chief responsible persons of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council, expressing support for Fang Lizhi's proposal  and raising a series of democratic demands: reform the political  system, release political prisoners, and terminate the practice  of convicting people of ideological crimes.    Many of those people were CPC members, and some were  deputies  to the National People's Congress and members of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference. Thus the actions aroused strong reactions at home  and abroad. Many famous figures of the intellectual and  scientific communities overseas responded by starting a  signature drive to show solidarity. The political climate in  China resembled to a great extent the situation before a huge  storm. While in Hong Kong, I also strongly felt that a political  storm was coming.    I asked the propaganda department of the Hong Kong Branch of  the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY to collect and sort out information about  reactions from Hong Kong society and international reactions,  and started the practice of transmitting to the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council information about the outside  world through the facsimile transmission device of the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY (the small branch) on a daily basis, providing them  with some reference information in the hope that they would take  note of outside reactions when handling the matter.    On 15 April 1989 Hu Yaobang died. University students of  Beijing began to go to the streets. On 22 April, the day of the  Hu Yaobang Memorial Meeting, tens of thousands of students  gathered at Tiananmen Square. They sent three representatives to  kneel down in front of the Great Hall of the People, demanding  that responsible persons of the center meet them. But no one  from the center went to meet them. I and several deputy  directors of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY saw  the scene on Hong Kong television. We all thought that such a  way of handling things was not appropriate. Why could Zhao  Ziyang and Li Peng not have come out to meet the students? If  they themselves did not want to meet the students, they could  have sent a secretary to meet the students. It was totally  incomprehensible why they should have totally ignored the likely  effects, letting students keep kneeling for several hours.  Students acted out of their patriotism and their support for the  reform and opening policy of the Communist Party of China. What  was there to fear? Why should CPC leaders be afraid of meeting  the masses and students? We really did not approve of the  central responsible persons' approach which was characterized by  being divorced from the masses.    Beijing students progressed from carrying out marches and  presenting petitions to staging a sit-in in Tiananmen Square,  and from demanding a meeting with central leaders to demanding a  dialogue with central leaders; but all the while the leaders in  Beijing failed to deal with the developments in a timely and  appropriate manner. The situation was getting increasingly  grave, and there had been strong expressions of dissatisfaction  from the outside world. I was extremely worried, and specially  asked people to deliver to Zhao Ziyang and the Central Committee  Secretariat, videos, made by Hong Kong reporters in Beijing and  broadcast in Hong Kong, of the student movement in Beijing, and  materials on reactions from the Hong Kong media, in the hope of  arousing their attention so that they might dispose of the  matter appropriately at an early date. After seeing them, Zhao  Ziyang said to the delivery people that they provided more  information than he got in Beijing and requested that such  videos and materials continue to be sent to him from time to  time. [End of Installment No. 115]  <H5>  [28 Aug 93 p 3] </H5>   [Text] An Angry Tide of Patriotism (Part Two): The  Political Bureau Meeting Determined That the Student Movement  Was a Case of Turmoil; Li Peng Completely Jettisoned the CPC's  Glorious Tradition of Relying on the Masses    On 23 April, Zhao Ziyang left Beijing to visit Pyongyang,  North Korea. The next day Li Peng gathered and presided over a  Political Bureau meeting, at which Li Ximing [2621 6932 6900],  secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, and Chen  Xitong [7115 1585 0681], mayor of Beijing, reported to the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on the student  movement in Beijing. They exaggerated the situation, or even  distorted facts and gave false information. As a result, the  meeting concluded that the student movement constituted a  "serious organized and planned political struggle guided by an  anti-Communist, anti-Socialist program," and that the movement  was a case of "turmoil" in terms of its nature. After the  meeting, Li Peng told Yang Shangkun that he would report to Deng  Xiaoping. On 25 April, Deng Xiaoping met Yang Shangkun and Li  Peng. After listening to reports, Deng expressed agreement to  their views and the Political Bureau meeting's conclusion on the  nature of the student movement.    After Deng Xiaoping expressed his attitude, on the same  night  Li Peng asked the party and government institutions of Beijing  Municipality to transmit the decision made by Deng Xiaoping and  the Political Bureau meeting, and informed the provincial and  municipal party committees by telegram. He also asked Hu Qili to  immediately arrange for RENMIN RIBAO to write an editorial. On  the next day, that is, 26 April, RENMIN RIBAO published an  editorial, entitled "It Is Necessary to Take a Clearcut Stand  Against Turmoil," publicly claiming that the student movement  "is a planned conspiracy, is a case of turmoil, and is in  essence aimed at fundamentally rejecting the leadership of the  Communist Party of China and the socialist system." On the same  day Beijing and Shanghai held their respective meetings each  attended by 10,000 CPC-member cadres, calling on all CPC members  to take part in this serious political struggle.    Upon learning the news, I felt that something was very  wrong.  According to analysis made at that time, a small array of  foreign forces and anti-Communist forces did get involved in the  student movement, and some even played some behind-the-scenes  manipulation in the student movement, but the student movement  was patriotic. The conclusion that the student movement as a  whole was a case of turmoil represented an exaggeration of the  seriousness of the problem, and an action of striking at a very  large number of people. This action was not proper in view of  the actual situation, and was very unwise.    After being published, the editorial aroused strong  reactions  from cadres at large and the broad masses. On 27 April, nearly  100,000 college students of Beijing demonstrated in the streets.  The CPC Beijing Municipal Committee had already issued, through  organizations at the various levels, strict orders of dismissing  and transferring those taking moderate actions to support  turmoil instigators and of arresting and punishing those taking  energetic actions to support turmoil instigators, but the  students still received warm responses and support from the  broad masses of residents and cadres when conducting marches.  Before 26 April, the student movement mainly targeted Li Peng.  After the publication of the editorial, things began to change,  and Deng Xiaoping began to be targeted directly. Some children  of senior cadres, close to the Deng family, spread the idea that  "Deng Xiaoping was sold out by Li Peng." The student movement  "escalated," thereby forcing Yuan Mu, Chen Xitong, and others to  carry out a "dialogue" with student representatives. Their rigid  attitude characterized by the insistence that the student  movement was a case of "turmoil" not only failed to moderate the  student movement, but added fuel to the flames. On 13 May  several hundred students began a hunger strike as part of the  petition effort. Students on hunger strike numbered several  thousand on the next day. Tiananmen Square, Beijing, and the  entire country were seething and were in an uproar. The were  reports, from time to time, of students fainting and being sent  to hospitals. The number of students on hunger strike continued  to increase. Some even began to refuse to drink water. It was  such a grave situation that forced Li Peng to come out to carry  out a dialogue with student representatives. As shown by live  television coverage, Li Peng put on executive airs and assumed a  condescending attitude, while demonstrating no trace at all of  the CPC's practice of mass work. Especially, on the one hand Li  Peng told student representatives: "Neither the government nor  the CPC Central Committee has ever said that you students are  creating turmoil." On the other hand he refused to accept the  demands contained in the petitions made by the students on  hunger strike, would not conduct any substantive dialogue with  student representatives, and refused to recognize that the  students were being patriotic. Li Peng also said that he would  express his own views at an appropriate time, thereby  effectively declaring that RENMIN RIBAO's "conclusion on the  nature of the movement" would not be changed. He continued to  threaten representatives of the students on hunger strike,  behaving in an abominable way. The scene was really unbearable  to watch. After seeing the scene, I and some of my colleagues at  the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY were totally disgusted, believing that  the CPC's tradition of believing in and relying on the masses  was completely jettisoned by Li Peng. It would had been better  that he had not come out to conduct the dialogue. After he  engaged in dialogue, the situation was certain to further  deteriorate.    Just a day later, on the night of 19 May, Li Peng, shouting  at the top of his voice, declared at the meeting of party,  government, and military cadres in Beijing that the student  movement was a case of turmoil, and that it was necessary to  fight back against turmoil. Yang Shangkun claimed that troops  were already being ordered to enter Beijing. Zhao Ziyang did not  participate in the meeting. I felt that Zhao Ziyang might have  already been driven out of power and that the situation would  deteriorate quickly.    The next day the marshall law decree signed by Li Peng was  made public, triggering even more powerful resistance activities  in Beijing and Hong Kong, and the situation became even more  serious. In Beijing a million people staged marches and  demonstrations, demanding the rescinding of the marshall law  decree. The slogan, "Down with Li Peng," was heard all over  Beijing, and even some workers at the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council took part in the activities, holding banners.  The powerfulness and scale were unprecedented. [End of  Installment No. 116]</p>

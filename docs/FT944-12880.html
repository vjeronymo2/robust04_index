			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Santer's choice packs a political punch: Future president's priority was a Commission that worked as a team Nobody said it was going to be easy. But after a day of tough talking inside Senningen Castle in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Mr Jacques Santer emerged with a deal on the division of portfolios in the new expanded Commission. The agreement boosted the authority of Mr Santer, a last-minute compromise candidate earlier this year to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the Commission; but the cost could prove high if a disgruntled Sir Leon Brittan carries out his threat to resign after being stripped of his most prized portfolio, eastern Europe. The question is whether Mr Santer - known as the man who never says No in his native Luxembourg - pursued an early deal at the expense of downgrading one of the few effective performers in the outgoing Delors Commission. Supporters of Sir Leon leave no doubt that their commissioner was treated poorly, with little regard to his track record in championing closer relations with central and eastern Europe, perhaps the most important task for the EU over the next five years. 'On a conservative estimate, Sir Leon's workload drops 30 per cent,' says one supporter. 'It could be as high as 60 per cent.' Those more sympathetic to Mr Santer argue that the president-designate tried everything to broker a deal between Sir Leon and Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch commissioner who is the big winner in Saturday's share-out of responsibilities in external relations. 'We went through all sorts of different options,' said a senior Santer aide, 'but the eastern European dossier turned into a beauty contest.' Under the deal, Mr Van den Broek gains control of economic and political relations with central and eastern Europe, as well as retaining responsibility for the common foreign and security policy, subject to the authority of President Santer. Sir Leon retains control of his multilateral trade dossier, which includes the setting-up of the new World Trade Organisation, as well as relations with North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, South Korea, Macao and Taiwan. Mr Santer made clear on Saturday evening that his overriding concern was to ensure that the new Commission works as a team when it moves into office next January, pending a vote of approval from the European parliament. He also sought to assert his authority by selecting three areas in which he intends to be primus inter pares: common security and foreign policy; preparations for monetary union; and institutional issues ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty. Mr Santer said the need to end personal fiefdoms was even more urgent now that the Commission was expanded from the present 17 commissioners to 21, assuming that Sweden and Norway join Austria and Finland in approving EU membership in next month's referendums. Most Brussels insiders agree that Mr Santer - egged on by his influential chief of staff Mr Jim Cloos - was right to end the artificial division between political and economic affairs inside the Commission's external relations apparatus, and to adopt a division on geographical lines. The divisions led to constant sniping between supporters of Mr Van den Broek and Sir Leon in Brussels. Abroad, it led to two commissioners landing in successive weeks in eastern European capitals to talk policy. Yet the row over Sir Leon's treatment risks obscuring a broader judgment about the new Commission, its organisation and its likely future direction. As Mr Santer noted on Saturday, even the harshest Euro-sceptics cannot accuse the new Commission of being packed with bureaucrats. It is highly political: a former prime minister (Mrs Edith Cresson of France) sits alongside a man who almost became prime minister (Mr Neil Kinnock, the former UK Labour party leader). There are also five women, up from one in the outgoing Delors Commission. None of the women is a shrinking violet. Ms Ritt Bjerregaard, who wins environment and nuclear safety in eastern Europe, enjoys a formidable reputation in her native Denmark; so too, Ms Anti Gradin, the Swedish diplomat, and Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, the German trade union leader. Watch out for Ms Emma Bonino, the Italian abortion rights activist who will handle the hitherto neglected consumer affairs dossier. A second leitmotif is Mr Santer's calculated effort to win Yes votes in the referendums in Scandinavia. Norway is rewarded with the fisheries portfolio, a vital national interest. Sweden wins the increasingly important judicial and immigration portfolio. Mr Santer has also shown sensitivity to France which was worried about losing influence with the departure of Mr Delors. Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, a technocrat, takes over the plum job of economic and monetary affairs, putting him at the centre of the plan to create a single currency by the end of the century. Mr Mario Monti, the distinguished Italian economist, will take charge of the single market, including fiscal policy and capital movements; while Mr Kinnock, who has never held a ministerial post, is delighted with the transport portfolio which includes the planned multi-billion Ecu rail and road trans-European networks. At first sight, the choice of Mr Franz Fischler of Austria to take over the agriculture dossier is surprising. Few could have expected a new member state to take charge of agriculture which accounts for more than half of the Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) budget. But no-one showed much interest in taking on a job which is bound to involve further unpopular reforms in the next five years, partly to prepare for the entry of the central European countries at the turn of the century. So Mr Santer handed the job to Mr Fischler, an old political ally. Despite the call for collegiality, it is possible to predict friction in some areas. Mr Padraig Flynn, the wily Irishman who runs social policy, is uneasy about Mrs Cresson running training and education. Nor were some commissioners delighted that the 10 socialist and social democrat commissioners met ahead of the Saturday session in Luxembourg. Yet the real test will be how Sir Leon intends to work with Mr Van den Broek, should he decide to stay on. Those who know him predict that Sir Leon would find it impossible to resist carving out a role in central and eastern Europe, using his commercial trade instruments. In that case, Mr Santer, who left most of the dirty work to Mr Cloos during the portfolio negotiations, would have his authority tested to the full.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          SANTER'S HELPERS: THE NEW EXPANDED EUROPEAN COMMISSION  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LUXEMBOURG            FRANCE                      GERMANY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Jacques Santer, 54    Edith Cresson, 60           Martin Bangemann, 59 President             Science &amp; research,         Industry, information                       training competitiveness    technology,                                                   telecommunications  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Yves-Thilbault de           Monika Wulf-Manthies,                       Silguy, 46                  52                       Economic &amp; monetary         Regional aid                       affairs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ITALY                 SPAIN                       UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mario Monti, 51       Manuel Marin, 45            Sir Leon Brittan, 55 Internal market,      Latin America,              Multilateral trade, financial services,   Mediterranean,              relations with taxation              Middle East, Asia           developed countries  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Emma Bonino, 46       Marcelino Oreja, 59         Neil Kinnock, 52 Consumer Affairs,     Institutional affairs,      Transport humanitarian aid      culture, media  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BELGIUM               DENMARK                     IRELAND  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Karel van Miert, 52   Ritt Bjerregaard, 53        Padraig Flynn, 54 Competition           Environment                 Employment, social                                                   policy  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GREECE                NETHERLANDS                 PORTUGAL  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Christos Papoutsis,   Hans van den Broek, 57      Joao de Deus Pinheiro, 41                    Central &amp; eastern           59 Energy, small         Europe                      Relations with companies, tourism                                developing countries  ----------------------------------------------------------------------        THE NEWCOMERS: Austria and Finland have voted to join,           Sweden and Norway vote next month on whether to                           accede in January  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AUSTRIA             NORWAY           FINLAND           SWEDEN  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Franz Fischler,     Thorval          Erkki Lilkanen,   Anita Gradin, 51 48                  Stoltenberg, 63  44                Immigration, Agriculture         Fisheries        Budget,           judicial affairs                                      personnel,                                      administration  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

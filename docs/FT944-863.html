			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Technology: Health checks for testing times - FT writers offer words of wisdom on food, drink, nutrition and the legend you're likely to be taking part in this weekend If the holiday season is likely to leave you feeling ill, worried or guilty, the world's home healthcare industry is ready to spring to your aid. On offer are a host of diagnostic tools to help you find out whether you have high blood pressure or too much cholesterol, have ovulated or are pregnant. There is no home sanity test yet. But the experts say some products may not be reliable, and could even be illegal. After all the revelry and stress, you might be tempted to buy cholesterol and blood pressure testing kits. High cholesterol levels are associated with high fat diets and with heart disease. High blood pressure can lead to heart problems, stroke, kidney and eye disease. Tests on the UK market range from a Pounds 7 cholesterol test - a drop of your blood spilt on special paper will change its colour according to your cholesterol level - to a Pounds 100 computerised blood pressure machine. The problem, according to the British Medical Association, is that there are many contributory factors to heart disease including family history, diet and exercise. 'You are not getting the whole picture with these devices,' says the BMA. Trials by the Consumers' Association found the cholesterol tests on the market give 'variable' results but blood pressure machines are 'promising'. Nevertheless, the British Heart Foundation said that 'tests can be unreliable' because measurements might not be taken 'under ideal conditions'. It said that the machines 'might cause panic or offer false reassurance'. There is better technology in home pregnancy and ovulation kits. These work by measuring variations in hormone levels in a woman's urine. The Family Planning Association says that today's pregnancy tests are 'very accurate'. It warned, however, that confirmation of ovulation does not mean that a couple can have children. The woman's egg might fail to implant, for example, or the man might be infertile. There is not, as yet, a home fertility kit for men. For those worried they might have been infected with HIV, home HIV testing kits are on the market. However, the Terence Higgins Trust, the Aids charity, says they are unreliable, inappropriate and illegal in the UK. It says that anyone who thinks they might harbour the virus should seek professional advice and the counselling that may follow a positive diagnosis. Perhaps a better idea than home kits is a subscription to on-line computerised medical help. Compuserve has medical discussion groups, diagnosis forums and drugs databases. But in response to worries that ordinary folk might use a distant computer instead of a doctor, it requires subscribers to first acknowledge they have read a screen saying the information is 'solely for your education and enrichment'.</p>

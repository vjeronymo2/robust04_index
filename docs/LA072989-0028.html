			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: FREDDIE JACKSON AT GREEK: HIP-THRUSTS, GOOD WILL  </P> <P> Freddie Jackson is a cuddlesome charmer, no doubt, and that's the core of his  appeal. When those wild vocal notes start flying all over the map -- some of  them making their destination, some not -- it's easy to start wishing for the  precision and soul-assured technique of a Luther Vandross. And when Jackson  starts to dance, thrusting his pelvis hither and yon like a Chippendale's  dancer who's fallen off the Pritikin diet wagon, well, it's not exactly a  lust-inducing sight.  </P> <P> But Thursday night at the Greek Theatre, Jackson -- resplendent in baby-blue  sequins and satin -- put on a show that engendered so much good will among his  audience that it was easy to overlook a few out-of-control notes and overly  zealous hip thrusts.  </P> <P> When Jackson let a hyperventilating woman in the front row wipe his sweaty brow  with a towel and then gleefully crowed, "I messed her up!" it didn't sound like  smug arrogance -- he seemed genuinely awed that he could have that kind of  effect on someone.  </P> <P> Opening act Vesta Williams is another performer in the give-'em-more-more-more  mold. Dancing so exuberantly at one point that she busted a bra strap, the  L.A.-based vocalist was undoubtedly raw. She also could grow into the kind of  singer mentioned in the same breath as Patti LaBelle and Aretha Franklin.  </P> <P> The bill also plays the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim tonight.

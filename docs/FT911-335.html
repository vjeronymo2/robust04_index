			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Mr Lilley and competition MR Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, has repeatedly emphasised his commitment to free competition. However, the effectiveness of government policies intended to promote that objective is blunted by a number of anomalies and shortcomings. Mr Lilley should use his promised statement on competition issues, due in the next two months, to set out a more coherent approach. His first priority should be to end the confusion created by his own ill-judged efforts to tighten scrutiny of UK acquisitions by foreign state-controlled bidders. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has blocked only one of the five such deals referred to it - and then chiefly on grounds of market share. As Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading put it last week, the discrepancy between Mr Lilley's stance and the MMC's findings has thrown merger policy into disarray. The legality of Mr Lilley's position is also doubtful. The Rome Treaty explicitly prohibits discrimination between private and publicly-owned companies, and state control is not recognised as a criterion by the European Community's merger policy, which takes precedence over national regulations in controlling large deals. That is not to dismiss Mr Lilley's underlying anxiety that state-owned companies enjoy unfair financial advantages. But the sensible solution is to impose more transparency and discipline on governments' dealings with nationalised industries, as EC competition authorities are seeking to do. New legislation Britain also needs to align itself with EC practice by giving the OFT powers against cartels comparable to those enjoyed by Brussels. At present, it is difficult to curb UK restrictive trade practices unless they involve wider Community interests. A White Paper proposing to correct this anomaly has gathered dust for almost two years. Mr Lilley should commit himself to introducing legislation in the next Parliament. The biggest challenge, however, is to ensure the long-term consistency and impartiality of competition policy. That can be assured only if it is insulated from the unpredictable impact of short-run political influences. As an outspoken critic of government intervention, Mr Lilley should recognise the value of reforms to entrench that principle. Strengthen OFT The first should be to strengthen the role of the OFT, at present mainly an adviser to government. It should be given at least as much autonomy as regulators of privatised utilities, which are formally not part of Whitehall and report directly to Parliament. Like them, the OFT should also have the authority to refer cases to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. That power should, as a minimum, extend to mergers, where the wide discretion at present enjoyed by the trade and industry secretary is hardly conducive to firm and consistent policy. An independent OFT, immune from the intense political lobbying which often accompanies large mergers, would be far better placed to decide objectively whether they should be referred. Clarity and efficiency would be further served by publishing the principles and precedents employed by the MMC and by requiring its members to serve on a full-time basis. There may also be a case for entrusting the OFT with some surveillance over the regulators of privatised industries. Though the record of the regulators to date is encouraging, their performance should be subject to independent scrutiny. That is particularly true in industries such as telecommunications, where the government retains influence. In some respects, the power of national competition authorities is being eroded by Brussels. That makes it all the more important, however, that they pursue policies consistent with the EC approach and enforce them just as vigorously. If the stiffer competition expected after 1992 is to produce its full benefits, it needs to be promoted within countries as well as between them. This is a point that the Labour party, as well as Mr Lilley, should keep in mind.</p>

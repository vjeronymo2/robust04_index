			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz focuses on commercial vehicles Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading truck maker, is planning to invest more than DM5bn (Dollars 3.16bn) in the research and development of new commercial vehicles between 1994 to 1998, Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive, said yesterday. The group will launch two van ranges in Europe next year, and introduce a new-generation heavy truck range in 1996. Mercedes-Benz is embarking on an aggressive expansion of its light commercial vehicle operations in Europe, with the aim of increasing its van production capacity by between 40 and 50 per cent during the next two years, to around 150,000 a year from 100,000 in 1994. It also plans to internationalise its light commercial vehicle operations. It wants to start producing in South America, Mr Bernd Gottschalk, managing director of the commercial vehicle division, said yesterday. The new T1 medium-weight van range (2.5-4.6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) to be launched in Europe next year will also be produced in Argentina, starting in 1996. In Europe, the capacity for this vehicle is being increased from around 75,000 to 100,000, competing with rivals such as the Ford Transit and the Volkswagen Transporter. In Argentina, Mercedes-Benz will build toward capacity of between 20,000 and 25,000 units a year, enough to supply the Brazilian market as well. The group has begun negotiations on two ambitious joint ventures in China for the production of heavy trucks and buses and coaches, said Mr Werner. It has entered a feasibility study with Yangzhou Motor Coach Manufacturing (YMC), the biggest Chinese bus and coach producer, for the formation of a joint venture. The target here will be the production of up to 12,000 bus chassis and 6,000 large coaches a year. Such an operation would exceed Mercedes-Benz's existing Brazilian bus and coach operations, which produced 14,600 vehicles last year. It would also be twice as big as its European bus and coach operations in Germany and Turkey. Separately, it is investigating the formation of a joint venture to produce heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) in China with its current licensee partner, Norinco.</p>

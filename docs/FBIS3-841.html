Tomorrow's  maiden session is expected to examine the impact of the  devaluation of the CFA franc on the economies of members.    Many observers believe that by deciding in July 1992 in  Dakar, Senegal, to transform the West African Monetary Union,  UMOA, into UEMOA, the heads of the member states demonstrated  their determination to consolidate their monetary union against  the background of an international economic environment  unfavorable to the continent.    The head of state was accompanied on the trip by several  cabinet members, including the ministers of finance, commerce,  mines and energy, as well as the secretary of state for  cooperation.</p>

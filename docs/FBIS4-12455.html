			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lebanese Army's deserted barracks in  al-Nabatiyah came under an artillery barrage from Israeli  positions in Tallat 'Ali al-Tahir at 0945 today. The barrage  was accompanied by bursts of heavy machine-gun fire from  adjacent hills and valleys. Rounds landed in the vicinity of  al-Mansuri from Israeli positions in al- Bayyadah.    Israeli helicopters flew over the area at midnight last  night, illuminating the area from al-Mansuri, Majdal Zun,  Zibqin, and Kafra, up to Yatar.    An Israeli gunboat cruised the coast of Tyre. Head of the  fishermen syndicate in Tyre said that the fishermen are  encountering difficulties fishing because Israeli gunboats  intercept their fishing boats.</p>

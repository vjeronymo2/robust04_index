			<p>SUMMARY                                  Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's early  March visit to Iran as part of a five-nation tour has served to  underscore Beijing's expanding bilateral ties with Tehran.  Although Qian hinted at Beijing's interest in supporting regional  economic cooperation efforts, he adopted a neutral stance on  Iran's role in this regard and appeared wary of Iran's desire to  lead efforts to resolve the political crisis in Afghanistan.                             END SUMMARY      As the latest high-level Chinese visitor to come to Iran (See  Note 1), Qian used his 4-6 March official goodwill visit to  reaffirm the value Beijing attaches to its expanding relationship  with Tehran.  Meeting with his host, Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati on 5 March, Qian reiterated Beijing's intention to  further deepen bilateral ties, noting that the Chinese Government  "pays great attention" to developing "friendly and cooperative"  relations with Iran (Xinhua, 5 March).  Although no specific  agreements were reported signed during the visit, Xinhua's  account of the meeting reported that the two foreign ministers  said that China and Iran have agreed to "further enhance" their  cooperative relations in "various fields including politics,  economics, and trade."      (Note 1)  Qian's visit was the latest in a series of high-level  exchanges between China and Iran in recent years--including  visits to Iran by PRC Premier Li Peng and then-President Yang  Shangkun in 1991, then-Minister of Defense Qin Jiwei in 1992, and  Politburo member and Vice Premier Li Lanqing last summer; and  trips to China by Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati and President  Rafsanjani in 1992.      Qian's visit comes on the heels of a significant expansion of  economic ties between the two countries promoted by Vice Premier  Li Lanqing's visit to Iran last July.  Li signed a memorandum of  understanding to provide Iran with a $100 million loan for  reconstruction efforts, while Iran agreed to help the PRC "reform  its oil refineries" to allow China to import more crude oil from  Iran (Xinhua, 6 July 1993).  Underscoring progress in developing  economic ties, Xinhua accounts during Qian's visit noted that PRC  exports to Iran had grown from textiles and light industrial  products to "heavy machinery" and "high technology" and that in  1993 trade volume between China and Iran rose to $712 million, a  63.2 percent increase over the previous year (4,6 March).      Caution on Nuclear Cooperation      Apparently reflecting Beijing's sensitivity to recent Western  news reports about possible Chinese nuclear exports to Iran, PRC  media departed from recent practice and reported no remarks by  Qian on China's nuclear cooperation with Iran.  By contrast,  during Li Lanqing's visit to Iran last July, PRC media quoted him  as "reiterating" Beijing's standard claim that nuclear projects  with Iran are "only" for the "peaceful use of nuclear energy"  (Xinhua, 6 July 1993).  Beijing had announced its decision to  provide nuclear power plants to Iran during President  Rafsanjani's September 1992 visit to China (Xinhua, 10 September  1992) and since then Chinese media have claimed that the plants  will be the largest that the PRC has built abroad (Xinhua, 22  February 1993; Beijing radio, 6 June 1993).  On 19 January, the  Hong Kong-based PRC-affiliated wire service Zhongguo Tongxun She  reported that the president of the China National Nuclear  Corporation "disclosed" that China expected to begin work this  year on the installation of two 300,000 kilowatt nuclear power  generating units it had agreed to provide Iran.      Hints at Regional Economic Cooperation      Although Qian expressed Beijing's support for greater regional  economic interaction in general terms, he stopped short of  satisfying Iran's apparent efforts to elicit a public endorsement  of the Iranian-supported Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO),  an attempt to create a regional economic alliance similar to the  European common market.  In contrast to Iranian media reports  before and during the visit that attributed to Qian statements of  explicit support for the ECO (Tehran Hamshahri, 22 February;  Tehran Abrar, 1 March; Salam, 5 March), Xinhua quoted Qian, at a  press conference on 6 March, as observing only that "all"  countries he had visited during his tour are trying to "improve  their economic situation" and are "ready for regional  cooperation" (6 March).      China's Concern over Afghanistan      PRC media reporting on the visit also suggested that Beijing and  Tehran do not see eye to eye on the question of resolving the  Afghan crisis.  Suggesting that Beijing is wary of Iranian  efforts to impose a settlement on its terms, Qian failed to  endorse Velayati's proposal, made at their meeting on 5 March,  that Afghanistan's "neighboring countries" should play a greater  role in bringing an end to the civil war there because of the  "failure" of U.N. mediation efforts (Xinhua, 5 March).  Instead,  Qian stated only that Beijing was "deeply concerned" about the  Afghan situation and repeated China's standard position on such  regional disputes, calling on "all factions" to resolve the  confict peacefully.  By contrast, in Qian's 22 February meeting  with Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali in Islamabad  at the beginning of his tour, Qian expressed his "appreciation"  for Pakistan's efforts to "settle differences" among the various  Afghan factions and "restore peace and stability" there (Xinhua,  22 February).      Implications     PRC media commentary on Qian's visit underscores Beijing's  continuing efforts to develop closer bilateral ties with Iran,  particulary in economic and trade relations.  At the same time,  although Beijing supports more regional cooperation in principle,  it appears concerned about greater Iranian involvement in the  countries along China's borders.

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Horne displays her vocal skill MARILYN HORNE, in the sunset years of her career, maintains a formidable armoury of vocal skills. Just how formidable was underlined after the final item of Wednesday's Covent Garden song recital, an admirably full (and now even rather unfashionable) two-hours' worth which had been sung, the singer revealed, with a chest-cold so bad she had been on the point of cancelling her London visit. Up to that moment one's evaluation was that Miss Horne had spent two hours giving a perfectly astonishing demonstration of how to make the most of little. The formerly extensive and voluptuously ample instrument seemed itself only in the lowest ranges, and ventures above had been carefully restricted (a single top G being the climax of the first half), yet by means of technical skill and communicative address in exactly judged combination she drew an exhilarating effect from every song she sang. Even before the start Miss Horne and her excellent pianist Martin Katz had earned one's approval by choosing a genuinely interesting and varied programme: Rossini, Vivaldi, Pauline Viardot and William Bolcom were its composers. Rossini opened and closed the proceedings; this is his anniversary year, and Miss Horne is of course one of the most celebrated of living Rossinians, but in both groups it was the quietly reflective songs that best showed her considerable powers of characterisation, colour and shading: a short setting from Dante of the Francesca da Rimini tale, an extraordinary elegy on one note entitled 'Adieux a la vie'. This singer has often seemed to me, indeed, a performer with two distinct and sometimes unreconciled personalities. The first is that of a serious and even rather restrained artist, skilful in the many languages she sings (in the fascinating group of Schumann-like Lieder by Pauline Viardot, her utterance of German was beautifully weighted); the second, thrower-out of florid fast scales, turns and shakes in abundance and thunderer of trombone chest notes, is a sock-it-to-'em vulgarian. On this occasion, health constraints were posing constant obstacles in the way of the latter Marilyn Horne - the single exercise in vocal bravura, 'Sorge l'irato nembo' from Vivaldi's Orlando furioso, proved impressive but by no means the tour de force of former years. And perhaps for this reason there seemed a far less stark dichotomy in the singer's artistic styles and ambitions. She remains a wonderfully frank, forceful humorist: in a selection from Bolcom's easily lyrical and well-turned I Will Breathe a Mountain cycle (1990), her varieties of native-American inflection, from the openly raucous to the quietly rueful with a hundred stages in between, were a joy to hear.</p>

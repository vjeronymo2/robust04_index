			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Nai: "Tax Reform Pays Dividends, Causes Trivial </F> Inflation"]    [Text] Tax reform has paid dividends just five months  after the new system was introduced.    The reformed tax laws have not spurred on inflation as some  predicted. Instead, it successfully increased central finance.    Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said the new system has almost  fortified government revenue while causing only a negligible  blip in inflation.    He claimed that the reform has been generally successful.    Accompanied with changes in banking and at state  enterprises,  the tax reform aims at boosting dwindling state coffers and is  believed to be one of the biggest and boldest steps in 1994 -- a  crucial year for reform, leaders repeatedly say.    The focus is on re-distributing revenue between central and  local authorities and between the government and enterprises.    Taking the place of the contract system, by which localities  are only required to turn over a fixed amount of their revenue  to central coffers, the new collecting method breaks payments  into three parts: One to the central government, another to the  local administration, and the rest shared by both.    The reform has put enterprises of different ownerships in  the  same tax bracket of 33 per cent, creating a fair environment for  competition.    Meanwhile, the government cut the original 40 tax items in  half and focused mainly on collecting value-added taxes. This  turns out to be more scientific and easier to carry out .    However when the system first went into effect on January 1,  experts worried that double-digit inflation was not providing  the right climate for tax reform. Some feared it would fuel  inflation.    Theoretically the reform will trigger cost-push inflation  because some enterprises will transfer the increased tax payment  onto consumers.    But economists may rest assured.    The price hikes inherited from the second half of last year  can be traced to the above-target money supply, overheated  fixed-assets investment, and the raise in grain prices. "The  tax reform has not pulled up the inflation rates at a large  margin," said Minister Liu, also director of the State  Administration of Taxation (SAT).    Before the reform each ton of steel cost more than 4,000  yuan  ($461.9). The price actually fell thereafter.    Plainly, it is still the relationship between demand and  supply which sets prices.    And while city folk complain that vegetables are more  expensive than a few months ago, they can't blame this on the  tax reform. The rate on the retail sales of vegetables has  remained unchanged. But some wholesalers and retailers are  raising the prices of their goods and services at the excuse of  the reform.    To check the malpractice, the central government has  launched  nationwide inspection tours and enhanced supervision on price  management.    These measures have kept the reform on the right track.    According to the SAT, state tax revenue jumped 29.2 per cent  in the first four months, compared with the same period last  Year. Central finance revenue was 85 billion yuan ($981 million)  more than expenditures.    Generally speaking, most enterprises feel a lighter tax  burden.    In Fujian Province the new system cut 49 million yuan ($5.6  million) in taxes from state industrial enterprises, according  to the Economic Information Daily.    Foreign investors who find themselves paying the same amount  of taxes as last year have dispelled any misgivings toward the  reform.    But the new system also hits some firms hard. The Economic  Information Daily says that waterworks and those using farm  products as major raw materials in Fujian shoulder heavier taxes  than before. It suggests that the government consider lightening  the burden on these firms.    The SAT does, in fact, extend preferential measures to some  enterprises. Welfare-oriented enterprises, school-run  factories, and some commercial wholesalers are refunded part of  their tax; the value-added tax rate for things like coal and  farm products has dropped from 17 per cent to 13 per cent.    SAT says that some enterprises are crying about increased  taxes because the new system has stopped loopholes that used to  make tax-dodging possible.    At the same time, the central government is aware of some  technical problems in the enforcement of new taxes.    According to the People's Daily, only 40 per cent of stores  know how to correctly make out value-added tax receipts. Some  people in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai even print and  peddle fake receipts.    Also the paper criticized a few local authorities who don't  understand the new tax system. Their misunderstanding will  likely upset the new system, it said.</p>

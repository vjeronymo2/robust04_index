			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Business Law: The drive to greater efficiency HOWLS OF anguish often greet the announcement of the award of a government contract. If it goes to foreign competition, British industry claims it is being put at risk. If it goes to a British company foreign competitors claim it increases the cost to the British taxpayer. The most spectacular instances usually occur in the defence sector. Recent examples include the award to Vickers of the contract for the Army's main battle tank, the Challenger II , against strong US competition; and the success of the IBM-Westland consortium for the Navy's Merlin Helicopter over GEC and British Aerospace. Up to now, companies seeking government business have lobbied ministers, civil servants and MPs, and tried to get their case well aired in the press. But apart from looking at the fine print in the invitations to tender and the contract, their lawyers have been able to offer little assistance. This has now changed. The EC Public Procurement Directives have been given real teeth in the UK. Companies which can show that rules in the Directives have been broken can now go to the High Court and ask for an injunction to stop the contract being awarded. If the contract has already been awarded, they can claim damages. This is the effect of two Statutory Instruments, The Public Works Contracts Regulations 1991 and The Public Supply Contracts Regulations 1991 which came into force on December 21 last year. The main reason for the EC Directives is the long-standing concern of the European Commission in Brussels about national governments buying national. Public sector procurement expenditure in the EC is enormous, amounting to about 15 per cent of the sum of the EC countries' GDP. Only a tiny fraction has been awarded by national public sector purchasers to companies from other EC countries. One estimate is that every consumer in the EC would be Pounds 215 better off every year if open procurement rules were followed by the utilities - water, energy, transport and telecommunications - alone. But there are other reasons for the Directives apart from helping to create the single market. The EC Commission argues that open competition would lead to greater efficiency, cut costs and improve the international competitiveness of EC industries. The policy of the UK government is to support the directives. Speaking in June on competition policy as the main incentive to efficiency, Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, warned: 'We will not see the benefits from the single market programme until we dismantle restrictive national purchasing policies.' The US has had legislation to compel competition in government contracting for many years and 'bid protest litigation' is common in America. Contractors can protest to a number of tribunals, including the General Accounting Office, and the General Services Board of Contract Appeals, which have to render decisions in no more than 90 and 45 working days respectively. During last year, protesters obtained relief before the GSBCA in some 111 cases - 42 per cent of cases filed. In the UK the two new regulations give important rights to contractors and suppliers. The court may grant an interim order suspending the contract award procedure, and, if it is satisfied that there is a breach of the duty to comply with the regulations, it may set aside any decision of the contract awarding authority (unless the contract has been entered into) or award damages, or do both. There is no limit on the amount of damages which may be awarded. Clearly the costs of preparing an unsuccessful tender could be claimed. For a big project, these may be very substantial. It remains to be seen whether the courts will entertain claims for loss of opportunity and profits. The rules are complex, and differ between contracts for the supply of goods and those for works, such as building or engineering works. Contracts must be publicly advertised in the EC 'Official Journal'. Large purchasers will have to give advance notice of their purchasing plans for a year ahead. Discriminatory technical specifications are prohibited. Rules are laid down for contract award procedures. Preference is given to 'open procedures' whereby all interested suppliers can tender, and there are limits on the use which contracting authorities can make of 'restricted procedures' (whereby only those invited by the authority may submit tenders) and 'negotiated procedures' (whereby the authority negotiates only with the contractors or suppliers of its choice). Contracts must be awarded either to the offer with the lowest price or to the offer which is 'the most economically advantageous' to the contracting authority; the authority must select at the outset which basis it will use. Criteria for determing 'the most economically advantageous' offer are laid down. Contracting authorities must give information about contract awards including, in some cases, reasons for rejecting unsuccessful tenders. Minor contracts are excluded. The rules do not apply to contracts for public works with an estimated value of less than Ecu5m, or to supply contracts below Ecu200,000 (there is a lower threshold for those central government purchasing authorities which are subject to the Gatt Agreement on Government Procurement). The rules do not apply only to central government departments, but also to many other public bodies such as local authorities, police, fire, education and health authorities. From January 1, 1993, the rules will be extended in most EC member states to the utilities. Even though companies operating in these sectors may not be state owned, they will still be caught if they operate on the basis of 'special or exclusive rights'. The rules will therefore apply, for example, to the UK electricity companies, water companies, British Gas, BAA, British Telecom, Mercury and Racal Vodafone. In due course the rules will also extend to contracts for services as well as for works and supplies. The new UK regulations implement the so-called 'review directive' adopted by the EC Council in 1989, which required implementation by December 1, 1991. The UK is one of the first member states to do this. France has introduced a bill, but it has not yet been enacted. In Germany the legislative procedure is not expected to be completed until the end of 1992. There has been criticism that the UK is opening its doors before the others. However, other procedures (under which a number of cases have been hears in the European Court) may still give a remedy, although these involve the Commission bringing an action against a member state and have not been very effective. And, in the Francovich judgment last November, the European Court of Justice held that a member state which has failed to implement a directive can be sued for damages. So will there be a flood of litigation? Only time will tell, but the stakes are high. Although duty to comply with the rules is owed only to contractors and suppliers which are nationals of and established in a member state, there are many European subsidiaries of US companies which will qualify under these criteria and whose executives will have had experience of exercising their rights in the US under the rules there. There is one notable exception in the rules - they do not apply to 'arms, munitions and war material' as defined in a list drawn up by the EC Commission under Article 223 of the Rome Treaty. Many of the biggest government contracts will not, therefore, be covered by these new rules. In a recent speech, Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, expressed dissatisfaction at this: 'It has meant, in practice, that the bulk of European defence orders are still filled by highly protected, high cost, national producers . . . It has led to grotesque distortions too in the sub-contracting field, because companies making defence related bids across national frontiers have to devise so-called 'off-setting' contracts in the customers' market'. Sir Leon recorded that the Commission has suggested the repeal of Article 223. In the meantime, it will be looking closely at any devices to protect so-called 'dual use' production with primarily civil applications. The Commission is showing considerable determination to impose a strict public procurement regime, and can be expected to continue to press for it to be extended also to all defence contracts.

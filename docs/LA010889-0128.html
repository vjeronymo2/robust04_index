			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FLAME ROOKIE FLEURY CONTINUES HOT START WITH 2 GOALS IN WIN  </P> <P> Rookie Theoren Fleury, whose reckless style of play has won the hearts of  Calgary fans, appears to be making the Flames a better team.  </P> <P> Fleury, 20, who was called up from the minors earlier this week and was playing  in only his second National Hockey League game, scored 2 goals Saturday night  as the Flames beat the Edmonton Oilers, 7-2, at Calgary.  </P> <P> "Oh, it was a really big thrill for me," he said of his first NHL goal. "It's  right up there with my experience in Moscow in the world junior championships  (last season). Maybe I'm finally getting my chance."  </P> <P> Doug Gilmour also scored 2 goals for the Flames, who moved 10 points ahead of  the second-place Kings and 12 ahead of the Oilers in the Smythe Division race.  </P> <P> Calgary Coach Terry Crisp said Saturday's performance by Fleury was a perfect  example of why he has become a crowd favorite.  </P> <P> "The little water bug, he was just scooting out there, and the fans love that  excitement," Crisp said. "He's colorful, talented and isn't afraid to hit. It's  nice for everyone on our club when someone comes up to the NHL and does what  he's doing."  </P> <P> Fleury had 3 assists in his NHL debut on Thursday in an 8-6 home victory over  the Kings.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the Flames opened a 7-0 lead before Craig Redmond ended goaltender  Rick Wamsley's shutout bid at 15:39 of the third period. Former King Jimmy  Carson scored the Oilers' other goal at 18:34.  </P> <P> Montreal 3, Boston 1 -- Brian Skrudland scored a goal and set up another to  help the Canadiens stretch their winning streak to 9 games with a victory over  the Bruins at Montreal.  </P> <P> Chris Chelios and Peter Svoboda also scored for the Canadiens, who are 5-0-1  against the Bruins this season. Montreal, which is 21 points ahead of  second-place Boston in the Adams Division, has outscored the Bruins, 18-7.  </P> <P> Boston peppered goaltender Patrick Roy with 21 of its 27 shots during the final  40 minutes but was unable to catch the Canadiens.  </P> <P> More than half the game was played with only linesmen Ron Finn and Mike Cvik  officiating. Referee Terry Gregson fractured his left collarbone and suffered a  slight concussion after colliding with Montreal's Stephane Richer midway  through the second period. He had to be taken off the ice on a stretcher.  </P> <P> Washington 6, Chicago 3 -- Mike Ridley had a team-record 6 assists, including  one on Kevin Hatcher's tiebreaking goal 4:01 into the third period, as the  Capitals beat the Blackhawks at Landover, Md.  </P> <P> The victory gave the Capitals a share of first place in the Patrick Division  with the New York Rangers, 1 point ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The  Capitals are 8-0-2 in their last 10 home games, and Chicago has lost 11  straight on the road.  </P> <P> New Jersey 5, Detroit 2 -- Sean Burke returned to the lineup and stopped 26  shots and Aaron Broten set up a goal that sparked a 3-goal second period as the  Devils beat the Red Wings at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> Burke, who had missed the past 4 games with a groin injury, was spectacular in  the net, allowing only third-period goals by Steve Yzerman and Joey Kocur. By  that time, New Jersey had opened a 5-0 lead en route to its second home victory  in as many nights.  </P> <P> Vancouver 7, Pittsburgh 5 -- Tony Tanti scored 3 goals in a 6:46 span of the  second period, and the Canucks tied a team record with 25 first-period shots as  they beat the Penguins at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> The Canucks, playing their third road game in four nights, ended a 0-2-1 slide  and knocked the Penguins into second place in the Patrick Division, a point  behind the New York Rangers and Washington Capitals.  </P> <P> New York Rangers 5, New York Islanders 1 -- Recently acquired Carey Wilson  continued his strong play with a second-period goal as the Rangers extended  their unbeaten streak to 7 games with the victory at Uniondale, N.Y.  </P> <P> Wilson, who has 11 points in 6 games since the Rangers acquired him in a Dec.  26 trade with the Hartford Whalers, scored his fourth goal as a Ranger and 15th  of the season. With Wilson in the lineup, the Rangers are 5-0-1.  </P> <P> Buffalo 6, Toronto 1 -- Rick Vaive scored 2 goals as the Sabres ended a 4-game  losing streak by beating the Maple Leafs at Toronto.  </P> <P> Vaive, who started his NHL career with the Maple Leafs, has 5 goals in 6 games  as a Sabre since being acquired from Chicago for Adam Creighton on Dec. 26.  </P> <P> St. Louis 7, Philadelphia 4 -- Ex-Flyer Peter Zezel scored twice, including the  go-ahead goal late in the second period, as the Blues beat the Flyers at St.  Louis.  </P> <P> Zezel, obtained by St. Louis from the Flyers on Nov. 29 for Mike Bullard,  directed a centering pass from Bernie Federko past goalie Ron Hextall for his  11th goal of the season at 14:40 of the second period, giving St. Louis a 5-4  lead.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSIGNING BLAME ON BUDGET MESS  </P> <P> Oil, at the present rate of consumption, runs out in about 100 years.  </P> <P> The vast reserves of the world's oil are in the Middle East. Even if we  developed every ounce of Alaskan and offshore oil that the United States  possesses, we would have created only a few years worth of energy. How then, in  the face of the Middle East crisis, can the President and Congress justify a  budget that gives $4-billion tax credit to the oil industry for development and  exploration, while simultaneously cutting from the budget solar and  renewable-energy tax credits?  </P> <P> ROBERT H.

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Truth of the Matter: Fleet Street's back to basics - Good old British hypocrisy over sex has returned Oh lord,' sighed the young minister as he scanned the headlines in the tabloids: 'I suppose one of these days I will have to confess I lost my virginity to a married woman'. Yes, it has been another of those weeks. Another establishment sex scandal and another resignation. The News of the World, a Sunday tabloid newspaper, started the moral witchhunt with its disclosures three months ago that a middle-ranking minister had fathered an illegitimate child. This week it claimed a bigger scalp - that of armed forces chief of staff and marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Peter Harding. In between there has been a spate of these so-called scandals. As media lights have been shone into dark corners of the private lives of the prominent, the results have frequently been farcical. One Tory MP was obliged to confess publicly he had shared a French hotel bed with a male friend - for no other reason than to save a few francs. But there has also been a more unsettling dimension. The revelations have not been confined to what was once seen as the grubbier end of the tabloid press. The so-called quality papers and the electronic media have picked up the same stories with gusto. Prurience and the public interest have often been treated as inseparable. For those of you who have spent the week on a saner planet, Sir Peter's misdemeanour was straightforward. A married man, he fell for an excitingly-dressed woman by the name of Miss Bienvenida Perez-Blanco. She now calls herself Lady Buck, a title bestowed through her brief marriage to the former Tory MP Sir Anthony Buck. Not much is worth saying about Lady Buck save that she claims to be of Spanish extraction, is in her middle 30s, dresses as if she is 20 years younger and has a penchant for influential men 30 years older. But Sir Peter fell for her. She took her story and his intimate love letters to the Sunday newspaper, which added a 'security' dimension to justify the invasion into his private life. She pocketed the money. He resigned. That, you might say, should be the end of it. But it will not be. Newspapers, battered by recession and a secular decline in readership, will not to let this one go. Sex sells newspapers. Sex in high places sells even more. When there is no alleged security angle, John Major's ill-fated back-to-basics initiative provides sufficient cover. Ministers insist children in the classroom are taught the difference between right and wrong. So the media reserves a right to highlight occasions when the politicians are not so discerning. But there has been another big change. Previously, the broadsheet press would have ignored most of the recent scandals. The Daily Telegraph would have tucked the odd piece on page three alongside reports of the more lurid cases before the courts. The Times would have remained aloof. The Guardian would have slipped in the odd detail through an account of what the tabloids were up to. Now the broadsheets vie with the rest. The Telegraph, for example, began this week with colour photographs of Sir Peter and his paramour on the front page. An editorial condemning the revelations as 'gutter journalism at its rankest' looked misplaced. Nor is television and radio news immune. Where once the bulletins would report such incidents only if and when someone resigned, they now take their lead from the tabloids. Prophecies of resignations and assertions of public interest become self-fulfilling. But something else is going on. This is more than a bout of mid-winter madness fuelled by shrewd commercial judgment. Politicians and generals have been having affairs since time immemorial. When an MP died suddenly a few years ago in the arms of his mistress not a word of the circumstances appeared in print. The opinion polls tell us that the moral puritanism of 'back to basics' has caught a popular mood. The marketing men are equally certain that the public appetite for salacious stories, and contempt for the establishment, has never been greater. The two are reconciled only with one rather sad explanation. The British penchant for hypocrisy has returned with a vengeance.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Taiwanese Airbus crash in Japan claims 261 lives A China Airlines aircraft bound from Taipei in Taiwan to Nagoya in western Japan crashed and exploded yesterday in Japan's second worst airline disaster. Officials said 261 people died and 10 survived when the Airbus A300-600R plunged headlong into the grass to the right of the runway at Nagoya Airport and burst into flames. Rescuers searching the charred wreckage took nine hours to account for the last people missing after the accident. Of the passengers, 158 were Japanese, 63 Taiwanese and 33 were of other nationalities, officials said. The immediate cause of the disaster was not known but airport control confirmed weather conditions were moderate and the view clear at the time. Witnesses said that the Airbus, whose wheels were not visible, approached the airport's runway, then suddenly turned its nose upwards as if to take off, before plunging within seconds almost at a 90-degree angle into the ground. The aircraft was scattered into bits across several hundred metres and the parts burst into a sea of flames which burned for 40 minutes as rescue teams tried to free passengers trapped inside. Airbus said last night three engineers had left for Nagoya. It declined to comment on possible causes of the accident, but said it was the first A300-600R to have crashed. Japan's worst air disaster was on August 12 1985 when a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 crashed into a mountain north-east of Tokyo, killing 520.</p>

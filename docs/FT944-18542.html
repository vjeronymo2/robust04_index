			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Although bond prices were supported by lower short-term money market rates and the sluggish stock market in the first half of last week, earlier gains were eroded by the release of stronger than expected industrial production figures on Thursday. This week, government bonds are expected to fluctuate in a narrow range. While weak stock prices and buying by public funds are likely to support the market, cautiousness over the speed of economic recovery is likely to weigh on prices. Meanwhile, a stronger yen could briefly prop up investor confidence. The rejection of calls to stop the yen's further rise by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the Japanese finance minister, by other countries at the Group of Seven summit last weekend, is likely to encourage buying of the currency. Aside from keeping import inflation lower, a higher yen has negative implications for corporate earnings, so may also hurt the stock market. Investment flow data for August, to be released this week with August current account figures, will provide some indication of the course of the yen. Foreign investors were net sellers of Japanese equities in July for the first time since June last year and are expected to have sustained the selling in August, which could cap the yen's appreciation.</p>

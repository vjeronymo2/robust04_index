			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Fun and games' at the London Metal Exchange - The background to the recent technical supply tightness A NASTY technical squeeze on the London Metal Exchange's zinc market seems to have been avoided. The question is: did the squeeze collapse because the exchange frightened off those who might be attempting some manipulation; or was it simply that the people behind the squeeze achieved their objectives? As with most LME squeezes, only a very few will know the full story. But most of the evidence suggests that an objective was achieved. The most popular theory about the latest squeeze is that the zinc price was being artificially propped up while the so-called 'mating season', or annual contract negotiations, between the Australian miners and Japanese smelters are going on. According to supporters of this theory, the talks have dragged on much longer than usual because smelters have been holding out for higher charges for treating concentrates from the mines. There is a surplus of concentrates (an intermediate material produced by the mines) so the smelters have been asking for Dollars 200 a tonne, up from Dollars 180 last year, to treat them. Producers have argued that this is unreasonable at a time when the LME zinc price has been falling. So, according to some traders, some smelters have used the options market astutely to squeeze the LME market and boost the price in the hope that this will make the producers more willing to give way. A squeeze is when pressure is put on a particular delivery date which makes the price of that date higher in relation to other dates. The contract talks, which usually are out of the way before the year-end, are at last nearing conclusion and analysts suggest it is no coincidence that the LME squeeze is now easing. As usual when the market appears not to know what is really happening, some fingers are pointing at Marc Rich, one of the world's biggest trading organisations. Some suggest that Rich, based in Zug, Switzerland, has taken control of 60 to 70 per cent of the LME's zinc stocks by the clever use of options. A source close to Rich, who prefers not to be identified, says this is not quite correct. While the company does have some options, two zinc producers (one European and one North American) are playing a bigger role in the squeeze. All three apparently concluded independently that the zinc price was due to rise. The source says: 'There will be some fun and games, but not in any major way. There will be a little squeeze, no big deal'. There certainly will be no repeat of the zinc squeeze last April when the backwardation - the premium for metal for immediate delivery over forward prices - soared to Dollars 217 a tonne and at one point Dollars 60 a tonne was paid to borrow zinc (buy cash and sell forward) for one day. The squeeze has been building since early December. Dealers say that the technical tightness at one stage forced the premium to borrow metal from February for three months to touch Dollars 60 a tonne. But it eased back after Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, gave the first of his two recent warnings that the exchange was 'closely monitoring the zinc market'. Analysts suggest that the squeeze has defied the zinc market's fundamental situation. The price stayed up even though record stocks of the metal have been attracted to the LME. Stocks now stand at 167,500 tonnes. Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez group, says the squeeze has made consumers shy away from buying zinc on the exchange and frightened off those who might have sold short (sold metal they did not have in the expectation they could buy it at a lower price in future). Neither has there been much hedging or forward selling by producers, perhaps because they fear this would depress the price. After its January meeting, the LME board said it had 'noted and expressed concern about the current tightness for nearby dates in the zinc market'. Activity in the market would be closely monitored, it added. According to Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's marketing director, this was to show 'that we are aware of the talk in the market that there could be tightness coming. This tightness has been so well signposted that the whole world should know about it by now. We, in turn, have reminded the world that we are watching - all the time'. The LME's critics suggest that traders are able to play fast and loose with metal prices, particularly by using options, for their own financial benefit without breaking the rules. Mr Abbott points out in response that markets do not behave in a perfect way at all times. At least 'the LME makes any errant behaviour very transparent'. During the zinc squeeze in April last year the LME executive took no overt action but worked hard behind the scenes to make sure matters did not get out of hand. However, the LME executive has a statutory responsibility not to let a 'disorderly' market develop and the executive did have to take action during a similar squeeze in the copper market in December. This quickly ebbed away after the LME imposed a limit of Pounds 25 a tonne of the daily backwardation. Zinc and copper prices dropped substantially after previous squeezes ended. They attracted a great deal of metal to LME stocks, which are highly visible. High LME stocks usually have a depressing impact on prices and that impact can last for a long time after the squeeze is over. At first sight there seems no reason why history should not repeat itself now the present zinc squeeze is ending. Analysts point out that about half of all zinc consumed outside the former eastern bloc goes into galvanised steel for the construction and automotive industries. Both industries are severely affected by the present prolonged recession. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group recently estimated that zinc consumption dropped by 1.1 per cent last year while refined metal production reached a record level. Consequently, there was a 170,000-tonne supply surplus. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, a Royal Dutch/Shell subsidiary, forecasts there will be another surplus in 1992 and says that the zinc price should not be expected to recover until the final quarter of this year.</p>

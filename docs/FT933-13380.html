			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Officials thrash out Nafta side deals CANADIAN, US and Mexican negotiators are meeting in Ottawa this week in the hope of resolving most outstanding issues for the environmental and labour pacts which will form part of the North American free trade agreement. The talks were described by one official yesterday as 'very important'. If successful, the three countries' trade ministers are expected to meet in the US next week to conclude the side-agreements. The Clinton administration is aiming to submit Nafta and the parallel agreements to Congress for ratification before the summer recess on August 6. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said last week the administration would not send Nafta to Congress for approval without the side-pacts. Nafta is scheduled to come into force on January 1 1994, but faces an uphill passage against special-interest groups in Congress. The key issue in the current negotiations is how environmental and labour standards will be enforced and how infractions will be penalised. The US has been pushing for a strong enforcement mechanism which would include sanctions against offenders, including the possibility of trade penalties. Canada and Mexico have taken a more cautious line however, insisting that sanctions should be a domestic matter. They are concerned that complaints about environmental or labour practices could be used as an excuse by US companies to launch protectionist trade actions. Substantial progress is understood to have been made in recent weeks on narrowing differences between the three governments, including the powers of a proposed North American environmental commission. This week's talks are at a technical working-group level. The three countries' chief negotiators are expected to report on progress at a press briefing on Friday.</p>

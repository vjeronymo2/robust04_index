			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (3): Pay-as-you-please system even suits the tax authorities - Guernsey's flexibility over taxation is one reason for the substantial growth of banks, investment managers and other enterprises associated with offshore capital flows. Surprisingly, enthusiasm for flexible and low taxes comes from tax officials as well as contributors / Financial services THEY have a rather unusual variant in Guernsey of Britain's pay-as-you-earn tax system, which helps explain the island's role as a substantial financial centre. It could be called pay-as-you-please. Most jurisdictions set tax rates and expect taxpayers to comply. The authorities on Guernsey prefer to negotiate. In the latest and most blatant example, the new international company regulations being introduced this year allow businesses to choose to pay virtually any rate they want, from less than 1 per cent up to 30 per cent. That flexibility - which is only a codification of informal arrangements practised over many years - is one reason for the substantial growth of banks, investment managers and other enterprises associated with offshore capital flows since the late 1960s. Guernsey now derives more than half its tax revenue and 54 per cent of its gross national product from the financial sector - up from a tenth in the early 1970s. Finance is also now the largest provider of employment - accounting for more than 15 per cent of the working population, according to the 1991 census. Many jobs and profits which do not relate directly to money management are spin-offs from it. That includes most of the leading accountancy firms, many law practices and even a firm of actuaries, not to mention the brass plaque engravers and rubber stamp manufacturers. Just as important, many of those travelling to the island, staying in its hotels and dining in its restaurants come for short business trips: nearly one-sixth of the 330,000 or so visitors last year. Speak to companies with a presence on the island and most will make strong approving noises about the benefits of being there - not least the low tax rates, which even for resident local companies are just 20 per cent, the same as for individuals. Similar words issue forth from many politicians and civil servants. What is more surprising is that the same enthusiasm for flexible and low taxes also comes from tax officials. Suitably enough, the States of Guernsey income tax office is hidden down an obscure alley and the sign marking its presence above the entrance is faded almost beyond recognition. From his room on the fourth floor, Mr Ken Forman, the administrator of taxes, makes no apologies for his approach and admits he has a dual role: part collector, part salesman. 'Our policy has to be flexible,' he says. 'It is a price we have to pay. We want a slice of the cake. Otherwise money would be lost to another territory.' The same tension between regulation and marketing exists for officials at the Financial Services Commission. The FSC was created in the mid 1980s to be independent of government. Its chairman is the elected president of the island's finance and advisory committee. But its four commissioners are drawn from the finance sector, which also funds the agency. Recently these funders have been pushing for a greater role in selecting the commissioners. Talk to banks and other financial institutions, and there appears to be a strong sense of camaraderie with the regulators. They refer to the supervisors by their first names and say they can always call them or arrange a meeting within a few hours. It is a quintessentially British system, but on a far more intimate, workable scale. Officials are keen to point out that Guernsey was never created as an artificial offshore centre. Indeed, they prefer to avoid use of the word 'offshore' altogether, in favour of 'finance' centre. But a growing element of artificiality has begun to creep in as more and more centres compete in an international beauty parade for business. Legislators and regulators are being forced to look over their shoulders more often - not least at Jersey. Mr John Roper, head of the FSC, talks about 'a pragmatic pragmatism.' In the UK, the authorities can all but impose their rules on most individuals and businesses, he argues. In Guernsey, by contrast, harsh conditions will simply drive mobile international business away. That is not to say that every change has favoured business. Insurance companies were forced to come onshore for regulation in 1986. More generally, tax exemptions in the past few years have all but put an end to the 'Sark Lark', by which companies held meetings and had directors on the nearby island of Sark to be offshore from the Guernsey authorities. Tougher new banking and insurance laws are planned for this year, and in the future there are plans for the regulation of stock brokers and fiduciaries - something not yet attempted in the UK. Most important, the system seems to have worked. Guernsey regulators have simply refused entry to all but what they believe are the most reputable companies after careful vetting. That, officials say, provides a far tighter net than exists on mainland UK. Barnett Christie, a small bank with imprudent lending, is the only significant financial embarrassment to have affected the island in recent years. The questions for the regulators are whether they can continue to handle the potential tensions of acting as both regulators and promoters of financial services; and whether their fragile discretionary authority would hold up if challenged in the courts. A final issue is that of secrecy. Guernsey has 14,000 limited companies  - more than 10 times the number per capita in the UK. Yet the only public information available on each is a list of directors and shareholders. It is impossible to find the annual accounts of any of these businesses, or the identity of their beneficial owners.</p>

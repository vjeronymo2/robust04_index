			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Davydov, director of Radio Russia, by </F> Oleg Moroz, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA columnist; place and date not  given: "State Radio Cannot Be Apolitical in Today's Russia"]    [Text] [Moroz] The first question that is most frequently  asked by journalists when they meet one another is: How are you  doing moneywise? So, Sergey Vyacheslavovich, how are things  going with you at Radio Russia? How are you able to stay afloat?  It is said that there are plans to cut your appropriations  sharply.    [Davydov] I cannot answer anything about this question  today.  It is very frightening. Some figures were mentioned recently--50  percent of the needed financing, now--32 percent, in my  opinion... I have simply stopped thinking about it, because this  is all promises, not money. What are we living on now? On the  money that we earn. That is earned by the entire television and  radio company, not only radio. Of course, there is not enough  money. But you get tired more of the uncertainty... They should  already have decided exactly how many hours of broadcasting are  needed. If 22 hours are not needed, like now, but five, then let  it be five. But these five hours a day must have full financing.  In exactly the same way, it should be decided clearly how many  state radio broadcasting channels are required. As is known,  there are now five of them.    [Moroz] Does it not seem to you that radio is dying out,  being squeezed out by television, and that it is being perceived  more and more frequently as some kind of half-finished  product--a phonogram without "pictures?"    [Davydov] No, it does not seem that way. I think that radio  will die when the last cultured person dies. Just what is a  television "picture?" It is a means of making up for our  laziness: After hearing some text, we are too lazy to think and  do some additional imagining of what was heard; and so the task  is made easier for us, we are given an image. Therefore, in  particular, television theater and radio theater are completely  different things. And radio theater is the same kind of cultural  possession as television theater. Like the drama theater. What  is more, there are after all genre theater and purely radio  theater. For example, literary readings. There is a special  radio audience. The blind, invalids... In addition, I suspect  that today the number of radio listeners is growing. Imagine the  television set breaking down; it is very expensive to repair  now, so a person is limited to the radio set... Of course,  radio, as well as television, is experiencing elements of a  crisis, but it seems to me that the crisis in radio--in a  cultural sense--is not that severe.    [Moroz] In what, nonetheless, do you see this crisis?    [Davydov] In many things. In particular, the departure of  announcers of the old school and the arrival of journalists at  the microphone has reduced the level of broadcasting culture  somewhat. Errors have become more frequent...    [Moroz] You understand, of course, that I asked the question  about the possible death of radio exclusively for the sake of  sharpening the conversation, and in order to provoke your  professional pride. Nonetheless, do radio journalists not have a  feeling of decline and second-grade status in comparison with  television workers? After all, the whole country knows those who  are on the air continuously. A person could be a rather average  journalist, but the feeling is such that this is a dominant  influence. Briefly, it is more prestigious to work in television  than in radio. In such a case, do you not suffer from turncoats?    [Davydov] The idea of the second-grade status of radio in  comparison with television exists more outside the professional  environment of radio journalists. We have had people who moved  over to television, but not that many. Isolated cases. And they  are journalists who did not become professionals in radio. A  person who has worked in radio for a dozen or so years, as a  rule, no longer aspires to television. He understands that radio  is ANOTHER type of journalism, another type of art. It is like  moving from opera to ballet. After all, there are opera and  ballet theaters, and these seem to be close things. Close, but  not very. But the attitude of the state and society toward radio  really is like toward something secondary. It is remembered as a  last resort, in periods of putsches and right after them, when  television has distinctly exhausted its resources. At that time  a stream of high-standing visitors rushes to us. They are all  amazed at what squalor we live in and antiquated equipment we  have, and they promise us the moon, but, naturally, as soon as  the crisis situation passes they forget about their promises.    [Moroz] What do you consider the framework of your radio day  to be? What are its pivotal programs. And what are the main  ideas that you put into your broadcasting?    [Davydov] Of course, hourly information releases constitute  the framework. It not we who make them--they are made by the  Radio Russia information service. But this is the framework.  Then we create our fillers. Firstly, the morning programs.  Basically, journal and musical. Then there are the daily  programs. These are children's and do-it-yourself programs.  "Interlocutor" left us for Radio 1, and the "Home Academy"  do-it-yourself program appeared. How to build a house, how to  keep house, how to feed the family... The need for such programs  is being felt more and more now. Politics is already starting to  get boring. The "Author's Channel 'From the First Person'" grew  out of the five hours of our first underground political  broadcasting in 1990-1991. This is our main political  program. Its title speaks for itself. This is an authors' radio,  if you wish. After 1800 a block starts that, perhaps, is dearest  to me--I hope employees who work on other programs are not  offended by me--the artistic broadcasting block. Here even  social and political journalism is done with a nuance of art.  And at 2220 the purely hip youth program "Four Fourths" starts.  It continues until 0200. It, of course, has its own problems,  but the main thing is that there was nothing like this on radio.  Although many of us grew up on the radio station Youth.    Frankly, when this program started up, there was  resistance--and tremendous resistance--from a number of  listeners and a listlessly intelligent resistance on the part of  the management of the company. But the young people,  nonetheless, showed that there should be such a youth program.  We still do not use it as an element of political propaganda,  but I fear that it will be necessary to use it in this capacity  as well: The mood among youth is an important factor in politics.    [Moroz] What is the balance here between serious and  entertainment programs, between culture and popular culture, for  which you are striving in your broadcasting?    [Davydov] Popular culture and entertainment is now  concentrated here mainly, perhaps, in the "Four Fourths" program  that I mentioned. There are also elements of entertainment in  the morning program "The Beginning," although I would not call  it entertaining. This year we changed the approach to thematic  programs somewhat. They still were somewhat heavy. We cut their  time to 15-20 minutes. And we expanded the musical flow of  sound. Mainly at the expense of classical music and  retrospective reviews. Moreover, it became clear that we hit the  nail on the head here. There is a strong nostalgia in our  society with respect to the 1960's and 1970's. It is also happy  with retrospective music. But the classics are classics. The  need for the eternal and imperishable is always alive among  people. It is a number one problem for us--nothing to laugh at.    So-called humorous programs have appeared here this year,  but  there is no particular response to them yet. And there is a  problem with game programs. We have, perhaps, only one game  program--"VZV" (Evening Amusement for Adults), which is done by  Leonid Azarkh. It is necessary to play on radio. Radio games  exist in the whole world.    As I have already said, we concentrate politics in four  hours  on the "Authors' Channel." And this is probably the optimal  variant.    [Moroz] Do you know what kind of audience you have?    [Davydov] Of course, we know, although, perhaps, not in  great  detail. Any kind of sociological poll is now too expensive. This  audience is very broad and mixed... And rather conservative.  Russia is a conservative country in general. This is not my  observation and not my discovery. As one of my colleagues said,  Moscow is not Russia, Moscow is Moscow, an entirely different  country starts beyond the ring road. But it is mainly Muscovites  who work for us, and they are young people as well. They do not  always understand that beyond the bounds of the capital there is  a very different country. So that we do not have 100 percent  confidence that we know our listeners.    [Moroz] To what extent do you depend on listeners?    [Davydov] Unfortunately, to no extent. The other day there  was a funny telegram: The main production line of the AZLK  [Moscow Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant] was shut down as a  sign of protest against discrimination with respect to the  program "Interlocutor" (this program is now transmitted on the  third channel). Well, where else can a production line of a very  large automobile plant shut down as a result of the fact that a  program ceased to exist on one channel and switched to another?  But imagine what it would entail if such a thing happened  somewhere else suddenly--let us say, the FIAT plant in Italy  came to a stop, because of some perturbations on radio? At a  minimum there would be parliamentary hearings. But in our  country--nothing. Even such serious threats do not influence us  in any way. In the meantime, dependence on listeners, perhaps,  is exactly what would save us in the economic situation in which  we find ourselves. If it were financial. But today, whether we  pay for a radio point or not, whether we pay taxes or not, this  has no effect at all on the work of the radio. Everything is  dissolved in the common pot, it is depersonalized...    [Moroz] How do you differ from other radio channels? From  Mayak it is clear, but, let us say, from Radio 1?    [Davydov] Our difference not only from Mayak but also from  Youth and Orpheus is clear. But as for Radio 1, we have a  significant similarity. The fact that we started to broadcast on  the "first button" compelled us to arrange our broadcasting with  a view to the first all-Union program. Our main difference from  this channel is, perhaps, that we are a younger and more mobile  radio. And now we have become even more dynamic--in connection  with program timing and the expansion of musical elements, about  which I have already talked.    [Moroz] As a result of the departure of "Interlocutor" from  your wavelengths, people were prepared to bring the automobile  plant to a halt. But "Interlocutor" is not your program...    [Davydov] Yes, it was accommodated on our wavelengths in a  contract with Ostankino. This contract ended in 1993.    [Moroz]...But do you have your own programs that are just as  popular, that are liked as much by the people, and whose  cancellation or switch to another wavelength would cause such a  powerful listener protest?    [Davydov] I am afraid of such a definition "liked by the  people": Each program has its listeners. There are programs that  are simply destined for success. No matter how they were made.  Take, for example, the program "An old gramophone reminded  me..." Or "A meeting with a song." I can simply sit, read  letters, and play songs that people request. And it will meet  with success. I do not want to diminish the role of those who  produce these programs, but I repeat, they are destined for  success. Or, for example, "Home Academy." Four young female  employees "cover" five hours of air time in a week. They are  real heroines, and a monument should be erected to them. But if  I simply sat an announcer down who would read how to boil  buckwheat, how to bring up a child...the program would be  popular all the same. But there are programs of another  kind--let us assume "Roots and Branches," which deals with the  fates of a classic legacy in contemporary life. People appear in  it of such a level as Yuriy Mikhailovich Lotman and Dmitryy  Sergeyevich Likhachev. I cannot call it popular. But this  program also established the face of the channel. Or we have the  young radio journalist Sasha Korshunov--a fellow who digs into  history. Moreover, who finds in it not cheap sensations but  exposes many of its pages anew. There also was never a big  stream of letters on its broadcast, and no production line will  stop for the sake of it, but it has its listeners. This is also  our face.    [Moroz] What can you say about the innovations in recent  years--the widespread use of going live on the air, telephone  participation of radio listeners in broadcasts, and so forth? Do  they not lower the quality of broadcasting?    [Davydov] We went through a stage of being infatuated with  listener telephone calls, while still working on the youth  channel of radio station Youth, and in the first period of  activity of Radio Russia. We very rarely resort to this now.  Telephone communications with listeners occurs with us, as a  rule, somewhat differently: We simply provide an open line  telephone, next to which our invited guest sits for an hour to  an hour and a half. But starting on 9 March a permanent open  line telephone has been working on Radio Russia--in the  reception room. Listeners can call it up from 1400 to 1800  during the day, Moscow time. But now local stations usually put  listeners who call on the telephone on live broadcasts: This  way, people bring their troubles and their problems to the  attention of local officials. As for our live broadcasting, it  takes up 10 of our 22 hours every day. In broadcasting to the  European zone. The ratio is different in rebroadcasts. Here  there are two sides. It is bad that it is impossible to correct  anything. What is said is what is heard. But it is impossible to  work without live broadcasting today. The situation in the  country is changing rapidly. If only recording is used, you  cannot keep up with this situation.    [Moroz] The other day corresponding member of the Russian  Academy of Sciences Khasbulatov who was released from prison  said in one of his numerous interviews that the most trying  experience in the prison cell was Mayak and Radio Russia, which  were continuously broadcasting a stream of lies. According to  him, it is necessary to have a powerful brain in order to come  up with so much lying. He also said that one radio station was  enough "to beat one's brains"--true, this was only said about  Mayak. What do you think about this?    [Davydov] In principle, I can limit myself to one phrase: We  have not lost one court case to date.    [Moroz] Have there been many trials?    [Davydov] One or two are always going on. So, let  Khasbulatov  go to court, and we will figure out who lied where.    [Moroz] I think the scientist had in mind not lies in a  literal sense, but Radio Russia's political orientation.    [Davydov] In that case, things have to be called by their  correct names. If, while carrying out a certain political  policy, we are also not sinning against the truth, our opponent  may himself answer for slander. However, we will not begin, of  course, to expend either the time or the money on such a court  examination.    [Moroz] But you do not intend to change your political  orientation? After all, many are changing it now...    [Davydov] You see, I am frequently told: "State radio should  be apolitical." I reply: "Yes, in a normal society." Radio  Russia was planned as a political radio "under Yeltsin." Well, I  am a person who is more or less apolitical--it was simply  interesting to me to make a new channel out of nothing. And  journalists came here mainly out of political considerations.  But when in the middle of 1992 a struggle of the two authorities  began, we tried to maintain an objective approach. Deputies  themselves commented here on everything that was happening.  Aksyuchits did not scramble out of our radio. I am not now  talking about broadcasting the meetings of the Supreme Soviet.  Then the political fight intensified. It seemed to the Supreme  Soviet that it was getting little air time. The idea came up for  a "Parliamentary Hour." I tried to show that the appearance of  this program would throw Radio Russia sharply into another,  opposite direction. I was not listened to. From the very first  minutes of the existence of the "Parliamentary Hour," streams of  abuse came down on the president. And we were compelled to  defend him. Today, of course, the situation is different, but  the political struggle continues. The fate of the country  depends on its outcome. But for this reason I will say once  more, Radio Russia, like all state radio, cannot allow itself to  be apolitical. Although, of course, we strive to present all  viewpoints that exist in society.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / TUC expected to urge public-sector strike THE Trades Union Congress is expected to call for a one-day public-sector strike in February over jobs, pay and the mining industry crisis. Mining unions yesterday tried to maintain pressure for an immediate resumption of coal-cutting at the 10 pits earmarked for closure. They argued leaving them on a stand-by basis might cost Pounds 150m over nine months. The TUC has been reluctant to urge a full one-day strike because of the legal complications and the fear of lack of support. But many unions are now more ready to risk industrial action. They have been encouraged by Monday's High Court judgment that the pit closure programme had been carried out unlawfully. The mining unions and the TUC public-services committee will meet separately on January 5 to discuss strategy. The TUC said the committee would consider 'synchronised balloting on industrial action with the aim of building activity around jobs and pay on a date in February'. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday formally appointed mining consultants Boyds to report on whether British Coal should proceed with the closure of the 10 earmarked pits. The High Court ruling called for an independent assessment before any closure decision was taken. But the unions argue that Boyds is not sufficiently independent, as it is working for the government on the wider Department of Trade and Industry review of the closures due in February or March. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, emphasised in a letter to Mr John Major, the prime minister, that appointing Boyds was 'not a satisfactory response; not even the letter of the judgment seems to be followed'. British Coal has agreed to buy 87,000 tonnes of coal from Monktonhall colliery, near Edinburgh, which it closed five years ago. The colliery is now leased by miners who ploughed their redundancy money into operating it as a private pit. A miners' strike in Poland has reduced imports of house-coal, and the one-year order for Monktonhall has been placed to make up the shortfall.</p>

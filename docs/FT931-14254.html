			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (23): Slow growth limits benefits - Pledges to workers have mixed success THE 'social dimension' of the European Community was relaunched by Mr Jacques Delors in 1989 to win the support of organised labour for greater economic integration and to address the fear that labour as a whole could lose out from the free market drive of the single market. It has been remarkably successful in achieving the first goal, rather less so in achieving the second. The 1989 social action programme contained a series of measures, from improving health and safety, establishing minimum rights for pregnant women, young people and part-time workers, to imposing EC-wide limits on the working week. But thanks to slower growth throughout the EC, and successful blocking by the UK government, few of the important measures have so far become directives. If the Maastricht treaty is passed, its 'social chapter', which Britain has opted-out of, will in theory make it easier to push through more social and employment legislation by majority vote. But that also looks unlikely at present. Most member states are reluctant to adopt any policies that might reduce competitiveness or provide succour to Britain, regarded as the 'Hong-Kong of Europe'. And even within the European Commission's social affairs Directorate-General 5 the leading strategists of the social dimension privately accept that a less ambitious approach to legislation is required. What is the case for the social dimension? Some supporters, especially in the richer EC countries, have argued that the harmonisation of minimum rights at work across the Community is required to prevent 'social dumping'. That means capital flowing to areas where labour is least protected, triggering downward pressure on standards in other countries. There is little evidence that an increase in social dumping is accompanying the arrival of the single market. That may be because the low wage economies, such as Spain, Portugal and Greece, have quite strictly regulated labour markets, making them unpopular with big business. It may also be because unit labour costs are remarkably similar all over the EC, in other words the high wage countries justify higher pay scales with high productivity while low wage countries have low productivity to match. There has, however, been a big increase in cross-border takeover activity by EC-based multinationals, inspiring the draft directive on European works councils, designed to give employees an EC-wide voice in corporate affairs. But apart from a few highly specialised groups, such as airline pilots, there is little sign that EC-wide collective bargaining or an EC labour market is emerging. Only 2m EC nationals work permanently in another EC country and the number has actually declined in the past 10 years. Yet there is a broader, more 'political', case for the social dimension as a counter-balance to the forces unleashed by the single market. Mr Robert Lindley, of Warwick University, summarises it thus: 'While capital is more mobile than labour, financial capital is more mobile than industrial capital. Combine the rigours of the single market with those of free capital movement and there arises a situation in which financial markets have apparently been handed much greater power to impose their judgments of performances and priorities upon the workings of the other constituents of the EC economy.' The measures outlined in the social action programme are an attempt to ensure that the judgments of one of those other constituents - labour - do not go completely unheard. But by stressing harmonisation against de-regulation and EC-wide rules against subsidiarity the architects of the social dimension have risked trespassing on an area of economic life strongly coloured by national differences. There are 12 different systems of industrial relations in the EC and while there are patterns of similarity which link some of them, there are also big differences in the role of the law, the power of unions, and the structure of working life. Southern member states, for example, tend to have low female participation and little part-time work. Spain and France have weak unions but strong labour laws. Most of the northern European states have strong labour laws and institutionalised 'social partnership' collaboration between organised labour and capital. The Christian Democrat/Social Democrat consensus that prevails in most continental European countries invariably gives labour a powerful institutional voice even where collective bargaining is weak. Britain, with its laissez-faire regulatory framework but historically strong (although now weakened) unions, is out on a limb. And its liberal hire and fire rules, widespread use of 'atypical' work patterns, and long working hours, make it the most affected by the regulatory regime the Commission has been trying to impose. Although the Commission denies it is trying to impose a particular model of industrial relations on the EC it clearly leans towards the Germanic model with its strong labour laws and legally-backed voice for employees. Whether, in the longer run, the Commission succeeds in establishing a 'European model' remains to be seen. There is some evidence that the 'Germanic' model, already heavily plagiarised by Holland and Belgium, is spreading into France, but otherwise there has been little spontaneous convergence. Indeed, if there has been a common trend over the past decade it is towards de-regulation and a weakening of social partnership, although that has gone further in the UK than elsewhere. Looking ahead, European labour faces a tough time. European monetary integration will impose a single inflation and interest rate, and rule out devaluation, with the result that the strain of economic adjustment will fall on wages and employment in the weaker countries. And without co-ordinated wage increases across Europe those countries with high unit labour cost increases, such as Britain and Italy, will see lost competitiveness flow directly into job losses. The social dimension affords little protection against the potentially dramatic effects of monetary integration. But it should not be written off completely and, interestingly, it survived virtually unscathed from the Edinburgh summit review of subsidiarity. Currently, in the UK, the government's drive to contract out central and local government services has been thrown into confusion by one of the oldest pieces of EC employment legislation, known as the acquired rights directive. The social dimension is undeniably suffering a cyclical down-turn, as it has done before, but it has also established itself as a fact of life across large areas of working life in the EC.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    EC COMMISSION LINE UP 1993-94  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       President:  Jacques Delors (France)  Economic and financial affairs:  Henning Chrisophersen (Denmark)                     Development:  Manuel Marin (Spain)                        Industry:  Martin Bangemann (Germany)       External economic affairs:  Sir Leon Brittan (UK)               Energy, transport:  Abel Matutes (Spain)                          Budget:  Peter Schmidhuber (Germany)               Customs, taxation:  Christiane Scrivener (France)                 Regional policy:  Bruce Millan (UK)                     Competition:  Karel Van Miert (Belgium)    External political relations:  Hans van den Broek (Netherlands)    Internal political relations:  Joao de Deus Pinheiro (Portugal)   Social affairs and employment:  Padraig Flynn (Ireland) Science, research &amp; development:  Antonio Ruberti (Italy)                     Agriculture:  Rene Steichen (Luxembourg)                     Environment:  Ionnis Paleokrassas (Greece)                   Single market:  Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi (Italy  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Raids, arrests,  and ill-treatment in the municipalities of Peja, Gjilan,  Suhareka, Prizren, Junik, Klina, Vitia, etc. have been  continuing unabated, said President Rugova, speaking at a press  conference today in Prishtina. Raids under the pretext of arms  searches are usually followed by demolition of property, Dr.  Rugova added. "The killing of Selman Daci in the vicinity of  the Macedonia-Kosova border- crossing point is a bad omen," said  President Rugova adding that the border with Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], "which is  illegal for us," began a toll of its first victim. The week  behind us was characterized by heavy movements of Serbian army  and their build up in different areas such as in the bordering  stripe Gjakova-Prizren, in the vicinity of Kacanik, around  Podujeva, Kamaran, and other places, Dr. Rugova said. "Taking  into account what happened in Bosnia we consider this as a new  threat. We have warned that such Serbian military movements  represent further provocation toward the Kosovo people,"  President Rugova said.    "Following the Serbian takeover of the building of the  Kosova's Academy of Arts and Sciences, the building of the  Institute of Albanian Studies is threatened with a similar  takeover. This is the only and last institution bearing the  symbolic relevance for the Albanians," President Rugova told  journalists adding that "once again we warn the Serbian regime,  the local Serbian-installed authorities in Kosova to seriously  think on what they have been doing."    Commenting on the NATO actions in Bosnia, Dr. Rugova hailed  the NATO intervention in compliance with the UN Security Council  resolution on the non-flying zone over Bosnia. He also hailed  the Croat-Muslim agreement signed in Washington hoping for its  implementation. "We hail the statement of the U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher who said that all the problems in  former Yugoslavia will be solved by the United States in  cooperation with the European Union, and Russia. We think that  such an approach is very encouraging for Kosova, too," he said.    Asked whether Albania and the international community would  intervene in order to stop Serbian violence in Kosova, President  Rugova said: "We have been calling for preventive steps toward  Kosova. Albania is interested to prevent any conflict. The  awareness that if something happens in Kosova would be  catastrophe for the entire region is very intense in the  international fora. Therefore, everybody is interested to  prevent such developments, and I hope that our demand for  placing Kosova under a UN protectorate will be accepted."    Asked to comment on the threats of his arrest issued in the  Serbian press recently, Dr. Rugova said he had no wish to  comment on them. Instead, he commented on the total  unwillingness of the Serbian side to accept dialogue with the  Albanians, stressing that the Albanian side is open and ready to  engage in a serious dialogue over Kosova.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nick Bezuidenhout] </F>   [Text] Approximately 11,000 posts in the civil service are  being advertised countrywide today at all government offices as  part of the government's plan to introduce affirmative action in  the public service. These include several new posts for people  who have to oversee this affirmative action program. This  follows the announcement, barely a week ago, of a short- and  long-term plan for affirmative action in the civil service. In  terms of the short-term plan, all vacant civil service posts  will be advertised. Posts where recommendations for  appointments have already been made will have to be advertised  again.    Part of the long-term plan is to appoint people in every  department at national and provincial level to oversee the  affirmative action program in the departments. The majority of  the posts advertised in the document of approximately 800 pages  are existing vacancies or posts where recommendations for the  filling of those posts have been withdrawn in line with the  policy of affirmative action. Altogether 246 of the 11,000  vacant posts are for the management sector of the civil service  (directors and higher).    The new posts for people overseeing affirmative action are  posts for a chief director, director, deputy director, four  posts for senior administrative officials, and two secretaries.  These people will work in the office of the Public Service  Commission. According to the advertisement the duty of the  chief director is, among others things, to give advice on the  collection of information on the composition of the civil  service, concerning steps for a more representative civil  service and negotiations on policy for a more representative  civil service.    An unknown number of posts for role interpreters in all  departments at national and provincial level are also  advertised. The duties of the people in these posts are  described as, among other things, the introduction of steps to  make the civil service more representative and the delivery of  support services to people belonging to the "under-represented  groups." A spokesman for the office of the Public Service  Commission said upon enquiry that the new posts will only be  filled if suitable candidates apply.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The president of the ANC [African National  Congress], Mr. Nelson Mandela, has told a gathering of business  people at Welkom that white South Africans should become aware  of the consequences of right-wing violence. Mr. Mandela said  once the ANC took countermeasures against the right wing, both  blacks and whites would die, and innocent people would be  sacrificed. He said the ANC did not want to retaliate against  the right wing, and he added that the organization was still  prepared to meet right-wing leaders and talk some sense into  them, as he put it. Mr. Mandela said there is no possibility of  the establishment of a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland], but added  that he was prepared to discuss a compromise, although this  would take a long time.</p>

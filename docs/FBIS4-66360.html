			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kang Wenhua [1660 2429 5478]: "Manas </F> Power Plant Second Phase Expansion Project Proceeding Smoothly"]    [Text] When the two 100MW generators are formally placed  into operation, they will increase the Urumqi region's power  generating capacity by more than one-fourth! Thus, "guaranteeing  that the No. 5 generator is formally placed into operation  during the second quarter of 1994 and striving to place the No.  6 generator into operation by the end of 1994" have become the  increasingly urgent goals of the builders of the Manas power  plant second-phase expansion project.    A key state project during the Eighth 5-Year Plan and a key  project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the second-phase  expansion project at Manas power plant (two 100MW generators,  the No. 5 and No. 6 units) will involve a total investment of  375 million yuan. Since the ground was broken to start  construction on 1 September 1992, an investment of 180 million  yuan has been completed.</p>

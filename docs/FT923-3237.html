			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: London railway scheme FRANK GRAHAM has been awarded a civil engineering design contract by CrossRail for the covered way and ramp at the Allen Garden section of this project. The value of the construction work is estimated at Pounds 7.5m. Commencing at the eastern portals of the bored tunnel drive 15 metres below Shoreditch, the work comprises a 250 metre section of cut and cover, which may be carried out using continuous bored pile walls and "top down'methods of construction. This is followed by a 300 metre long ramp and viaduct which, initially, is in open cut before climbing to link with the existing viaduct at Vallance Road. The CrossRail scheme, a joint development between London Underground and British Rail Network SouthEast, involves building a twin-bore tunnel, 9.6kms long, across central London between Paddington and Bethnal Green. This will 1ink rail lines to Reading and Aylesbury in the west to those serving Shenfield in the east. The Pounds 1.7bn scheme will reduce journey times across the region and relieve congestion on the London Underground.</p>

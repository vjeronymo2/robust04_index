			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Taiwan to press for UN membership TAIWAN'S President Lee Teng-hui said yesterday that the island would mount a campaign to rejoin the United Nations, from which it was ousted by China in 1971, Reuter reports from Taipei. 'We will actively seek to join the United Nations. We hope the international community will seriously consider this issue within three years,' he said in a speech at the opening of a session of the National Assembly. 'We will push to join more international organisations in order to contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world.' Taiwan has applied for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and has said it wants to join several other multilateral economic organisations. International pressure forced Taiwan to give up its seat in the UN to China, which has claimed sovereignty over the island since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. But Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which made strong gains in last December's elections, wants Taipei to re-apply for UN membership immediately and has staged demonstrations to press its demand.</p>

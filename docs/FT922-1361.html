			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: South Africa JOHANNESBURG fell following the ANC's decision to withdraw from negotiations on power-sharing with the government. But the weakness of the financial rand, which lost 7.5 per cent earlier in the session before recovering slightly, helped lift those companies with offshore assets. The overall index lost 42 to 3,639 and industrials were down 51 at 4,471. The gold index shed 17 to 1,141. Minorco gained 25 cents to R47.25 and Lonrho added 15 cents to R5.55. De Beers shed R1 to R87.50.</p>

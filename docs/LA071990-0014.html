			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.: The San Francisco-based utility said  second-quarter net income was $166.2 million, down 30% from a year ago. Revenue  was $2.17 billion, up 4%. PG&amp;E attributed the lower earnings in large part  to a one-time after-tax charge of $66 million from an adverse decision in  litigation over the rupture of a water conduit east of Fresno in 1982.  </P></p>

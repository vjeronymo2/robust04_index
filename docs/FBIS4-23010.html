Pererva, Molecular Biology and Genetics Institute  at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev, and Colloidal  Chemistry and Water Chemistry Institute at the Ukrainian Academy  of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 577.21]    [Abstract] The environmental and economic tasks of  industrial enterprise waste water treatment with the help of  various microorganism strains and the urgency of finding  off-chromosomal genetic determinants of the biological  degradation process prompted the screening of plasmid DNA in the  strains separated from industrial enterprise waste water. To  this end, Ps. putida, Ps. alcaligenes, B. subtilis  strains from the collection of the Voodoobrabotka Research  center are used. The microorganisms were grown a salt medium.  The study demonstrates that the strains capable of utilizing  surface active substances contain plasmid DNA yet with respect  to urea, this property does not correlate with the presence of  plasmids. It is speculated that it is coded by chromosomal  genes. The findings open the possibility of developing vector  molecules for B. subtilis on the basis of the pMA9  and pMA10 plasmid genomes. A comparison to published data makes  it possible to note that plasmids DNA participating in the  biodegradation of ampholytic surfactants are detected in a  number of Ps. putida strains. The importance of  separating the direct genes which determine biodegradation of  syntanol is stressed. Figures 1; references 3: 2 Russian, 1  Western.</p>

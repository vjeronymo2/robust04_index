			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO REVIEW SAN JUAN REDEVELOPMENT;  </P> <P> PRESERVATION: THE 10-MEMBER PANEL WILL RECOMMEND CHANGES IN A HISTORIC-AREA  PLAN. IT WILL INCLUDE ARCHEOLOGY EXPERTS, HISTORIANS AND MERCHANTS.  </P> <P> In an attempt to build community-wide support for a downtown redevelopment  project, the Community Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday voted to form a  citizens' committee that will review the plan and recommend changes.  </P> <P> Officials this week released plans to convert a 6-acre parcel, located one  block south of Mission San Juan Capistrano, into a Historic Town Center that  would pay tribute in a parklike setting to the city's roots.  </P> <P> Plans call for a creating a 3.5-acre archeological park, preserving two  historic homes and keeping intact most of the Redevelopment Agency-owned  businesses along the city's main thoroughfare, Camino Capistrano. The project  also proposes to realign Ortega Highway south to Verdugo Street.  </P> <P> The redevelopment agency directors, who are also council members, voted to form  a 10-member committee that will include archeology experts, historians,  merchants and citizens. Appointments to the advisory committee will be made at  an unspecified future date.  </P> <P> "I would really like to pull from all facets of the community because everybody  has something at stake," Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said.  </P> <P> City officials formulated this latest redevelopment plan after an earlier  proposal was met with ardent opposition. That plan, drawn up in 1985, called  for a 125-room hotel, restaurants and retail shops. Opponents argued that the  development was too intense for a historic area that contains archeological  artifacts.  </P> <P> But members of Friends of San Juan Capistrano, a group formed in 1987 to oppose  original redevelopment plans and to promote historic preservation, praised the  current plan.  </P> <P> "Once again, San Juan Capistrano takes a bold step forward for preservation and  sensitive community planning," said Mark Clancey, president of Friends of San  Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> The advisory panel will review the plan, identify potential problems and  recommend changes, City Manager Stephen B. Julian said.  </P> <P> The redevelopment agency also pushed for creation of a nonprofit organization  that would oversee and raise money for further archeological exploration of the  Historic Town Center.  </P> <P> Since January, 1988, the city has spent $1 million on archeological excavations  of the site, which uncovered Indian artifacts and building foundations from the  late 18th Century. Portions of the area are shown on early 19th-Century maps as  a town square that extended from the mission grounds.  </P> <P> But city officials are reluctant to spend more of the taxpayers' money to  explore the site beyond what is legally required for environmental  documentation, Friess said.  </P> <P> Times correspondent Len Hall contributed to this report.  </P></p>

The prime minister, who left at 1330 today for the United  States via Ireland, revealed the point of his official visit to  Washington in his statement yesterday that it is a big battle in  a friendly climate for all our national issues.    At his meeting with the Greek prime minister, the U.S.  President might also raise Greek-Turkish relations and the  Kurdish issue. After their meeting, the two leaders will give a  joint news conference. On Wednesday 26 April [as heard], the  prime minister will meet Archbishop Iakovos of North and South  America.    The prime minister, who is visiting the United States at the  invitation of President Clinton, will be accompanied by a  government entourage, economic advisers, and 25 representatives  from economic organizations.    Referring to the prime minister's visit to the United  States,  government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that Papandreou,  within the friendly atmosphere of Greek-U.S relations, will wage  the battle to promote our national issues. Venizelos said: The  ultimate goal is to improve Greek-U.S. relations. Improvement  comes through the help that we naturally expect for promoting  our national issues and stability in the region.    Papandreou will be visiting Washington as Greek prime  minister. But if issues pertaining to EU [European Union]-U.S.  relations are raised they will be discussed in his capacity as  president of the European Council.

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / ICI may pay less for electricity to safeguard chlorine business THE GOVERNMENT plans to allow Imperial Chemical Industries to buy electricity at cheaper rates than other UK industrial users in an attempt to safeguard its chlorine business. The move should secure 7,000 jobs at ICI's chlor-alkali plant at Runcorn, Cheshire. PowerGen, the generating group, would be offered a licence to supply electricity directly to the plant. The proposals follow threats by ICI last year to abandon its chlorine business unless it could secure supplies of cheap power. If ICI abandoned chlorine production to foreign competition, it estimates the impact on the UK balance of trade would be Pounds 1.5bn. The group, which currently buys electricity from a spot market, experienced sharply higher power costs following the industry's privatisation. ICI's chlorine-based plants at Runcorn are the UK's largest consumers of electricity - capable of using 250MW, equivalent to 1 per cent of the UK's entire output. The Department of Trade and Industry must now decide whether other large industrial users should benefit from similar licences. Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Council, said he would want to assess why ICI should be a special case, according to The Engineer, a specialist magazine. Blue Circle Industries, the UK's largest cement manufacturer, and British Steel are likely to want similar deals. The DTI's proposals would allow PowerGen's Ince power-station near Runcorn to supply the chlor-alkali plant directly. Ince is fuelled by oil or Venezuelan bitumen. ICI would prefer to use the Fiddler's Ferry 2,000MW plant five miles from Runcorn, which produces cheap electricity from coal. The company has been paying up to Pounds 31 a megawatt hour for electricity compared with under Pounds 20 before privatisation. Electricity now accounts for about 70 per cent of the variable costs of ICI's chlorine production. In November, ICI said it had given itself three months to sort out the problem.</p>

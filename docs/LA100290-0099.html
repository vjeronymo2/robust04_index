			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: SUFFERING STARTS IF PAIN ENDS  </P> <P> All athletes have a big problem as to what to do in the after-life, when their  sports careers are over and it's time for the real world. Bob Golic has a  bigger one than most.  </P> <P> The Raider lineman has to find an occupation that will fill needs built up over  two decades of nonstop football play in the most grueling position of all,  defensive tackle.  </P> <P> Bob Golic is going to miss the pain. Bob Golic is going to miss the Monday  morning head buzzes, the locked knee, the twist in the lower back, the ringing  in the ears and the overwhelming urge to throw up.  </P> <P> He's going to miss the Excedrin, the throbbing in the left ankle, the knee that  tells him when it's going to rain and the swelling in the calves, or even the  feeling that his left shoulder is free floating.  </P> <P> It's a neat problem. What do you do? See if your neighbor next door wants to  come over and exchange head butts? Try to find somebody who will double-team  you at the supermarket? Or who will sneak a punch in your gut and then step  aside with an injured innocent look? Or do you just go and ride a bike on the  Hollywood Freeway at twilight?  </P> <P> It's not easy living without pain. You feel as if something is missing from  your life. Bob Golic has been slamming into hostile, vengeful people all his  adult life and most of his childhood. It gets addictive after a while.  </P> <P> Some people like hot fudge sundaes. Others are partial to baked Alaska or  chocolate malts. Bob Golic is addicted to having his teeth hurt. Nosebleeds are  kind of fun, too. He has had his thumb broken so many times he always looks as  if he's hitchhiking.  </P> <P> It's hard to give up a way of life. Golic can do without the crowds cheering,  the wave, the banquets, the adulation -- but he could break down and cry when  he realizes he's not going to be on the five-yard line against the Chicago  Bears ever again, living the ecstasy of having his facemask ripped by some  sociopath who is just smaller than a bus.  </P> <P> Bob Golic has been wearing a helmet so much of his life only a few people know  what color his hair is. Or even if he has any. He's hard to recognize unless  he's lying on top of a quarterback or manhandling a halfback. In the NFL, if  you don't have the football, nobody knows who you are. But all the flossy plays  by the passers and wide receivers would not be possible if people like Bob  Golic didn't get them the ball.  </P> <P> Bob Golic has been getting the ball for people since grade school. He's a  charter member of the hall of fame at his high school, St. Joseph in Cleveland.  At Notre Dame, he made 479 tackles, more than anyone else in the history of the  school. Wherever the football showed up, Golic did, too.  </P> <P> But crashing into other 270-pound behemoths every weekend, or every practice,  wasn't enough for Golic. In his spare time, he wrestled. Not the Hulk Hogan  hype wrestling, the real article, the kind where the blood isn't ketchup. He  had a high school record of 67-14-2 and was state champion. At Notre Dame, his  wrestling record was 54-4-1. Golic was happiest when he was either in a  headlock or inflicting one. Some guys watch birds in their off-hours, others  play golf. Golic preferred to throw people around -- or vice versa.  </P> <P> Bob Golic sat in the Raiders' locker room after Sunday's Bear game and peeled  off the tools of combat -- yards of bloody tape, a scarred helmet, a mound of  dirt. He grinned at the circle of microphones and note pads of the assembled  press.  </P> <P> "I enjoy the pounding," he said. "It's very familiar to me."  </P> <P> Would he miss it?  </P> <P> Golic laughed and said, "I guess I'll have to get in some dangerous occupation.  I don't want to get bored."  </P> <P> Golic might not be content with putting out oil-well fires or defusing  terrorist bombs or even climbing the Matterhorn in street shoes. He might need  to go out periodically and persuade someone to fetch him a karate chop, or an  elbow in the ribs. He might have to get a friend to sink a fist in his  mid-section, kick him in the groin, do something to take away that longing in  his heart for the Green Bay Packers and the good old morning-after feeling, as  if he has just been run over by a truck.  </P> <P> When does the hurting from a game stop, he is asked, along about Wednesday?  Thursday?  </P> <P> "How about March?" Golic says with a wince. "How about just in time to go to  training camp and start all over?"  </P> <P> Has he always had this affinity for public suffering?  </P> <P> "Well," he says, grinning, "when I was a kid I used to get my father to run his  truck into me."  </P> <P> He pauses to laugh.  </P> <P> "Naw, I'm kidding. But you have to get used to collisions. It's crowded out  there."  </P> <P> Bob Golic is typical of the acquisitions of Al Davis' Raiders. It is the policy  to pick up skilled, crafty, still aggressive players whose own teams have  concluded that their usefulness is over.  </P> <P> Golic was a "Plan B" player with the Cleveland Browns, a veteran not protected  on the team's 37-man untouchable roster. The Raiders picked up such explosive  players as Lyle Alzado and John Matuszak similarly when their teams gave up on  them. Golic, to owner Davis, was another classic example of a guy who still had  a lot of tackles left in him, even though he made 738 in 10 years with the  Browns.  </P> <P> Golic has had a plate in his right arm, more or less permanent game-day stomach  cramps, and gets predictable postgame nausea. His cup runneth over. What more  could any red-blooded American boy ask for?  </P> <P> Being on the Raiders is a little slice of heaven, since opponents save their  most homicidal attacks for them. Golic doesn't have to fear being coddled.  Playing in a Raider line is a little like having a home on the slopes of Mt.  St. Helens.  </P> <P> Golic wouldn't have it any other way. It's kind of boring walking around and  not having anything to heal and your stomach is at rest and the bleeding has  stopped. I mean, if you feel good all the time, what do you have to compare it  to?  </P> <P> Fortunately, Golic doesn't have to worry. He only feels good in March and parts  of April. His biggest nightmare is probably that when he retires, he will wake  up every morning feeling like singing and without a mark on him -- and his next  door neighbor will be a priest.  </P></p>

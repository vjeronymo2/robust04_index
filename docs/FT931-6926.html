			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / The Property Market: Investment Property Databank's figures indicates hint of market improvement THERE WAS a hint of improvement in the market in January, according to the Investment Property Databank's latest monthly figures. January saw the lowest monthly fall in capital values recorded since last July - by just over half a point - the result of a further outward shift in yields and the continued decline in rental values. Total return for January stood at 0.2 per cent, an increase from the zero return recorded in December. But the year-on-year results continued to fall. Rents fell by more than 10 per cent in the year to January, while capital growth and total return fell to -8.5 per cent and -0.2 per cent, respectively. Offices and industrials showed a relative improvement in their monthly returns of four and five basis points respectively, while those for the retail sector remained static, at 0.3 per cent. The industrial sector showed the strongest monthly return, beating retails for the first time since January 1992. A slight deterioration in capital values, to -0.4 per cent, meant that total return for the retail sector remained at 0.3 per cent for the month. Office values improved by about half a point in January, representing their highest monthly return since early 1990.</p>

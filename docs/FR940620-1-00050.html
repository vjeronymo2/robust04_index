The clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of data identified as ``deferred delivery'' data at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data items) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such technical data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify which technical data is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such data to permit timely delivery of the data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deferred ordering. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7027, ``Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software'', when a firm requirement technical data has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for the data. Under this clause, the contracting officer may order any technical data that has been generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such technical data expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the data are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the technical data into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 227.403&hyph;9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Copyright. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Copyright license.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', requires a contractor to grant, or obtain for the government license rights which permit the government to reproduce data, distribute copies of the data, publicly perform or display the data or, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in technical data will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate a copyright license that provides fewer rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted data into a deliverable data item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted data in which the government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Copyright considerations_Acquisition of existing and special works. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See 227.405 or 227.406 for copyright considerations when acquiring existing or special works. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 227.403&hyph;10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Contractor identification and marking of technical data to be furnished with restrictive markings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Identification requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227&hyph;7017, ``Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions'', requires offerors to identify to the contracting officer, prior to contract award, any technical data that the offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the Attachment or fails to complete the Attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.607. An offeror's failure to correct the informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.403&hyph;13. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 227.403&hyph;13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract Attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision. Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' permits the contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

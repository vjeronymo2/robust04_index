Since Congress has provided funding for section 316 grants, the Department will hold a competition for new awards in Fiscal Year 1995. Hispanic-serving institutions should note that to receive a grant under section 316, a Hispanic-serving institution must satisfy the institutional eligibility requirements for the Strengthening Institutions and Endowment Challenge Grant Programs, as well as additional statutory eligibility criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996, the Department will conduct biennial grant award competitions under the Strengthening Institutions Program and under section 316 of the HEA for Hispanic-serving institutions. Under a biennial grant award competition, an institution submits a grant application that may be considered for funding under two successive fiscal year grant award competitions. Applications are evaluated and ranked by field readers for the first competition. If the institution's application is not selected for funding under the first fiscal year's award competition, it will be considered for funding under the second fiscal year's award competition for new awards based upon the score it received in the first competition. As part of this scheme, no new applications will be accepted for the second fiscal year competition for new awards. Accordingly, if an institution wishes to apply for a new grant award under the Strengthening Institutions Program for Fiscal Year 1995 or Fiscal Year 1996, it must submit an application for Fiscal Year 1995; and if an institution wishes to apply for a grant award under section 316 of the HEA, it must submit an application for Fiscal Year 1995. The Department will publish a separate closing date notice for those grant applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making awards under the Strengthening Institutions Program, under section 313(b) of the HEA, the Secretary gives priority in funding to institutions that are not already receiving funding under a Strengthening Institutions Program grant. Therefore, in awarding grants in Fiscal Year 1995, the Secretary will fund in rank-order from those applicants that have a funding priority in Fiscal Year 1995. In awarding grants in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fiscal Year 1996, the Secretary will fund in rank-order from those applicants that have a funding priority in Fiscal Year 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The biennial grant award competition has the following institutional eligibility implications. To receive a grant in Fiscal Year 1995, an institution must submit an institutional eligibility application to the Department by the deadline date set forth in this notice and must qualify as an eligible institution. To receive a grant in Fiscal Year 1996, an institution must submit an institutional eligibility application to the Department by the deadline date set forth in a notice that will be published for that year and must qualify as an eligible institution under that notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of awarding grants under section 316 of the HEA, if the Secretary selects an institution to receive a grant in Fiscal Year 1996, for purposes of determining whether the institution has an enrollment of undergraduate full-time equivalent students that is at least 25 percent Hispanic students, the Secretary will consider that the institution submitted its application in Fiscal Year 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To receive a grant in Fiscal Year 1996, an institution does not have to submit an institutional eligibility application to the Department in Fiscal Year 1995. However, the failure to submit an eligibility application for Fiscal Year 1995 will preclude that institution from receiving any benefits that derive from being an eligible institution during that fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

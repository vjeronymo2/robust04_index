			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TWO FORCES SPARK A REVIVAL AT BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL: POWER RUNNING OF BARRIOS, HARD-NOSED COACHING OF LUCZAJ HELP PUT  COYOTES IN THE PLAYOFFS.  </P> <P> In a league that features such perennially strong teams as Sunny Hills and  Fullerton, Buena Park rarely has been taken seriously.  </P> <P> In fact, before this season, the Coyotes had won only one Freeway League game  since 1983 and had not qualified for the playoffs since 1981.  </P> <P> But this year, Buena Park swaggered into the season with a two-fisted  confidence that caught more than one opponent off guard. The Coyotes stunned La  Habra, 54-0, in the seventh game and secured a playoff spot with a 28-13  victory over Troy last Friday night.  </P> <P> For the first time in recent memory, the Coyotes (5-4, 3-1 in league) are  ranked in the sportswriters' divisional polls. Tonight, they play Fullerton,  also 3-1 in league.  </P> <P> Two keys to Buena Park's new-found success are Angel Barrios, a 6-foot-2,  215-pound junior running back, and Martin Luczaj, the team's first-year coach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE PLAYER  </P> <P> Barrios, a soft-spoken, hard-running 16-year-old with sleepy eyes and  short-cropped hair, has been a major factor in the Coyotes' turnaround.  </P> <P> He is among Orange County's leaders in rushing (1,030 yards, an 8.9 average)  and (16 touchdowns). He has run for more than 100 yards in three consecutive  games, including 211 against Troy and 196 (and three touchdowns) against La  Habra.  </P> <P> "He's big, strong and fast," Troy Coach John Turek said. "He runs with  determination and doesn't let one tackler bring him down. He just runs with  authority."  </P> <P> Lineman Gavin Molinar, one of Barrios' best friends, says: "I love to block for  him. We're like a pair. When I block for Angel, he does something and that  motivates me.  </P> <P> "After he has a big run or scores, he always comes back to the huddle and says,  'Good job, linemen. Good job.' And because he's so modest about it, it makes  you work that much harder."  </P> <P> "Barrios is a real talent," Luczaj says, "and the kids rally around him just as  anyone would rally around a talented athlete."  </P> <P> Football isn't the only sport in which Barrios has found success. He also plays  basketball and, in the same season, plays baseball and runs track. If he  continues at his current pace, he would be one of the top varsity  letter-winners in Buena Park history, with nine.  </P> <P> Barrios usually excels at any sport he tries. Recently, Molinar took Barrios to  play racquetball. Molinar had been playing for about six months; it was  Barrios' first time.  </P> <P> "Angel beat my socks off," Molinar says. "That's just Angel, though. Every time  he picks up a ball, he wins."  </P> <P> On the Buena Park campus, the Barrios legend is growing. Some have started  calling him "Bo," a reference to professional football and baseball player Bo  Jackson.  </P> <P> But it hasn't been all touchdown runs and end zone celebrations for Barrios,  who transferred from Servite to Buena Park after his freshman year. He has  struggled in the classroom. His parents separated, and he has moved back and  forth between them.  </P> <P> "I don't know how he does it," Molinar says. "But he's always there for  everybody. I think he does it a lot to please his dad. If his dad's happy, then  Angel is happy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE COACH  </P> <P> If Barrios is one of the instruments that has helped turn around a withering  program, then Luczaj is the conductor who has orchestrated it all.  </P> <P> These days, he is looking more and more the hero, although if you call looking  for him at the athletic offices, an assistant coach might answer good-naturedly  that Luczaj's head is too big to fit indoors these days.  </P> <P> Luczaj admits he likes being in charge. That, he says, is why he left Fullerton  College and came to Buena Park, where is also athletic director and a physical  education teacher.  </P> <P> Resuscitating a dying program is not new for Luczaj. He did it at Fullerton  High School, which had had a 3-17 record in the two seasons before Luczaj  arrived in 1981. Three years later, Luczaj led the Indians to a Central  Conference championship.  </P> <P> At Buena Park, the change has not come easily, though. "Coming in, I've had to  be a hard-nosed coach, who instilled discipline," Luczaj said. As he expected,  the players responded negatively at first.  </P> <P> Not until the Coyotes defeated La Habra did they begin to realize things were  getting better.  </P> <P> "We wanted to give up by the middle of (the nonleague games)," Barrios says.  "At first we didn't believe in him. Now, we believe."  </P> <P> Says Molinar: "We wanted to be better than (Luczaj's) old team, Fullerton. We  got tired of hearing Fullerton this, Fullerton that. We just wanted to shut him  up."  </P> <P> Luczaj says some people perceive him as brash and egotistical, and he is not  without detractors. But the team's play has helped quiet them.  </P> <P> "I knew there was going to be grumblings," Luczaj says. "I don't even hear it  any more after 17 years coaching in the area.  </P> <P> "I'm older and wiser. I've stopped worrying about what others think. I just try  to do the best job possible for the kids to help them experience success. What  others think, I'm not really concerned about. It's high school football and  sometimes it gets blown out of proportion."  </P> <P> Besides, Luczaj believes Buena Park's success on the field speaks volumes.  </P> <P> "For Buena Park to be playing for a spot in the playoffs eight or nine games  into the season says a lot about what we've been able to accomplish."  </P></p>

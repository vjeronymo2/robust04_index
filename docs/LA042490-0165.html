			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMERSON ANNOUNCES LAYOFFS  </P> <P> As part of a consolidation with a recently acquired sister company, Emerson  Computer Power, a maker of power supply equipment, began laying off 100 of its  580 employees in the past month, the company confirmed Monday.  </P> <P> Emerson Computer Power, a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Emerson Electric Co.,  makes uninterruptible power supplies, or devices that protect electronic  equipment from sudden power surges or power outages.  </P> <P> The unit has been located in Santa Ana since 1963.  </P> <P> "The 100 layoffs relate to a reorganization combining field management, inside  sales and administrative staff with the Liebert division in Columbus, Ohio,"  said Jim Orso, a spokesman for Emerson Electric in St. Louis. "The employees  were informed in March and (the layoffs) will be completed by mid-May."  </P> <P> Emerson Electric, a $7.1-billion diversified electronic-components firm, bought  Liebert Corp., maker of computer cooling systems, in 1987.  </P> <P> In the consolidation, part of the computer power division has been transferred  to the parent company's industrial controls division in Grand Island, N.Y., and  a manufacturing line has been moved to another Emerson Computer unit in Irvine.  </P></p>

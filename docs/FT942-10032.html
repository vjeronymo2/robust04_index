			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Standing tall in a mini-market - Retailer Fotex is hard to ignore in Hungary Fotex, Hungary's biggest retail group, will next week begin drawing on cash from eastern Europe's largest international equity offering. With investor enthusiasm for emerging markets dampened, the company and CS First Boston, its advisers, could only raise Dollars 70m, Dollars 30m short of the planned sum. This is, nevertheless, sufficient to fuel Fotex's rapid expansion for up to two years. Fotex, a home-grown private enterprise, retails household goods, cosmetics, furniture, optical products and photographic services. The capital increase will finance its entry into yet another segment. The group has agreed to pay Dollars 30m to acquire 99.5 per cent of Keravill, Hungary's largest consumer electronics and appliance chain. Fotex is also making a tentative expansion of its its cash-and-carry DAK chain, with a plan to increase the number of stores from 11 to 40, at a cost of up to Dollars 15m. Acquisitions like that of Keravill, and organic growth, are expected to double turnover and net profits, which in 1993 were Ft15.8bn (Dollars 154m) and Ft945m respectively. By international standards, it is not much, but Fotex will account for some 4 per cent of non-food retail sales in Hungary this year. The domination by one conglomerate in five retail segments would run into problems in a western economy. However, Mr Gabor Varszegi, chief executive and principal shareholder of Fotex, plays down his strength in the marketplace. But he does admit, with more than a touch of pride: 'At the end of the day, if Max Factor and Revlon want to be successful (in Hungary) they have to deal with us.' Fotex's growth, however, raises the question: how long before the group bumps its head against the ceiling? Hungary's competition office can stop acquisitions with potential to give a combined market share of 30 per cent or more. However, the monopoly watchdog has proved toothless. Fotex's latest prospectus to investors says the competition office has, legally, left it too late to challenge any of the group's acquisitions. In any case, there remain virgin retail sectors for Fotex to breach. Mr Varszegi expects turnover of Ft10bn over three years from its role as exclusive distributor of mobile telecommunications services provided by Westel 900, the joint venture with US West, the regional Bell operating company. Fotex is thinking of introducing non-perishable food to its DAK stores, and Mr Varszegi also mentions stationery as another retail possibility. The privatisation authorities may be increasingly reluctant to feed Fotex's retail weight, but plenty of other openings for acquisition remain. Excessive reliance on debt financing and economic recession have combined to put many private companies into receivership, and on to the market. And Mr Varszegi is a natural stop for sellers. 'You wouldn't believe some of the things that he's been offered,' says an investment banker close to the group. Fotex has edged out of retailing to acquire manufacturers and wholesalers with the aim of vertical integration. The group has, for instance, taken over Balaton Butorgyar, a furniture producer, to ensure security of supply for Domus, Fotex's chain of furniture stores. However, diversification has its limits. Institutional investors hold most of the 76 per cent of Fotex not in Mr Varszegi's hands, and they constantly advertise the virtues of focus. Mr Varszegi, who is widely believed to be eastern Europe's richest individual, has invested in property, a brokerage house and other areas. But this dabbling has gone, not through Fotex, but via his private Panama-registered company, Blackburn International. Although expansion into neighbouring countries would be one outlet for Mr Varszegi's acquisitive drive, the Fotex chief executive says he has investigated the possibilities and remains sceptical. '(The rest of) eastern Europe is underdeveloped compared with Hungary. Fotex is too sophisticated a company.' He makes an exception for the Czech Republic, but says the policy of privatising retail outlets one by one has complicated matters. He believes it will be between five and eight years before other eastern European countries are sufficiently well-regulated to allow a serious commitment. Even if Fotex is cramped in Hungary, economic recovery offers room for growth. Fotex has prospered in spite of a four-year recession that has driven gross domestic product down by more than 20 per cent. The group is now better-placed than anyone to benefit from a revival in Hungarian consumer spending, says an investment banker. He compares Mr Varszegi to the retail entrepreneurs who rose on the back of the UK's consumer spending expansion in the 1980s. Most failed when boom turned to bust. Mr Varszegi must hope that the parallel does not extend so far.</p>

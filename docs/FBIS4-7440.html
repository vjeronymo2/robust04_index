			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday in Sarajevo, the Croatian-Muslim Assembly  finally and formally abolished Bosnia-Herzegovina as a federal  unit of the former Yugoslavia, Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of  the Assembly of the Srpska republic, said. We may all be  pleased with this act. The former Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer  exists and, due to this fact, we are altogether at a great step  closer to peace, Krajisnik pointed out.</p>

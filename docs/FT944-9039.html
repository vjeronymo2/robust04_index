			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Farmers welcome land reform plan Legislation to reform agricultural tenancy laws in England and Wales has been broadly welcomed by farming groups for its provisions to free up land for young farmers and new entrants to farming. The legislation will reintroduce freely-negotiated tenancies between farmer and landowner. The proposed legislation will also create a new farm business tenancy arrangement to try to attract a wider range of land-based rural enterprises.</p>

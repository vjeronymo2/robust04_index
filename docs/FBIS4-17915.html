			<p>BFN     [Text] An agreement on the Kazakh-Chinese border,  stretching 1700 kilometers, is the main result of the  Kazakh-Chinese talks, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev told  a press conference on Tuesday.    He said that none of the former Soviet republics bordering  on  China had concluded such an agreement. He also believes that  this document reflects Kazakhstan's and China's determination to  maintain stable, friendly relations.    Nazarbayev pointed out that the positions of the two states'  leaders on the political situation in Asia were the same.    Both parties stated that the agreement between the Kazakh  Transportation Ministry and the Chinese Railways Ministry lifted  all limitations from the transit of cargo and passengers between  China and Kazakhstan.    Nazarbayev announced that the agreement on the extension of  a  50 million yuan credit will be used to broaden bilateral and  invigorate border trade, to reconstruct the Karaganda steel mill  and build enterprises putting out consumer goods.</p>

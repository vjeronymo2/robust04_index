			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / European works council marks Ford policy shift A EUROPEAN works council is to be established at the Ford motor company covering its 100,000 employees in Britain, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Belgium. Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU general union national officer for the car industry in Britain yesterday said: 'Ford workers throughout Europe can today celebrate a new European unity among their unions. 'We recognise Ford operates as one European entity in the single market. Unfortunately the backward British government has singularly failed to come to terms with its social obligations towards workers in the European community.' Until now, Ford has opposed the idea of a works council covering all its European operations. But the EC is soon expected to endorse a directive on works councils that will compel Ford and other companies to introduce them. The new body will contain full-time union officials and plant conveners from the UK. German members will come from existing works councils in Ford plants. It has taken long discussions between the unions to reach agreement on the Ford works council. There are around 25 European-wide company works councils, mainly in French-owned enterprises and other car companies. Separately, the final touches are being put to a union pay claim at Ford in the UK. Conscious of the troubles facing the company, union negotiators intend to give their highest priority to job security rather than a big pay rise. Vauxhall faces industrial conflict if it fails to improve its existing two-year wage offer to its 8,000 workers when it meets union officials next Wednesday. Mr Roger Butler, the AEEU engineering union's chief negotiator, said unions would hold a strike ballot if the offer of a 2.1 per cent rise this year and 2.6 per cent next year is not increased. The unions are seeking a substantial rise and a cut in working hours. They say productivity has improved by 8 per cent over the past 12 months and the company is making substantial profits.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (4): The dawn was false - Why producers are glum FLAGGING consumption, record production and stocks and historically low prices add up to an unappetising recipe for any commodity sector. To most people the obvious prescription for the indigestion felt by producers in such a situation, especially those whose operating costs were not being covered in the market place, would be a substantial dose of capacity mothballing, if not outright scrapping. To the more far-sighted, however, the danger of overdosing on retrenchment and so blighting the longer term prospects of the industry as a whole might be regarded as a comparable, if not greater, evil. That was the attitude taken a year ago, when the aluminium market faced just such a situation, by a considerable number of industry analysts. They need not have worried. Producers did not cut output on the scale feared by the analysts, consumption did not turn upwards as many had expected and as a result the market remains sumptuously oversupplied with aluminium at prices even lower than the sadly depressed levels of October, 1991. The mood of the aluminium producing sector late last year was somewhat equivocal. The fundamental situation was certainly bad. But there seemed no reason to panic as the factors that were depressing the market could mostly be regarded as short term. The world economic recession could not last much longer; neither could the heavy influx of metal from the former Soviet Union. And many producers felt that while some rationalisation of production capacity might be prudent in the circumstances, it could safely be left to their competitors. A rise in prices early this year seemed for a while to justify that attitude and there was a noticeable drying up of cutback announcements to augment those promised in late 1991, most of which had been completed by the end of the first quarter. But the price rise proved to be a false dawn, and as Billiton-Enthoven metals put it in the May edition of its Aluminium Update, it was 'in no way reflected in a turnround in this market's fundamentals', which remained 'to say the least, unconstructive'. Consumption remained 'muted', Billiton said; production cuts had 'not had the desired impact'; and stocks had continued to rise 'swelled further by resumed shipments from the CIS'. Billiton suggested a variety of reasons why producers might hesitate to cut output: the costs involved in shutting or mothballing plants; the willingness of large integrated producers to operate high-cost smelters and accept the metal as a transfer price within their operations: 'In the hope that the less efficient among the independents would take the decision to close'; the linking of power and/or alumina (aluminium oxide) prices to the price of the metal, particularly in the US. 'Thus,' it explained, 'falling metal prices exert significant downward pressure on the cost curve of the industry;' the fact that many producers were able to 'lock in' higher prices by selling forward late in 1990, when the market picked up. 'The more modest improvement in prices since the start of this year has also encouraged some forward selling,' Billiton added. According to the Spector Report, a New York-based aluminium industry consultancy, permanent plant closures in 1991 amounted to 372,000 tonnes and temporary closures to 623,000 tonnes. The effect of these cuts shows up in figures from the International Primary Aluminium Institute. The average daily production rate fell from a peak of 41,000 tonnes in June, 1991 to 39,700 tonnes in December, then held steady until falling further to 39,300 tonnes in March. But then the effect of new capacity and expansions began to overtake that of the cutbacks and by August the figure was back to 40,200 tonnes. 'In the absence of further cutbacks this rebound in production is sure to continue,' said Billiton in its late-September Metals Report. While Pechiney's new 215,000-tonnes a year smelter at Dunkirk had been fully operational since mid-May there was more to come from two new smelters in Quebec, Lauralco, at Deschambault, and Alouette, at Sept Isles. Both these 215,000-tonne units were well on the way to full production, Billiton said, the former scheduled for this month and the latter in December. In addition the 235,000-tonne Alba expansion in Bahrain was reported to be ahead of schedule, with a fourth potline likely to be on stream by December. Overall, the Spector Report says, these projects will have added 900,000 tonnes to annual capacity and 394,000 tonnes to expected 1992 production. Further production boosts have come from Indonesia's Inalum, after increased rainfall enhanced availability of hydro-electric power, and Canada's Alcan, which this month restarted three potlines totalling 67,500 tonnes a year, closure of which occurred last year due to a water shortage. Future expansion plans are thin on the ground. Alusaf has a 400,000 tonnes a year plant in South Africa on the drawing board. But financing for that project has yet to be finalised and an environmental impact report, which could delay or perhaps kill off the plan, is expected any day. Further advanced but equally doubtful is a 180,000 tonnes a year plant in Nigeria for which Reynolds Metals of the US, which has an 11 per cent interest, is providing the technology. The Nigerian government is financing the whole of the Dollars 1.66bn project, which Mr Randolph Reynolds, executive vice president, international, of Reynolds Metals, recently said was 'coming along slowly'. He added that his company was 'being very cautious and making sure the money is available before making any move'. In Australia a decision is expected before the end of this year on a possible doubling of capacity at Comalco's 230,000 tonnes a year Boyne Island smelter in Queensland. This project is complicated by the need, if it is to go ahead, for a consortium including Comalco to spend ADollars 750m on buying the nearby Gladstone power station from the Queensland state government. Billiton, in its September report, put 1991 western world production (including Yugoslavia) at 15.11m tonnes, which was more or less in line with the July estimate of Anthony Bird Associates, a specialist aluminium consultancy, of 14.81m tonnes (excluding Yugoslavia). The two reports agreed that output would be down this year - Billiton suggested 14.75m tonnes and Bird 14.49m tonnes - but while Bird saw the fall continuing to 14.31m tonnes in 1993 Billiton, with the benefit of another two months of data, thought the uptrend would be resumed, taking the 1993 figure to about 15.1m tonnes. Some divergence is also apparent on the prospect for CIS exports. In July Bird projected 'net socialist exports of aluminium (including Yugoslavia) of 750,000 tonnes in 1992, down only slightly from 1991's 800,000 tonnes'. But in the longer term it suggested that 'although there may be great uncertainty about the timing of the coming decline in CIS exports, we have little doubt that the decline will happen, and that it will be severe'. It explained that few of the 'technically very inefficient' CIS smelters would be able to stay in business when they had to pay realistic prices for their inputs. In contrast Billiton has warned against pinning hopes on a big cut in CIS exports, noting that recent reports suggested that they could this year be as high as the 1991 record, which it put at 875,000 tonnes, 'and will remain high for the foreseeable future because of the country's need for hard currency'. 'There is the possibility that CIS smelters could be forced to close or reduce output markedly if environmental laws are enforced stringently,' it added. 'But few regard this as likely in the near future.'  ------------------------------------------------------         PRODUCTION COSTS IN US CENTS PER POUND  ------------------------------------------------------ Country         Cost       Company      Cost  ------------------------------------------------------ AUSTRALIA         45       ALCAN          50 BRAZIL            55       ALCOA          51 CANADA            43       ALUMAX         49 FRANCE            52       ALUSUISSE      69 GERMANY           67       COMALCO        51 JAPAN             58       HYDRO AL       64 NORWAY            63       KAISER         58 SPAIN             80       PECHINEY       56 UK                63       REYNOLDS       50 USA               56       VAW            60 VENEZUELA         42  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Anthony Bird Associates  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

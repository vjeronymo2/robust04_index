			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW SUDAN LEADER PURGES MILITARY;  </P> <P> MOST TOP GENERALS FIRED; PEACE TALK RESUMPTION PLEDGED  </P> <P> Sudan's new military ruler, Brig. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir, dismissed more  than two dozen generals in a purge of the armed forces Saturday and said he  will seek to resume peace talks with secessionist rebels waging a six-year-long  war in the south.  </P> <P> Moving quickly to consolidate power following the bloodless coup that toppled  the civilian government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi on Friday, Bashir  announced the dismissal of 28 generals -- virtually the entire senior command  of the Sudanese armed forces -- including the commander in chief, Fathi Ahmed  Ali, who reportedly is also under arrest, and Chief of Staff Babu Nimir, who  was said to be an ally of the ousted prime minister.  </P> <P> Reports from the Sudanese capital of Khartoum said the city remained calm  Saturday, with no outward signs of resistance despite what had been initial  fears that some of the large and well-armed militias controlled by Sudan's now  disbanded political parties might try to oppose the military takeover, which  ended three years of democratic but chronically disorganized rule in the  largest nation in Africa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Troops Patrol City  </P> <P> Diplomats in Khartoum said that troops continued to patrol the city, manning  roadblocks and checkpoints at key intersections. Telex and telephone  communications, cut immediately after the coup, were restored, but Khartoum  airport remained closed to most air traffic.  </P> <P> A state of emergency also remained in force, with Radio Omdurman, the state  broadcasting service, warning that violators of a nighttime curfew in the  capital risked being shot on sight.  </P> <P> Egypt, Sudan's northern neighbor and the Arab country with the largest  strategic stake in stability in Khartoum, cautiously welcomed the new regime,  with editorials in Cairo's state-run press focusing on the political anarchy,  sectarian tensions, corruption and economic mismanagement that were endemic to  Mahdi's hapless government.  </P> <P> Chad, another neighbor, also welcomed the change, but there was no immediate  reaction from Libya, whose increasing military presence in Sudan was a major  factor behind what has been a steady deterioration of Egyptian-Sudanese  relations since Mahdi came to power.  </P> <P> Bashir, who in the wake of the coup appointed himself prime minister, defense  minister and armed forces commander, is said to be pro-Egyptian, having done  some of his military training here.  </P> <P> It is still not clear, more than a day after the pre-dawn coup, who the other  members are of a new 15-man Revolutionary Command Council set up to govern  Sudan. But, like Bashir, they are said to be mostly middle-ranking officers  dissatisfied with the Mahdi government's political paralysis and seeming  inability to negotiate an end to the bloody war in the south against rebels  from the Sudanese People's Liberation Army.  </P> <P> Bashir, meeting Saturday with Cabinet undersecretaries, sharply criticized  Mahdi's ambivalent approach toward peace talks and said that he will launch a  new initiative aimed at reaching an accord with the rebels, Radio Omdurman  said.  </P> <P> "Our primary goal is peace. We (the army) are the people most suffering from  war, and I will enlist the help of all experts in the quest for peace," the  radio quoted him as saying.  </P> <P> He said that a referendum could determine whether Sudan should have Islamic  law, or sharia, which has been a key issue in the civil war.  </P> <P> The civil war, pitting the Christian and animist-dominated south against the  Muslim north, has made millions homeless, ruined the Sudanese economy and  caused untold suffering by preventing relief supplies from reaching the  famine-stricken south.  </P> <P> Last February, the military issued a public ultimatum demanding that Mahdi  either make peace with the rebels or give the armed forces the means to win the  war. The prime minister's faction-ridden government appeared unable to do  either, however, and this paralysis was seen by most observers as the key  factor leading to his downfall.  </P> <P> It was still not clear what had happened to Mahdi, who was elected premier  three years ago when another military regime stepped down after overthrowing  President Jaafar Numeiri in a 1985 coup.  </P> <P> Some reports said that Mahdi had been arrested, along with most of the other  senior members of his government. But other reports suggested he had escaped,  possibly to Libya. The new government remained silent on his fate.  </P> <P> Throughout the day, Radio Omdurman broadcast what it said were messages of  support for the new government from army units stationed across the country.  </P> <P> Little about Bashir was known to outsiders before the coup. But according to  details now emerging about his background, he is a 43-year-old paratroop  commander who achieved a measure of fame as the hero of a major victory over  rebels at the town of Mayoum.  </P> <P> He is a Muslim and a northerner of Arab extraction who, according to reports in  the Egyptian press, studied in the Soviet Union but is considered to be  anti-communist.  </P> <P> His elder brother, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, was quoted by Persian  Gulf newspapers Saturday as saying that Bashir was an admirer of Gen.  Abdul-Rahman Swareddahab, the former defense minister who overthrew Numeiri in  1985 and ruled for one year before stepping down in favor of a democratically  elected government headed by Mahdi.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tania Malheiros] </F>   [Text] Rio -- Edgar Kircher, the Furnas Electric Power  Plants, Inc. [Furnas] adviser for environmental security, has  reported that Angra-1 will probably be dismantled in about 15  years, or in other words around the year 2009.    Furnas failed to earn a profit of nearly $100 million (97.7  billion real cruzeiros) as a result of the fact that Angra-1  nuclear plant has been closed for more than a year without  producing any electrical energy. This energy should have been  connected to the electricity system serving the southeastern  region of the country. Angra-1 can produce energy equivalent to  20 percent of the electricity consumed in the city of Rio de  Janeiro. Furnas experts said that ``this loss is not really a  loss, but a profit the company failed to make.''    Angra-1 construction costs totalled about $2 billion, but  through having been disconnected over 30 times due to faulty  parts and equipment and to comply with court orders, the plant  has already forced the government to spend much more than that.  Concrete figures, however, have never been reported. Kleber  Cosenza, head of the Furnas Power Generation Department,  reported that Angra-1 fuel -- enriched uranium purchased from  Urenco (a consortium from Germany, England, and the Netherlands)  -- alone cost Furnas $20 million last year. Another $5 million  were spent in repairing the plant.    Consenza added that Angra-1 is undergoing final tests for  being put into operation again in 20 days. According to him,  the plant is theoretically ready to be put into operation. To  do so, however, Furnas needs the authorization of the National  Nuclear Energy Commission and the conclusion of the emergency  plan to evacuate Angra dos Reis residents in case of an  accident. The evacuation plan is about to be finished, and has  undergone a series of modifications, Consenza said.    Luiz Henrique Goncalves de Moraes, assistant at the Furnas  Thermonuclear Generation Superintendency, said that this plan  has to be reviewed so that Angra-1 can again operate. According  to him, the new plan meets the requirements of the international  concept establishing that in case of an accident, residents  living in a 3 km radius around the plant must be evacuated.    He reported that the latest data reported by the Brazilian  Institute for Geography and Statistics, IBGE, indicate that  nearly 9,000 people live in this area. In accordance with the  new plan, monitorial teams will determine small areas at a  radius of 5 km to 15 km around the plant to be isolated. He  said that in accordance with IBGE data nearly 70,000 people  currently live in this wider area.    On the night of 5 April, Furnas experts visited Angra-1  facilities during a visit made to the plant by a group of Sao  Paulo environmental experts.</p>

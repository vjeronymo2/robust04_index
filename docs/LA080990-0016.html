			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PENDLETON UNITS GOING TO MIDEAST  </P> <P> Although the highest-ranking U.S. Marine said Wednesday that there are no  immediate plans to dispatch elements of the Camp Pendleton-based 1st Marine  Division to the Middle East in response to the Iraq-Kuwait crisis, a  well-placed source who requested anonymity said Marines would be leaving for  the area and may already have left.  </P> <P> Gen. Alfred M. Gray, commandant of the Marine Corps, speaking at a press  conference at Camp Pendleton, said "any military option is going to require an  integrated team effort of all of the armed forces" and added that the 1st  Marine Division has not been placed on alert.  </P> <P> But a source confirmed on Wednesday that Camp Pendleton troops would indeed be  used in the Middle East operation. Military officials have emphasized the need  for secrecy concerning troop deployments.  </P> <P> Gray was at Camp Pendleton to attend a change-of-command ceremony. He will  return to Washington Friday.  </P></p>

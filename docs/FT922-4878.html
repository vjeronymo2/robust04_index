			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Brussels left with no clear ideas on next step The European Community has faced crises before - but no one, in Brussels, Copenhagen, or any other EC capital, has a clear idea of what to do following the Danish vote to reject the Maastricht treaty. Previous dramas have usually involved a deadlock, rather than the death of a full-scale treaty on which negotiations began some four years ago. It seems slightly incredible that a paper-thin majority in one country could halt ratification by all EC states of something as far-reaching as forging a new 21st century single currency and eventual common defence for Europe. But the Treaty of Rome clearly says such constitutional revisions must be unanimously agreed - and ratified - by all states. The Community's normal way out of an impasse is to look to its executive for guidance. But it is hard to see the Commission, whose usual board meeting today will be dominated by the treaty crisis, doing more than wringing its hands. In treaty revisions, it has no more power of proposal than an individual member state, and less, in the sense that it is not a signatory. Certainly, the government in Copenhagen will be fielding queries today from Brussels and other EC capitals about whether it thinks it could win a second referendum on a modified treaty. If so, there will be hurried calls on Portugal and Britain, current and impending presidents of the EC Council, to see if a renegotiation can be arranged. For, while it is extremely unlikely, and probably illegal, for Denmark to be simply sidestepped by its 11 partners, it is also clear that most EC leaders have invested too much political capital and effort in the endeavour for them not to seek to salvage some form of political and monetary union. It only needs a majority - seven out of 12 - of governments to set an intergovernmental conference rolling.</p>

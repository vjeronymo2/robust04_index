			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: A season for tempting trusts Autumn is here - the season for investment managers to dust off their marketing plans for new trusts to tempt investors, writes Bethan Hutton. Fidelity is launching Special Values, an investment trust to be run in parallel to Fidelity's Special Situations unit trust and under the same manager, Anthony Bolton. The idea of special situations is to find under-valued companies which have recovery or growth potential, are potential takeover targets, operate in niche markets, are being restructured or are under-researched. The other new offering is from BZW Investment Management and Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. It is an unusual concept: an investment trust specialising in companies which will benefit from development of the information infrastructure in the emerging economies of Asia, Europe and Latin America. This includes advertising, broadcasting, electronic hardware and software, newspapers and telecommunications.</p>

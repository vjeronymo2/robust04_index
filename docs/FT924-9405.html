			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finance awaited for Jamaican bauxite venture THE CREATION of a joint venture between a Ukrainian and a Jamaican company to mine bauxite on the island is awaiting the securing of financial guarantees, according to Jamaican bauxite industry officials. Jamaica Bauxite Mining, a state-owned company, and Nikolaev Alumina of the Ukraine have been negotiating the establishment of a company to rehabilitate and work bauxite mines on Jamaica's north coast, which were closed eight years ago, with the ore being processed in the Ukraine by Nikolaev. Mr Vin Lawrence, chairman of Jamaica Bauxite Mining, said it was proposed that his company would have a 51 per cent stake in the new company, with Nikolaev holding the remaining equity. He said neither the Jamaican nor the Ukrainian governments would be involved in the venture. The mines, which were worked by a local subsidiary of Reynolds Metals of the US, were closed in 1984. The venture being considered by Jamaica Bauxite Mining and Nikolaev will need between Dollars 20m and Dollars 25m to rehabilitate the mines. Production is projected to reach 2.5m tonnes a year within five years.</p>

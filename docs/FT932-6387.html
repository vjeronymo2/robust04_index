			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Fujitsu to cut dividend after losses despite profitable ICL FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer manufacturer which owns ICL, the UK-based computer group, has dropped into loss for the year ended March, and plans to cut its dividend. Pre-tax losses - Fujitsu's first since it was introduced to the stock market in 1949 - are Y8.7bn (Pounds 51.2m) for the parent company, compared with profits of Y40bn in 1991-92. On a consolidated basis, the pre-tax loss was Y16.1bn against profits of Y51.5bn after taking in losses at subsidiaries, including overseas operations. ICL, however, was one of the 'elite' companies, Fujitsu said. ICL made pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.6m for the year ended December 1992. Sales for the parent company dropped 1.5 per cent to Y2,398bn while on a consolidated basis sales were up marginally at Y34,619bn. The steep decline in investment in information technology by Japanese corporations in the past few years came at a time when Fujitsu's costs have been at a particularly high level. This was due to a management decision to invest heavily in strategic areas, particularly semi-conductors, and to keep employment levels high. Last year, Fujitsu took in 3,600 new recruits. It is also bearing a good part of the depreciation costs on its Pounds 200m initial investment in a new semi-conductor plant it has built in the UK. As a result, the decline in sales led directly to a fall in operating profits which were down by 76 per cent to Y15.9bn. A 4 per cent decline in sales of information processing equipment, which make up over 73 per cent of total revenues, wiped out the beneficial impact of a 7 per cent increase in overseas sales. Large mainframe computers, a profitable business for Fujitsu, were particularly affected. Fujitsu was obliged to sell stock holdings to boost its results, with a Y14.6bn profit on securities sales. It is not optimistic about the outlook for the current year. Parent sales are forecast to be lower at Y2,210bn. However, Fujitsu believes the benefits of a restructuring programme and cost cutting will help lift pre-tax profits to Y30bn. On a consolidated basis, Fujitsu sales are expected to drop 5 per cent drop to Y3,280bn and it hopes to break even at the net profit level.</p>

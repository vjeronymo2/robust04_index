Patten said: Under  circumstances where China and Britain cannot reach full  agreement on the issue of the political system, the British side  can still strive to reach a partial agreement with the Chinese  side on the issue of the political system or reach an agreement  on issues other than the political system, which states that  each side goes its own way (agree to disagree).    A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said last Friday that  the talks could only be reopened if the Hong Kong Government  revoked that part of the political reform bill submitted to the  Legislative Council [Legco]. Responding to this statement,  Patten pointed out: Legco has already started discussing part  of the political reform bill, it is impossible for the Hong Kong  Government to suddenly stop its legislative work, and the  legislative process concerned process will continue until the  end of February when Legco passes the bill. He said: The  Chinese side knew months ago that the Hong Kong Government is  facing a very big time constraint.  <H5>  Partial Agreement on Political System Welcomed </H5>   Faced with a deadlock in which China and Britain still  cannot  reopen the talks, Patten said that when he returns to Britain at  the end of this month to report on his work, he and Prime  Minister Major, Foreign Secretary Hurd, and other cabinet  members will review Sino-British relations following the  suspension of the talks and plan for the next step of the  legislative work on the electoral arrangements. He will also  hold in-depth discussions with the top British leadership on  four tactical options for handling Sino- British relations.    Patten said that he will attend a hearing held by the  Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee and will discuss current  Sino-British relations with Foreign Office officials. While in  London, Patten will meet Robin McLaren, British ambassador to  China and negotiator at the Sino-British talks, who has  recovered from an illness, and will discuss the outlook for  talks with him.    Patten said: Now, the top priority of the British side is  still to strive to hold an 18th round of talks with the Chinese  side and to strive to reach an agreement on the issues of the  through train, the functional constituencies, and the electoral  committee before the Hong Kong Government submits the remaining  parts of its political reform bill to Legco. He pointed out  that if both sides cannot reach a full agreement, he welcomes  both sides trying to reach a partial agreement, for example,  both sides could reach an agreement on one to two of the three  large issues, namely, the through train, the functional  constituencies, and the electoral committee to narrow the gap  between both sides on the arrangements for the political system.  For the British side, this is the second option.    However, Patten stressed: Even if the partial through train  arrangement theoretically emerges, there has been hardly any  sign so far that the Chinese side intends to reach a partial  agreement. Besides, he said, a partial agreement must contain  factors which are reasonable and deserve to be upheld.  <H3>  Vigorously Ensuring Other Kinds of Cooperation While Each  Side Goes Its Own Way </H3>   Patten acknowledged that if both sides could not hold  another  round of talks, the British side must decide on the electoral  arrangements on its own. The British side's third option is  that both sides admit that there are differences over the  political system, but that they can continue to cooperate with  each other on issues other than the political system and can  reach an agreement which states that each side is going its own  way. He said: Even if China and Britain cannot reach agreement  on political issues, it does not mean that both sides cannot  reach any agreement on other issues, and an agreement which  states that each side goes its own way, is, after all, better  than no agreement. He added: It is always better to confine  both sides' differences to a few political issues rather than  spreading the political impact to other fields.    When talking about the British side's final option, that is,  under a situation where there is no agreement, the Hong Kong  Government unilaterally submits the remainder of the political  reform bill to Legco for discussion, Patten said that it was his  duty to exercise effective rule over Hong Kong and that he  firmly believed that Legco members would not choose to do  something which they deem incorrect merely because the Chinese  side had threatened to cancel arrangements for the political  system. Patten added: The Chinese side has warned that in  1997, they will cancel any arrangements on the political system  with which Beijing does not agree, but different Chinese  officials give different meanings to "cancellation." Patten  said: The Hong Kong Government should not, at present, do  anything to the detriment of the interests of Hong Kong merely  because the Chinese side may do something to the detriment of  the interests of Hong Kong in an uncertain future.    In the interview, Patten also commented on the preliminary  work committee of the preparatory committee of the special  administrative region and analyzed the prospects of Sino-Hong  Kong cooperation and implementing a high degree of autonomy  after 1997. In addition, he also talked about China's  most-favored-nation status, Hong Kong's economic prospects, the  financial reserves, the overheated real estate market, and other  issues.</p>

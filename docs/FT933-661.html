			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan Yesterday's statement from Grand Metropolitan at least showed the market was wrong in worrying about a Guinness-style disappointment on the trading front. But there is a bitter-sweet message in the accompanying disclosure that the group is to take a Pounds 175m charge for restructuring. The positive aspect is that it is getting to grips with Green Giant, the vegetable business acquired as part of the Pillsbury deal. GrandMet also appears to be dressing up Pearle for sale. That will help ease gearing pressure when it eventually happens. But the provisions will eat into cash flow meanwhile. Nor does it help that the company has given no details of how it will use Pounds 50m of yesterday's charge. Perhaps it must slim down other businesses before they can be sold at a reasonable price. Some reorganisation spend was inevitable to shield Green Giant from the effects of vegetable price fluctuations. GrandMet's slowness in grasping the commodity nature of this business will hardly have counted in favour of Mr Ian Martin, who was responsible for the Pillsbury acquisition but lost the contest for the chief executive's job. Separating the two announcements by just a weekend does little to dispel the idea that they were in some way connected.</p>

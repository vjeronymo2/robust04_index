			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOYALTON;  </P> <P> BREATHALYZER'S REMOVAL PROTESTED  </P> <P> The state has removed the Breathalyzer from the Sierra County Sheriff's  Department substation in Loyalton, meaning that deputies must now make a  60-mile drive to Downieville to give a breath test to a suspected drunk driver.  The Sierra County Board of Supervisors and the Deputy Sheriff's Assn. complain  that the drive of at least an hour over the 6,700-foot Yuba Pass decreases the  presence of law enforcement, dramatically increases court costs and gives the  suspect time to sober up.  </P></p>

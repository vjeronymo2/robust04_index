			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Iraq spurns 'colonial' UN conditions for sale of oil IRAQ said yesterday it would never accept United Nations resolutions imposing 'colonial' conditions on its sale of oil, agencies report. 'Iraq's position towards Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 is fixed and will never change,' the Foreign Ministry told the Iraqi News Agency. Iraqi and UN experts are to meet in Vienna on Wednesday to discuss possible export of Iraqi oil, still banned by a Gulf war trade embargo. The UN offered last year to let Iraq sell oil worth Dollars 1.6bn, under terms which would deny Baghdad control of the income and allocate part of it for war reparations. Baghdad rejects the conditions set out in the resolution for the sale of its oil, saying that strict UN monitoring of the transactions and the presence of UN and foreign oil company supervisors were an insult to Iraqi sovereignty. US and British diplomats on the council have said they are prepared to be flexible about many of the resolutions' terms but that basic guidelines, including UN monitoring of sales and proceeds, could not be altered. While Baghdad is suffering from the embargo, the UN also needs money derived from oil sales to pay for relief supplies it distributes in Iraq as well as for the commission destroying or removing Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic weapons. UN sources say the following issues are expected to be raised. Some will need formal or informal approval from the Security Council or its sanctions committee. Pipeline: Iraq has indicated it wants to sell oil to pre-war Asian clients, mainly Japan, through its Mina al-Bakr oil terminal. A secretary general's report accepted by the council said the oil should run through the northern pipeline to Turkey, the only one operating at the end of the war. Security Council sources said there would be no objections to Mina al-Bakr, but only if proper monitoring were possible. Contracts: Iraq wants guarantees that it would be able to make long-term contracts, which would enable its state oil company to establish itself again in international markets. Council sources said this was a possibility. Monitoring: Baghdad wants 'transparency' in all financial transactions so that it can see where the proceeds are going and how humanitarian goods are bought and delivered. Under the resolutions, Iraq markets the oil but the UN has to approve all contracts, open an escrow account and then supervise Iraqi purchases and distribution of food and other supplies. The monitoring of oil sales is to be done by officials from Norway's state oil company. It is expected the council would be flexible on this demand if UN officials work out the technicalities.</p>

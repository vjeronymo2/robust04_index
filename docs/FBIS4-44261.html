			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- A maritime agreement has been  concluded between Cuba and Germany, which replaces a treaty  between the former GDR and the Caribbean island. As the  Transportation Ministry in Bonn announced on Wednesday [22 June]  after negotiations with Havanna were concluded, the new  agreement regulates, among other things, the freedom of  establishment and the free transfer of cargo for maritime  shipping. An important part of the agreement is the fact that  ships of the partners to the agreement are treated like the  respective country's own ships regarding access to ports and the  use of services. In addition, the freedom of establishment is  ensured for shiping companies.</p>

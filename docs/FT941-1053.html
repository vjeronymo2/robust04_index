			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / 'Traditions' that mean nothing: As They Say in Europe A writer in the Spectator magazine the other day told of what happened when he entertained Enoch Powell, the former Conservative cabinet minister, at a meeting of a local Tory party association. (Readers outside Britain should know that Powell used to be a Tory but fell out with them and went on to represent the Ulster Unionists in parliament. He is renowned for his penetrating intellect.) To quote the article: 'Each time Mr Powell made a remark critical of the government, he was applauded incontinently. When a man stood up to announce he would be standing as an anti-federalist, against a Tory candidate, in June's Euro-elections, the ovation from his fellow Conservatives verged on the hysterical. There are pockets of Toryism flourishing and vibrant in Britain today. Sadly for Mr Major (the Prime Minister), they are unrelated to the government.' The writer added: 'Given the attitude of those who run the party now, I had better not say which Conservative association played host.' This is understandable: faced with the prospect of a confrontation with that Himmler of the Tory party, chairman Sir Norman Fowler, the most vibrant right-wing blood runs cold. Fortunately, I have uncovered details of the meeting. It was held just outside Ewell, Surrey, in the function room of Ye Olde Cocke House Inne, which stands between the Wok-on-By Chinese restaurant and a kitchenware shop called Hote Cuisine. There was a delicious meal (breaded scampi on a bed of lettuce 'garnished with all the trimming's'). The debate on the European Union was followed by a heated discussion led by Powell on another subject dear to his heart: the menace of coloured immigration. It included his famous expose of how Shakespeare's works had been written by a group of Elizabethan courtiers. I have spent much time burrowing through Europe's newspapers to see if lesser nations can produce anything to match this very English occasion. But their acceptance of the integration of Europe, and the suffocation of their own traditions, remains remarkable, partly because they do not believe that is what is occurring. Instead, they share a belief in a need for an authority to make rules to create that 'level playing field' so beloved of British politicians and which can make a single market work. That those employed in that authority are sometimes incompetent, corrupt, arrogant and stupid in no way distinguishes them from officials in the various national capitals. There is also a belief that the process of enlargement makes the system harder to operate, and a conclusion that the present British attempt to lower the proportion of votes needed for a veto is meant to ensure no decisions are taken at all. But, even then, there is not that moral outrage which characterises the British debate. There is certainly no equivalent of the Eurosceptic fury over the destruction wrought on a thousand years of constitutional perfection. Perhaps it is because these nations enjoy no such tradition. No chaps in tights opening their parliaments. No national leaders giving clear answers during the remorseless probing of prime minister's question time. There is no hysterical concern with the sexual incontinence of gentlemen in leading positions, either. Britain, the land that was once known for its phlegm and sang-froid is now in the grip of inexplicable obsessions. And those UK newspapers which make most of the trifling peccadillos of public figures are also those in which Europhobia is most pronounced. I must thank Fernando Vallespin, a writer in El Pais of Madrid, for explaining why. He was struck by the difference in attitudes towards sexual misdeeds in Britain and the US, on the one hand, and Brazil and Austria, on the other. (The president of the former behaved in an unseemly manner during the carnival in Rio; the activities of Austria's president were documented here last month.) There is, says Vallespin, 'a connection which almost always exists between repressive societies and liberal states'. Economic liberalism, he argues, is connected with capitalism in such a way that it pre-supposes the promotion of self-interest. As a result, a liberal state has to impose artificial rules to replace the glue that exists in traditional systems. There rules are broken easily without society falling to bits. Britain is no more a traditional society than Ye Olde Cocke House is a traditional inn. Its rules bind private and public morality in a seamless, brittle whole. So it is, I deduce, that European integration generates moral explosions in Britain: European integration is penetration by Europe. As Vallespin noted: 'One must not forget that Adam Smith was as much a moral philosopher as an economist.' James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

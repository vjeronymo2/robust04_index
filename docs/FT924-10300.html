			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: Aetna strongly ahead despite hurricane impact AETNA LIFE &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurers, yesterday reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 239m, up from Dollars 115m in the same period of last year, despite higher catastrophe losses from Hurricane Andrew. The income figures, which worked through at Dollars 2.17 a share, compared with Dollars 1.06 a share in the same period of last year, included the earnings of American Re-Insurance which Aetna sold for Dollars 1.4bn to the leveraged buy-out firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, at the end of September. Stripping out the Dollars 34m of income from American Re and Dollars 78m of profits from its sale, Aetna made Dollars 127m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, from continuing operations, compared with Dollars 72m, or 67 cents a share, a year ago. The results included Dollars 58m, or 52 cents of net realised capital gains, compared with losses of Dollars 45m, or 40 cents a share, a year ago. This quarter's gains included losses from additional property reserves of Dollars 52m, down from Dollars 72m a year ago. The group's commercial property and casualty insurance services earned just Dollars 4m, down from Dollars 32, as catastrophe losses rose to Dollars 29m, up from Dollars 6m, mainly because of Hurricane Andrew, which devastated Florida during the summer. For the nine months Aetna reported total net income of Dollars 426m, up from Dollars 412m.</p>

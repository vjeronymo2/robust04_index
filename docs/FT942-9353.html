			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Greek rates soar on devaluation fears Greek interest rates soared to record levels yesterday amid speculation the government may be forced to devalue the drachma, following its surprise decision to free short-term capital movement. To avoid renewed pressure on the currency, the central bank raised the overnight borrowing rate from 30 to 33 per cent and imposed a surcharge of 0.4 per cent daily - equivalent to an annual rate of 186 per cent. The three-month interbank lending rate shot up to 48.5 per cent from 25 per cent on Friday. The rise in rates seemed to be having the desired effect, with the drachma closing yesterday at 148.2 against the D-Mark compared to 147.70 on Friday and at 247.9 against the US dollar compared to 247.1. Dealers said the surge in interest rates, which saw the one-month interbank rate touch 70 per cent, reduced pressure on the drachma early in the day and the central bank was not forced to intervene. Last week, the Bank of Greece spent some Dollars 1bn of foreign exchange reserves totalling around Dollars 9.5bn to support the currency. However, analysts said pressure would quickly resume as such high interest rates could not be sustained for long, reviving fears of a devaluation. On the other hand, the government would be reluctant to resort to devaluing the drachma ahead of next month's European parliament elections. A devaluation would most likely lose the Socialists several percentage points in their first electoral test since taking office last October. Instead, the central bank may have to abandon its 'hard drachma' policy, intended to restrict depreciation this year to around 7 per cent, and let the currency slide more rapidly. 'We should expect increased depreciation, perhaps an extra 3 and 5 per cent, over the next couple of weeks,' said Mr Spiros Damaskos of Sigma Money Brokers. The government lifted all restrictions on short-term capital movement at the weekend, six weeks ahead of schedule, in an attempt to ease mounting pressure on the drachma. Central bank officials said overnight interest rates (including the surcharge) would go 'into four figures if necessary' in order to protect the currency. The Bank of Greece is in the uncomfortable position of having to defend the drachma on its own, as Greece has never joined the European Union's exchange rate mechanism, which would allow it to call on other EU central banks for support. The government is relying on today's issues of Ecu- and dollar-linked bond issues at higher interest rates to preventing a heavy outflow of capital and boost foreign exchange reserves. Dealers said the dollar issue attracted more than Dollars 100m from institutional investors yesterday, ahead of the launch.</p>

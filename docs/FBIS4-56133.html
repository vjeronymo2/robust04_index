			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today  approved legal measures aimed at transferring state-owned real  estate to the ownership of the Federation of Jewish Communities  and Jewish Religious Communities, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  told journalists after a cabinet meeting.    Individual ministries ought to submit their proposals for  specific transfers to the Finance Ministry for definitive  approval by June 15, Klaus said. The State Jewish Museum makes  an exclusion since in its case, given the complicated nature of  the transfer, a proposal should be submitted only in September,  he added.    Klaus confirmed that all the transfers would be implemented  in the form of a gift-given agreement according to the Civil  Code.</p>

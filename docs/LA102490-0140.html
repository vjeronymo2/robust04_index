			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HALF A MILLION POLES BACK WALESA CANDIDACY  </P> <P> Solidarity leader Lech Walesa upstaged his presidential rival Tadeusz  Mazowiecki on Tuesday by presenting half a million signatures backing his  candidacy for next month's Polish elections.  </P> <P> Walesa's campaign chief said he presented the national election commission in  Warsaw with sacks of signatures -- at least 500,000 names and five times the  number required to register as a candidate. Prime Minister Mazowiecki  registered last Wednesday with about 140,000 signatures.  </P> <P> The number has only symbolic importance, but Walesa deliberately waited a week  longer to register in order to upstage his rival.  </P></p>

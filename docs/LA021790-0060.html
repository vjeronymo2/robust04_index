			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME ANTI-SEMITISM TAKEN OUT OF PASSION PLAY  </P> <P> Jewish high priests will no longer have horns, Judas will be a confused rather  than a coldly mercenary figure and the temple merchants will no longer be among  Jesus' persecutors in the 1990 Oberammergau Passion Play.  </P> <P> But the half-million people who descend on the small German town in the  Bavarian Alps for the account of Jesus' final days will still hear the passage  from Matthew that has plagued Jews for 19 centuries: "His blood be on us and  our children."  </P> <P> American Jewish leaders who have been meeting with village officials since 1985  to eliminate what they consider anti-Semitic images from the play applauded the  changes but said they do not go far enough.  </P> <P> "The retention of the 'blood curse' is very problematic," said Rabbi James  Rudin, director of interreligious affairs for the American Jewish Committee in  New York. "My dream was, my hope was, there would be a new play."  </P> <P> But one of the play's directors said the revisions, plus three votes and long  discussions within the village about whether to keep the passage from Matthew  27:25 show that Oberammergau is sensitive to Jewish concerns.  </P> <P> "With all the changes, I think that anti-Semitism is not the problem of the  play in 1990," Otto Huber said in a telephone interview this week from his home  in Oberammergau.  </P> <P> The Passion Play dates to 1663, when bubonic plague ravaged the mountain valley  where Oberammergau sits. When the Roman Catholic villagers vowed to stage a  passion play every 10 years if the plague abated, the epidemic vanished in what  was considered a miracle, according to historical accounts.  </P> <P> The play was last performed in 1984, when a special jubilee production  attracted 470,000 spectators. Americans accounted for about 45% of the visitors  to the daylong production.  </P> <P> Since then, leaders of the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation  League of B'nai B'rith have sought to change aspects of the play they believed  maligned Jews and blamed them for the Crucifixion.  </P> <P> The idea that Jewish people have collective guilt for Jesus' death has been  devastating in its impact on Jews throughout the centuries, Rudin said.  </P> <P> The play will be performed this year from May 21 to Sept. 28.  </P> <P> Among the changes:  </P> <P> * Jesus' identity as a Jew is emphasized, including having him and his  followers wear traditional prayer shawls. "We have tried to show Jesus really  as a Jew coming out from Jewish tradition and Jewish faith," Huber said.  </P> <P> * Jesus has a larger popular following among Jews, and there is no longer a  separation of Jesus and his followers and the rest of the Jewish community in  light and dark clothing. "You had the good guys and the bad guys in the 1984  text," Rudin said.  </P> <P> * There is no longer any connection between the temple merchants and Jesus'  persecutors. Rudin said that connection was "one of the worst stereotypes of  the play," playing on anti-Semitic images such as "Shylock."  </P> <P> * The Jewish high priests who presided at the trial that led to the  condemnation of Jesus will no longer have horns, an image carried over from the  Middle Ages.  </P> <P> * Pontius Pilate, who prior to 1984 was portrayed a noble Roman and in 1984 was  shown as ambivalent in sentencing Jesus to death, is presented in the 1990 text  as an unsympathetic, brutal character.  </P> <P> * Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, is portrayed as a confused  character who lost faith in Jesus, rather than as a man motivated only by the  30 pieces of silver he received for giving up Jesus.  </P> <P> Huber said the changes show that Oberammergau is "very conscious about all the  questions of anti-Semitism."  </P> <P> He noted that the passage from Matthew was barely approved by a 11-9 vote of  the text committee, and only with the provision that a five-page explanation  saying it does not apply to one race and outlining the history of anti-Semitism  surrounding it be included in scripts that tourists purchase to follow the  German-language play.  </P> <P> While it may be difficult to find someone to write a new play, Huber said, he  favors continuing discussions for the production in 2000.  </P></p>

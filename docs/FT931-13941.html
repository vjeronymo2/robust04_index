			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Brittan blitz on Gatt talks SIR Leon Brittan, European Community trade commissioner, plans a blitz of top-level meetings next week aimed at achieving a rapid end to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Plans to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, his newly-appointed US counterpart, in Washington have yet to be confirmed. He will meet Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), tentatively next Wednesday, and other leaders concerned with the Uruguay Round at the following weekend's Davos summit. The initiative coincides with calls to the incoming US administration, whose views on the Uruguay Round and wider trade policy remain unclear, to make a final push to complete the six-year-old talks before the negotiating mandate granted by Congress expires in March. Mr Dunkel said yesterday after a stock-taking meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) which oversees the 112-nation liberalisation talks: 'We are critically short of time. We must conclude now or risk drifting into the sands.' Sir Leon, who assumed responsibility for EC trade policy three weeks ago, has moved swiftly to press for a rapid end to the talks. After a meeting outside London on January 2 (a day after assuming office) with Mrs Carla Hills, outgoing US trade representative, he agreed with the US to focus negotiations on tariff cuts on manufactured goods. 'We have not reached agreement,' he commented this week. 'But we have not wasted our time. We have injected new urgency into the process and have prepared the ground for a successful conclusion.' He clearly hopes the meetings next week will provide fresh momentum at a time when success or failure almost certainly depends on the priority given to the Uruguay Round talks by President Clinton. At present, Mr Clinton's trade priorities are unclear. Mr Kantor, who spends his first day today as US trade representative, gave mixed signals on likely policy priorities when he appeared before the Senate finance committee for his nomination hearing. His deputies have not yet been named, but the people chosen will provide important signals on how policy will be shaped. 'We see no sign that suggests we should be worried there will be any increase in US protectionism, and remain totally open to building up contacts with the new administration,' a spokesman for Sir Leon said yesterday. He refused to comment directly on remarks by Mr Kantor at his nomination hearing indicating 'deep concern' over aspects of November's US-EC agreement to reduce farm subsidies.</p>

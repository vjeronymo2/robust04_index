			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Output fall casts doubt on momentum of US recovery THE US Federal Reserve yesterday reported a 0.5 per cent decline in industrial production last month, raising fresh doubts about the momentum of the US recovery, Michael Prowse reports from Washington. The drop in production - the biggest since January - was announced as the International Monetary Fund forecast a moderate US recovery next year and urged swingeing cuts in the federal budget deficit. The IMF predicted growth of 2 per cent this year, rising to 3 per cent next year. It based its optimism on recent falls in short-term interest rates to 20-year lows and on a strengthening of private sector finances as debts are repaid and the maturity of loans extended. However, Mr Michael Mussa, the IMF's chief economist, said there were few precedents for the financial strains faced by the US and other countries as a result of weak asset prices and the debt build-up of the 1980s. The fund had been surprised by the abnormally slow pace of the recovery: growth had been 'less than half the pace of the slowest previous recovery' since World War Two. Officials said subdued US business and consumer confidence partly reflected failure to address severe budgetary problems. The IMF indicated the US should cut the federal deficit by the equivalent of four to five percentage points of gross domestic product over the next five years. This would require a combination of spending cuts, including restraints on entitlement programmes such as health care and pensions, and tax increases. Appropriate tax measures could include the introduction of a 5 per cent value-added tax and a modest levy on carbon emissions. Together, these could raise revenues equivalent to 1 per cent of GDP by 1997. The Fed said US production had been affected by Hurricane Andrew, which accounted for 0.1 per cent of the decline last month, and by a strike at General Motors, the car company. However, even allowing for special factors, the report was bleak: nearly every industrial sector registered declines in output - some were considerable. Manufacturing production fell 0.3 per cent and the capacity utlisation rate in industry fell a sharp 0.5 percentage points to 78.5 per cent. The drop in production follows recent reports of falls in retail sales, employment, industrial orders and consumer confidence.</p>

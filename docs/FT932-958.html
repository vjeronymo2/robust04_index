			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Loss expected at Philips offshoot PHILIPS Kommunikations Industrie, a German subsidiary of the diversified Dutch electrical group, expects a loss of DM100m (Dollars 60.20m) in the first six months of this year following a 20 per cent drop in sales. The Nuremberg-based company, which last week announced plans to cut 1,500 jobs this year, had earlier reported a 23 per cent fall in turnover during the first quarter, and a 36 per cent slump in incoming orders. PKI said yesterday it planned a quick change of course to concentrate its efforts on four core sectors: public and private communications systems, and radio and mobile radio businesses. The company, which incorporates the Grundig home entertainment and electronics business, is negotiating to sell its cable activities to NKF Holding of Delft. The job cuts and sales of activities will leave PKI with a total workforce of 3,400, compared with 6,300 at the end of April. The company last year made a net DM82m on sales of DM2.3bn.</p>

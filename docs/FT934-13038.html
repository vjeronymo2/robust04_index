			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Food argument absurd Sir, The contention by Mr Luc Guyau, leader of FNSEA, the French farmers' union, that the third world needs French food is absurd (World Trade News, October 19). The main effect of subsidised food exports by OECD countries is to depress world prices on free markets, since OECD food consumption is too low to absorb extra production generated by subsidies. This deprives farmers in poor countries of a share of revenues they would otherwise get if there were no subsidies, in turn producingurban exodus, food riots, lower growth and demand for OECD industrial products.

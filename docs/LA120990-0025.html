			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART WORLD: SOVIET ARTIST SURFACES AT USC GALLERY  </P> <P> FACES  </P> <P> "In art you need some tragedy. Where would we be without that?" asks  Leningrad-based painter Gleb Bogomolov, referring to a 40-year period in which,  he says, the development of Russian art was "completely cut off."  </P> <P> Bogomolov should know about that tragedy in Russian art; he has long been  recognized as a leader of the Soviet Union's underground art scene. But  Bogomolov was one of the lucky ones. He has been able to make an underground  living through his work, which he has been selling to foreign diplomats and  collectors for more than 10 years -- long before Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms.  </P> <P> Now, he is included in "Keepers of the Flame: Unofficial Artists of Leningrad"  at USC's Fisher Gallery through Jan. 19. In addition, he has his first Los  Angeles solo show at George Mayers Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard through Dec.  18.  </P> <P> "My condition has not changed, except that now I can go abroad, I can travel  with my works," says the artist, who is currently on his first visit to Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Although his English is excellent, the 57-year-old artist with the ready grin  insists on using an interpreter so that the "subtle nuances" of his  conversation will be understood. Frequently, however, he finds himself helping  out the interpreter with those very nuances.  </P> <P> In the past two years, since being officially "recognized" by the Soviet  government, Bogomolov has shown at several prestigious Soviet institutions,  among them the Russian Museum, Far East Museum, Museum of Leningrad and  Moscow's Museum of Modern Art. He has also shown in Norway and Sweden, and is  currently featured in the large-scale exhibition "The Quest for  Self-Expression: Painting in Moscow and Leningrad, 1965-1990" at Ohio's  Columbus Museum of Art. But times were not always so easy for the artist, who  left his state job as an engineer 13 years ago to devote himself to life as an  underground artist.  </P> <P> "I wanted to do something contrary to society," Bogomolov remembers. "Before  perestroika, we were to be a (slave) to what we were told. But I was always  doing what I wanted to do. I was supposed to work officially, but I didn't want  to do it, even though they could imprison me for having no official job.  </P> <P> "It was very difficult trying to be an artist. They tried to stop my work,"  continues Bogomolov, who had no formal art training, but began making art while  still a child.  </P> <P> "I was always striving for avant-garde work," he says. Bogomolov did not become  an "official artist," he says, because he did not want to always paint what he  was told to, or paint in the official style of Socialist Realism.  </P> <P> He notes, however, that because his work relies heavily on old Russian icons,  he may be seen more as following old traditions that new ones.  </P> <P> "I think that the avant-garde often leans on old traditions," he says. "I  always turn to the tradition of icon painting because I think our modern times  and ancient culture are very connected to each other. We have the literal  result now of what was happening in ancient times."  </P> <P> In his mixed-media paintings, Bogomolov often depicts "only vague remains of  something that is not understood" thus causing the viewer to "guess" the  piece's meaning. Such is the case with "Shrine," a work included in the USC  show, which features only one clear element, a hand of playing cards  representing "absolute mockery and a challenge that takes away from old history  and culture."  </P> <P> "I think (works like this) are a consequence of my experiences of spiritual  tragedy," Bogomolov says of the suffering he underwent as an "unofficial"  artist in the Soviet Union before Gorbachev's reforms.  </P> <P> CURRENTS  </P> <P> Photographers + Friends United Against AIDS, which mounted "The Indomitable  Spirit" traveling exhibition seen at the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery earlier  this year, has donated $350,000 to the American Foundation for AIDS Research.  To date, the organization has raised nearly $1.2 million through the  exhibition, catalogues and a connected portfolio. A second limited-edition  portfolio featuring works by artists including Andres Serrano, David McDermott  and Peter McGough is planned for release in 1991.  </P> <P> HAPPENING  </P> <P> Artists including Leo Limon, Dolores Guerrero-Cruz, Ricardo Duffy and Michael  Amescua will participate in Self-Help Graphics third annual Christmas Arts and  Crafts Sale, to be held at the East L.A. gallery today from 2-6 p.m. Works will  be priced from $5-$100.

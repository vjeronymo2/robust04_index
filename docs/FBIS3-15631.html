As previously reported, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper on  Wednesday [2 March] published an article about armaments used by  the Lithuanian field army. The report was based on information  provided by MP Kestutis Gaska, who is a member of the committee  and recently left the parliamentary faction of the ruling  Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP].    In the opinion of some other committee members, the  information published by the newspaper is a state secret.    Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the committee, told the  LIETUVOS AIDAS newspaper that he would not provide any such  information to the press and described Gaska as an "emotional"  lawmaker with a "great imagination." The committee chairman, who  is a member of the ruling LDDP faction, said "you cannot put  handcuffs on him and you cannot stop him from talking."    But in Petkevicius' opinion, Gaska's critical remarks about  the quality of the army equipment donated by some foreign  countries are correct.    LIETUVOS RYTAS, referring to Gaska's words, said the 30  jeeps  that were donated by the French government are meant for a  tropical climate and can be used in Lithuania only 3 or 4 months  a year.    On Thursday, the French embassy in Vilnius circulated a  press  release saying that "it would be a pity if polemics based on  erroneous information would cast a shadow on military  cooperation between France and Lithuania."    The embassy said the jeeps were still used by the French  army  only four years ago and denied that they are meant only for hot  climatic conditions.    Petkevicius said he personally attended the ceremony during  which the jeeps were handed over to Lithuania and it "would have  been impolite not to accept them." He noted, however, that the  jeeps were made in 1942, they use 27 liters of gasoline per 100  kilometers and can only "be sold to a museum of antiques."    Petkevicius is also very skeptical about the automatic  rifles  from Israel which are suitable "not to shoot but to sow  bullets." LIETUVOS AIDAS quotes the lawmaker as saying that  donated batteries for communication equipment are also old and  should have been "buried in the ground" back were they came from.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Sanctions on North Korea and Economic Stability </F> in the ROK"]    [Text] With international economic sanctions on North  Korea drawing near, a sense of tension has been heightened in  many domains.    Under a policy that economic sanctions led by the United  States are an inevitable choice for blocking the North Korean  nuclear development, the government is carrying out many-fold  diplomatic efforts to seek more effective sanction methods, and  has strengthened the alert posture of the entire Armed Forces,  thus assuming the emergency work system. Under this situation,  President Kim Yong-sam, now visiting Russia, held a news  conference on the spot and stated that "both the ROK and the  United States not only grasped the North Korean movement 100  percent but also retained sufficient capabilities to cope with  the an emergency. Therefore, the people may feel easy about a  series of changes in the situation."    Since the situation at home and abroad surrounding the North  Korean nuclear problem has been strained rapidly, people from  all walks of life at home, who used to be insensitive to  security, began to gradually realize the seriousness of the  situation. With the increased number of stocks put on sale by  foreign investors at domestic stock markets, indications show  that the cold wind has begun to blow surrounding the North  Korean nuclear issue. Reports also point out that business  firms which have been pushing ahead with economic cooperation  with North Korea in the past are taking pains to work out proper  measures to cope with economic sanctions against North Korea  when they actually take place. In particular, for some large  business groups that have processing-on-commission [imgagong]  plants in North Korea and have brought considerable quantities  of North Korean materials to the ROK, sanctions on North Korea  mean the overall discontinuation of North-South economic  exchanges. Thus, it is urgent for them to work out appropriate  measures to minimize the business deadlock anticipated after  sanctions are imposed.    What we must keep in mind regarding sanctions against North  Korea, to be pushed for as part of international efforts to  block North Korea's nuclear development, is that our economy  must not be left wavering. The method and time of sanctions on  North Korea have not been concretely decided. However, even if  details of sanctions are announced, the direct impact of such  sanctions to our economy would be insignificant and may even be  ignored. North-South economic exchanges pushed ahead by some  business firms still remain in such an extent as to operate  merely a certain number of processing-on-commission plants in  North Korea and to bring in a certain quantity of North Korean  materials. Moreover, these materials are merely plain consumer  goods. The amount of their transactions was $4.38 million last  year, and $4.63 as of the end of April this year. Compared to  the scale of our imports amounting to $100 billion a year, this  amount is, in a word, indeed negligible.    This being the case, what we should be on the watch for is  psychological uneasiness about sanctions against North Korea and  negative economic effects. In other words, our business firms  and enterprises should not tuck themselves up in uneasiness  without any grounds, and should not cause any economic unrest.  In view of this, the government should inform economic  organizations and business firms rapidly and correctly of  changes in the situation at home and abroad lest they fall into  a sense of uneasiness. In addition, the government should  realize that the building of an economic cooperative system  based on the understanding between business firms and the people  is as important a task as ensuring the military security posture.</p>

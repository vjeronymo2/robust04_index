			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> RISKY FAMILY BUSINESS BEATS LIFE AS LANDLUBBER;  </P> <P> YOUNG MAN AND THE SEA: A STRONG LURE  </P> <P> His father was a commercial fisherman. So was his father's father. It follows,  then, that Randy Babich was expected to become . . . a dentist?  </P> <P> "Every fisherman tried to coax his son into something other than fishing. They  thought a steady job on land, with a steady paycheck, was less risky," Babich  said recently, sitting on the family dock and thinking how lucky he was to have  rejected that advice.  </P> <P> Like his forebears, Randy Babich has chosen the sea. In doing so, he helps to  preserve a maritime heritage that has distinguished Washington's development  since the first white settlers arrived.  </P> <P> Sea traders plied the coast starting in the 1700s, looking for furs. Even after  the railroad arrived in 1883, most settlers who rode the rails westward passed  up Washington's arid eastern plains, preferring tidewater towns such as Seattle  and Tacoma.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protected Coastline  </P> <P> Unlike much of the Pacific coast, where great ocean swells pounded the shore,  Washington's island-studded Puget Sound offered miles of protected coastline.  Salmon and other fish were abundant, and the waterways became highways for  ships hauling timber cut from tall forests.  </P> <P> Randy's grandfather, Spiro Babich, came from Yugoslavia in 1910, about 40 years  after the first whites settled in Gig Harbor. Two of the town's founders were  Yugoslav fishermen, and they started a Slavic connection still obvious in the  local phone book, where Jerisich, Markovich and Stanich are well represented.  </P> <P> Spiro Babich was a typical immigrant: He had no money and spoke no English, but  he learned fast. He soon had his own boat and used it to pursue salmon  zealously. It is said that he used to pray for bad weather so the timid would  go ashore and leave more fish for him. When he died at 67, he was planning to  fish the next summer.  </P> <P> One of his two boats went to son Peter, who fished until retiring last year at  65. "Talk about a duck out of water," Randy Babich said of his father. "He's  going to be leasing a boat for the fall, just so he can go out and fish once a  week."  </P> <P> Randy, 39, with a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, could  have avoided the dangerous fisherman's life. But his exposure to the workaday  world of landlubbers gave him an appreciation of fishing that his grandfather's  generation couldn't match.  </P> <P> "If they knew about commuting to work every day on the freeway, fighting  traffic, they'd have come home and kissed their deck winch," Babich said.  </P> <P> Fishing today is easier in many ways. Whereas his grandfather pulled up heavy,  tarred-cotton nets by hand, Babich uses a power winch to haul nylon nets aboard  the Paragon, his 56-foot seiner.  </P> <P> But hazards remain. The weather is as unpredictable as ever, and Babich, like  most Washington fishermen, now must motor up to the distant waters of Alaska to  make a living. He complains about strict regulations, foreign competition and  outrageous insurance rates.  </P> <P> Lately his son, Stefan, 19, has been helping on the boat. But just to work his  way through school, you understand.  </P> <P> "I encourage him not to follow fishing," Babich said.  </P></p>

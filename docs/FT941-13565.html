			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Menzies pleases City with advance to Pounds 6.3m Mr John Menzies, chairman of the retail and wholesale chain which carries his name, said that the group's interim results continued to show the improving trend of the last few years. In the six months to October 30 pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 6.3m, though Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, group managing director, said they were skewed by Pounds 500,000 of losses last time from the now sold Hammick's retail bookshop chain, and by halved interest charges of Pounds 800,000 this time. The reduced interest costs reflected, he said, the strength of the group and its cashflow as well as the management of working capital. On the profits front, he said he was more encouraged by the 20 per cent increase in operating profits on continuing operations to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 5.9m). The shares rose 30p to 654p on the day. The main engine of growth was the distribution side which, as a high volume, low margin business 'concentrates the mind', according to Mr Noel-Paton. He echoed his chairman in his disappointment over the short shrift the government gave the outcome of the MMC's 18-month inquiry into the distribution of newspapers in England and Wales, but was confident the group would not suffer from the government's intended liberalisation of newspaper wholesaling. TBD (home entertainment and book wholesaling) and Universal Office Supplies both performed well in the period. The retail side showed a similar pattern as previously, with Early Learning Centres 'really performing well' with 'a sales rise in double digits' balancing the John Menzies Retail chain, which is being restructured. ELC has 177 outlets, two of which are superstores, which carry clothing and nursery goods as well as toys and books. Mr Noel-Paton said this new format had 'huge turnover'. JM Retail consists of 276 stores, some 150 of which are to be redesigned away from generalist outlets to multi-specialist shops. Mr Noel-Paton also revealed a 6.5 per cent like-for-like increase in retailing sales over the Christmas period with music sales at the forefront. Group turnover climbed to Pounds 573.1m (Pounds 539.3m) and the interim dividend is lifted to 4.1p (3.8p), payable from earnings per share more than doubled to 5.9p (2.9p).</p>

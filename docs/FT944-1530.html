			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Family tax cost will rise to 35.6% The amount of tax the government takes from the average family is set to rise again next year, further denting the Conservatives credentials as the party of low taxation, David Owen writes. New figures released last night by the Treasury show that a married man on average earnings, with two children, will pay 35.6 per cent of his earnings in direct and indirect taxes in 1995-96  - up from 34.7 per cent in the current financial year. This outstrips the 32.2 per cent that a similar family would have paid in 1978-79, when the Labour party was last in power. When the government acknowledged in January that its 1993-94 tax take would amount to 32.8 per cent of an average family's earnings, the disclosure was immediatedly pounced on by the opposition parties. Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, replying to a written question by Mr Andrew Smith, Labour MP for Oxford East, said that tax increases taking effect over the next year would cost households on average about Pounds 2.30 a week. He added that real personal disposable income was still expected to rise by 1 1/2 per cent next year. 'This should mean that households will on average be about Pounds 5 a week better off after tax and inflation,' he said.</p>

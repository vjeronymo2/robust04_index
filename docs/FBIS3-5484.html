			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa renewed his pledge Tuesday [8 March] to reform Japan's  economic structure which has been criticized by other countries  as impeding fair trade.    "As the coalition government was established, the Japanese  people expected it to break the rigidity of politics and the  economy caused by the long-term rule of the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP)," Hosokawa said at a plenary session of the House of  Councillors.    Hosokawa launched the seven-party coalition last August  after  breaking the LDP's 38-year-long grip on power.    At Monday's plenary session of the more powerful House of  Representatives, the prime minister vowed continued efforts to  make the Japanese economy more open to the rest of the world  even though the initial task of the coalition government to  reform politics is complete.    Hosokawa also expressed hope that the Japanese economy will  see a recovery in fiscal 1994, which begins in April.    Accelerating inventory adjustment in the private sector  offers bright prospects but the economy remains stagnant in  general, he said.    "The government compiled the 15 trillion yen stimulus  package  and incorporated measures into the fiscal 1994 budget to bring  the economy back on track as early as possible in fiscal 1994  and keep up stable growth from fiscal 1995 on," the premier said.    He was responding to questions by Tomio Yamamoto, an LDP  upper house legislator.    Hosokawa tried to allay concern about a possible shortage of  rice, saying the government increased the amount of domestically  grown rice to be sold in March and is taking steps to solve the  shortage.    Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of  rice to make up for the shortage resulting from last year's  worst harvest in the postwar period.    Representatives of political parties started three days of  interpellations Monday on last Friday's policy speeches by  Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Round of strikes hits Belgrade Belgrade was yesterday hit by the biggest wave of industrial unrest in nearly three years of war, despite a government deal with striking miners. Much of the country was blacked out by power cuts after the miners' strike. Rail and municipal transport halted as workers protested for higher wages. And city undertakers, disgruntled with their low wages, also threatened to take to the streets. The monthly inflation rate in December hit 1m per cent, making most wages worthless by the time they are paid. More than 1m workers have been laid off and many factories have shut down. Leaders of the miners from Kolubara basin yesterday reached an agreement with management and government representatives to pay backdated wages, said Tanjug, the Serbian news agency. Strike leaders had also demanded that the government admit it was exporting power to neighbouring states. Tanjug said electricity was due to be restored throughout the country last night. As Serbs rushed to do their last-minute shopping before new year holidays, state shops remained empty but markets were piled high with produce from the countryside and black-market goods, mostly from Hungary. Suckling pigs changed hands for D-Marks, which have virtually replaced the national currency, the dinar. As chaos gripped Kalenic Pijaca - a main open-air market where people queued up to buy newspapers, wine from barrels, or raso, a liquid antidote for hangovers made from pickled cabbage - a local radio journalist appealed to citizens to refrain from shooting their guns - a Serbian new year tradition  -in order to keep their strength for what promised to be a difficult 1994.</p>

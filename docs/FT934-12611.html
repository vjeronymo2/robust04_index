			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Mediation on offer in housing disputes  -Legal Briefs Britain's 1.8m registered housing association tenants are to be offered mediation as an alternative to litigation when in disputes with their landlords. This follows an agreement between the new ombudsman service established by the Housing Corporation, and IDR Europe, a mediation group. The Housing Corporation is a public body set up to distribute government grants to, and to regulate, housing associations in the UK. This is the first time a public body has signed a formal contract to use alternative dispute resolution rather than resorting to the courts. It is a big step forward for the use of alternative dispute resolution in the UK. IDR, with more than 120 trained mediators, will be called in to resolve disputes between landlord and tenant in cases where the ombudsman feels mediation is more suitable than court action.</p>

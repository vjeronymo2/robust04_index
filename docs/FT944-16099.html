			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (9): Buyer beware - check the label / Claire Gooding takes a look at the role of the consumer Consumer power is usually associated with protest and defence, rather then with positive input. The consumer is the person who grumbles when the handle snaps off the vacuum cleaner, who is anxious to contribute to the environment by using eco-friendly products, and who may get killed by badly wired electrical appliances. Consumers who look for help when something goes wrong generally turn to the supplier first, then local consumer organisations. This is only the start of a long chain. Respected retailers pride themselves on thorough testing of goods. The testers themselves have to be tested. That accreditation has to be done to a standard acceptable in other countries, to enable other goods and services to come from other sources. It seems far-removed from the consumer, but this is where Iso, the International Organisation for Standardisation, comes in, its thousands of standards defining product aspects such as dimensions, safety, fit and performance. Its most famous product is Iso 9000, which establishes standards for quality management. 'Consumers need standards to protect them; standards need a consumer input to be practical and useful'. This declaration is part of the campaign associated with World Standards Day, celebrated each year on October 14 by all member countries of Iso and its partners - the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Its theme this year is 'Standards and the consumers: partners for a better world'. Iso is not the first name that would occur to an aggrieved consumer, but it will be somewhere at the end of the chain. It has a long history of producing voluntary, consensus-based standards, which feed into the design process at one end of the cycle, and into testing and accreditation processes at the other. Most countries have a national structure through which international standards are filtered. In Britain, the Consumer Protection Act requires that any specific safety standards are applied to a product. It is an offence to sell goods that do not comply either with specific safety regulations or with general safety requirements. Enforcement of the act falls to the 120 or so local authorities. 'The role of local authorities is to make sure that no one is selling anything unsafe,' explains Mr Gordon Powell, assistant director of consumer protection at Westminster City Council. 'Consumers themselves might not be aware of the specific technical standards behind that duty: you'd have to be a technologist or scientist to understand the technical requirements. 'The real issue is that these safeguards should be built in at manufacture.' It is in manufacture that international standards are most influential. Such standards are voluntary, but they influence every stage of the production and retail process that eventually brings goods into homes. The process of standardisation is also spreading to services and affects international issues such as environment and the economic development of non-industrialised countries. For most people, it is the safety aspect of consumer-based standards that springs to mind first. The danger of fumes from foam-filled furniture, and of clothing made of cotton that has not been fireproofed, have made headlines. The problems have been duly scrutinised and researched by Iso and voluntary standards exist in these and many other areas. Technical standards affect consumers in other, less visible, ways. The range stretches far beyond household goods and technical appliances to include medical instruments, plastics, telecommunications, transport, computers and sports equipment. It is thanks to international standards that a Russian smart card - incidentally, for smarter than most European credit cards - exactly fits the appropriate slots in western wallets. The standard-makers presently face challenges in the fields of information technology (IT) in general, multimedia, and the 'information highway' which allows people around the world to dip into databases. This is underlined by the fact that the World Standards Day message was signed by Mr John Hinds, president of Iso, Dr Hans Gissel, president of the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) and Pekka Tarjanne, secretary-general of the ITU. However, Iso's vice-president for technical management, Mr John Kean - who also heads the Canadian Standards Association - acknowledges that it is not easy to get the consumer's voice heard in the standards process, which tends to act through national bodies. 'We have-to address this issue in the future. The true consumer voice has to be heard and acknowledged. It's all the more true as we deal with standards for services as opposed to standards for products.' He cites as an example the difficulty of agreeing on an international standard for hotel rating - important to some developing countries that rely on tourism, but whose base of experienced travellers might be limited inside the country itself. 'If we can get people into the debate, to agree within regions, within countries, and get input from regulatory authorities, then what comes out will be more meaningful than if we don't have their voice. 'But the more we do this, the more complex it becomes, because there are so many issues to tackle: the environment is just one example.'</p>

The technique which uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this is called Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Phase-Polar Analysis: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This is the use of polarized light in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phase contrast microscope. It is used to see the same size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers that are visible in air filter analysis. Although fibers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finer than 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> m are visible, analysis of these is inferred from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of larger bundles that are usually present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Phase-Polar Microscope: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The phase-polar microscope is a phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrast microscope which has an analyzer, a polarizer, a first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order red plate and a rotating phase condenser all in place so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the polarized light image is enhanced by phase contrast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Sealing Encapsulant: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This is a product which can be applied,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferably by spraying, onto an asbestos surface which will seal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the surface so that fibers cannot be released.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Serpentine: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A mineral family consisting of minerals with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general composition Mg <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (Si <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (OH) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  having the magnesium in brucite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> layer over a silicate layer. Minerals important in asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis included in this family are chrysotile, lizardite,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antigorite.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 1.1. History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Light microscopy has been used for well over 100 years for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of mineral species. This analysis is carried out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using specialized polarizing microscopes as well as bright field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microscopes. The identification of minerals is an on-going  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process with many new minerals described each year. The first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recorded use of asbestos was in Finland about 2500 B.C. where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material was used in the mud wattle for the wooden huts the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people lived in as well as strengthening for pottery. Adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health aspects of the mineral were noted nearly 2000 years ago  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when Pliny the Younger wrote about the poor health of slaves in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the asbestos mines. Although known to be injurious for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> centuries, the first modern references to its toxicity were by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the British Labor Inspectorate when it banned asbestos dust from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the workplace in 1898. Asbestosis cases were described in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> literature after the turn of the century. Cancer was first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspected in the mid 1930's and a causal link to mesothelioma was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made in 1965. Because of the public concern for worker and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public safety with the use of this material, several different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of analysis were applied to the determination of asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content. Light microscopy requires a great deal of experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and craft. Attempts were made to apply less subjective methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the analysis. X-ray diffraction was partially successful in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the mineral types but was unable to separate out the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibrous portions from the non-fibrous portions. Also, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum detection limit for asbestos analysis by X-ray  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diffraction (XRD) is about 1%. Differential Thermal Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (DTA) was no more successful. These provide useful corroborating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information when the presence of asbestos has been shown by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microscopy; however, neither can determine the difference between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibrous and non-fibrous minerals when both habits are present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same is true of Infrared Absorption (IR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When electron microscopy was applied to asbestos analysis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundreds of fibers were discovered present too small to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible in any light microscope. There are two different types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of electron microscope used for asbestos analysis: Scanning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (TEM). Scanning Electron Microscopy is useful in identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minerals. The SEM can provide two of the three pieces of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information required to identify fibers by electron microscopy:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> morphology and chemistry. The third is structure as determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by Selected Area Electron Diffraction_SAED which is performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the TEM. Although the resolution of the SEM is sufficient for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very fine fibers to be seen, accuracy of chemical analysis that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be performed on the fibers varies with fiber diameter in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers of less than 0.2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> m diameter. The TEM is a powerful tool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to identify fibers too small to be resolved by light microscopy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and should be used in conjunction with this method when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. The TEM can provide all three pieces of information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required for fiber identification. Most fibers thicker than 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> m  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can adequately be defined in the light microscope. The light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microscope remains as the best instrument for the determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of mineral type. This is because the minerals under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation were first described analytically with the light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microscope. It is inexpensive and gives positive identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for most samples analyzed. Further, when optical techniques are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequate, there is ample indication that alternative techniques  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be used for complete identification of the sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 1.2. Principle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Minerals consist of atoms that may be arranged in random order or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a regular arrangement. Amorphous materials have atoms in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> random order while crystalline materials have long range order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many materials are transparent to light, at least for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particles or for thin sections. The properties of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials can be investigated by the effect that the material has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on light passing through it. The six asbestos minerals are all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crystalline with particular properties that have been identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and cataloged. These six minerals are anisotropic. They have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular array of atoms, but the arrangement is not the same in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all directions. Each major direction of the crystal presents a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different regularity. Light photons travelling in each of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> main directions will encounter different electrical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighborhoods, affecting the path and time of travel. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> techniques outlined in this method use the fact that light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traveling through fibers or crystals in different directions will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behave differently, but predictably. The behavior of the light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as it travels through a crystal can be measured and compared with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known or determined values to identify the mineral species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Usually, Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) is performed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strain-free objectives on a bright-field microscope platform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This would limit the resolution of the microscope to about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.4 &mu;m. Because OSHA requires the counting and identification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers visible in phase contrast, the phase contrast platform is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to visualize the fibers with the polarizing elements added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the light path. Polarized light methods cannot identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers finer than about 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> m in diameter even though they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible. The finest fibers are usually identified by inference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the presence of larger, identifiable fiber bundles. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibers are present, but not identifiable by light microscopy, use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either SEM or TEM to determine the fiber identity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The advantages of light microcopy are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Basic identification of the materials was first performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  by light microscopy and gross analysis. This provides a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  large base of published information against which to check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  analysis and analytical technique.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The analysis is specific to fibers. The minerals present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  can exist in asbestiform, fibrous, prismatic, or massive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  varieties all at the same time. Therefore, bulk methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  of analysis such as X-ray diffraction, IR analysis, DTA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  etc. are inappropriate where the material is not known to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  be fibrous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The analysis is quick, requires little preparation time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  and can be performed on-site if a suitably equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  microscope is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The disadvantages are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

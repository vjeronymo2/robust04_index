They also shelled the area with Maljutka missiles. The  Ustashas used all artillery pieces to shell Gornji Vakuf, while  they launched primitive explosive devices at Stari Vitez.  Regrouping and reinforcement of Ustasha forces has been sighted  in the area of Zepce. The Chetniks from Mt. Ozren are sending  reinforcements to Novi Seher.    The Zvornik free territory is again under fierce artillery  fire from the Serbian aggressor. Yesterday, in the course of  the afternoon, the remains of the once beautiful Zaseok were  destroyed with tank shells fired from Klisica and the  surrounding hills. This morning, the Chetniks continued their  provocations against the lines of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade.  Its troops are in position and are ready to resist all attacks.    The autonomists' army continues its provocations in the  Bihac  region. Yesterday's attempt at an infantry breakthrough was  decisively repelled by the 5th Corps units. Fikret's [Abdic]  paramilitary is concentrating its forces which means that they  are preparing a new offensive. Our army's defenders are ready  for it.    In the Seven South Operative Group zone of responsibility,  the enemy today targeted civilian targets in Maglaj and provoked  the defense lines of the independent Tesanj Battalion. New  forces are being brought in toward the region of Novi Seher,  which means that new attacks are in preparation. What  particularly worries the 120,000 citizens and refugees in the  area is the lack of food, medicine, and energy.    In the Second Operative Group zone of responsibility, the  Serbian aggressor has intensified artillery activity. The enemy  is targeting the free territories of Doboj and Gracanica. This  morning he attempted an infantry breakthrough that was  decisively repelled by the 109th Doboj Brigade.</p>

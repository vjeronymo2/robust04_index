			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Stuck with the bill - Europe's insurers could learn from US experience Insurers at Lloyd's of London breathed a sigh of relief last month after a New Jersey court ruled that they were not liable for the costs of a Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m) environmental clean-up. Market leaders believe that the case  - involving the chemical company Diamond Shamrock, which manufactured herbicides including agent orange at its Newark plant  - could reflect a change in US legal opinion. John Wetherell, chairman of the Lloyd's non-marine underwriters association, says he senses that the complex and drawn-out legal battle between insurers and US industry about who should pay the bill to clean up America could be moving in favour of insurers. The issue is crucial for Lloyd's  - which is among dozens of US and European insurers which face potentially crippling losses if the US courts order insurers to pay costs estimated by Tillinghast, Nelson &amp; Warren, the US actuarial consultants, at between Dollars 41bn and Dollars 1trillion (million million). But many observers are less sanguine than Wetherell. Specialist environmental lawyers and insurers point out that the underlying trend of legal settlements in the US is favouring policyholders. Worse still, European insurers also face potentially heavy exposures nearer home as the cost of European industrial clean-up becomes clearer. Dawn Enright, a US lawyer working with London-based Cameron Markby Hewitt, says British insurers in particular are 'not doing enough to protect themselves. They have a chance to look and learn from the US experience. They have been lucky so far but this could change'. Since 1980, when the US government introduced the so-called 'Superfund' laws to make the 'polluter pay' for environmental clean-up, the US industry has been attempting to offload the cost on to its insurers. The trend of rulings on a number of basic issues gives the insurance industry little cause for comfort. The majority of legal opinions have favoured policy holders on one fundamental issue: whether government-ordered clean-ups constitute insured damages under the terms of comprehensive general liability (CGL) policies. Six out of eight state high courts  - California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Washington and most recently Iowa  - have said that government-mandated costs are covered under the CGL policies. High Courts in Maine and New Hampshire have ruled that the costs are not covered. In addition, four federal appeals courts have found they are covered. Only two have said that they are not. wording in the early 1970s, restricting coverage to 'sudden and accidental pollution'. But even in cases involving these policies the courts have sometimes ruled in favour of policyholders. Enright points out that the terms 'sudden and accidental' are ambiguous. While insurers were intending to offer cover for sudden discharges of pollutants, courts have often tended to support policyholder interpretations in which the term 'sudden' has meant sudden discovery of gradual pollution. Insurers have also lost out on a third issue: whether a company being sued for the cost of cleaning up hazardous waste sites can claim on all its policies from the time the pollution begins to the point at which liability is known, the so-called 'continuous trigger'. Lawyers and specialists believe that increasingly the insurance industry will need to focus its energy not on defence of general issues but on the facts of particular cases of pollution, where it can prove - as in the Diamond Shamrock case  - that pollution was deliberate. 'Courts are becoming sensitised to the factual circumstances of each case. Where the pollution can be shown to be expected or intended, insurers can be let off the hook,' says Peter Burgin, a lawyer with LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby &amp; MacRae in New York. However, insurers will see legal costs rise as they step up their defences. Increasingly, environmental litigation will be on a case-by-case basis. 'It will be like trench warfare. Costly and long drawn out,' says Burgin. In Europe there is little doubt that the cost of the environmental clean-up will be considerable: UK consultants Ecotec estimate that the UK has between 50,000 and 100,000 contaminated sites, with a total area of 100,000 hectares. Germany has 130,000 contaminated sites and the Netherlands has 100,000. Although the shape of European legal framework is still unclear  - with initiatives at national and European level creating a complicated patchwork of laws  - in several countries a much tougher regime of pollution control and remediation is at hand. Section 61 of Britain's Environmental Protection Act of November 1990 permits local authorities to recover the costs incurred in site clean-ups from the site owner, for example. A draft European Commission green paper prepared this year starts from the recognition that something must be done to clean up what it calls 'the legacy of environmental damage from the past'. In addition, several features of both national and EC legislation could encourage litigation. For example, in the UK the Environmental Protection Act of 1990 has introduced a more rigorous regime of pollution control in which local authorities will be forced to build up detailed registers of polluted sites. Brian Street, an environmental insurance specialist with Reliance National in the UK, says this new legislation 'will greatly increase the power of pressure groups to bring civil proceedings.' Moreover, some critics believe that insurers are complacent about the problem. Many UK companies, for example, have continued to underwrite public liability policies which, by not excluding pollution, in effect offer the broadest possible insurance coverage. Except for installations where there was a perceived risk of pollution, such as a chemical plant, restrictions of coverage to sudden and accidental damage have been generally introduced only since 1990, a delay which Randolph Fields, a American lawyer specialising in environmental law, describes as 'inexplicable'. Both Street and Fields believe UK insurers could face potentially massive losses. Fields says liability claims deriving from 'carte blanche underwriting of unrestricted pollution liability insurance in the UK between 1930 and 1990' are of potentially 'catastrophic proportions'. What seems certain is that what one Lloyd's underwriter calls the 'sins of the past' will haunt insurers for some time to come.</p>

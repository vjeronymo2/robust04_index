			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WORDS, FISTS FLY AT PANEL MEETING IN N. HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> A meeting of the North Hollywood Redevelopment committee ended in chaos Tuesday  night after two committee members walked out to protest what they called  "tainted elections," the chairwoman launched into a tirade and fistfights broke  out.  </P> <P> Participants said the bitterness surrounded the elections for nine vacant seats  on the committee and a dispute over whether the proceedings would be recorded  by a video camera.  </P> <P> The meeting, called to hold the elections, was hostile from the beginning.  </P> <P> Chairwoman Ada Klevens shouted at Brad Berlin, a Pasadena law clerk, that  "people like you are rabble-rousers" when Berlin tried to protest a February  committee election of members.  </P> <P> Berlin maintained that the committee violated state rules by failing to  properly publicize the election.  </P> <P> Several times Berlin tried to interrupt, but Klevens shouted: "I'm talking, and  you're going to listen or you're going to leave."  </P> <P> Berlin said, "Madame Chairman, you're breaking the law."  </P> <P> "So sue me," she replied.  </P> <P> Shortly before that, committee member David Gerred walked out, saying, "I will  have no part in tainted elections." He was followed by committee member Diana  Hoffman.  </P> <P> Deprived of a quorum, the committee was unable to proceed with the scheduled  election of additional members by those at the meeting, who, to be eligible to  vote, were supposed to live in North Hollywood or have a business there.  </P> <P> Arguments over who met the eligibility requirements began early in the meeting  and continued after it broke down.  </P> <P> A North Hollywood businessman swung at a man videotaping the proceedings and  knocked the camera to the ground, participants said.  </P> <P> "No one went down, and no blood was drawn," said Jerry Belcher, a CRA project  manager.  </P> <P> Several persons intervened and "cooler heads prevailed," he said.  </P> <P> In another fight, Greg Roberts, who identified himself as an unsuccessful  candidate for one of the committee seats, said he was punched in the stomach.  </P> <P> North Hollywood Division Police Lt. Stuart Maislin said assault complaints were  brought by Roberts and by Scott Halper, who alleged that his camera was knocked  to the ground as he was videotaping the disorder.  </P> <P> Maislin said detectives would investigate the complaints today.  </P> <P> The committee usually acts as an advisory board to the North Hollywood  Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> Berlin and other critics have charged that the Community Redevelopment Agency  has tried to pack the citizens advisory committee with members who will give  rubber-stamp endorsements to its plans.  </P> <P> Belcher responded that there is "absolutely no truth" in the charges.  </P> <P> The 740-acre North Hollywood redevelopment area is bordered roughly by Tujunga  Avenue on the west, Cahuenga Boulevard on the east, Hatteras street on the  north and Camarillo street on the south.  </P> <P> The redevelopment area, the only one in the San Fernando Valley, is the third  largest in Los Angeles, ranking behind the downtown central business district  and the Hollywood zone.  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kazakhstan in forefront of CIS energy rush - Neil Buckley and Haig Simonian explain the republic's appeal to foreign investors AS WESTERN oil companies stream into the former Soviet Union in search of reserves, two significant deals in less than two months have propelled the central Asian republic of Kazakhstan to the forefront when it comes to attracting foreign investment. Chevron, the fourth largest oil company in the US, finalised an agreement in May to develop Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield, with recoverable reserves estimated at between 6bn and 9bn barrels of oil, ranking it alongside some of the bigger fields in Saudi Arabia. The deal is worth Dollars 1.5bn over the next three years, and could be worth as much as Dollars 20bn over the expected 40-year life of the field. This week, British Gas and Agip, the Italian state oil company, won exclusive negotiating rights to develop the Karachaganak field, with 20 trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas, and another 2bn barrels of oil and condensate. It beat competition from a consortium of BP and Statoil, the Norwegian state-owned oil company, and hopes to reach final agreement by next summer on a deal involving Dollars 6bn investment in the first ten years. The former Soviet Union, with the biggest gas reserves and among the biggest oil reserves in the world, has become a magnet for oil companies seeking to improve their reserves/production ratios. Deals have been few, however. Fears about political instability, the remoteness and difficulty of developing reserves in some regions, and sometimes their sheer size - as well as local bureaucracies unaccustomed to doing business with western companies - have all played their part in limiting the number of agreements signed. Kazakhstan has been conspicuously successful, partly due to its sizeable reserves and the fact that these are within reach of Europe. But Mr Robert Gray, country manager for the former Soviet republics at JP Morgan, who advised on Chevron's Tengiz deal, also points to the influence of Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president. 'Mr Nazarbayev is genuinely committed to economic reform and attracting western capital. The political system is also relatively simple, with muted opposition,' Mr Gray says. Mr Nazarbayev has exerted a personal influence on the Tengiz negotiations, through Mr Kalyk Abdulayev, deputy prime minister and head of the republic's economics committee, who heads the Kazakh negotiating team. The president himself signed the final agreement with Mr Kenneth Derr, Chevron chairman, in Washington. The break-up of the Soviet Union has also helped disengage the brakes. 'Previously you had to negotiate with a production enterprise, a local government, a republican government, and the Soviet government. Now the Soviet ministry layer has been removed, and the republican governments tend to have a more direct line to the enterprises,' Mr Gray says. The Karachaganak deal is a good example of the potential benefits to all parties of deals with the former Soviet republics. Kazakhstan is set to become an important oil and gas exporter by the end of the century. While staffing levels are not yet certain, the development will provide employment, as well as housing and other facilities, for Kazakhs. British Gas says the deal will double its worldwide reserves. Moreover, it will play an important part in achieving the stated aim of Mr Robert Evans, chairman and chief executive, of increasing the proportion of total earnings coming from exploration and production from 15 per cent to 40 per cent by the year 2000. This will reduce the company's reliance on its UK marketing operations, where it must surrender 50 per cent of its share of the industrial market by 1995 and may face competition in the household market as early as next year. Karachaganak may also help dispel the doubts of analysts who have been looking for proof that British Gas can achieve the growth it is looking for in exploration and production. BG says it regards Karachaganak as a low-risk development, and pipeline infrastructure already exists that would allow the export of both oil and gas to Europe, although some new construction may be necessary. At its peak, the field should produce 2bn cu ft of gas a day - similar to the UK's biggest gas field at Morecambe Bay, and 200,000 barrels of oil. The contract could last for 60 years. The deal also has profound implications for Italy, which relies heavily on oil and natural gas imports, and where the government has since the early 1970s been promoting the use of natural gas over oil for both household consumption and electricity generation. Natural gas accounts for about 26 per cent of Italy's total energy needs, compared with a European average of 16 per cent. Italian usage has been reinforced by the 1987 referendum vote blocking the nuclear programme. Having risen from just 9 per cent in 1970, the share of gas in overall energy consumption should reach around 33 per cent by the end of this century. The country has been keen to diversify its gas supplies, currently running at about 50bn cu m a year. About 60 per cent of supplies come from Algeria and Russia, with Holland accounting for a further 19 per cent. At a press conference in Rome, Mr Gabriele Caglieri, chairman of the state owned ENI energy and chemicals group, which owns Agip, said Karachaganak alone could meet Italy's current consumption for 11 years. The field will increase ENI's oil and gas reserves by 50 per cent. 'It is the most important contract ever signed between ourselves and another country,' said Mr Caglieri. He stressed that the estimates for the field's reserves probably represented a minimum, based on current extraction technology, and could be revised upwards in the light of technological advances. With a population of about 17m and rich reserves of oil and gas, as well as gold, silver, copper, lead and chromium, some observers say it may not be too much of an exaggeration to suggest that Kazakhstan could become the Saudi Arabia of central Asia.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Pace of democracy splits Hong Kong legislature HONG KONG'S legislature last night split over the pace of democratisation in the colony, bringing to an end an almost three-year pact which sought more popularly elected seats for the colony's 1995 elections. The members of the legislature voted 25 to 23 against a motion by liberal legislator Mr James McGregor which asked for the Legislative Council's reaffirmation of the October 1989 'Omelco consensus' struck by members of both the Legislative and Executive (cabinet) councils. The Omelco consensus called for a much faster introduction of elective democracy in the colony than Britain and China had previously agreed. For the 1995 elections it proposed that 30, or half, the legislature should be directly elected, instead of the 18 earlier agreed by Beijing and London and the 20 subsequently achieved by the UK through negotiation. The vote underlines the clear divisions over how best to deal with China ahead of the colony's transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Those who voted against Mr McGregor - all of whom were either appointed members or elected to the legislature through a limited franchise - said they saw no possibility of China agreeing to more elective democracy before 1997. It was, therefore, better to work with China rather than unnecessarily angering it, they said. Mr McGregor's supporters - who included all popularly elected politicians - said that only through an increase in representative democracy could the people's rights be safeguarded and Hong Kong be assured of the 'high degree of autonomy' it was promised in 1984 when Britain and China agreed the terms of the transfer of sovereignty. The vote highlights the difficulties facing Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's incoming governor. He will be one of the British government's key advisers on how to deal with China on a range of political issues in the lead up to 1997. But he will have to tender that advice in the full knowledge that he represents a divided community. The decision by the legislature also weakens the position of Britain which has, since early 1990, said it would raise the issue of faster democratisation with the Chinese government. On a visit to the colony in May, Mr Alastair Goodlad, a junior foreign office minister responsible for Hong Kong, said Britain would take up the issue with China soon. In early 1990 the UK had achieved an increase to 18 from 10 popularly elected seats for the 1991 elections and an undertaking from China that no fewer than 20 members would be popularly elected in the 1995 elections. The spirit of this agreement was incorporated into the Beijing-drafted Basic Law  -the colony's post-1997 constitution - and passed by the Chinese parliament in April 1990. China has said repeatedly that it will not change the Basic Law before 1997 and has denounced those who want its amendment as 'subversive'.</p>

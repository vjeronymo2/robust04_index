			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE . . .: FUDGE TREAT COOKS AT NEAR-SUPERSONIC SPEED  </P> <P> Remember the good old days when folks gathered in the kitchen on cool nights to  pull taffy and dip apples in caramel? And how it seemed to take forever for the  candy to cook?  </P> <P> Our microwave Valentine's Day sweets cook with near supersonic speed. Best of  all, they're easy enough for children to make. But do caution them to be  careful. Hot caramel and chocolate are nothing to kid around with.  </P> <P> There's no point in trying to microwave classic fudge or fondant, caramels or  taffy, which must be cooked to just the right temperature, because you'll be  opening the oven door constantly to check on their progress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dangerous to Move  </P> <P> Moreover, these old-fashioned candies don't really cook much faster by  microwave than they do on top of the stove, and they bubble and boil so  furiously they can be dangerous to move, especially if your oven is placed at a  high level such as above your range or counter. So reserve these family  favorites for the top of the stove.  </P> <P> The microwave does excel, however, at short-cut candies that involve little  more than melting chocolate or caramel. It can even be used to boil up a  terrific nut brittle -- and from scratch, at that. The recipes that follow have  all been developed especially for the microwave oven and if you follow them to  the letter, you should succeed every time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 6-MINUTE CHOCOLATE CHIP-PECAN FUDGE  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound) box powdered sugar, sifted  </P> <P> 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter or margarine, cut in small pieces  </P> <P> 1/4 cup half and half  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon vanilla  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate pieces  </P> <P> 3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts  </P> <P> Combine sugar, cocoa, butter, half and half, vanilla and salt in 2-quart  casserole. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 2 to 2 1/2 minutes,  stirring after 1 minute, until bubbling.  </P> <P> Beat mixture until smooth, mix in chocolate pieces and nuts and spread evenly  in well buttered 8-inch square pan. Cool, chill until firm, then cut in 1-inch  squares. Makes 64 squares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PEANUT BRITTLE  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1/3 cup light corn syrup  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups roasted blanched peanuts  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> Combine sugar and corn syrup in 2-quart measure or casserole and microwave,  uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 4 minutes, stirring at half time.  </P> <P> Mix in peanuts and butter and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 3 1/2 to 4 minutes  until pale brown. Quickly stir in vanilla and soda.  </P> <P> Pour onto buttered baking sheet and spread as thin as possible with buttered  metal spatula. For extra thin brittle, cook 4 to 5 minutes, then pull and  stretch with buttered fingers (mixture should be pliable). When cold, crack  into pieces. Makes about 3/4 pound.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NUTTY CARAMEL APPLES  </P> <P> 1 (14-ounce) package vanilla caramels  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons water  </P> <P> 4 wood skewers  </P> <P> 4 medium red apples, washed, dried and stemmed  </P> <P> 1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans  </P> <P> Microwave caramels with water in 1-quart measure on HIGH (100% power) 3 to 3  1/2 minutes, stirring every minute.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, insert skewers in stem ends of apples.  </P> <P> When caramels are melted, stir until smooth. Dip apples into caramel to coat  evenly, then roll in nuts. Cool on wax paper until caramel hardens. Makes 4.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

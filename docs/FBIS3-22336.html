			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent M. Karlov report: "So Who Exactly </F> Is Poisoning Us?"]    [Text] A conflict situation has now arisen in Russia  because of the purchase and use of of foreign pesticides which  have not undergone expert ecological and toxicological analysis.  Over 500 domestically produced pesticides are authorized for  use as it is, and counting all their various compounds and forms  the figure runs into several tens of thousands. Every year the  list of authorized pesticides is augmented by new preparations.  This information was heard yesterday at a collegium of the  Russian Federation Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources.    Numerous research studies have shown that persistent stable  pesticides are accumulating in the soil, ground sediments,  plant-growing products, water, and living organisms. As a  result various illnesses have arisen and the reproductive  functions of people and animals and the functions of their  genital organs have been disturbed.    All this is not surprising, because around 100,000 tonnes of  unusable pesticides have accumulated at Russian Federation  Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs depots alone, and the  problem of disposing of them has still not been solved. Fish  are dying as a result of poisoning. For example, two years ago  two million fish died in the Mechetka River (Rostov Oblast)  alone -- pike, roach, perch, carp, and silver carp. For the  same reason insects -- the pollinators of plants -- are dying,  and this is greatly reducing the yield of agricultural crops.  It is no accident that in 1992 almost 1,000 violations of  environmental protection requirements were detected.</p>

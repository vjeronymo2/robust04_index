			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucia Domville] </F>   [Text] Currently, the political climate is not propitious  for the Mexican Government to speed up the elimination of  tariffs being demanded by the United States and Canada.  Consequently, sources of the National Foreign Trade Council  [Conacex] and the National Association of Mexican Importers and  Exporters warned that the Commerce and Industrial Development  Secretariat [Secofi] will not begin negotiations until after  federal elections take place in Mexico.    Between June and September, the governments of the three  countries will seek to correct NAFTA administrative deficiencies  because there are bureaucratic hitches that still hinder the  trade of products, representatives of local and U.S. chambers  added. Businessmen also stated that the month granted by the  Secofi to producers to conduct consultations and make the  necessary studies is not enough.    Since October 1993, the Mexican, U.S., and Canadian  Governments agreed to convene a new negotiation on NAFTA  sections under Article 302, part three of the agreement.    Government representatives from the three countries held  talks on the process from the latter part of 1993 until 23 May  1994, the date on which the list of 157 products they decided to  include in the first round of negotiations was published on the  Official Gazette and the U.S. Federal Register. The list is a  compendium of the proposals made by the private sectors of the  three countries. Mexico seeks the expeditious elimination of  tariffs for over 90 products, the United States for 47, and  Canada for 31.    The U.S. list was the most modified because it dropped down  to 47 products, after the United States had announced, last  March, its intention to change schedules and tariffs for over  600 line items.    Private sector sources revealed that Mexico has maintained  higher tariffs for many products of U.S. interest, and  underscored that the counterpart should keep in mind that the  differences between the economies of the commercial partners  were supposed to be reflected precisely in the schedules agreed  upon for the elimination of tariffs.    To the contrary, the number of tariff reductions that Mexico  would like the United States to implement in an accelerated  manner seeks to dismantle the protectionist mechanisms in force  in that country, because the United States has not carried out a  "unilateral liberalization."    The resolution published in the Mexican Official Gazette  indicates that within the month following the publication,  Mexican productive sectors will determine which products with  lower tariffs benefit Mexican businessmen. Sources consulted  said then that two weeks after investigations conclude, Herminio  Blanco, under secretary for international trade negotiations of  the Commerce and Industries Development Secretariat, is expected  to meet with U.S. and Canadian counterparts Rufus Yerxa and John  Weekes, respectively, for a "give and take."    Since 23 May, representatives of the local chambers of  products involved expressed their opposition to a process to  eliminate tariffs. Within Conacex and ANIERM, businessmen have  emphasized that the month designated for consultations is not  enough and that it is rather hasty since NAFTA has only been in  effect for five months.    The businessmen explained that, in addition to confusion  among industrialists who have not recovered yet from the shock  caused by the implementation of NAFTA, the political situation  Mexico is currently facing is too precarious to implement an  accelerated elimination of tariffs. The anonymous sources  anticipated that the Mexican Government will not engage in any  negotiations until after the 21 August elections.    "These are difficult political times, and the Mexican  business sector is in no shape to conduct negotiations, a source  added. However, they mentioned that representatives of the  sectors involved in the process will have to ask Secofi for an  extension. Meanwhile, representatives of U.S. and Mexican  industrial chambers stressed that, thus far, U.S. and Mexican  authorities will try to solve and eliminate the bureaucratic  problems that hinder foreign trade.    Such topics as paperwork and excessive bureaucracy will be  reviewed. Problems classifying products into line items have  occurred in both the United States and Mexico, because each  country has a different set of regulations. The use of  certificates-of-origin and place-of-origin regulations  constitute nontariff obstacles that have hindered trade in North  America.</p>

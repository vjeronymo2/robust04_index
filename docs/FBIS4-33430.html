			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special envoy Froilan Arencidia] </F>   [Text] Doha, 5 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign Relations  Minister Roberto Robaina visited the Umm Sa'id industrial zone  located on the outskirts of the capital city of Qatar, as part  of his two-day visit to this Persian Gulf state. The tour began  with a visit to the Qatari Steel Company, a steel plant that  utilizes more than 100 workers and produced more than 7 million  tons of steel in 1993.    A management delegation representing this steel company  visited Cuba recently and expressed its interest in establishing  cooperation in this field with the Cuban Government. The Cuban  foreign minister reiterated to the Qatari company Cuba's  willingness to encourage an exchange of expertise in this field  in which the island has a considerable infrastructure.    Robaina and the delegation accompanying him also visited the  Qatari Fertilizer Company, which was founded in 1969 and is  considered the largest ammonium manufacturing company in the  Middle East. This Monday, the Cuban foreign minister will be  received by Amir Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the Qatari chief  of state, and will also meet with the ministers of foreign  relations, health, and finance.    In addition, tomorrow Robaina will officially inaugurate the  new Cuban Embassy in Doha, which will be in charge of relations  with Oman and other Gulf emirates with which Cuba recently  established diplomatic relations. Relations between Havana and  Doha received significant encouragement during the last few  months as a result of the visit of Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad  Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabir Al Thani to Cuba.</p>

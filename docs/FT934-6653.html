			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Lenders hold fire until Budget Most building societies, taking their lead from Halifax, the largest lender, have decided to hold fire until the Budget before deciding on mortgage rate cuts. Nationwide, the second largest lender, was the only one of the top 10 building societies to announce a cut in its mortgage rate, while National Westminster Bank also announced a cut. Both said they would reduce their standard variable rate by a quarter of a point to 7.74 per cent from today for new borrowers and from January 1 for existing customers. The reduction means a saving of Pounds 6.67 a month on a repayment mortgage of Pounds 50,000, according to Nationwide. Nationwide, which also announced a package of mortgage discounts, said a reduction of much less than a quarter of a point would have scarcely been worth undertaking. Mr Brian Davis, operations director at Nationwide, said the move was designed to help boost confidence in the housing market ahead of the Budget. Newcastle building society also announced a cut to 7.75 per cent. Halifax said it planned to reduce its mortgage rate. But Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive, said: 'We are now so close to the Budget that it makes sense to wait and see the totality of the chancellor's package on November 30. We will then decide on the appropriate rate reductions.' Building societies are likely to take advantage of the cut to widen margins. Mr Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest society, said borrowers would 'almost certainly not get the full benefit of a 0.5 per cent reduction in base rates'. However, Mr White added, conditions were right for potential buyers to enter the market. 'This latest move is further evidence that both low interest rates and low inflation appear to have staying power,' he said. 'Potential housebuyers, who are holding back because of concern that high rates will return, should feel much more confident now.' He added that the society would soon announce new fixed mortgage rates taking the base rate cut into account.</p>

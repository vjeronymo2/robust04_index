			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tino Teller: "Nuclear Scrap From Prague"] </F>   [Text] At one point, the main central cooling pump ceased  to work, the next time the emergency water feeder failed, and  then an entire reactor block had to be shut down because of an  operational mistake: A total of 315 major and minor incidents  were registered at the Czech Dukovany power plant in 1993, 84 of  which were direct consequences of "human errors."    This can be learned from the most secret annual report of  the  State Office for Nuclear Safety SUJB ("Statni urad pro jadernou  bezpecnost") to the Economics Ministry in Prague, which has  reached the hands of the Upper Austrian Greens Party.    A short glance into the secret report, which officially  exists only in two copies, even exceeds the worst fears  regarding the state of the Czech nuclear power plants in terms  of security technology.    --In the 52 serious incidents, the operators of the Dukovany  nuclear power plant had to declare an "unplanned decrease in  output," which, according to the report, is 28 cases more than  in 1992, a twofold increase within a single year.    --All in all, 13 emergency shutdowns had to be carried out  at  Dukovany within a single year--for example, on 27 June 1993 in  Block 2, as a result of a major operational fault, or on 29  September in Block 1 and on 29 October in Block 3, as a result  of a sudden failure of two of the six main central cooling pumps.    However, the other "deviations" from normal operations with  unchanged reactor output bore considerable risks. Some of them  were classified by the Nuclear Safety Office as "dangerous" in  retrospect.    --During a check, the high-pressure pump for the emergency  water did not start at all, while, during another check, the  electric engine for feeding the boron solution into the system,  the lack of which might lead to a disaster in an emergency, ran  in the wrong direction.    --Contrary to the opinion of the state safety experts, the  fire in the hydrogen system on 11 January 1993 was initially  presented as absolutely harmless by the Dukovany engineers.    The Dukovany plant, which has been operating since 1985, is  quite obviously showing major signs of wear and tear so that its  continued operation is possible only by accepting  ever-increasing safety risks.  <H5>  Lower Safety Standards? </H5>   In its ultrasound checks in Block 2, the state office  discovered cracks in the steel beneath the interior lining of  the reactor vessel. Moreover, in one area, the inner lining of  the reactor vessel no longer stuck to the ground material, which  can lead to material tension and cracks. Yet, instead of  repairing the defective material, which would cost considerable  amounts of money, the inspectors in their annual report suggest  a much cheaper solution: The quality defects, they wrote in  their "recommendation," would be acceptable for the further  operation of the reactor if "the safety criteria were  overhauled"--that is to say, lowered.    Yet, as they stated themselves, the inspectors were unable  to  check the real state of the steel in the reactor vessel because  of permanent defects in the ultrasound equipment....    That the position of the reactor vessel in Dukovany's Block  4  is too angular as a result of obvious construction defects, that  it deviates more than 100 percent from the applicable safety  regulations, hardly seems to count anymore. Even in this case,  the State Nuclear Safety Office regards the further operation as  "acceptable until further notice," despite this grave defect.  <H5>  Is Prague Playing a Wrong Game? </H5>   For Rudi Anschober, Greens deputy from Upper Austria, this  annual report of the Czech Nuclear Safety Office only provides  the final proof that the Prague government is playing false:  "All defects in the Czech nuclear reactors that we have pointed  to have been confirmed in this secret report. Dukovany is a  nuclear time bomb, only 35 km north of Austria's border.  However, even we were surprised about the dramatic increase in  the number of incidents last year. Dukovany has long since been  fit for the scrap heap."    Yet, surprisingly, the secret report of the State Nuclear  Safety Office supplies nuclear opponents with new ammunition  against finishing Temelin. If the responsible district  authority at Ceske Budejovice classifies the planned refitting  of the Temelin reactors by the U.S. "Westinghouse" group as  "essential," which is generally expected, then, in the view of  the Nuclear Safety Office in Prague, the operators of the power  plant also need a new construction license.  <H5>  Illegal Building Site Temelin </H5>   With this view, the secret report indirectly supports  Temelin  opponents in the Czech Republic and abroad, for whom Temelin has  been "the world's largest illegal building site" (Anschober) for  some time.    The new construction licensing procedure might then mean the  ultimate end for Temelin at the very last minute. Within the  next few weeks, with their signature, at least 100,000 Austrians  should therefore, as a precautionary measure, claim their right  to speak out in the hearing regarding the construction of the  missing blocks of the Temelin plant at the district office at  Ceske Budejovice.    Despite all denials from Prague, the Czech Government is  planning a massive extension of its nuclear program. At the  moment, another licensing procedure is under way for a temporary  storage plant for fuel rods not far from the Dukovany power  plant, which would create an internationally unparalleled  concentration of risk in this area. The Czech Nuclear Safety  Office has not authorized this project because of planning  mistakes.    According to the secret report, a separate fuel rod plant is  also being planned, which would ultimately make the Czech  Republic the number-one nuclear nation in East Europe.</p>

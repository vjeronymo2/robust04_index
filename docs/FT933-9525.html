			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Increase in lending adds to optimism on recovery: French rate cut helps lift shares to record close STRONG CONSUMER credit growth and a smaller than expected rise in the prices of manufactured goods yesterday added to optimism that the UK recovery is gathering pace without being dogged by inflation. The good news, together with a trimming of lending rates in France, sent share prices in London to a record closing high as investors anticipated renewed economic activity in Europe. Official UK credit figures pointed to a willingness among consumers to borrow for this year's early summer sales, indicating they are shedding some of their post-recession fear of accumulating debt. The Central Statistical Office said consumers borrowed a net Pounds 213m in June, the highest seasonally adjusted monthly figure for two years. A broader measure of credit growth painted a similar picture, with net lending at Pounds 616m in the second quarter compared with Pounds 299m in the first. Meanwhile, the prices of manufactured goods leaving factories rose only 0.1 per cent in July compared with June, suggesting that manufacturers are continuing to absorb the higher cost of imported raw materials and fuel following the devaluation of sterling in September. Prices were 4.1 per cent higher than a year ago. The FT-SE 100 Index closed up 16.6 at a record high of 2,986.4, just off a new peak reached during trading of 2,986.8. However, the pound, trading against the background of a stronger D-Mark, lost some of its recent gains to close down  3/4 of a pfennig at DM2.535. Against the dollar sterling ended just less than half a cent lower at Dollars 1.4935. In New York it closed at Dollars 1.49075. New credit advanced to consumers rose in June to Pounds 4.69bn, from Pounds 4.2bn in May. Nearly two-thirds of the increase reflected higher advances on credit cards during the month, with most of the remainder due to lending by finance houses. Economists counselled against reading too much into one month's figures. 'The June growth in consumer credit reflects the very lumpy profile of the most recent retail sales figures, which dropped off in May, followed by a strong June figure to make up,' said Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities. 'Still, this is one in the eye for those who thought that, when the recovery did arrive, consumers would refuse to finance it with consumer credit,' he added. June was the ninth consecutive month in which consumers borrowed more than they paid back. The credit figures account for only a small part of total private sector debt as they do not include mortgages. The June lending data take in about 15 per cent of consumer borrowings, while the broader quarterly measure includes personal bank loans and lending by non-bank credit cards and covers about 20 per cent.

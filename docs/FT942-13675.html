			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market stages strong end-account rally - Market Report UK shares ended the week and the account in sparkling form as a powerful performance by US stocks and bonds on Thursday evening and the emergence of yet more takeover activity injected some much-needed confidence into the market. Even a lack-lustre opening performance by Wall Street yesterday failed to discourage London. Also helping the equity market regain its poise was a firm gilt-edged market, where long-dated issues closed with gains of around  3/4 of a point after money supply and lending figures for March. Hard on the heels of the Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn merger with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester came news of a Pounds 177m takeover of Hogg Group, the insurance broker, by Inchcape. A bid for Hogg had been widely expected after HSBC, the banking group, acquired a 6 per cent stake some weeks ago. Inchcape was one several potential bidders for Hogg and looked to have won control after buying HSBC's stake. The FT-SE 100 index, which came under severe pressure for much of the week, rebounded strongly, closing a net 32.5 up at 3,133.7 and reducing the fall on the five-day period to 34.6. The market's second-tier stocks, comprising the FT-SE Mid 250 index, were much more restrained with the index closing only a modest 7.0 higher at 3,789.5 in spite of some hefty two-way activity. The London market has been hit by two big blows this week. First, the move by the US Federal Reserve to increase its Fed Funds rate by a further quarter of a point, and second, by evidence of strong economic growth which is seen by the market as reducing the chances of any early cut in UK rates. The main catalyst for yesterday's upsurge in London and throughout Europe came from the US where the Dow Jones jumped 53 points or some 1.5 per cent in the wake of a strong rally after excellent results from IBM, the computer giant. There was, however, some disappointment at the level of turnover in the market given that sentiment was much improved following the big jump in US markets and the latest bid news. Turnover in London yesterday reached 816.2m shares but with the FT-SE 100 stocks only accounting for 317.1m shares, or 39 per cent of total business. Electricity stocks, on the other hand, were badly affected by news that the electricity industry regulator had sent out letters to the heads of all the recs outlining what were said to be stringent and severe initial proposals on pricing due to take effect next year. Oil shares, among the market's best performers over the past couple of weeks, made rapid progress in the wake of rising crude oil prices. The majors responded to good results from Amoco, the US company, but the market's attention remained firmly on exploration company Lasmo where there was renewed takeover speculation and further big activity. Much of this was carried via the inter-dealer broker screens which guarantee anonymity to both buyer and seller of the shares and are widely utilised in stake-building and takeover situations. Marketmakers, although relieved at the market's resilience this week, said they were not entirely convinced that the UK equity market's recent correction had run its course. 'The market feels comfortable at this level but becomes unhappy above 3,155 on the FT-SE 100; we remain at the mercy of Wall Street.'</p>

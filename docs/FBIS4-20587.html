			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Kiichi Kamimura, Ichiroh </F> Ohtake, and Yoshiharu Onuma, Department of Electric and  Electronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Shinshu  University]    [Text] Polycrystalline boron films were deposited by plasma  assisted chemical vapor deposition. The source gas was diborane  or trichloroboron. The structure of film was characterized by  transmission electron beam diffraction. The optical energy gap  was estimated from the energy dispersion of photo-absorption  coefficient. The electrical properties were determined from Hall  measurement.    Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of deposition  system. Reaction chamber was made from quartz tube with the  diameter of 42 cm. The RF power was applied by a couple of ring  electrodes. The frequency was 13.56 MHz. The diborane gas was  diluted to 5% with hydrogen gas. The substrate  temperature was  600-900C.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-30A>      Figure 1. Deposition System </FIG>     Figure 2 shows a typical transmission electron beam  diffraction pattern of a sample. The ring pattern shows the film  is polycrystalline _a_- boron. The plasma enhancement was  effective to get sharper diffraction patterns. Some properties  of the polycrystalline boron films were listed in Table 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-30B>      Figure 2.

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Property (Eastern Europe): Pitfalls that await the unwary - So you're moving to eastern Europe. Audrey Powell looks at the problems of finding a home YOU WORK for one of the companies spreading out to take advantage of the opportunities opening up across eastern Europe. Where might you be sent and what sort of living conditions would you have? Pauline Sheerman, head of the Confederation of British Industry's eastern Europe department, says you would probably go to Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Russia or Romania. What happens then depends on the company. A large group might rent a whole building, using part for offices and the rest as accommodation. But even major companies have to test the water first and send out a few staff with the pioneering spirit. After the initial spell in a hotel, their experiences can be varied. Rented flats may be scarce, or simply hard to find in places where letting agents are not part of the scene. Local office staff may have to fulfil that role. Beware of renting something that could be the subject of a restitution claim. 'Unfurnished' can mean no lights, carpets or kitchen units. Often, telephones can take months to be connected. There are many pitfalls for the unwary. Ion Florescu and Marek Scidor-Rylski are co-authors of Making a Success of Joint Ventures in Eastern Europe, a CBI book just published.* Florescu, who is Anglo-Romanian, is general manager of a London-based company and visits Romania each month. He warns that accommodation for people going there to work is 'very basic'; as a result, many foreigners live permanently in hotels. While there are some agents in Bucharest, generally you have to rent privately from local people, who might sub-let a flat in a house. It is difficult to find a modern, well-kept apartment. Florescu says: 'For a shabby, two-room apartment in the centre of Bucharest, you will pay Pounds 500 a month, with rent three to six months in advance. You will probably need to employ someone to re-decorate before you move in, and you have no security over the accommodation.' Scidor-Rylski is Anglo-Polish. He is with a Canadian-quoted company investing in eastern Europe and spends half his time in Poland. He says: 'Everybody can and does own property there. There are plenty of apartments.' A small flat in a tall building - functional but austere - should cost Pounds 300-Pounds 500 a month. The problem is lack of offices, not flats, although some hotels will arrange for you to use an office on another floor, or adjacent to your room. But the worst thing about living in Warsaw is car theft. 'Take a good immobiliser,' he advises. Some new arrivals in eastern Europe have had a few problems. Nick Gera works in Sofia, Bulgaria, for London-based chartered accountant Touche Ross. He rents a five-bedroom, semi-detached house with garage 'and over-run garden' in a village six miles out of the city for Pounds 840 a month and lives there by himself. Gera found it through a contact when he went earlier to Sofia to work on a temporary project. He advises anyone who can to go there before moving - for a holiday, perhaps - so they can look for accommodation at leisure. Finding it is not difficult, Gera says, because plenty of people in Sofia have built houses in surrounding villages to let to foreigners. While they often seek ambitious rents, he knows of deals agreed at a third of the asking figure. Do not sign the first contract offered, Gera advises, and watch out for any 'nasty' clauses. Get the lease fixed for as long as possible - a request for renewal will result in a demand for increased rent. William Touche, senior manager of Touche Ross and a great-grandson of the firm's founder, has just returned to London after 2 1/2 years in Moscow (Touche Ross has about a dozen offices in eastern Europe). At first, he lived in a hotel with his wife and baby. 'With all the property state-owned, it was extremely difficult to find anyone to let apartments,' he says. Ingenuity was called for. Of the limited options, an apartment in a leafy boulevard in central Moscow appealed. Unfortunately, it already had tenants: a psychiatrist, her mother, child and divorced husband. She was anxious for him to go so Touche paid seven months' advance rent; this allowed the man to get a co-operative flat elsewhere. With the aid of brokers, a smaller flat was found for the psychiatrist and her family. The firm paid the rent for this, plus Pounds 700 a month for the boulevard apartment with its four rooms and parquet floors, and Touche moved in. When he left Moscow in April, his replacement took it over. Finding accommodation in Moscow became easier, and renting it much cheaper, after the coup in 1991, he says. Now, there are more brokers who will fix up deals. At first, they stuck notices in phone booths; today, they advertise in English-language newspapers. Although there are a number of relocation companies in Britain, few can help over moves to eastern Europe. But one that does is Hamptons Relocation in Swindon, Wiltshire (tel. 0793-619 555). Quoting from its comprehensive information sheets: 'Prague is becoming busy with Americans and Japanese. This has led to a dramatic increase in rental prices.' It gives the average monthly rental for a three-bedroom furnished property there as Pounds 1,835, and Pounds 1,282-2,565 for a similar-sized property in Warsaw. Hamptons adds: 'In Budapest, Hungary, apartments are generally rather small, with few in the three- to four-bedroom category. But there is a fair amount available . . .' The agency likes to meet clients, with their families, at their UK homes to take details of their requirements, says international relocation manager Anita Saunders. It will tell them what they can expect in the area sought, and its representative there will inspect suitable properties and show clients a selection. It also handles negotiations and rental terms. 'Just give us the moving date,' adds Saunders, 'and the property should be ready.' Fee: Pounds 2,250. *Insight International, Pounds 50. 110 pages.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Section 905.678 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;905.678  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Annual Submission of activities and expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Annual Submission is a collective term for all documents which the IHA must submit to HUD for review and approval before accessing the current FFY grant funds. Such documents include the Annual Statement, Work Statements for years two through five of the Five-Year Action Plan, local government statement, IHA Board Resolution, materials demonstrating the partnership process and any other documents as prescribed by HUD. For planning purposes, an IHA may use either the amount of funding received in the current year or the actual formula amount provided in HUD's notification under &sect;905.669(b)(1) in developing the Five-Year Action Plan for presentation at the resident meetings and public hearing. Work Statements cover the second through the fifth years of the Five-Year Action Plan and set forth the major work categories and costs by development or IHA-wide which the IHA intends to undertake in each year of years two through five. In preparing these Work Statements, the IHA shall assume that the current FFY formula amount will be available in each year of years two through five. The Work Statements for all five years will be at the same level of detail so that the IHA may interchange work items as discussed in &sect;905.672(d)(5)(i). An IHA may budget up to 8% of its annual grant in a contingency account for cost overruns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submission.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After receiving HUD notification of the formula amount and estimating how much funding will be available from other sources, such as State and tribal governments, and determining its activities and costs based on the current FFY formula amount, the IHA shall submit its Annual Submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acceptance for review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Upon receipt of an Annual Submission from an IHA, HUD shall determine whether:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The Annual Submission contains each of the required components; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The IHA has submitted any additional information or assurances required as a result of HUD monitoring, findings of inadequate IHA performance, audit findings, and civil rights compliance findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the IHA has submitted a complete Annual Submission and all required information and assurances, HUD will accept the submission for review, as of the date of receipt. If the IHA has not submitted all required material, HUD will promptly notify the IHA that it has disapproved the submission, indicating the reasons for disapproval, the modifications required to qualify the Annual Submission for HUD review, and the date by which such modifications must be received by HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Resident and local government participation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An IHA is required to develop its Annual Submission, including any proposed amendments to its Comprehensive Plan as provided in &sect;905.672(e), in consultation with officials of the appropriate governing body (or, in the case of an IHA with developments in multiple jurisdictions, in consultation with the CEO of each such jurisdiction or with an advisory group representative of all jurisdictions) and with residents and duly elected resident organizations of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public notice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within a reasonable amount of time before the advance meeting for residents under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the IHA shall annually provide public notice of the advance meeting and the public hearing in a manner determined by the IHA and which ensures notice to all duly elected resident organizations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Advance meeting with residents.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IHA shall at least annually hold a meeting open to all residents and duly elected resident organizations. The advance meeting shall be held within a reasonable amount of time before the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The IHA will provide residents with information concerning the contents of the IHA's Five-Year Action Plan (and any proposed amendments to the IHA's Comprehensive Plan to be submitted with the Annual Submission) so that residents can comment adequately at the public hearing on the contents of the Five-Year Action Plan and any proposed amendments to the Comprehensive Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public hearing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IHA shall annually hold at least one public hearing, and any appropriate number of additional hearings, to present information on the Annual Submission and the status of prior approved programs. The public hearing shall provide ample opportunity for residents of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, officials of the appropriate governing body, and other interested parties, to express their priorities and concerns. The IHA shall give full consideration to the comments and concerns of residents, local government officials, and other interested parties in developing its Five-Year Action Plan, or any amendments to its Comprehensive Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Expedited scheduling.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> IHAs are encouraged to hold the meeting with residents and duly elected resident organizations under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section between July 1 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., after the end of the program year_June 30) and September 30, using the formula amount for the current FFY. If an IHA elects to use such expedited scheduling, it must explain at the meeting with residents and duly elected resident organizations and at the public hearing that the current FFY amount is not the actual grant amount for the subsequent year, but is rather the amount used for planning purposes. It must also explain that the Five-Year Action Plan will be adjusted when HUD provides notification of the actual formula amount, and explain which major work categories at which developments may be added or deleted to adjust for the actual formula amount and that any added work categories/developments will come from the Comprehensive Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contents of Annual Submission.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Annual Statement for each year must include, for each development or on an IHA-wide basis for management improvements or certain physical improvements for which work is to be funded out of that year's grant:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A list of development accounts with an identification of major work categories;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The cost for each major work category, as well as a summary of cost by development account;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The IHA-wide or development-specific management improvements to be undertaken during the year;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For each development and for any management improvements not covered by a HUD-approved management improvement plan, a schedule for the use of current year funds, including target dates for the obligation and expenditure of the funds. In general, HUD expects that an IHA will obligate its current year's allocation of CGP funds (except for its funded replacement reserves) within two years, and expend such funds within three years, of the date of HUD approval, unless longer time-frames are approved by HUD due to the size of the grant, the complexity of the work, and other factors;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A summary description of the actions to be taken with non-CGP funds to meet physical and management improvement needs which have been identified by the IHA in its needs assessments;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Any documentation that HUD needs to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act and other related authorities in accordance with &sect;905.120(a) and (b);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

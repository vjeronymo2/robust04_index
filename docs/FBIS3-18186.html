Mr. Chretien says Canada may even extend its  200-mile offshore economic zone to protect depleted stocks.    Canada has negotiated a one-year moratorium with more than a  dozen other nations to protect threatened species in waters that  straddle the Grand Bank or are just outside. Alvin Cater  reports:    [Cater] At the legislature building in St John's, the prime  minister listened to pleas for help from people whose lives have  been ruined by the collapse of the Atlantic fishery. For two  years a ban on the northern cod has deprived them of their  livelihood. But foreign vessels have continued to fish just  outside Canadian waters on the nose and the tail of the Grand  Bank. In Brussels last week some European nations agreed to a  moratorium on east coast fishing. Today Chretien warned Canada  is preparing to flex its legislative muscle if the foreign  fishing doesn't stop.    [Begin Chretien recording] The bill will be ready within  weeks. As soon as the fishing starts again, if it's not  respected, the bill will be passed and we will use the resources  we have to make sure that the bill is respected. [end recording]    [Cater] Chretien wouldn't say how the government will police  the nose and the tail of the Grand Bank if it extends Canada's  jurisdiction.    Many people in the audience have been receiving federal aid  since the ban was imposed but because of this week's budget  they'll be receiving smaller checks. The prime minister only  talked about the budget as he answered reporters' questions. He  admitted the aid program is being scaled back but he insisted  the cuts will not be drastic.    [Begin Chretien recording] There will be some change. I  cannot deny that. But those who say that they will be cut in  half, they will have to swallow their words. [end recording]    [Cater] The prime minister also said the government had no  choice but to slash unemployment insurance [UI] benefit.  Otherwise, he said, the UI fund would eventually go broke.</p>

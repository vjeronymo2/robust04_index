The Romanian president will be shown the special  economic zones in the South of China, Shen Zhen and Zhu Hai, the  Quandong Canton Province where, the Romanian delegation will  meet with the local administration. The president will be  accompanied by a group of Romanian businessmen, executives of  state and private companies, and will examine the prospects of  cooperation between the two countries. [passage omitted]    The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry read a communique at  a  Wednesday, March 2, press conference, saying that the Romanian  Foreign Ministry has taken note with satisfaction of the  agreement on the creation of a Croatian-Muslim Federation in  Bosnia- Herzegovina and of a confederation made up of the said  federation and Croatia. The Romanian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs considers that the putting in place of the provisions of  this accord would represent an important step in finding a  political solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in  parallel with solutions for the other problems under  negotiation. The Foreign Ministry expresses hope that this  favorable moment will be made good use of in the interest of all  the parties, of stability and security in the region, reads the  communique.    The relations between Romania and Moldova are not function  of  the electoral cycle, which was already proved when elections  were held in Romania, said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mircea  Geoana at his Wednesday, March 2, press conference, speaking  about the elections held in the Republic of Moldova on February  27.    The results of the polls reflect the state of mind of the  population and they can be interpreted in terms of the economic  and social difficulties confronting the Republic of Moldova, of  the way in which the electorate took those aspects of the  programmes of the parties running for seats in parliament that  refer to the current situation of the country, mentioned the  spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. An evaluation of the  results has to take into account the conditions specific to the  Republic of Moldova, the tensions appeared in consequence of the  situation in Dniester and the districts inhabited by Gagauz, the  general evolutions in the former Soviet space. "That is how the  option for the left can be explained, the relative high percent  of vote got by the bloc formed of the Socialist Party (the  former Communist Party) and the "unity" party. It is  interesting to mention, nevertheless, that the Democratic  Agrarian Party had the biggest number of seats in the previous  parliament and it has preserved its position, added Geoana.    At the 2 March weekly news conference of the Romanian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Spokesman Mircea Geoana referred to  the statement of 28 February of the Council of Representatives  of the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania (UDMR), issued as a  follow-up and in response to a letter sent to this body by  Bishop Laszlo Tokes. The spokesman said that the letter  confirms, once again, the extremist and anti-Romanian angle from  which Pastor Tokes, encouraged by some UDMR leaders and  political persons in Hungary, approaches his relations with the  Romanian state and with UDMR itself.    "We express the hope that the UDMR leaders will distance  themselves from the positions of the honorary president of their  party, in whose view at present in Romania Ceausescu's policies  on minorities are being continued. It is only to be regretted  that the declaration issued by the UDMR's Council of  Representatives practically reiterates all the accusations  listed in the instruction-letter of Pastor Tokes. UDMR's  declaration is accusing the Romanian authorities of lacking the  political will to implement the amendments of the Council of  Europe. We think it is high time UDMR understood that the  addressee of these amendments is the Romanian society as a whole  and that the observance of the commitments made before the  Council on Romania's admission to it is a matter of national  interest," the spokesman said. He also stressed that the  withdrawal of UDMR from the Council for Ethnic Minorities -- the  place where it would be but natural that such problems were  debated -- reveals the lack of both real interest and pragmatism  in solving them, and lack of consideration for the interests and  role of the other ethnic minorities in Romania.    "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the confidence  that, joining the competent institutions in the rapid  finalization of this process, all the forces interested in  proving the democratic propensity and realities of Romania will  bring a constructive and sincere contribution," the Foreign  Ministry spokesman concluded.</p>

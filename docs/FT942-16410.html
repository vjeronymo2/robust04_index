			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Finance loophole advisers attacked Accountants and lawyers have been actively involved in avoiding financial reporting regulations, an academic told the European Accounting Association annual conference in Venice yesterday. The involvement of lawyers, auditors and corporate financiers in developing capital instruments had undermined rule-based regulations, Mr Atul Shah, of the University of Bristol, said. In a case study of convertible capital bonds he said the instrument was designed to exploit tax and accounting loopholes. He said rule-based regulation was 'doomed to failure' because professionals actively helped their clients to evade these rules. He quoted advertisements and articles in trade journals which he said were marketing initiatives by lawyers selling avoidance schemes. He also cited interviews conducted with bankers saying that they could not have designed and implemented these schemes without close co-operation from lawyers and auditors. Mr Shah said no single professional was involved in packaging the whole avoidance scheme, suggesting that ethical considerations did not limit their actions.</p>

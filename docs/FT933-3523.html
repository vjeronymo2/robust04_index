			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / US to renew Vietnam ban: Clinton may indicate future relaxation of trade embargo PRESIDENT Bill Clinton must sign an order maintaining the US trade ban against Vietnam today. Most analysts say he is unlikely to end the embargo, but congressional staffers believe he may offer a sign that the US will move toward further relaxation. Hindering efforts to lift the embargo are continuing tensions about the fate of US prisoners of war and 'missing in action' held at the end of the Vietnamese war. Last week a document surfaced in Russia suggesting that Vietnam held more prisoners than it had previously admitted. Vietnam rejected the report, but it has 'got people shaky again', said one Senate aide. 'There are a lot of people who will never be satisfied' that the Vietnamese have been open in dealing with the POW-MIA issue, said Ms Kathleen Bertelsen, an aide with the House subcommittee on economic policy, trade and environment. A commission headed by Senator John Kerry that found no evidence that Vietnam still held US prisoners 'relaxed some members of Congress,' Ms Bertelsen said. But there would not be wide support in Congress for lifting the embargo until 'the bulk of (members) feel relatively comfortable that MIA-POW (representatives) will not come to their town meetings and start screaming at them.' Today is the date on which the president must annually renew the list of countries with which trade is barred under the US Trading with the Enemy Act. Some elements of the embargo have been relaxed already. Last year President George Bush allowed US companies to sign, but not execute, contracts with the Vietnamese. Earlier this year the US dropped objections to allowing Vietnam to refinance its international debts, clearing the way for International Monetary Fund and World Bank loans. US businesses are eager for Mr Clinton to allow trade in all but strategic sectors, before Europeans and others capture the Vietnamese market, according to Mr John Howard of the US Chamber of Commerce. 'Our members have long recognised that unilateral sanctions like this only benefit our competition.' One action the president could take would be to allow US companies to undertake humanitarian and development projects in Vietnam. This would ease charges that US taxpayers are funding projects - through the World Bank - in which US companies are not allowed to participate.</p>

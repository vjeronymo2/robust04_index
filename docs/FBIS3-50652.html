			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean-Ralph Fleurizard] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] We should consider setting  aside, by private agreement, the two antagonistic plans that  dominate the political scene. This ia proposed by Professor  Leslie Manigat, leader of the Assembly of Progressive National  Democrats [RDNP]. Speaking for the first time since the fifth  convention of his party, Manigat has proposed a (?set) of  balanced concessions, a kind of equitable compromise aimed at  balancing the scales between the parties. In the opinion of  [former] President Manigat, this compromise is essentially aimed  at lossening the vise which is stifling the country, at  facilitating the emergence of the third centrist democratic  stand, and finally at allowing the mobilization of cooperative  action by men of goodwill. [passage omitted]    Leslie Manigat, who believes that Haitian politics must be  conducted in an atmosphere of sincerity, thinks Father  Aristide's return as president is neither possible nor  desirable. What is obvious, in Manigat's opinion, is that  Aristide's return to power cannot be the appropriate solution.  Also, he wants to put the government of President Aristide in  the dock. He invites the international community to change its  (?stand) and to organize the post-Aristide period. [passage  omitted]    Once again, Manigat says he has stayed on the sidelines so  as  to have a national and responsible voice heard. Although the  RDNP leader is convinced that times have never been so hard for  the majority of the people, that a national collapse has taken  place, and that the gap between the capital and the provinces  has become an abyss, he nevertheless is optimistic -- but  cautious. In his opinion, one must not despair because one can  do better than survive. He says one is even able to eventually  rise above conditions. He criticizes the sanctions imposed on  Haiti, sanctions he deems illegal and outrageous.</p>

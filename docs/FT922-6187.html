			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Trafford Park in line for Pounds 45m investment A SERIES of related agreements between Asda, Varity Holdings, Amec and Trafford Park Development Corporation is expected to lead to Pounds 45m of investment during the next five years, with up to 1,550 new jobs and more than 1m sq ft of new factory space. The developments will lead to Varity, the troubled international farm and industrial machinery group, which owns Massey-Ferguson and Perkins, leaving the Trafford Park industrial estate in Greater Manchester. Worldwide distribution of Perkins replacement parts will be relocated to the former steelworks town of Irlam, still within the corporation's area. A new 17-acre warehouse and office complex in Irlam will be run by Caterpillar Logistics Services, which will handle Massey-Ferguson and Perkins warehousing. The principal part of the agreement involves the redevelopment of 70 acres of former Massey-Ferguson land in the main Trafford Park area. Varity is selling 30 acres to Asda for a shopping development, with the development corporation acquiring the rest. Varity and the corporation have negotiated an agreement with Amec Properties for phased redevelopment of the site, starting next year.</p>

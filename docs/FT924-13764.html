			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Heseltine points to way out of recession MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, put the task of improving UK manufacturers' competitiveness at the heart of his industrial strategy yesterday. His comments were part of the government's response to criticism of yesterday's pit closures announcement. He defined the prime goal of the strategy as enabling industry to 'compete in an increasingly competitive world'. He added: 'That means we have to search for the opportunities for lower costs and for more effective products.' His remarks followed criticism by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British industry, who said business was frustrated at the lack of a thought-out industrial strategy. Pointing to the present level of subsidies for British Coal of Pounds 100m a month, Mr Heseltine criticised those calling for legislation to prevent the closures. He said such a move would 'make our manufacturing base less competitive'. 'If you are arguing that I should subsidise the coal industry, then you have to argue that that is the best use of national resources,' he said. 'If you are trying to make British industry competitive, which is the only way out of this recession, then helping them to contain their costs - possibly even to reduce their costs - is a significant part of that process.' Describing the industrial and economic case for rationalisation as 'unanswerable', he said that savings to electricity consumers of Pounds 300m  -applied uniformly - implied 'householders' electricity bills up to around 3 per cent lower than would otherwise have been the case'. Governments had always tailored domestic coal production to the scale of demand, he argued. Mr Heseltine made little attempt to disguise that the announcement comes at a particularly difficult time for the government. The 30,000 job losses will swell the growing ranks of the unemployed, while the Pounds 1bn cost of the proposed redundancy payments comes with the public-sector borrowing requirement threatening to spiral upwards. The timing may also make for a vituperative passage of the paving bill for coal and rail privatisation through its committee stage in the House of Lords. Ministers had confessed to not relishing the prospect even before yesterday. Mr Heseltine said he had hoped to inform MPs of the closures in a parliamentary statement next week, but had changed his plans in the light of widespread 'leaks and speculation'. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, called on Mr Heseltine to intervene to halt the closures. It was 'a bad energy strategy and a worse economic policy,' he said. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, described the closures as 'a fatal body blow' that would increase Britain's trade deficit.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Alameda County Board of Supervisors has proposed to increase a countywide  tax by up to $8 to help bail out the county's trauma care system. The system is  "financially punishing the three participating hospitals," said Don Perata,  chairman of the Board of Supervisors. "With this kind of support, no hospital  gets rich providing trauma care, but we will finally have a solid program." The  tax plan would provide $4 million a year for the trauma centers, set up to  treat victims within the first critical hour of injury.  </P></p>

Washington will  continue to put pressure on Islamabad not to encourage terrorism  in the state. This was conveyed by the U.S. assistant secretary  of state for South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, to a 12-member group  of Congress-I MP's [Members of Parliament] during their meeting  in New Delhi today. She agreed that a solution to the Kashmir  issue should be found by India and Pakistan bilaterally within  the framework of the Simla Agreement.    Briefing newsmen, Mr. V.N. Gadgil and Mr. Hanumanthappa said  it was agreed that India and the United States should continue  their dialogue to remove misunderstandings and misconceptions.  The Congress-I MP's told Ms. Raphel that in Kashmir the  political process could not be revived because of Islamabad's  continued support to terrorists. She agreed that some hired  persons were used by militants in the Hazratbal Shrine incident.  The MP's told her that Kashmir should not be treated as a  communal problem as Pakistan is trying to make out. Other  members of the group included Mr. M.M. Jacob, Mr. Sushil Kumar  Shinde, Mr. S.S. Ahluwalia, and Mr. Indrajit.    During her meeting with the home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan,  Ms. Raphel reiterated that the United States will continue to  urge Pakistan to stop aiding and abetting terrorists operating  in India. She conveyed her government's appreciation for India's  transparency in Jammu and Kashmir. Ms. Raphel said the main  objective of her visit is to clear the misunderstandings created  recently and to place Indo-U.S. relations on a sound footing.    The home minister said that certain statements from  Washington have adversely affected the ground situation in Jammu  and Kashmir. He emphasized that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral  part of India and the Indian people will not tolerate attempts  to undermine the nation's territorial integrity.    Earlier, during her meeting with the head of the American  Division in the External Affairs Ministry, she discussed the  issues on which there are some differences in the positions of  the two countries.    Ms. Raphel also met a member of the National Human Rights  Commission, Mr. Virendra Dayal. Mr. Dayal told her that respect  for human rights is central to India's ethos and traditions and  the country is determined to uphold these values.    The Clinton administration's offer to Pakistan in return for  a freeze on its nuclear weapons program includes supply of not  only F-16 fighters but also P-3 antisubmarine warfare planes.  This has been reported by the NEW YORK TIMES. PTI quotes  analysts in Washington to say that the proposed plan will not  require Pakistan to abandon its nuclear program. On the other  hand, the analysts are of the view that the plan would  legitimize Pakistan's nuclear program so that it could be used  as a lever against India.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Warning of 14% rise in food prices FOOD and drink prices might rise by up to 14 per cent at the end of the year following the fall in the value of the pound, the Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said yesterday. It explained that there was likely to be a sudden rise in prices of ingredients because EC farm prices would be changed on January 1 - when the European single market takes effect - to take account of the devaluation of sterling. 'We had hoped that the price increases could be phased in after January 1,' the federation said.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A GREAT YEAR TO ZAP BUGS, FIRM SAYS  </P> <P> To most people, the zzzzt from their back-yard bug zapper spells the demise of  another flying pest. To David Blotnick, it's the sweet sound of success.  </P> <P> Spring in many parts of the country was damp and the summer has been hot, very  hot: perfect conditions for a multitude of flying insects.  </P> <P> "It has been a good season," said Blotnick, executive vice president of DeJay  Corp., which supplies the United States, Australia and Japan with more than  750,000 bug zappers a year.  </P> <P> "We couldn't ask for anything better," he said last week.  </P> <P> In the corner of DeJay's East Tennessee plant hang several dozen finished  products. Some have been there since the plant opened two years ago.  </P> <P> "It's our best way to see how they do in the field," Blotnick said.  </P> <P> Bug zappers attract bugs with a fluorescent light. Circling the light is a grid  that zaps the bugs with an electric charge as they try to reach the light.  </P> <P> The plant has about 150 workers on three assembly lines, making six bug killers  a minute. The zappers, sold under the brand name Stinger, range from $20 to  $60, depending on size.  </P> <P> "We can't build enough merchandise this year," Blotnick said.  </P> <P> He said the zappers last indefinitely, though the bulb probably needs replacing  every two or three years.  </P> <P> In the off-season, the workers make transformers, which power the grids, for  the bug killers.  </P> <P> In another section of the plant, where the transformers are tested, one can  hear the familiar zap of the bug killers.  </P> <P> Blotnick says the seasonal appeal of the product is well understood by DeJay, a  family-owned business based in Holbrook, Mass., and founded in 1964.  </P> <P> William Blotnick, David Blotnick's father and president of the company, said  DeJay started out making consumer electronic products, particularly children's  phonographs that were popular as Christmas presents.  </P> <P> "We were looking for a product to fill the season," the elder Blotnick said.  </P></p>

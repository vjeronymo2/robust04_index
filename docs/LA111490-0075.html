			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications.  </P> <P> Lockheed's Jet-Makeover Plum: Lockheed Corp. is helping Japan Airlines upgrade  and refit its older jets.  </P> <P> Burbank-based Lockheed will benefit in two ways: It will gain access to JAL's  aircraft maintenance technology, and the contract puts it in a good position to  win future aircraft orders. In the meantime, the company may be riding the  wings of a new trend of airlines giving aircraft state-of-the-art make-overs  rather than purchasing new planes in a time of economic uncertainty. Japan  Economic Journal  </P> <P> Out of Kitchen, Into Supermarket: While it's old news that supermarkets are  luring customers from restaurants, what's new is that they are now recruiting  restaurant managers, cooks and chefs. The workers are saying au revoir to their  eateries and bonjour to Vons, Publix and other chains as they opt for higher  wages, better benefits and shorter hours. The move to beef up supermarkets'  food service departments is essential, as the departments account for about 10%  of sales -- more than $3 billion last year. Restaurant News  </P> <P> Bright Spot at Sears: Overall, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. may still be in a  retailing slump, but two of its new formats are booming. The Women's Store and  Men's Store have been pleasant surprises. A senior executive vice president  said that, in addition to the new format, Sears has been selling more apparel  because of changes at the competition. When Dayton Hudson bought Marshall  Field, Sears was able to grab about 20 of Field's buyers, who are "showing  Sears some interesting things." Second, as J. C. Penney tries to move its image  upscale, consumers of moderate-priced goods seem to be moving to Sears. St.  Paul Pioneer Press  </P></p>

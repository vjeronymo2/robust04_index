			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Ucatt may delay ballot for leader THE BALLOT for a new general secretary of the Ucatt construction union could be postponed following the election of a leftwing majority to the union's executive council. The new executive will decide on Monday whether to press ahead next month with the postal ballot for a successor to the general secretary, Mr Albert Williams, who is due to retire. There was some uncertainty within the union yesterday about what the executive council changes would mean. It is still possible that one of the three candidates elected on a leftwing stand could form an alliance with the two existing 'establishment' members. The changes and uncertainty, together with the allegations of ballot-rigging and other irregularities which have plagued Ucatt for years, come at a bad time for the union as far as construction pay talks are concerned. An initial offer of 4.7 has been rejected by the union, and it is not clear whether the negotiators will still have a mandate. The switch in political control of Ucatt could significantly affect voting patterns at the Trades Union Congress in Glasgow in September.</p>

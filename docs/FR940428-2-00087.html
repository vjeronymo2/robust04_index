			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased operating cycle will not result in a channel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistical allowance which exceeds the margin which exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the current Technical Specification and the licensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis Safety Analysis. This margin, which is equivalent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(7) Loss of Power Undervoltage and Degraded Voltage Relays:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Technical Specifications specify that the Loss of Power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (undervoltage and degraded voltage) relays be calibrated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested at a refueling interval; that the undervoltage alarm be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibrated at a refueling interval, and that the undervoltage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (station blackout) input to Auxiliary Feedwater be calibrated at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling intervals. It is proposed that the surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency be revised from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the undervoltage and station blackout relays were found to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be within specification at each of the refueling outage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the old relays have been replaced with relays from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different manufacturer whose drift characteristics are expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be superior, extending the surveillance interval by several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months will not significantly increase the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously analyzed has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Past test results provide reasonable assurance that the relays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will perform in an acceptable manner for an extended operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle. With the installation of the new relays, whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance will surpass the old relays, it is concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant will perform within its design basis for an extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle. Therefore, the possibility of a new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the new relays will surpass the performance of the old  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relays, there is reasonable assurance that a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in the margin of safety has not resulted from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended operating cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(8) Over-pressurization Protection System (OPS) and Control Rod  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection System (for use with Low Parasite (LOPAR) fuel) Trip:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated will not occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over-pressurization protection system and the LOPAR trip system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This necessitates a change in the LOPAR Technical Specification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trip setpoint from 350  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F to 381  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle has been performed based upon historical test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data. Based on this analysis, a change to the Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifications is required. Sufficient margin exists between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Analysis limit and the proposed Technical Specification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit to accommodate projected channel uncertainty over a 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month operating cycle. A statistical basis exists to assure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective action will occur to prevent Safety Analysis limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from being exceeded. Thus, there will not be a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in the probability or consequences of an accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon a statistical analysis of past historical test data it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been demonstrated that reasonable assurance exists to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclude that Safety Analysis limits will not be exceeded over a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 month operating cycle. The proposed Technical Specification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits provide margin with respect to the Safety Analysis limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and confidence that appropriate plant protective response will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident from that previously evaluated from being created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to the Technical Specification limits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being made to assure that the previously established margin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains the same between plant protective function set points and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Analysis limits. This margin is based upon an evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of past historical test data and analytical methods for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projecting instrument channel uncertainty over a 30 month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margin of safety has been preserved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(9) Condenser Evacuation System Activity Monitor (R&hyph;45):]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Condenser Evacuation System Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R&hyph;45) be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this radiation monitor is relatively new a degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty is introduced by extending the surveillance interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by several months. However, the setpoint for automatic diversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is set some what conservatively. It is established sufficiently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high to avoid spurious actuations and yet sufficiently low so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that diversion and alarm can occur should a step increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radioactivity level occur. Under these circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable departure from the setpoint can be accommodated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the monitor will still perform its intended safety function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continued monitor operability is important and malfunction would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be detected by monthly checks during the extended operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle. Thus, despite the introduction of a new monitor, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability of R&hyph;45 to tolerate drift in addition to monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator checks, leads to the conclusion that an extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle will not result in a significant increase in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability or consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously analyzed has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monthly checks would identify abnormal operating characteristics,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should the instrument fail to perform its intended function. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the event of tube rupture with a reactor coolant system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radioactivity concentration corresponding to 1% defective fuel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resultant site boundary dose would be within 10 CFR [part] 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits should the monitor fail to perform its function (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]). In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternate means of alarms to indicate a tube rupture event are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. Thus, the possibility of a new or different kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this monitor is not necessary to mitigate releases below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory limits, it does provide the earliest of a steam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generator tube leak. In this regard, continued instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation is important. Continued instrument operability would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be verified by the monthly checks in an extended operating cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(10) Service Water Inlet Temperature Monitoring Instrumentation:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

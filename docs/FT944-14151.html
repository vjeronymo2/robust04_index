			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Root out terror in your areas, US tells Arafat Washington yesterday called on Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, 'to root out terror in the areas he controls'. On the eve of President Clinton's departure for the region, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said last week's bus massacre in Tel Aviv was targeted not only at Israelis but 'aimed at destroying Palestinian aspirations'. 'If peace brings nothing but more terror,' he said, 'the process of reconciliation cannot be sustained. Palestinians more than anyone will suffer. It is imperative Chairman Arafat fulfil his responsibility to root out terror in the areas he controls. The same courage he demonstrated in making peace must now be shown in fighting the enemies of peace.' The US appeal came as Palestinian officials said in Cairo that they rejected claims by Israel's foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, that the two sides had agreed on methods for combating Islamic attacks on Israelis. 'We did not agree, as they said, on fighting anybody. We agreed the cycle of violence and counter-violence harms the peace process,' said Mr Saeb Erekat, Palestinian negotiator. The PLO has said it will not crack down on the Hamas resistance movement and risk civil war. The PLO said yesterday the two sides had failed to make any progress in talks on releasing Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners or lifting the Israeli closure of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, steps Mr Erekat said were vital to show Palestinians there was 'genuine peace'. Israeli officials said their security forces were continuing arresting Hamas activists across the still Israeli-occupied West Bank. In Gaza, Mr Mahmoud Zohar, a Hamas spokesman, called on Mr Arafat to protect his life and those of other Hamas leaders from Israeli attacks. Mr Clinton's trip will take him to Syria, the first visit by a US president in 20 years. Mr Christopher held out the hope that an Israeli-Syrian peace would leave 'no place for terrorists on Israel's borders'.</p>

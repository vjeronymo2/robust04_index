			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Youths playing with smoke bombs apparently unleashed a fire that swept across  300 acres in San Bernardino County, and 250 acres were burned in Riverside  County, which was hit last week by a 7,840-acre fire that was nearing full  control, authorities said. Another blaze that blackened 203 acres on the edge  of Sequoia National Park over the weekend was brought under control. Witnesses  told officials they saw three youngsters playing with the fireworks north of  San Bernardino, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Lindsay Maierhofer. There  were no immediate arrests, she added, saying the fire charred 100 acres of the  San Bernardino National Forest and 200 acres of county land. "The temperatures  are hot and the terrain is very difficult," Maierhofer said. (Related story,  Part II, Page 1.)  </P></p>

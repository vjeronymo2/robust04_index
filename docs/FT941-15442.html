			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Sharp correction continues in the Pacific Rim Wariness over the recent surge in share prices prevailed among investors, and the Nikkei average lost ground for the first time in seven trading days on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index shed 216.62, or 1.2 per cent, to 18,577.26. The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 7.96 to 1,503.47, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.03 to 1,241.61. The Nikkei rose to a day's high of 18,823.38 in the morning and fell to a low of 18,548.75 just before the close. Arbitrageurs unwound long positions in late morning trading, and strong selling pressure came from corporate investors, wanting to prop up profits ahead of the March book closing. Traders, however, said that the downside was limited due to expectations of further buying from foreign investors, and investors and dealers were reluctant to hold short positions. Many analysts expect fund managers to shift out of south-east Asia and into Japan. Mr Geoffrey Barker at Baring Securities said that 'on a risk reward basis, Japan, which massively underperformed last year, is the pick', adding that although the rewards in investing in Tokyo may not be substantial, the risk of a market collapse was low compared to other Asian markets. Volume totalled 430m shares, against 451m. Declines outscored advances by 556 to 472, with 152 issues unchanged. Foreigners supported Sony, which gained Y100 at Y5,880. However, other high-technology issues were weaker, with Matsushita Electric Industrial off Y10 at Y1,560 and Fujitsu falling Y15 to Y871. Banks were lower on profit-taking by corporate investors. Most corporations have traditionally held shares of their main creditors as a symbol of maintaining a long term relationship. However, low dividends and falling profits have increased the burden for companies in maintaining such portfolios. Mitsubishi Bank dipped Y10 to Y2,700. Reports that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone will test run its multimedia service in Japanese households next year prompted buying in telecom related stocks. NTT put on Y4,000 at Y814,000, but KDD, the international telecom company, lost its morning rise and finished Y100 down at Y11,200. Ishihara Sangyo, the country's largest producer of titanium oxide, added Y24 at Y355 on mounting expectations of a rise in titanium oxide prices. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 81.18 to 20,583.66 in volume of 54.6m shares. The index posted its eleventh consecutive gain in spite of increased profit-taking. Roundup The region saw a further substantial correction, but analysts commented that the cause was related to profit-taking and a return to levels seen before the Christmas rally. A London-based broker said Hong Kong could well fall below the 10,000 level, given that the market's traditional correction from high levels was normally around 30 per cent. Yesterday's selling, he added, came mainly from retail investors in Japan and the US. However, in London trading yesterday afternoon, buyers returned and the unofficial index closed an indicative 204 up at 10,380. HONG KONG fell sharply for the third consecutive day on broad selling pressure. The Hang Seng index lost 536.22 to 10,176.51 in turnover up to HKDollars 9.2bn from HKDollars 7.8bn. Among the major movers during the session, HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 103, while Bank of East Asia lost HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 55. Hutchison was also active, dropping HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 31. In the property sector, Sun Hung Kai Properties slipped HKDollars 5 to HKDollars 61.50, Cheung Kong HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 41.50 and Hongkong Land HKDollars 1.40 to HKDollars 23.90. TAIWAN skidded down on news that the government was not, after all, going to seek direct shipping links with China. The weighted index lost 363.81 to 5,851.40 in turnover up to TDollars 104.5bn from Wednesday's TDollars 88.5bn. Sentiment was also affected, said Mr Kevan Crosthwaite of HG Asia in London, by further signs that diplomatic ties with the country were being weakened, in preference to securing stronger links with mainland China. KUALA LUMPUR remained weak on forced selling and trading restrictions, which included a ban of buying by some stockbroking firms, with the composite index closing down 37.05 at 1,029.17. The cheaper levels attracted some foreign funds in the afternoon but the market remained overwhelmed by selling pressure. SINGAPORE took another broad tumble for the third day this week, with the Straits Times Industrial index dropping 65.45 to 2,194.86. Analysts expect the impact of several liquidity-tightening measures in Malaysia to continue to affect investor sentiment in both countries. Malaysian shares traded over the counter account for much of Singapore's daily turnover. MANILA fell for the fifth straight day, with weakness elsewhere in the region dampening sentiment. The market index shed 76.85 to 2,901.15. JAKARTA was lower as local investors cashed in their positions, with some late bargain hunting preventing a sharper correction. The market index fell 13.20 to 572.02. AUSTRALIA was unsettled by the falls in other regional markets and the All Ordinaries index fell 18.1 to 2,177.5 in heavy volume of 462.3m shares. NEW ZEALAND traded in a tight range before the NZSE-40 capital index finished 11.37 lower at 2,235.97. SEOUL continued to trade against the trend, ending higher for the third consecutive session as waves of blue-chip buying overwhelmed selling by the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation Fund. The composite stock index rose 12.35 or 1.4 per cent to 898.66.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE ASIAN MARKETS HAVE PERFORMED  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Yesterday's move (%)  Move since Jan 1 (%)  1993 rise (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kuala Lumpur         -3.5                -19.3               98.0 Bangkok              -3.3                -14.5               88.4 Hong Kong            -5.0                -14.4              115.7 Singapore            -2.9                 -9.6               59.1 Manila               -2.6                 -9.2              154.4 Taiwan               -5.9                 -3.6               79.8 Seoul                +1.4                 +2.8               27.6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

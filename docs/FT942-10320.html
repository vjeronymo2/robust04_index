			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Japan's regret for the past Sir, Your article, 'Japan withdraws atrocity claim' (May 7/8), has some historical misunderstanding. It says that Japan 'lags far behind Germany in voicing official regret for the past', but from 1954 to 1976 Japan paid enormous amounts of reparations to its neighbouring 12 countries. It even paid reparations to prisoners of war of 14 countries in 1955 (including the UK). Germany never paid 'official reparations' to its neighbouring countries (except victims of 'scientific' experiments). It only compensated victims of the holocaust and Germans who suffered persecution. It is difficult to compare what Nazi Germany and Japan did during the war. Nazi Germany was dominated by an organised violence; the Nazi party tried to liquidate its political opponents, several races, cultures and civilisations. This is quite similar to the Stalinist Soviet Union (I have never heard that the Soviet Union apologised or paid reparation to its victims). The 'crimes' Japan committed were colonisation, killing of civilians and ill-treatment of POWs. Every country has at some time committed these 'crimes' (I have never heard of any country apologising for committing these 'crimes' except Japan). It is difficult to evaluate and reflect history because, unlike natural science, it does not have only one answer. If we changed our viewpoints, there is a totally different dimension. I am not defending militarism, but I want to defend our ancestors who died in the war.

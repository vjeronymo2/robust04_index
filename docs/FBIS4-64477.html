			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Manfred Kimmerle: "EEC -- EC -- Maastricht </F> (EU): Nothing But Illusions!"]    [Text] The signing of the Masstricht Treaty came at a time  that saw an increasing number of international conflicts and  economic and political change in East Europe. The treaty has  not produced a monolithic construction and particularist  interests continue to be represented. As for the granting of  special rights, Denmark and Great Britain occupy first place.  The FRG alone has accepted all the disadvantages that this  "work" entails.    With the Treaty of Rome -- which founded the EEC (25 March  1957) -- the participating countries only expressed their  determination to proceed with integration in a way that would  secure economic and social peace. Since 1973, the community has  expanded its membership from six to 12 in three stages. As the  number of countries increased, problems of coexistence began to  develop, something which was overlooked in what amounted to  integration euphoria..    Other countries are also seeking admission; East Europe also  harbors expectations. At the moment there is even talk of a  two-speed Europe. There is nothing that illustrates the  difference between desire and reality better. In the end, the  number of timetables [for admission] will be the same as the  number of members.  <H5>  Sickness in the Head and in the Limbs </H5>   If we view the pillars of the Maastricht Treaty, that is,  the  Treaty of Rome with its expansion to include economic and  monetary union as well as social policy and environmental  protection, a future European foreign and security policy, as  well as cooperation in the field of domestic and legal policy,  then the only verdict is: With the definitive participation of  Kohl's government, a treaty has come into being that has finally  transformed our republic from being a sick state into an infirm  one.    The requirements for a common economic and monetary policy  --  in the form of high-level price and monetary stability, a public  finance situation that is tolerable in the long term, the  favorable development of markets, balance of payments positions  and labor unit costs -- cannot be realized in the long term too.  The imbalances between the economies are too great, and that is  reflected in frequent exchange rate adjustments, that is,  devaluations, since the fall of 1992. In addition, Italy and  Great Britain have left the exchange rate mechanism. This then  constitutes the path leading to a common currency.  <H5>  The Structural Engineering Is Wrong </H5>   A further example of harmonization that exists only on paper  is that of developing common social standards. This is another  area in which Great Britain has accorded itself a special  status. This means the sanctioning of substantial differences  in social systems; Great Britain has obtained competitive  advantages for itself that further endanger Germany's position  as a center for industry. Companies are already transferring  production facilities to Scotland or England.    The conditions for cooperation in domestic policy and legal  policy as well as the explanations in the final act are a farce  from the German viewpoint. The FRG, which is subject to  enormous immigration pressures, has been left to cope by itself.  Of course, this changes nothing about the domestic political  failure of the established parties on this crucial issue.    The chancellor wants to be celebrated as Europe's architect.  It is poor master builder who erects a building without making  sure that the structural engineering is in order.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edgar Augusto Sanchez for the "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] Eastern Colombia has the most extensive guerrilla  presence, especially in Santander, Norte de Santander, and Cesar  Departments. Despite an Army deployment in that area,  guarantees for the normal development of the electoral process  have not been given.    The Army troop deployment was prompted by harassment by  subversices of nearly 80 towns in Santander, southern Cesar,  Bolivar, northeast Antioquia, and Arauca Departments. In  Santander, seven National Liberation Army fronts, six  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia fronts, and one Popular  Liberation Army front are surrounding towns like  Barrancabermeja, Puerto Wilches, Sabana de Torres, Rio Negro,  Provincia de Velez, and Provincia de Garcia Rovira. In (Chima)  and (Guacota) municipalities in Provincia Comunera, where  subversives had never gone before, members of the 46th Front  asked local residents not to vote, and some voter cards were  stolen. Political groups have begun to abandon southern Cesar  Department, especially Agua Chica, in response to the violence.  Nearly 200,000 members of the Army and the Santander Department  police force are trying to stop the guerrilla incursion. .    [Begin General Manuel Jose Bonet, 2d Brigade commander,  recording] I ask the people to go to the polls and vote. The  best way people can fight is to vote and show the enemies of the  fatherland that society will not be frightened. [end recording]    However, political supporters in the department are afraid  and very aware of the few guarantees available to them as they  have stopped traveling to the countryside. People here  represent 60 percent of all voters.    [Begin recording] [Carlos Plata, candidate for Congress] The  Army offered us nine sites to land, but when we arrived here, we  could not land in four of them.    [Police Commander Hugo Lozano] We have provided security to  all politicians who have requested it. [end recording]    By increasing the number of personnel in the entire  department, the Army and the police hope to overcome the  difficult obstacles presented by the guerrillas during the  electoral process.</p>

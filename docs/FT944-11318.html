			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Observer: Bottoms up Having done its best to absorb the financial and image-tarnishing consequences of the Schneider property collapse, Deutsche Bank is meeting as many of the claims of contractors on the property magnate's uncompleted buildings as it feels are justified. One demand will probably prove too much, however, even for a bank doing all it can to repair the damage caused by Jurgen Schneider's wayward business decisions and subsequent disappearance. For the company which supplied champagne to Schneider - in rather large quantities - has now presented its bill. Observer suspects it has about as much chance of collecting its money from Deutsche as of squeezing a popped cork back into a bottle of bubbly.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As of 2 April, it has become definite that Japan  will send a group of about 40 election monitors to the Republic  of South Africa to monitor its election of a constituent  assembly. The elections are scheduled to start on 26 April.  According to a concrete plan, a group of about 20 monitors  which is mainly composed of Foreign Ministry personnel and  civilian volunteers who participated as monitors in the  Cambodian elections will be sent as independent government  monitors. Moreover, five monitors will be sent by  nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and 15 others will go as  individual participants in the UN Observer Mission to South  Africa (UNOMSA).    The first group of these monitors to be sent by the  government will leave for South Africa on 8 April. Other  members will leave around the middle of this month. Moreover,  Japan also plans to send an advisory election monitoring group  composed of Diet members.    With regard to the upcoming dispatch of the election  monitors  group, the government does not plan to apply the UN Peacekeeping  Operations (PKO) Cooperation Bill. In this connection, the  election monitors to be sent will not participate directly in  the UNOMSA, but they will act while maintaining close contacts  with the UNOMSA.</p>

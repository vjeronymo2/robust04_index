They are the first group of a contingent of 600 soldiers who  will be flown to the region, Igor Kashin, spokesman for the  Russian airborne troops, said on Monday.    He said 400 of them will be deployed in Serb Krajina and the  rest in Sarajevo.    All of them are volunteers drawn on a contract basis for six  months.</p>

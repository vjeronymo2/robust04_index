			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONABLE APPOINTMENTS  </P> <P> The James Watt legacy lives on in spite of George Bush's campaign promise to  put the very best people to work on his environmental agenda. Bush has made one  outstanding appointment in William K. Reilly as chief of the Environmental  Protection Agency. But his selections for other critical natural-resource jobs  raise serious questions about the Administration's pledge to safeguard the  nation's parks, wilderness and coastline.  </P> <P> Two former aides to one-time Interior Secretary Watt have been chosen to  positions overseeing 70% of the public lands. James Cason has been nominated as  assistant secretary of agriculture in charge of the U.S. Forest Service and Cy  Jamison has been selected to be director of the Bureau of Land Management in  the Department of the Interior. Cason is a former Oregon real estate developer  who constantly ran afoul of the nation's environmental organizations as deputy  assistant secretary of the interior. Jamison was a legislative liaison for Watt  and for the past eight years has been an aide to Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.)  assigned to the House Interior Committee staff. Marlenee has a reputation as  one of the most anti-wilderness members of Congress.  </P> <P> Other critical Interior Department appointments include two Midland, Tex., men  who are close to the oil industry -- one of them a friend of President Bush  going back to his oil days -- and two Indiana political supporters of Vice  President J. Danforth Quayle. None of these appointments reflects any  distinguished environmental credentials.  </P> <P> Bush's friend is Martin L. Allday, a member of a prominent Midland law firm and  past chairman of the Oil, Gas and Mineral Section of the State Bar of Texas. He  was a young attorney in Midland when Bush moved there following World War II.  Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan has announced Bush's plan to name Allday  as department solicitor, the secretary's chief legal adviser.  </P> <P> Also from Midland is Barry A. Williamson, former owner of an independent oil  and gas development company. He had worked since February, 1988, at the  Department of Energy before being chosen by Lujan to run Interior's Minerals  Management Service, which is in charge of the department's offshore oil  program. In the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill, Williamson issued a press  release announcing offshore drilling rigs could expect "a stepped-up series of  surprise visits" from department inspectors. There's nothing like having  advance notice of a surprise visit.  </P> <P> The Quayle supporters are Frank A. Bracken, chairman of the board of Ball-InCon  Glass Packaging Corp. in Muncie, who was chosen to be undersecretary of the  Interior, and James M. Ridenour, head of the Indiana Department of Natural  Resources 1981-88, to be director of the National Park Service, replacing  California's William Penn Mott. Bracken's previous resource experience was  service during 1969-72 as a legislative counsel at Interior. Ridenour was an  executive of Great Lakes Chemical Corp. before taking the Indiana resources  job, where he clashed repeatedly with environmental groups over commercial  developments on state lands.  </P> <P> Reilly, at the Environmental Protection Agency, is an important anchor for the  Bush environmental policy. But Bush's determination to build a strong  environmental record will be severely undermined -- or doomed -- unless he also  has managers at Interior and the Forest Service who are willing to put  conservation and protection of the nation's dwindling natural estate ahead of  the business-as-usual practice of commercial exploitation. The new appointees  should be given a chance to demonstrate such a commitment, but so far, the  record is not encouraging.  </P></p>

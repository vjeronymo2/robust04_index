			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHESS  </P> <P> "Enemies: A Chess Story," by Mitch Berman (Oct. 7), states that Kasparov and  Karpov will play "in front of television cameras." I thought the condition was  that no TV cameras could tape the actual tournament.  </P> <P> Am I wrong?  </P> <P> Besides that, did I enjoy the article? Yes! I took notes on your descriptions  of the players and their moods, when you sat down with them to play. The way  they are as persons came across nicely.  </P> <P> DAN ERLAND ANDERSEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> Mitch Berman replies: TV cameras did film the match, and snippets were  broadcasted nationally every Sunday evening on ABC's World News Tonight. The  entire course of the match was also shown live on closed-circuit monitors  throughout the New York hotel, where the first half the world chess  champtionship was held.  </P></p>

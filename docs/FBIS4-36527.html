			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister said this morning that Faysal  al-Husayni would have to move to Jericho if he planned to run  autonomy affairs. Surprisingly enough, Faysal al-Husayni did  not reject the suggestion. Here is what he told Qol Yisra'el's  English department correspondent Dick Winter:    [Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] I do not know if it was  meant as a threat. In any event, if Mr. Rabin means that I  should leave my home here and move to Jericho, I do not think it  is a statement [preceding word in English] he should have made.    [Winter] What about your office?    [Al-Husayni] If he was referring to the offices, I have an  office right here, where I conduct activities that are part of  the peace process [preceding two words in English]. I will  pursue that part which is not related only to the interim  agreement. If, however, he was referring to activities  pertaining to the Palestinian rule, then we can discuss the  matter and see how to proceed. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], who is in Okinawa to campaign  for local election candidates, gave a news conference at the  prefectural government building on 7 April at which he commented  on the two recent U.S. military aircraft crashes.    He said: "I will report the facts of the accidents and the  Okinawan people's sentiments to the prime minister, the foreign  minister, and the director general of the Defense Agency. The  government will take appropriate measures."    He indicated the government and the ruling parties might  discuss suitable responses, including the suspension of flights  by F-15 fighters and CH-46 helicopters until the causes behind  the two accidents were determined.    During the news conference, Kubo talked about issues  affecting Okinawa, such as the proposed bill on the utilization  of returned military land, and the plan to combine the Okinawa  Development Agency, the Hokkaido Development Agency, and the  National Land Agency. He also gave his views on national  political developments and the realignment of political parties.    The fact he chose to mention the accidents involving U.S.  military aircraft is interpreted as an indication that the  government and the ruling parties may take action.    Commenting on the accidents at the news conference, Kubo  expressed his shock, saying: "It has been reconfirmed to me  that the overwhelming concentration of bases here in Okinawa 50  years after the end of the war forces residents to endure  anxiety and fear."    He said: "We have to deal with this problem as a major issue  for Japan as a whole."    He also said, though, that the chances were slim of the  proposed bill on the utilization of returned military land, a  key issue on Okinawa, being passed in the current Diet session.    He said: "There is very little time left in the current  session and legislation will be difficult."    However, he also said: "I think the (military land use  system) is an important issue because it concerns land use after  military land has been returned, and the revitalization of local  communities."    He pledged to work for the submission of the bill by Diet  members [most Japanese bills are submitted by the government]  during the current Diet.    Commenting further on the planned integration of three  government agencies, including the Okinawa Development Agency,  Kubo said: "Its role in assisting the national and local  governments will remain important for some time to come."    This was taken as an indication that he believes it would be  premature to integrate the three agencies.    Talking about the mayoral elections in the cities of Okinawa  and Gushikawa, the purpose of his visit, Kubo said: "These are  important elections which will affect the forthcoming  simultaneous local elections, and the upper house elections and  general elections next year."    He stressed that the SDPJ would do its utmost to retain  reformist control of the prefectural government at the  gubernatorial election in November.</p>

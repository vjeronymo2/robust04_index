			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASIAN-AMERICAN MAY BE IN LINE TO HEAD UC BERKELEY;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THE NO. 2 ADMINISTRATOR AT UC IRVINE, A NATIVE OF CHINA, IS REPORTED  TO BE A LEADING CANDIDATE FOR THE CHANCELLORSHIP.  </P> <P> Chang-Lin Tien, the No. 2 administrator at UC Irvine, is a leading candidate to  become chancellor of UC Berkeley and thus the first Asian-American to head a UC  campus, sources said Sunday.  </P> <P> Tien, a 53-year-old native of China, is an internationally recognized expert in  mechanical engineering and a former vice chancellor for research at Berkeley.  He joined the faculty there in 1959 and went to UC Irvine as executive vice  chancellor in 1988.  </P> <P> If chosen, Tien, who once faced segregated drinking fountains in Kentucky,  would head a prestigious and argumentative campus that has been under fire for  its policies on admission of Asian-American students and hiring of minority  faculty.  </P> <P> Tien declined to comment Sunday on reports from several sources that he is  among the finalists recommended to UC President David P. Gardner by a search  committee. "Any comment has to come from the university," Tien said.  </P> <P> Gardner must recommend one name to the UC Board of Regents to succeed Ira  Michael Heyman, who is retiring after 10 years as chancellor. The regents are  to meet Thursday in San Francisco to discuss the location of the first of three  proposed new campuses.  </P> <P> Ron Kolb, a spokesman for Gardner, said Sunday that if the Berkeley  chancellorship is to be taken up at that meeting, the matter would have to be  added to the agenda by this afternoon.  </P> <P> "The fact is that President Gardner has not made a decision or a  recommendation," Kolb said.  </P> <P> Faculty and administrators at Irvine said Tien's candidacy had been rumored  there for months. Several were disappointed by the reports and said they would  consider the departure of the administrator and scientist a great blow to UC  Irvine.  </P> <P> "To be quite truthful, I'm kind of disappointed if he's leaving," said John  Liu, co-chairman of Irvine's Asian Faculty Staff Assn. "I think he's brought  dialogue that the campus has long needed and he has shown a sensitivity to a  lot of pressing issues that the administration hasn't always done."  </P> <P> Liu and others said Tien has played a leading role in recruiting minority  faculty to the Orange County campus and instituting a new "international  breadth requirement." As of next year, all incoming freshmen will be required  to take one class on a multicultural issue and one class on an international  issue.  </P> <P> Kathy Jones, associate vice chancellor at Irvine, said Tien has also taken  steps to give faculty a greater voice in managing the campus.  </P> <P> Tien was born in Wuhan and fled to Taiwan in 1949 after the Communist takeover  on the mainland. He graduated from National Taiwan University and earned a  master's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Louisville.  </P> <P> "When I got off at the bus station, I saw drinking fountains that said 'whites  only' and drinking fountains for 'colored,' " Tien told The Times in a 1988  interview. "I was very disturbed. I didn't know which fountain I was supposed  to use."  </P> <P> Tien went on to earn a second master's degree and then a doctorate in  mechanical engineering from Princeton University.  </P> <P> Tien has won a distinguished teaching award from Berkeley, a Guggenheim  fellowship, and prestigious scientific awards from West Germany and Hong Kong.  He also held the Berlin Chair in Mechanical Engineering at Berkeley.  </P> <P> As a consultant for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, he  helped solve the problem of keeping heat-shielding tiles from falling off U.S.  space shuttles in the early days of the program.  </P> <P> Tien lives with his wife, Di-Hwa, in University Hills.  </P></p>

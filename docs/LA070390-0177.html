			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MCKEON WANTS OUT AS MANAGER  </P> <P> Padres Manager Jack McKeon says he has notified team Chairman Tom Werner that  he would like to give up his job as manager and work solely as the club's vice  president of baseball operations.  </P> <P> "I told him my desire is to do just one job," McKeon said.  </P> <P> "Manager was never a longtime goal of mine, anyway. I think a lot of people  realized I wouldn't be managing here after this season. I was happy to help  out, and I always said when a time came that I didn't feel like managing, I'd  let them know."  </P> <P> Werner did not make any promises to McKeon during their meeting Monday, but he  said he would evaluate the situation and consider the request.  </P> <P> "Obviously, things are not going like we want, but we don't want to be forced  into making a decision, either," Werner said. "We'll see what happens and go  from there."  </P> <P> McKeon's decision comes on the heels of the Padres' worst slump of the season,  in which they have lost 14 of 19 games.  </P></p>

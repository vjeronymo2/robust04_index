			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (7): Landlords are flavour of the month again - The property recession has been a boon for the rental market / The rental sector THE RENTAL sector has profited from the recession in the UK property market. Many people rent short-term, for employment or other reasons. But in the past few years many Britons have been renting longer-term until they feel that the time is right to buy - agent's books are full of such people waiting and watching the market for signs of a pick-up. Before the second world war it was common to rent one's house, in London and sometimes also in the country. After the war the habit withered - except for sportsmen renting shooting lodges, hunting boxes or houses for Ascot or Wimbledon. It was also an era of high income tax: it made sense to be a buyer and to gain as much mortgage relief as possible. Meanwhile landlords fretted that they would never be able to eject tenants from their property because the law would protect them. So they let to companies or to foreigners, who were unlikely to go to court. Gradually the rental market dried up. In the recession it revived. The new law of assured shorthold tenancies, allowing landlords to regain possession at the end of the lease, has given them the confidence to let to the British. As the buying and selling of houses slumped, renting grew. A recent survey by the University of York with the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA) reported that lettings increased in 1992 by an average 13 per cent per agent countrywide, with the largest increase of 21 per cent in the inner London suburbs. Seventy per cent of the lettings were assured shortholds. While UK interest rates were high, potential house-buyers found that their monthly rent was cheaper than a hefty mortgage, and that it was easier to wait and see how far prices would drop. The reverse was that would-be sellers became landlords, waiting for prices to rise again. So did those hit by Lloyd's liabilities or other debts, who decided that the rent income from a pied-a-terre was more valuable than the luxury of a second home. The York/ARLA survey found that about one fifth of private landlords in 1992 were people unable or unwilling to sell their properties. Now it is back to the 1930s. Renting is established again as a flexible alternative that makes sense for landlords and tenants. A glance at the property advertisements shows how many more homes are for renting, in town and country. The UK is slowly catching up with the rest of Europe, where it is normal for city-dwellers to rent rather than buy. But the fall in interest rates and prospect of rising house prices changes the picture for those wanting to buy and settle down. They do not want to miss the turn of the market, knowing that month by month their payments (on an old-fashioned repayment mortgage) cut the building society's share of their house. For first-time buyers, who can obtain a 5 per cent mortgage if they shop around, it makes sense to buy now. From rental savings they should be able to recoup their deposit and buying costs in 18 to 30 months, says Yolande Barnes, of Savills. That is one of the reasons behind her bullish view of the property market. All those who have been waiting five years are now eager to make their move. The problem is, Where? At present there are not enough houses on the market. And until the new private landlords who would not or could not sell their properties change their minds, the stranded tenants wanting to escape to their own place as owner-occupiers will have to carry on renting. In London the hard core of tenants that all cities have is growing, Ruth Gray of agent John D. Wood reports, as foreign banks and multinational companies look for places to house the extra staff they are bringing to London. In Arthur Road, Wimbledon, SW19 she could quickly arrange a let at Pounds 2,600 a month for a family with Shell, for a house which had 'sat' for a while at Pounds 2,400. This was in August, which is letting agents' busiest time, before school starts. Whether tenant or landlord, you need a good agent - unless you make the arrangements yourself. For new landlords that is not advisable, as the law has many traps. And even if you are experienced or the tenant is an old friend, it is easy to make a mistake or fail to keep up with the changes in the law. Do you, for example, know who normally should pay the new council tax? Glentree Estates' (081-458 7311) useful guides for landlords and tenants point out that it is the tenant or permitted occupier - even though the tax is a modified form of the old rates, when the landlord often paid. ARLA (071-734 0655) is the only professional organisation devoted solely to lettings. It has about 600 member offices across the UK, which are growing by 10 a month. Its code of practice is what all letting agents should follow, stressing the duty of care to the tenant as much as to the landlord. Good agents will check references, prepare the inventory, see that the rent is paid on time (and passed on to the landlord), pay the tax at source that the Inland Revenue may require from landlords abroad, and deal quickly with the sudden failure of the boiler and the other hassles of living in a house or flat one does not own. Since October 1992 all ARLA members have been bonded by professional indemnity insurance to protect the tenants' deposits and the landlords' rents. They must also have been in the letting business for at least two years and, like solicitors and accountants, have separate client accounts for the monies. For letting property they can take commissions only from the landlord.</p>

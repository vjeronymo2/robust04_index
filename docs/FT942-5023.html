			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Survey finds UK conveyancing best in Europe - Legal Briefs International property investors believe the UK has a better legal system for property transactions than other European countries. They also prefer the UK's tax structure, according to a survey conducted by Gallup for international property consultants Richard Ellis. The survey of 68 institutions - which included Japanese life companies, French insurers, German open funds, Dutch pension funds, Hong Kong entrepreneurs and UK institutional investors - found that half of those questioned thought the UK's conveyancing system was preferable to others in Europe. Only 16 per cent thought it was worse. On the tax system, 44 per cent thought the UK was better than its European rivals. UK chartered surveyors were also rated more highly than their European counterparts by 71 per cent of those questioned. But more than one-third of those surveyed thought London's status as a world financial centre had declined in the past five years and 26 per cent believe it will decline further.</p>

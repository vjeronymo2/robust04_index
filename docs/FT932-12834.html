			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Photos 'cut card fraud by 99%' AN EXPERIMENT in etching photographs and signatures on cheque guarantee cards cut fraud by nearly 99 per cent, the Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday, John Gapper writes. The bank, which has 1m customers, said it intended to be the first British bank to offer them all the chance to have photographs on cards. The laser etching of photographs and signatures on the reverse of the bank's Highline cheque guarantee, cash dispenser and debit cards, costs about Pounds 1.20 per card, about three times the cost of conventional cards. The bank said an experiment, covering 30,000 customers in 39 branches over the past 18 months, had reduced the anticipated level of fraud from about Pounds 45,000 to three cases involving a total loss of Pounds 494. The bank said it would not charge for such cards - though it charged customers Pounds 2 per card in the pilot scheme. It believed it could increase its gain by lowering the processing costs per card. TSB has been testing putting photographs on customers' credit cards through thermal imaging - a method adopted nationally by the National &amp; Provincial Building society. Mr Alex Barr, Royal Bank's card services development manager, said it was also considering trying to put photographs on its credit cards. It would have to negotiate this with First Data Resources, which makes its credit cards. He conceded that the bank's competitive advantage would probably be eroded if other banks adopted similar tactics. At present most other financial services companies are working together on new card fraud prevention measures. Mr Barr said 31,500 of the 100,000 customers offered cards in the pilot had applied for them. The bank expected a similar proportion of all its customers to take up the offer, but they would be free to choose.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: European prices firm on hopes of monetary easing European government bonds put on a solid performance yesterday, closing more than  1/2 point higher on renewed hopes for European monetary easing. However, turnover was thin as continued uncertainty kept investors at bay. 'After the volumes we're seen recently, it felt like a Friday in August,' said the chief trader at a US bank in London. In addition to Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting - the last before the central bank's Easter break - market participants are awaiting this week's raft of key economic and inflation data in the UK and the US. 'No one wants to take positions ahead of numbers and events that can't be predicted,' said Mr Andrew Roberts, a gilts analyst at UBS. UK gilts were given an early boost by lower than forecast February producer price data, which reignited hopes of another cut in base rates. However, follow-through buying fizzled out, with most dealers reluctant to take on large positions ahead of this week's data releases. 'The market didn't move much because everyone and his dog are waiting for the retail sales number,' said Mr Roberts. February retail sales figures are due to be announced tomorrow, along with the February unemployment report, average earnings and unit wage costs. 'A bullish retail sales number could really hurt the short end,' he added. 4 Moreover, dealers are nervous ahead of this week's US inflation data, which some fear might prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary reins again. US February PPI data are due to be released today and CPI is due tomorrow. The June long gilt future rose  1/2 point to close at 110. German bunds ended the day just below their highs, supported by Friday's public-sector wage settlement, upbeat comments from Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer over the weekend and the moderate outcome of Sunday's elections in Lower Saxony. All eyes are on today's announcement of the Bundesbank's latest securities repurchase agreements. Dealers were calling for another round of variable-rate repos, with the minimum rate slipping another three to five basis points from last week's 5.94 per cent. 'The D-Mark is strong against the dollar and we have had two very encouraging wage settlements (in the engineering and public sectors) - this should make the Bundesbank feel more confident on the inflation outlook,' said Mr Stephen Hannah, head of research at IBJ International. The June bund future on Liffe was up 0.57 points at 96.85 in late trading. French bonds tracked bunds higher, shrugging off the Bank of France's decision to leave its key intervention rate unchanged at 6.10 per cent. The March notional bond futures contract on Matif rose 0.92 points to 125.56. Italian bonds also strengthened slightly, with the June BTP future rising some 0.75 points to 110.55. However, the market remains clouded by political worries ahead of the March 27 - 28 elections and analysts say the Italian 10-year yield spread over bunds could widen further amid political jitters from the current 320 basis points gap. US Treasury bonds registered moderate losses yesterday as dealers turned pessimistic ahead of February prices data to be released later in the week. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower at 91 3/8 , with the yield rising to 6.936 per cent. At the short end, the price of the two-year note slipped  3/32 to 99 11/32 , as the yield climbed to 4.963 per cent. The market opened on a weak note as traders failed to carry through on a rare burst of buying during the final session of last week. Many were betting that today's report on producer prices would spell more trouble for the market, which has plunged in recent weeks on inflationary fears and jitters over the direction of US monetary policy. February's consumer price index, due out tomorrow, loomed as yet another obstacle. Evidence of accelerating inflation in either report would support the view that the Federal Reserve was poised to boost short-term interest rates for a second time, perhaps after its March 22 policy-making session. Against this backdrop, many traders chose to stay on the sidelines. Activity remained light and tended to be on the selling side. No confidence was to be derived from the day's only important economic news. The Federal Reserve of Atlanta said its manufacturing diffusion index jumped last month, while the prices-paid segment of the report showed a worrisome uptick.</p>

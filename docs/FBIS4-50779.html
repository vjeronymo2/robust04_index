			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 22 (XINHUA) -- King Norodom  Sihanouk of Cambodia will meet Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan  on May 25 in Beijing, the Khmer Rouge -- or Democratic Kampuchea  -- representative office here said today.    Khieu, who will be attending a round-table meeting on  Cambodia in Pyongyang from May 27 to 30, will fly to Beijing on  May 25 to attend a dinner hosted by Sihanouk, said a spokesman  for the office, who added that Khieu had thanked Sihanouk for  the invitation.    Meanwhile, Sihanouk today urged the four participants in the  round-table meeting in Pyongyang to agree upon an unconditional  and immediate ceasefire and to pledge their commitment to unity.    In a letter to the participants sent from his residence in  Beijing, Sihanouk said that he is not trying to "impose a  political solution to the bloody and tragic `problem' existing  between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic  Kampuchea Party."    "I would like to implore you to accept, while in short of a  political solution, an unconditional, immediate, total and  irreversible ceasefire across Cambodia," said Sihanouk.    He suggested that the ceasefire be supervised by an  inter-Cambodian commission of control, to be formed of a number  of army officers from both sides of the conflict, and headed by  two neutral generals representing Sihanouk himself -- General  Oum Mannorine and General Buor Holl.    He also called on the participants in the round-table  meeting  to sign a declaration pledging themselves to national unity,  territorial integrity based on the 1963-69 border, and "our  national ideals of peace, national unity and progress."    "We will continue to do all we can to find a peaceful and  political solution to the 'problem' which still divides the  Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic Kampuchea  Party," said Sihanouk.    The four participants in the round table meeting will be  Chea  Sim, president of the Cambodian National Assembly, Norodom  Ranariddh and Hun Sen, the two co-prime ministers of the royal  government, and Khieu Samphan, president of the Democratic  Kampuchea Party, or the Khmer Rouge.</p>

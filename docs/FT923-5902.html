			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Zealand to resume wool trade with Russia NEW ZEALAND is resume its wool trade with Russia after nearly two years' of severe disruption because of the former Soviet Union's financial problems. For more than two decades it had been one of New Zealand's most important customers for carpet-making wools. Mr Pat Morrison, chairman of the New Zealand Wool Board said yesterday that it was hoped that about 16,500 tonnes would be sold this season. This confirms reports in May that the Russians would buy wool worth some NZDollars 100m (Pounds 27m) this season, following the signing of new credit agreements with the West. Initial shipments of 1,400 tonnes of wool worth NZDollars 11m are being assembled for export in Auckland and Christchurch. Mr Morrison said payment arrangements for the initial deal had been completed on a very satisfactory commercial basis. Most of the wool will be sold from the board's stockpile, which grew to 580,000 tonnes, from 1989 largely because of the withdrawal of Russian and Chinese buying, before China resumed buying in large quantities last year. Traders had been wary about making deals with the former Soviet republics because of delays in settling an estimated NZDollars 350m of unpaid bills. This included NZDollars 270m owed to the Dairy Board and NZDollars 60m to the ANZ Bank, which underwrote a wool deal last year. Mr Morrison said getting the trade going again had been a priority, although it would take time to see it return to former buying levels. The Soviet Union used to buy about 10 per cent, or 25,000 tonnes of New Zealand's total wool production, and was viewed as the country's most consistent buyer.</p>

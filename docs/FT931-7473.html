			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Unipart bucks recession with 29% rise to Pounds 19m UNIPART, the motor parts and accessories manufacturer and distributor, increased pre-tax profits in 1992 by 29 per cent to a record Pounds 19.1m, despite one of the most severe recessions in the UK motor industry's history. The results reflected productivity improvements and cost base cuts which have been in progress since Unipart first began adopting Japanese-style working practices in 1989. Pre-tax profits in 1991, also a year of deep recession for the motor industry, had risen by 17 per cent. However, a decision to end trade union recognition last spring played a significant role in the profits rise from 1991's Pounds 15.4m, according to Mr John Neill, chief executive. Sharp productivity increases, as high as 30 per cent in the contract distribution division, had been achieved last year, said Mr Neill. The company, which employs 3,800 people, has four principal operating companies with a combined turnover last year of Pounds 661.4m, up 17 per cent on the comparable Pounds 566.7m. Other contributors to the record results were the coming on stream last year of Premier Exhausts, a new Coventry-based catalytic exhaust and catalytic converter plant supplying Rover and Honda; more than Pounds 2m saved by Unipart's own form of Japanese 'quality' circles, and new products such as car immobilisers.</p>

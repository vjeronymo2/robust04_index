			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Jacobs agrees Pounds 22m bid for Embassy John I Jacobs, the shipping company headed by Sally Line founder Mr Michael Kingshott, has made a Pounds 22m recommended offer for Embassy Property, a group in which he has a 6 per cent stake. Mr Kingshott, chief executive, said he intended to build up Jacobs as a shipping, transportation and property group, but Embassy's two largest developments are likely to be sold off to generate cash. The company is also close to finalising the purchase of the car delivery business of BRS, a subsidiary of NFC, the logistics company. Jacobs is offering one new share for every 65 Embassy shares. This represents a 35 per cent premium to Embassy's share price before it announced negotiations for the deal. At Jacobs' closing price on Friday, this represented 1p per Embassy share, compared with the company's stated net asset value of 0.84p. However, Mr Kingshott said: 'There is unrealised value to come out of the development properties, the properties are all valued at cost and there are Pounds 16m of tax losses'. The transaction would enlarge Jacobs' issued share capital by 51 per cent, leaving Mr Kingshott with 12 per cent of the company, down from 15 per cent. The deal is contingent on shareholders' approval and 90 per cent acceptances. He said buying into a company with property management expertise would help develop the group's existing assets, such as warehousing. In addition, Jacobs plans to move into port ownership. It already manages Thames Europort. The company also announced that Sheertrucks, purchased from Mr Kingshott and partner Mr Colin Williams last June, achieved profits of Pounds 678,300 in the year to October. As a result, the vendors will receive the maximum deferred consideration of Pounds 1.1m in new shares priced at 50p.</p>

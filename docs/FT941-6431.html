			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Indonesia contract loan The US Export-Import Bank has announced an offer of a Dollars 34.3m subsidised loan to a US company seeking a contract from Indonesia's state-owned dredging company, PT Rukindo, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. If the US wins the contract, it will be the first subsidised loan begun under the Clinton administration, which is formulating a more aggressive export finance strategy. The financing backs a bid by Ellicott Machine of Baltimore to sell dredging equipment. Mr Kenneth Brody, Eximbank chairman, yesterday said the bank was pushing support for small companies such as Ellicott. It will match, in this case, the offer by a competing Norwegian company, whose name Eximbank could not disclose, of long-term loans at low interest rates.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Renault in first step to reduce Volvo links Renault, the French state-owned car group, has sold more than half of its shares in the parent company of Volvo, its first move to reduce the complex cross-shareholdings between the two groups since the collapse of their planned merger last December. The block of 3.2m Volvo B shares was understood to have been sold to a number of institutional investors at SKr655 a share, valuing the deal at close to SKr2.1bn (Pounds 177m). Renault said the decision to cut its stake in AB Volvo, the parent company of the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, from 8.27 per cent to 3.45 per cent was financially motivated. It said its voting rights had only been reduced from just under 10 per cent to 8.76 per cent. The sale had not affected its shareholdings of 45 per cent in Volvo's truck activities and 25 per cent in its car operations. However, the share disposal follows the dismantling of several agreements between Renault and Volvo over the past few weeks. Renault and Volvo entered into a far-reaching alliance in 1990, but plans for a full merger collapsed in December in the face of a shareholder revolt in Sweden. Renault said its shareholding in AB Volvo was not covered by the 1990 agreement, and since the collapse of the merger it had been treating the stake like any other investment. The timing of the sale had been determined by the strength of Volvo's share price, which had risen by around 70 per cent since the merger plan collapsed. Renault has made an estimated capital gain of about FFr750m (Pounds 84.45m) from the share disposal. Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said the sale of Renault's stake would not affect the continuing dialogue between the two companies over areas for collaboration. However, industry observers said the sale confirmed that the two companies intended to maintain only a limited commercial relationship. 'This is an almost inevitable step in the parting of the ways,' said Mr Bob Barber, motor industry analyst at James Capel in London. 'In due course we will probably see the cross-shareholdings unwinding, but it is hard to predict how quickly.' Last month Renault announced it had agreed with Volvo to dissolve combined purchasing and quality control organisations. Volvo's B shares continued to rise yesterday, gaining SKr17 to close at SKr692. Editorial Comment, Page 15 Opel loses court battle, Page 16 Lex, Page 16 Renault begins breakup, Page 20</p>

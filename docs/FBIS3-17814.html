Boris Suprugin, addressing the Russian president's  commission  on citizenship on Tuesday, urged Moscow to take action against  what he qualified as discrimination against Russian speakers and  to link Russia's economic assistance to Kazakhstan to this  problem.    He also insisted that the Russian government press for dual  citizenship for North Kazakhstan's Russian-speaking community,  which accounts for about 80 percent of the region's population,  and for Russian speakers throughout Kazakhstan. Since the  Kazakh government refused to allow Russia to open its consulates  in Kazakhstan, Suprugin asked the Russian Foreign Ministry to  set up consulates in Russian regions bordering on the Central  Asian republic to make it easier for its ethnic Russians to  receive Russian citizenship.    Suprugin demanded an official status for Kazakhstan's  Cossack  community to make it "a state structure that would make it  possible to keep on tenterhooks states which violate the rights  of their Russian population."    He said Russia should not have signed with Kazakhstan an  agreement to lease from it the Baykonur spacecraft-launching  complex for $115 Mn, for the complex had been built at Russia's  expense. He expressed the apprehension that a similar agreement  would be made on the 200-km section of the Trans-Siberian  Railway running through Kazakhstan.</p>

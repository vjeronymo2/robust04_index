			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranci Fini, Italian National Alliance </F> secretary, by Bruno Vespa in Rome on 25 April: "Fini: `Nothing  To Do With Mussolini'"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Vespa] What did this  date [25 April] mean for him in past years.    [Fini] April 25 is the date when the end of the war is  remembered. Historically, it is right to interpret it in this  way rather than as the day when one side prevailed over the  other. April 25 was not the end of the civil war. It was the  end of the war.    [Vespa] Have you ever considered it a day of celebration for  the "others"?    [Fini] At times, yes. In the recent past, yes.    [Vespa] How did it feel?    [Fini] Anything but pleasant. I was saddened by the fact  that after so many years there was still in Italy a desire to  maintain certain barriers of discrimination and hatred.    [Vespa] The "National Alliance manifesto" states that there  is no need to rewrite history. However, the impression could be  gained that there is a desire to level out history, to set all  historical events on the same plane....    [Fini] No, history cannot be leveled out, nor can it be  rewritten. History does not embody two versions of the truth.  The fact is that ever since the time of Julius Caesar history  has been written on the basis of the principles of the winners.  Remember? Vae victis: Woe to the defeated.... Instead,  history should be written solely on the basis of historical  fact. However, we cannot expect this task to be performed by  politicians, especially at a time such as this, when there is a  Left that is trying to exploit 25 April as an opportunity to  recoup for the results of the recent general election. [passage  omitted]    [Vespa] You talk as a political leader. But do all your  followers think the same way?    [Fini] Yes. Or, at least, the fringes on the Right that do  not want reconciliation are in a tiny minority.    [Vespa] What do you feel about the nostalgia of some  youngsters who did not experience fascism and the civil war but  who identify with fascism or even Nazism?    [Fini] If you are referring to the so-called Nazi-skins, I  condemn them absolutely, with no hypocrisy and no attempt to  understand or justify them.    [Vespa] How much importance do these people have within your  party and your movement, among your voters?    [Fini] None.    [Vespa] What do they expect from you?    [Fini] I think that they hate me sometimes. [Fini ends]    I reminded Fini of the sad episode the other day in Genoa. A  schoolgirl went to see "Schindler's List," Spielberg's  extraordinary movie about the deportation and extermination of  the Jews. Some youngsters started laughing, mocking the Jews,  and some sang Nazi-fascist songs. This prompted two girls to  walk out, for which they were suspended by their principal,  because they had not been authorized to leave the theater. This  latter aspect of the episode was given wide coverage in the  press. But I asked Fini whether he was not disturbed by the  former aspect, namely, the fact that some of our children feel  no dismay or compassion about one of the most ghastly tragedies  in history. This question too elicited a laconic reply.    [Fini] It shows that youngsters must be taught history. But  this must not be done in such a way that history appears like  propaganda, still less so in such a way that it becomes a  subject of everyday political struggle.    [Vespa] Are you convinced that there is only one history  that  can be told?    [Fini] History must be told in accordance with the facts.    [Vespa] How many years must pass before 25 April really  becomes a day of celebration for everyone?    [Fini] We hope that next time, which will also be the 50th  anniversary of the end of the war, it will be the 25 April of  reconciliation.    [Vespa] What will you do in the months ahead to ensure that  this happens?    [Fini] We will continue with a series of initiatives  designed  to make people understand the reasons for a reconciliation.  Keep in mind that I am not talking simply about the calm  detachment that the historian must have with regard to events  that took place half a century ago. Reconciliation is a  practical matter, too, and should be expressed through  ceremonies in which everyone can pay tribute to the fallen.  There also must be an elimination of all the discriminations  that now separate the victors from the vanquished. For instance,  how many people know that in Italy the partisans were rightly  granted the title of fighters, whereas the same status was  denied to the soldiers of the Social Republic? They were denied  the same rights, even though they were soldiers too, just like  those of the other side.    [Vespa] Should the fact of having been on what historically  has been defined as the wrong side have certain consequences?    [Fini] No, it should not have any consequences, because in a  democracy it is the voters alone who judge merits with regard to  becoming government forces or not. It cannot be historians.  And I am entirely convinced that the vote at the end of March  (including the large vote for the National Alliance) was not a  vote for a return to the past, for an apologia of fascism. It  was a vote for change, precisely because the Italian people now  realize that there is no longer a fascist threat. I disagree  with the theory propounded by the German historian Nolte, that  the National Alliance could give rise to a soft form of fascism,  a democratic form of fascism. Fascism was born, lived, and died  with its founder, Benito Mussolini. Today the National Alliance  is a modern, European Right. A social Right that certainly  expects respect for history, but that certainly does not  represent a continuation of fascism and neofascism. [Fini ends]    This is the first time that Fini has broached these issues  analytically. It is the first time that he has replied to  Nolte, the most authoritative living expert on Nazism, arguing  the arbitrariness of asserting even the remotest connection  between nostalgia for the black shirts and the vote in March  that will bring the MSI [Italian Social Movement] into the  government for the first time in Republican Italy. Fini was  flippant on the subject of the gestures and significant dates of  the dictatorship. When I asked him what he does when he sees  the fascist salute, he said that he replies with a quip. And  when a sound engineer, placing his microphone ready for a  television interview, told him that he too was born 3 January  and I observed that it is an embarrassing date for a birthday,  Fini explained to him that it was on 3 January 1925 that fascism  became a totalitarian regime, with Mussolini's famous speech in  the "deaf and gray chamber."    "Don't worry," he added. "No important acts by the new  government can take place on 3 January, or on 28 October."    We went down to the bar. Fini picked up the tab.    [Vespa] How are your finances?    [Fini] Good: The 5 million votes earned us a reimbursement  of 8 billion lire from the state. Further funds will come from  the European elections. We must manage the money well; it has  to last some years, because the annual funding of the parties is  over. Nevertheless, we are confident. Do you know how many  employees we have throughout Italy? A mere 40. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOFFREY AT CAL STATE L.A.  </P> <P> Letter writer Peter Bretnall raised some important issues about the "expensive  association" of Cal State L.A. and the Joffrey Ballet (Saturday Letters, Sept.  9). He is correct in saying that under Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds expenditures  have "run amok" while "real-world problems continue to fester." Unless James  Rosser, Cal State L.A. president, has changed his management style, Bretnall  would be refused any information on the cost involved, although the campus and  the system are spending state funds.  </P> <P> While many of us in the campus community would ordinarily be pleased to have  Cal State L.A. associated with a splendid dance company, we deplore the fact  that none of the faculty leadership was consulted or even informed, although  the agreement could have a serious negative impact on the university's academic  programs.  </P> <P> The Joffrey facilities are by far the most lavish and carefully constructed on  our campus -- with the exception of the president's suite. Our faculty,  students and staff have suffered for years from the conditions of our  classrooms, faculty offices and restrooms.  </P> <P> Does the state really have enough money to pay for such an extravagant  arrangement to satisfy the chancellor's and the president's need for public  attention?  </P> <P> HOWARD P. HOLLADAY  </P> <P> President of California Faculty Assn. chapter at Cal State L.A.  </P></p>

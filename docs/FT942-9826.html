			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Start-up costs behind Pounds 6.6m Flextech deficit Flextech, the USM-traded cable and satellite television group, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.62m in the 12 months to December 31 1993 on turnover of Pounds 6.77m. The operating loss of Pounds 6.26m was mainly due to start up costs associated with the launch of the Family Channel and duplicated satellite costs. Directors said comparisons with 1992 were not possible as the group was reorganised via a reconstruction in July of that year. Flextech has undergone further changes in the current year, including the merger with the European programming assets of United Artists European Holdings. Under the deal, Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television operator, becomes Flextech's controlling shareholder. The enlarged company becomes the biggest cable and satellite channel operator in the UK after British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite broadcaster in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. Flextech has since added terrestrial broadcasting to its portfolio through the acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in HTV, operator of the Wales and west of England Channel 3 licence. Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman, said income from satellite and cable subscribers would form the most important revenue stream over the next few years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Jordanian-Palestinian Meetings"] </F>   [Text] Based on a number of joint principles and amid a  climate highlighted by common objectives, the  Jordanian-Palestinian meetings began yesterday in order to  formulate policies and define mechanisms that would achieve the  aspirations of the two fraternal peoples. Those two fraternal  peoples are united by hopes and pains as well as the unity of  blood, geography, and joint history.    There is no doubt that these meetings, which were permeated  by a true fraternal spirit, are of special importance. Great  hopes are pinned on these meetings that are accompanied by  serious challenges. All this should lead to practical results  that respond to the requirements of this decisive stage and  support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on their  national soil in the occupied territories.    These bilateral talks acquire further importance because  they, in themselves, represent the first link in a series of  links to achieve required Arab coordination. This is especially  since it has become clear that Arab coordination is useless  without previous coordination between the Jordanians and  Palestinians on whom and on whose course at this level  everything aspired in terms of broader Arab coordination depends.    While defining mechanisms that can translate principles into  practical steps, the Jordanians and Palestinians are not  forgetting that they are holding talks at a very critical stage;  that is, when the initial requirements of the peace process have  to be met. This give these talks a responsibility that cannot  but be shouldered, especially since any expected result from  these talks will strengthen the Palestinian stand and improve  the PLO's negotiating stand.    As we wager on these talks and aspire for results that serve  both Jordan and Palestine, we are confident that the deep sense  of serious responsibility and high awareness of the dangers of  this stage and its possible consequences will push these talks  toward achieving the desired success and whatever else that can  reinforce the two peoples' cohesion and strengthen the  deep-rooted relations between the two fraternal peoples.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / NZ fraud probe into ex-auditor general New Zealand's Serious Fraud Office is investigating the financial affairs of the former auditor general, Mr Jeff Chapman - the country's top financial watchdog - after a highly critical report found he owed the Audit Office more than NZDollars 156,000 (Pounds 60,700). Mr Chapman resigned two months ago citing personal financial difficulties. Mr Bruce McCallum, the government-appointed investigator, found that Mr Chapman had insufficient regard for the prudent expenditure of public money. Mr McCallum said that 'as the government's own financial watchdog it was a pity that he did not follow his own advice'. The report said that much of the money owed to the department was due to overseas travel. Mr Chapman travelled first class and stayed at the best hotels and one trip alone cost NZDollars 101,000. He had also claimed NZDollars 14,000 in expenses and had cash advances of NZDollars 48,000. Mr Chapman says he disputes two-thirds of the debt, as well as large parts of the report. Mr Paul East, the government minister in charge of the Audit Office, said he was shocked and disappointed by the revelations which showed a 'very unfortunate state of affairs'. Mr East said that appointment procedures relating to senior civil servant positions would be reviewed.</p>

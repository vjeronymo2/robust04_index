			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Kirin forecasts earnings decrease KIRIN Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, yesterday blamed appraisal losses on its securities holdings for an unexpectedly poor pre-tax profit forecast of Y32bn (Dollars 256m) for the first half to end June, down from Y36.9bn last year. Sales for the six months are estimated to have risen by 5 per cent to Y610bn, with beer sales about 4 per cent higher by volume, and demand strong for its growing range of pharmaceutical products. However, like many Japanese companies, Kirin has traditionally bolstered profits through stock sales, and the collapse of Tokyo stock prices has forced it to book appraisal losses on its short-term holdings of stocks. Kirin has regained market share over the past year, after having suffered in a Japanese beer market flooded with new products. The company faces steep marketing costs for its own new products, and is concerned about the impact of a mild Japanese summer. For the full year, Kirin is forecasting sales of Y1,380bn, up from Y1,315bn last year, and a pre-tax profit of Y87bn, compared with last year's Y86.4bn, although a downward revision is likely if Tokyo stock prices remain weak.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Turnround at Osborne &amp; Little Increased margins and the lack of exceptional costs this time enabled Osborne &amp; Little, the wallpaper and furnishing fabrics concern, to report a turnround from losses of Pounds 802,000 to profits of Pounds 947,000 pre-tax for the six months to the end of September. Last year there was a charge of Pounds 1.2m relating to the sale of the French offshoot. Sir Peter Osborne, chairman, said the margins rise reflected continuing emphasis on cost control and the effect of sterling's devaluation. Group turnover rose 3 per cent to Pounds 9.13m, against Pounds 8.87m, which included Pounds 1.83m from discontinued activities. Earnings per share, helped by the purchase for cancellation of 300,000 shares, were 9.33p (losses 13.48p). The interim dividend is raised from 2p to 2.5p.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSH TO ATTEND CITIZENSHIP RITES  </P> <P> President Bush will participate at an outdoor naturalization ceremony for 3,500  new U.S. citizens at East Los Angeles College stadium on Sept. 16, Mexican  Independence Day.  </P> <P> Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said the President agreed to  appear in East Los Angeles after it was learned that virtually all of the  prospective citizens are of Mexican descent.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, organizers of the annual Mexican Independence Day parade in East Los  Angeles have moved the event up a day from Sunday, Sept. 17, in an attempt to  persuade the President to ride in the parade after the ceremony. The White  House so far has been silent on whether he might appear.  </P> <P> The events are part of the observance of Mexico's revolt for independence from  Spain, which was ignited by a shout of freedom -- El Grito -- by a priest,  Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, in 1810.  </P></p>

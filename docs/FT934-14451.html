			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Rate cut pressure grows EUROPEAN short-term interest rate futures continued to push upwards yesterday, signalling the belief that interest rates are due to slide, writes Peter John. December short sterling and D-Mark contracts traded on Liffe were both strong and the French contract traded on the Matif in Paris rose 10 basis points in early trade. The contracts go up on expectation of lower rates. They reflect the market's view of where three-month lending rates are moving ahead of the contract maturity dates in December. Short sterling has been firm all week and appears to have broken through a narrow trading range as belief solidifies that the UK government must cut base rates by at least half a point if the economy is to continue its recovery. The short sterling futures contract for December moved through 94.50 to close 12 basis points up at 94.57. There is also a growing body of opinion that some European countries, especially France and Belgium, will be forced to abandon attempts to link their currencies with the D-Mark by cutting rates and letting them find their own level. The French financial futures contract rose 14 basis points to 93.56 while the much more thinly traded Belgian contract added to a big rise on Thursday with a further 26-basis point rise to 91.51. That level indicated three-month money would be around 8.5 per cent in December. The Belgian three-month rate was at 10 per cent yesterday. The German D-Mark contract rose 4 basis points to 93.84. Bank of England operations were relatively comfortable yesterday. The Bank offered the money market an early round of assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.5bn which was later revised down to Pounds 1.3bn. Among the main factors affecting the market were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands which drained Pounds 504m from the system, Exchequer transactions which removed Pounds 445m and a rise in note circulation which took up another Pounds 675m. Partly offsetting these developments were bankers' balances above target which injected Pounds 145m into the system. The central bank bought Pounds 1.004bn of bills at the early round of assistance followed by a further Pounds 81m and late assistance of Pounds 110m.</p>

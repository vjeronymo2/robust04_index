			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIANS, ISRAEL AND MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> I applaud your editorial "U.S. Should Never Fear to Negotiate" (Aug. 22). A  peaceful solution is the only solution this country should pursue now that we  have the military power in place to negotiate from a position of strength.  </P> <P> But we (including the United Nations) should use this window of opportunity to  put into motion the resolution of whatever problems may have created this  crisis, or could cause it to simmer and threaten recurrence in another deadly  manner.  </P> <P> For openers, there is the matter of a peaceful resolution of the  Arab-Israeli-Palestinian problem, i.e., recognition of Israel's right to exist,  coupled with self-determination for the Palestinians. A militarized Middle East  bodes ill for the security of the area, so a plan for ultimate disarmament of  all nations in the area is essential. To insure the peace, at least during the  transition, a significant U.N. military presence would be essential. And to  address a major potential for future violence, the monarchies and dictatorships  should be encouraged to establish a timetable for the phase-in of democratic  governments.  </P> <P> BENNETT L. NEWMAN  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

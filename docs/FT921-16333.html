			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: FNFC Part of the reason for yesterday's 23 per cent recovery in First National Finance Corporation's shares was that its Pounds 34m pre-tax loss was not even worse. The worries, which prompted FNFC's share price to collapse by some 85 per cent between its peak last April and the end of the year, have proved unfounded. The company, whose name still brings back unhappy memories of the secondary banking crisis of the 1970s, does not look as though it is about to fall victim a second time. It has sufficient undrawn credit to meet debt repayments of Pounds 230m this year, and the rate of default by its borrowers has slowed. That said, new provisions last year were over 7 per cent of the loan book, more than three times greater than those of the clearing banks. With the housing market still depressed, they are likely to come down only slowly, so that a further loss can be expected this year. Though the company is making play on the scope for home improvement lending, there is limited room for organic growth until demand for consumer credit recovers. At some stage after the recession, earnings should snap sharply back into the black. The conservative valuation of FNFC's loan book may then allow some provisions to be clawed back. On that basis, the shares appear cheap at 37p; even more so against a net asset value - admittedly still falling - of 113p. The trouble is the turnaround will be a long time coming. Meanwhile there is no yield and there are plenty of recovery stocks offering a faster potential return.</p>

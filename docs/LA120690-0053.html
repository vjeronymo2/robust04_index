			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'END' AN HONEST SEARCH FOR SELF-ESTEEM  </P> <P> In 1976, Dyan Cannon won an Oscar nomination for her remarkable short film  "Number One," which showed how in early childhood we are made to feel guilty  and confused about natural functions, drives and needs. In a very real sense  her new feature, "The End of Innocence" (AMC Century 14), expands on those  concerns. It's as if Cannon -- the film's writer, director and star -- is  playing one of those children now grown up.  </P> <P> At the climax of "The End of Innocence," Cannon gets carried away in her  harrowing saga of a woman fighting to overcome a mental breakdown. She indulges  in some foolish and overly emotional exultation; even so, her film is  consistently a work of honesty and courage, deeply personal without being  literally autobiographical. It's unsettling in the best sense because it's so  easy to see yourself in varying degrees in Cannon's Stephanie, who strives her  entire life to please others in her hunger to be loved, only to end up with  nothing left of herself for herself.  </P> <P> In a series of swift and succinct vignettes Cannon traces Stephanie from a  child growing up in what seems clearly -- but is never directly stated -- a  volatile Jewish household. Very early on, Stephanie (played from ages 18 to 25  by the late Rebecca Schaeffer) learns to feel guilty about sex, yet in her  desire to be loved is seduced more easily than she could ever imagine.  </P> <P> By the time Cannon assumes the role, Stephanie is a neurotic, middle-aged  divorcee in love with a nakedly self-absorbed and callous younger man (Steve  Meadows) and working indifferently for her father (George Coe) at his lampshade  business. She is a constant pill-popper and pot smoker who seems to live on ice  cream bars.  </P> <P> Stephanie's inevitable crack-up and painful rehabilitation in intense group  therapy (overseen by a calm, controlled John Heard) is the stuff of TV movie  melodrama. What gives Cannon's histrionics as the now-raging Stephanie an edge  is that Cannon the writer and Cannon the director chillingly convince us that  the people nearest and dearest to Stephanie have never really paid any  attention to her.  </P> <P> You get the feeling that her shrill, vulgar mother (Lola Mason) as well as her  father have never thought about her or listened to her. They seem to regard  parenting as merely laying down rules and expectations and providing for their  daughter materially. Stephanie, both as a child and as an adult, doesn't seem  to exist as an individual for them.  </P> <P> "The End of Innocence" (rated R for language and adult themes), which features  Renee Taylor as a randy participant in the group sessions, has drive and  passion. The sense of desperation that permeates both Cannon's performance and  the all-too-heady note of triumph upon which the film ends suggests that for  people like Stephanie, who is not so different from the rest of us, the  struggle for self-esteem never is really over.  </P> <P> 'The End of Innocence'  </P> <P> Dyan Cannon: Stephanie  </P> <P> Steve Meadows: Michael  </P> <P> Rebecca Schaeffer: Young Stephanie  </P> <P> George Coe: Dad  </P> <P> Lola Mason: Mom  </P> <P> A Skouras Pictures release of an O.P.V. production.

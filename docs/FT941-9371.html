			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Heavy dosage of biotechnology flotations - The forthcoming launch of International Biotechnology Trust Now might not seem the best possible time to launch Britain's first biotechnology investment trust. After a flurry of biotechnology flotations, virtually all of which are currently trading at a discount to their issue price, UK investors' enthusiasm appears to be cooling. However, Mr Jeremy Curnock Cook, of Rothschild Asset Management, argues that the timing is perfect. 'The biotechnology sector as a whole is at least two and a half times undervalued compared with major pharmaceuticals companies in terms of the products in the pipeline. Competition for those new products is bound to increase, forcing up share prices in the near to medium-term.' To take advantage of the predicted upturn Rothschild's will next month launch the International Biotechnology Trust - a listed trust intending to focus on recently floated biotech companies. It is hoping to raise about Pounds 100m from a placing and offer for subscription of shares and warrants by Robert Fleming. About a quarter of the issue will be available for private investors. The trust will be managed by the same Rothschild's team that runs Biotechnology Investments, a 12-year-old fund now valued at over Dollars 200m (Pounds 137m). The team is headed by Mr Curnock Cook, who joined Rothschild's in 1987 after selling the biotechnology company he founded to Shell. He believes that now is the time to invest in the sector partly because of the downward pressure on drug prices caused by healthcare reforms, particularly in the US. 'In future, the major pharmaceuticals companies will have to rely on innovative new products, not price, to drive their profits. Yet when they turn to their own pipelines they look rather bare.' The top 10 quoted pharmaceuticals companies, which have a market value six times that of all the world's listed biotechnology companies, have 20 per cent fewer new products in clinical trials. Moreover, Rothschild's argues that the biotechnology companies tend to be developing innovative products with greater market opportunities than those in the pipelines of the established companies which are often refinements of existing products. However, partly because of this wealth of potential products the biotechnology industry faces a 'funding hiatus', according to Mr Curnock Cook. 'A huge amount of money went into the industry in 1991 with an explosion of flotations. The funds were spent getting a large number of products half way up the development ladder.' Now the companies need cash for the most expensive part of the process, the clinical trials. 'But the money won't come from the public markets and the pharmaceuticals industry is not going to start writing cheques at that level.' This is where the International Biotechnology Trust sees its opportunity. It plans to take stakes of between 5 and 10 per cent in companies which went public up to two years ago or intend to float within the next year. Although its investment would be limited to some Dollars 15m it would normally lead a syndicate of other investors. It will be looking for companies with strong technology and identifiable market opportunities but also with a low market valuation and some management weaknesses. 'Many of the companies which came to the market in 1991-92 were still in short trousers and are now suffering from holes in the management,' says Mr Curnock Cook. The companies in which the trust invests will have access not only to the 10-strong investment team - with experience in science, industry, finance and management - but also a distinguished panel of scientific consultants, including professors from Cambridge, Edinburgh and New York universities. The board of non-executive directors will include leading figures from the US biotechnology industry such as Mr Ted Greene, founder of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, and Mr James Grant, a former deputy commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration. The annual management fee will be 1.375 per cent of net assets with other expenses estimated at 0.28 per cent. Based on gross proceeds of Pounds 100m the total launch costs are expected to be 3.1 per cent. The trust will have a geographic spread roughly in line with the industry, 70 per cent of which is based in the US, and will have an initial life of at least five years. Although managed by the same team the trust will have little overlap with Biotechnology Investments, which has a large portfolio of holdings acquired earlier in companies' lives. The trust's individual investments will be bigger but should also be somewhat less risky. The prospectus will highlight the particular risks of investing in biotechnology, not least the extreme volatility of shares in the sector, but Rothschild's can point to the record of Biotechnology Investments. According to NatWest Securities this was the best performing UK-listed investment company in the venture capital and unquoted securities sectors in the five years to September 1993.</p>

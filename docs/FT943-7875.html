			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Vodka on rocks with bitterness: When the Stolichnaya factory is ailing, what does it say about Russia These are troubled times in Russia. Defence factories are at a stand-still, cholera and anthrax are spreading across the country and gangland-style executions have become commonplace. But if Russians have one special skill it is survival, and in these difficult days many have turned to the nation's traditional source of solace: one-shot glasses of chilled Stolichnaya vodka, followed by salty fish on a piece of rye bread. This week, even that sacred sanctum has been breached. Kristall, the factory which produces Stolichnaya, has been declared bankrupt by the government. 'This is absurd,' says Mr Vladimir Iamnikov, director of Kristall, puffing on a Marlboro cigarette and glancing at the bottles of Stolichnaya and 70 other hard liquors the plant produces, which decorate his office. Mr Iamnikov is convening by telephone other anti-reformist factory directors, and their supporters, to a war council to fight this latest piece of government perfidy. 'We are Russia's flagship vodka factory and vodka is the heart of everything which is Russian,' Mr Iamnikov rages. 'This bankruptcy proceeding is incomprehensible to us and to everyone else as well.' In fact, the government's Federal Bankruptcy Agency has started proceedings against Kristall because of the debts it has incurred. The agency, staffed by many market reformers, is eager to clamp down on inefficient state enterprises - Kristall is 51 per cent government-owned - and impose private-sector financial discipline. Bankruptcy proceedings act as an ultimatum: either the current management shakes itself up, or the concern's assets will be sold to private investors. With the announcement that Kristall is in the red, the bankruptcy agency's guerrilla war against Russia's ailing enterprises has hit the headlines as well as the heart (or liver) of Russia. One western banker says: 'Vodka producers have traditionally been more precious to the country than even huge, powerful companies like (energy company) Gasprom.' This explains why 'the Kristall affair' is taking on a significance greater than a single vodka factory with 1,000 employees would otherwise merit. It has turned into a test of the government's resolve in taking on factory directors who have become used to running their operations in old, inefficient Soviet fashion. Mr Iamnikov says his only problem is the febrile imaginations of the government's market reformers. His factory's debts - put at 7bn roubles by the bankruptcy agency - are reasonable, he argues. He admits that Kristall is operating at only 30 per cent of its capacity but says government taxes, which he claims amount to 92 per cent of his vodka's sale price, have hit demand. Mr Iamnikov concedes Stolichnaya faces tough price competition from cheaper foreign vodkas: costing 2,300 roubles in Moscow - a little more than a dollar - per half litre bottle, Stolichnaya is expensive by Russian standards. But Mr Iamnikov hints at darker motives behind the government's decision. 'They tell me I must sell off the recreation club for my workers to pay off part of the debt, but I know what they really want,' he says. 'They want to get their hands on the club so they can transform it into a casino and a place to meet pretty working girls. That's all these 'reforms' have brought us.' Government officials counter that Mr Iamnikov has to explain how a vodka producer in Russia can possibly lose money. 'Something not quite right is going on at that factory,' says Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy director of the state privatisation agency, parent organisation of the bankruptcy agency. 'It's one thing when a factory which produces widgets is declared bankrupt - we have hundreds of them in Russia which should be shut down. But vodka is a liquid asset in Russia. It's as good as money, because the market can never get enough of it.' State officials want to investigate why the factory has invested soheavily in gleaming new Italian production equipment, and question its high distribution and marketing costs. Mr Narad Sarkisian, the director at the bankruptcy agency responsible for Kristall, admits that the action taken against the plant is sensitive: 'For Russia, saying that Kristall is bankrupt has the same effect that the announcement that Mercedes had gone broke would have in Germany.' A former professor of aviation engineering with a degree in higher mathematics, Mr Sarkisian embodies the low-key, technocratic ethos of his agency and is perturbed by the public passion the Kristall affair is generating. He says that the state will first try to convince the factory's managers to 'act like real executives'. But if re-education fails, Mr Sarkisian says, 'we are the owners and we can do what we like: even fire the director or sell some of our shares.' Kristall, he is convinced, has potential to grow and become profitable. But to realise its strengths, the factory will need to do more than just adopt a hard-headed financial approach. Notwithstanding its traditionally cherished place in Russian life, Kristall, which sells 95 per cent of its output in Russia, is not only losing price wars with importers: the row over its impending bankruptcy is adding to a growing image problem. When Moscow's nouveaux riches visit the city's restaurants and night clubs, they are increasingly ordering Absolut, a Swedish vodka, rather than Stolichnaya and the truly au courant avoid vodka altogether. 'Newly rich people who want to prove that they can afford anything, prefer imported liquors,' Mr Iamnikov admits sadly. As western visitors leave his office he enjoins them: 'Drink Stolichnaya - not those inferior foreign whiskeys.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 KYODO -- China's most famous  dissident Wei Jingsheng was detained for yet another time Friday  [1 April] while returning to Beijing, his secretary said.    Wei was coming from the port city of Tianjin when at least  seven police vehicles stopped the car he was riding in and took  him away, his secretary, who was riding with him, said.    Police showed Wei a "summons and investigation warrant"  before taking him off, the secretary said in describing the  incident which occurred about 5:00 p.m. [0900 GMT] Beijing time.    Wei was returning from what is believed to have been a  forced  exile after being detained in early March, several days before  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in Beijing to  press China's communist leaders for progress in human rights.    The dissident, who became famous for his publications and  imprisonment during the democracy wall period in the late 1970s,  was released on parole last September 15, days before the  International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted on what city was to  hold the 2000 Olympics.    Many surmised his release was a cynical move by Beijing to  attempt to polish its human rights image for IOC voters, while  using its political dissidents as hostages.    Wei was jailed for "counterrevolutionary propaganda and  incitement" 15 years ago March 29, which was also the date on  which his parole was to end.    However he had also been deprived of his political rights  for  three years following his release. Deprivation of civil rights  for varying periods is among China's punishments.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed Thursday that despite  the termination of his parole, Wei is not allowed to give  interviews to foreign journalists.    The ministry refused to clarify under which law such a  restriction is stipulated, although it stressed that china has  "a rule of law."    Theoretically a "summons and investigation warrant" allows  for the detention of citizens for up to three days.    Wei incensed Chinese leaders when he met U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck at Shattuck's  request two weeks before the Christopher visit and said the U.S.  should continue to link trade with progress in human rights.    The United States has tied the renewal of China's  most-favored- nation (MFN) trading status, which facilitates  billions of dollars in bilateral trade, to progress on the  rights front.    Wei, similarly incensed paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in  1978 when he called democracy China's "fifth modernization," at  a time when Deng was pushing the "four modernizations" -- of  agriculture, industry, defense and science -- in his attempt to  rebuild china after the disastrous 10-year cultural revolution.    Deng reportedly personally ordered Wei's arrest at that  time,  saying, "arrest Wei Jingsheng and never let him go."</p>

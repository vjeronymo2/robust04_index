Afghan Reconcilian Committee Chairman Jalaloddin Haqqani  told  AL-HAYAH yesterday that the truce in Kabul "will begin at 0500  Tuesday [15 February] and will last for four days."    Haqqani, who heads a committee consisting of some 100  commanders and ulema, added: "We have, from both sides, written  assurances of adherence to the cease-fire and cooperation for  the sake of probing the main causes of the crisis."    Asked by AL-HAYAH if the cease-fire would also apply to the  Uzbek forces against whom the Afghan president declared jihad  and refused to agree a cease-fire with, Haqqani said: "There  will be a cease-fire between the camps of Rabbani and  Hekmatyar." He reaffirmed that both parties to the conflict had  agreed to a truce.    Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar told AL-HAYAH that "the  Higher Coordination Council has agreed to a cease-fire provided  it is used to find a mechanism for the settlement of the current  crisis, as follows: Unconditional resignation of the president  (Rabbani), declaration of Kabul a demilitarized zone, removal of  the armed units from it within a week, and the formation of a  provisional government within two weeks." [passage omitted]    Haqqani made an appeal through AL-HAYAH to the Islamic  governments and organizations to provide urgent aid for the  Afghan capital. Emotionally, he said: "The situation is  extremely tragic, with scores of families without shelter,  clothes, or food. The Muslims must help in this critical period."</p>

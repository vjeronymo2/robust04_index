			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Arts: Strong on the Renaissance - Nicholas Powell sums up the mood at the Maastricht Art Fair WITH attendance up by 20 per cent on 1991 and business reportedly well in excess of last year, the week-long Maastricht European Fine Art Fair should bring some continental economic cheer to its 31 British participants by the time it closes tomorrow evening. The show has been attended by 144 dealers from ten countries. Buyers were mostly Belgian, Dutch and German, along with some Italians and Spaniards. Highly specialised art collectors came from as far afield as the US, Japan and Hong Kong: dealer Edward R. Lubin from New York, specialising in Renaissance works of art, said he had chosen Maastricht as opposed to the more ostentatious Paris Biennale antiques fair for his first European venue, for precisely that reason. Curators were busy buying, too. During the first 48 hours of the fair, the Antwerp gallery, J. Zeberg, sold a 15th century Nottingham alabaster sculpture and a magnificent Fontainebleau walnut cabinet, c 1580, to European museums. This year, Maastricht sported a new jewellery department grouping the world's four biggest firms, in which the brightest sparkles came from Harry Winston's shamelessly camp lifesize pair of Judy Garland's ruby slippers. There was real art in the fair's other new section, 'Gravura,' comprising five stands devoted to works on paper and books. Siegfried Billesberger, from Munich, had brought along extremely fine German and Italian drawings and rapidly sold a Van Gogh pencil sketch to a Spanish collector for a hefty DM200,000. Wolseley Fine Arts from London fielded an attractive choice of late 19th century and early 20th century French drawings. Maastricht's Textura section, the biggest and best quality concentration of textile dealers anywhere in the world, this year housed Renaissance specialist Bernard Blondeel from Antwerp, selling among others a pair of late 16th century Mille Fleurs tapestries from Bruges for Pounds 600,000. Maastricht remains unaccountably afflicted with poor quality contemporary art stands, and there is still little furniture to be seen. Prinz und Moeller from Hamburg, however, had lots of very glossy Biedermeier and Gloucestershire dealer, Michael Golding, of Huntingdon Antiques, is showing an outstanding selection of late medieval and renaissance English furniture, which British museums would, presumably, kill for, if they had any money. Old Master paintings and drawings, occupying roughly half the stands in the fair, remain very much the hallmark of Maastricht, and there are some great and unusual works poking through the acres of Dutch tulips in vases and merrymaking Flemish peasants. The London firm, P &amp; D Colaghi, returned to Maastricht after missing last year with a poignant and exquisitely coloured Holy Family by Hendrick Bloemaert, signed and dated 1635, which sold to a private collector within hours of the opening. Galerie d'Arenberg from Brussels were on the look-out for sellers as much as for buyers, and had ideal museum material to hand with a 'Noli me tangere' by Janssens Wildens, c 1620 for BFrs10m and a Virgin and Child by 17th century French painter Simon Vouet for BFrs28m. Other dealers had trimmed their sails to suit a North European clientele. Galerie de la Scala from Paris brought Dutch drawings and two extraordinary paintings - Saint Gregory by the 17th century Dutch artist, Matthias Stomer, at FFrs2m and a very rare 17th century work by Jacob Cuyp, better known for his portraits, of two leopards (entitled 'Two Tigers') for FFrs3m. There were exceptional art objects on display, too. Galerie Neuse from Bremen showed Augsburg silver and beautifully fine South German baroque ivory sculptures. Axel Vervoordt, who deals from his own castle near Antwerp, made his booth into a sort of 'wunderkammer,' lining it with 18th century French bookshelves laden with an eclectic choice of objects and 18th century silver. Old Masters dealer Richard Green from London, who has shown at Maastricht since 1972, sold six paintings this year. He said trading for art up to Dollars 0.5m was no problem. It was proving less easy up to Dollars 1m and tricky above that figure, he said. 'The quality is excellent. This is a top fair, which lives up to its expectations. It's not only what we sell that counts, it's the aftermath, the ongoing interest, the deals that happen afterwards which are important.'</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Bonds: World Bank pricing more generous than expected THE World Bank played safe with the launch of its first D-Mark global bond, setting an indicated price range which was slightly more generous than the market had expected. The DM3bn offering of 10-year bonds will be priced today to yield between six and eight basis points over the 6 per cent German government bond due 2003. Demand was such that the bonds are likely to be priced at the lower end. Even though the indicated range was only one basis point wider than most expectations, it sent a clear signal to the market that the World Bank was keen to attract top-quality German and international institutions. In addition, the indicated range achieved the best pricing for a supranational issuer in the D-Mark sector since the introduction of the fixed re-offer price last year. Joint lead managers Deutsche Bank and Salomon Brothers said the issue was several times oversubscribed, though demand from within Germany was not that strong. However, this had been expected because of the much higher yields which are available in the domestic bond market. According to initial estimates, around one-third of the bonds were placed in east Asia, 25 per cent in the US and the remainder in Europe. International demand was also strong for Credit Local's FFr7bn offering of eight-year Eurobonds. Joint lead manager JP Morgan said around 75 per cent of the bonds were placed outside France. The bonds were priced to yield 21 basis points over the 9 1/2 per cent French government OAT due 2001, at the low end of the indicated price range. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread remained intact. This offering replaces Credit Local's planned French franc global bond offering, the documentation for which would not have been ready for another one or two months. This delay meant that the offering could not be launched before late November or early December, which traditionally is not the best time to raise large amounts of money, especially under a new format. Credit Local was not willing to wait until next year because of its large borrowing requirement, so it opted to raise the funds through an issue of Eurobonds. However, the French franc global bond offering remains open for next year. Ireland took advantage of arbitrage opportunities available in the Euro-escudo market to raise cheap D-Marks. At the same time, it become the first foreign sovereign issuer to tap the escudo sector of the international bond market. At the underwriting level, Ireland's Es15bn issue of five-year Eurobonds was priced to yield around eight basis points below the 12 1/2 per cent Portuguese government bond due January 1998. Euro-escudo bonds yield less than Portuguese government bonds because they are not subject to withholding tax. However, the yield differential has narrowed considerably in recent months, on rumours, now confirmed, that Portugal planned to abolish the tax on foreign holders of its bonds. An official at Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency said the proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate D-Marks at a substantial margin below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Ireland is believed to have achieved a margin of between 11 and 15 basis points below Libor. The floating-rate D-Marks would replace more expensive liabilities in that currency. Lead manager Banco Portugues de Investimento said most of the bonds were placed with non-resident investors. IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, achieved its aggressive dollar funding target of between 35 and 40 basis points below Libor by swapping the proceeds of its Pta10bn offering of five-year bonds.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: Losses deepen at Explaura Shares of Explaura Holdings yesterday declined 3p to 15 1/2 p after the USM-quoted group, which has limestone quarrying interests in Canada, reported a net deficit of Pounds 1m for 1990. Mr David Finch, chairman, blamed the setback on start-up problems of new quarry and plant facilities which limited production capability. An exceptional charge of Pounds 297,000 related to production costs above original estimates. Nevertheless, production at Lower Cove, Newfoundland continued into early winter with an inventory at the year-end of some 300,000 tonnes of graded aggregate at the quarry. The 'high costs' of establishing deep water marine terminals at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Savannah, Georgia, were absorbed into overheads. Sales of aggregate for the year amounted to Pounds 266,000. Losses per share deepened to 0.87p (0.06p).</p>

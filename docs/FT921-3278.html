			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / White South Africa faces its last trek: On Tuesday, whites vote in a referendum on political reform that could lead, after 350 years, to rule for the black majority. Patti Waldmeir assesses the mood 'THE HISTORY of the Afrikaner reveals a will and a determination which makes one feel that Afrikanerdom is not the work of men but the creation of God.'  - Daniel Malan, South Africa's first National Party prime minister With this grand vision of the Afrikaners as a chosen people in a promised land, Malan ushered-in the era of apartheid which has so twisted the psyche of all who live at this tortured tip of Africa. Now, apartheid is shuddering to an end and Afrikaners must face something that many find too ghastly to contemplate: the triumph of black Africa. For 350 years, they have fought to keep Africa at bay. They have believed the Afrikaner tribe would perish unless it had total domination. Apartheid was to have been the Afrikaner's saviour - but it has failed him. On Tuesday, whites will be asked to make the final leap into a multi-racial future when they vote in a referendum on political reform. Beset by all the old, atavistic fears of the black man, and more modern worries over economic decline, the Afrikaner is setting out on his last great trek. Where will it lead? 'Not to isolation this time, but to find a real home in the new South Africa, a true fatherland at last,' says Afrikaner historian Professor FA van Jaarsveld. 'A trek to accepting changed values. A trek to accepting the inevitable." Tuesday's vote will tell if a majority of the 3.5m Afrikaners are resigned to such a trek. Clearly, many are not, for throughout the South African platteland - the deeply-conservative home of the rural Afrikaner - the prejudice of centuries dies hard. Spurred-on by a blend of arrogance and fear which seems peculiarly Afrikaans, the dour farmers of the platteland still shock the foreign visitor with their bigotry. I cannot count the times I have been told - by God-fearing Afrikaner men and women throughout South Africa - that blacks smell; that they cannot be trusted; that they are unreliable drunkards with no inclination to work or save; and that they are not really human. Afrikaners challenge the self-righteous foreigner with the claim that economic apartheid exists in every country; they believe South Africa's only fault was to make it law. But such aggression reveals, as well, a dark fear of being swamped by Africa; of being forced to go against the divine will as interpreted by generations of Afrikaans pastors - that God created the races to remain separate and mixing them is against both nature and religion. 'If you're taught something all your life and then you're told it's a sin, it makes life very scary,' says Dina Cronje, 57. Seated at a rough table in her farmhouse kitchen near Warmbaths, in the heat and dust of the northern Transvaal, she is outraged that the Dutch Reformed Church - the main Afrikaner church - has branded apartheid a sin and that some church leaders have apologised for it. 'I've never done anything to blacks so why should I apologise?' she asks. In her platteland community - where the cars are recent models but the dresses and hair-styles would have been stylish in the 1960s - almost everyone still believes that the Bible ordained apartheid. Cronje's neighbour, Herculas Venter, 78, offers to prove this from the copy kept near at hand in his sitting room. The argument focuses on Old Testament texts which demand apartheid between the children of Israel and other heathen nations. For years, the Dutch Reformed Church (known, disparagingly, as the 'National Party at prayer') distorted the Bible shamelessly to give apartheid a theological basis. Since 1986 - when, miraculously, the church re-discovered Christ's instruction: 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,' and branded apartheid a sin - its leaders have fought to persuade their parishoners of the need for change. They have made little headway in Warmbaths. Cronje and her neighbours do not believe apartheid was wrong: it just did not work. Its aim, they argue, was not to oppress the black man. In the words of Afrikaner theologian Dr Carel Boshoff: '(Apartheid) was a serious and honest effort to liberate the black nations.' Put more crudely, whites believed blacks had to be segregated in separate tribal homelands to stop them tearing out each other's throats. Many whites still do; they predict civil war in the new South Africa, not between white and black but between tribes of Africans. Tannie (Aunt) Lettie Swart is convinced of it. When I knocked at her screened back door, Tannie Lettie - like any 19th century Voortrekker wife - was baking rusks in an old wood-burning stove. Scarcely had I stepped through the door before she let me know that two of her aunts and her grandmother had been interned in British concentration camps during the Anglo-Boer war, and that the farm where we stood had been destroyed in the fighting. Stooped and bent at 75, Tannie Lettie's voice is faint with age. But her opinions are forthright. 'The white people worked so hard, since van Riebeeck's time (Jan van Riebeeck, the first European settler). Nothing was done by the blacks. In the past four centuries, the whites are responsible for all the growth: now, the blacks want to take it from us.' Her neighbour Bucks Viljoen, 52, could not agree more. When I drew up outside his tiny bungalow on a smallholding near Warmbaths, he was sweating in the midday sun - along with his wife, Katerina, and mother, Anna Maria - to build an ice-house to store the farm's slaughtered meat. He wants to be self-sufficient and never uses black labour. But this means that Anna Maria, 73, and Katerina, 46, have to help with the farm work. They are a portrait of the poor white family. Anna Maria's face is like cured leather from the sun; she wears a crushed hat and old trousers. Katerina is plump and shapeless and looks after the four-year-old son of an unmarried daughter. The Viljoens demonstrate one of the abiding mysteries of Afrikaner psychology: how, in the words of novelist Alan Paton, 'a nationalist can observe the highest standards of behaviour towards his own kind, but can observe an entirely different standard towards others.' Allister Sparks, an historian and journalist, spells-out this paradox further in his book The Mind of South Africa: 'Piety co-exists with cruelty, prayerfulness with an aggressive militarism, a yearning to be understood and to be loved with a national bellicosity and an impulse to tell the rest of the world to go to hell.' Bucks Viljoen embodies all these contradictions: polite to me at all times, he is shockingly crude in his attitude to blacks ('the 'munt' is still half-wild,' he told me, promising to 'shoot me a coupla kaffirs'). He is a Christian but bars 'munts' from his church. Viljoen is an extreme case of the platteland racist. But even among the more enlightened platteland Afrikaners - and there are many who support political reform, either by conviction or because they are resigned to it as inevitable - the fear remains that Afrikaans culture will be swamped by the very different values and practices of Africa and that Afrikaners will become, once again, a subjugated nation in their land. Afrikaner leaders always have taught that a pure white race could not survive without a privileged position. As van Jaarsveld explains: 'Apartheid was designed for the protection of the Afrikaner. Throughout the 20th century, he felt threatened by the British - there was always the memory of the Anglo-Boer war. 'Then, after the (second world) war, Afrikaners were worried about the urbanisation of blacks. Apartheid was meant to protect Afrikaners against the English, and against the rise of the black man.' Throughout the platteland, Afrikaners recount the struggle against the cultural and linguistic dominance of English. 'The Afrikaner, over the years, had to fight like hell to maintain his language against English influence,' says De Wet Nel, a retired lawyer in the Karoo town of Carnarvon. 'You could read decent books only in English when I was young - there was very limited reading matter available for Afrikaans-speaking people. So it (the Afrikaans language) has had a hard struggle to get where it is today.' But Andries Botha, a liberal farmer in arch-conservative territory in the Orange Free State, points out that the battle has left deep scars as Afrikaners have forced other groups to speak their language. 'The Nationalists made Afrikaans extremely unpopular and unpalatable to the rest of the population,' he says. Now, Nationalist leaders are fighting a rearguard action to get Afrikaans - a creole of Dutch, French, English, Malay and African words - accepted as an official language in the new South Africa. They argue that 13.3m South Africans understand and speak it - 1m more than speak English - and that 5.5m to 6m regard it as their mother tongue, making it the third largest home language after Zulu and Xhosa. Leading Nationalist institutions such as the the Dutch Reformed Church and the Broederbond (the Afrikaner secret society which directs much National Party policy) finally have abandoned their strategy of purity in isolation. To ensure the survival of the Afrikaans language and their culture, they have redefined the very concept of an Afrikaner: now, you can qualify simply by speaking Afrikaans and 'wanting to make one's future in Africa.' The clear aim of this policy is to include the country's 3m coloureds (mixed-race people) in the Afrikaner nation so as to give it critical mass. Many Afrikaners - especially among the urban middle classes, the professionals and the verligtes (enlightened ones) - see the threat of Africa as more economic than cultural. They fear expropriation by a black government, and the economic mismanagement which has turned much of the rest of Africa into a wasteland. De Wet Nel points out that 40 years of apartheid have left blacks ill-educated and unused to responsibility. The view on the platteland - or in the working class suburbs of any major city - is more emotional, though. Kobus Botha, a lawyer in the Orange Free State town of Viljoenskroon, gives the apocalyptic view of the future. 'If things end up the way they're heading now, the Afrikaner will be wiped out. The white nation in South Africa will be . . . split up and chased all over the world and this country will become just one more battlefield in Africa.' Afrikaners are, more than at any time in history, divided over their future. Boshoff says: 'Some want to enter the new South Africa purely on merit, without guarantees for their values and culture; then another group wants to take part, but with safeguards on language and education.' The third group, for which Boshoff speaks, does not want to join the new South Africa at all; it has founded a separate white state, called Orania, in the northern Cape. Tuesday's vote will tell whether the majority of Afrikaners have resigned themselves to life as an ethnic minority ruled, if not dominated, by blacks. On the platteland, though, change will be slow to come - either way. As Tannie Lettie steps into her dusty yard, taking the freshly-baked rusks to an outdoor clay oven for drying, she is far from optimistic. 'I believe in the will of God, but it's hard. We can try to live together, but I don't think it will ever be good or pleasant. They are so DIFFERENT from us.' She shakes her head, sadly. 'Sometimes, I think there's going to be a war.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Business lobbies from Japan  and the United States on Thursday [23 June] jointly urged that  Japan's current account surplus be reduced to less than 2  percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).    The Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai  Doyukai) and the Committee for Economic Development (CED) also  agreed on their opposition to the setting of specific targets  for Japan's imports from the U.S.    However, they said such targets would be effective if used  in  unbinding ways to gauge the openness of the Japanese market.    In a statement that described the Japan-U.S. relationship as  the most important partnership in the world, the groups called  on Japan to open its market and reduce its external imbalance.    The statement said the ratio of Japan's current account  surplus to its GDP should be brought down to around 2 percent in  fiscal 1997 and less than that thereafter.    Japan's current account surplus accounted for more than 3  percent of the GDP in fiscal 1993 ended March 31.    The statement also requested more than 100 trillion yen be  added to Japan's 430 trillion yen public works program for this  decade.</p>

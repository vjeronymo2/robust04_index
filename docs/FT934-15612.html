			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / A navy all at sea: Ukraine is backtracking on the Black Sea deal The grey, trawler-like ship moored in front of the famous steps at the port of Odessa flies one of the rarest sights on the seas: the blue cross and trident emblem of a Ukrainian naval flag. The Slavutich, an intelligence-gathering vessel, represents a quarter of Ukraine's fledgling navy. During its two-year naval dispute with Russia, independent Ukraine has bagged one light frigate that defected from the rest of the fleet and has commissioned ships that were under construction at its shipyards - a frigate, another light escort ship and the Slavutich. It also has a hovercraft. The remainder of the once-proud Black Sea fleet, which traces its traditions back to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia, remains in an extraordinary post-Soviet limbo. A summit on September 3 between Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk and Russia's President Boris Yeltsin at Massandra in the Crimea appeared to have settled the fleet's future status. Ukraine would give up its entitlement to half the 300-vessel fleet. In exchange, Russia would write off Ukraine's debts to it for oil, gas and electricity, estimated at Dollars 2.5bn. But Ukraine has been backtracking ever since. A joint Ukrainian-Russian commission was set up for more detailed discussions, but the Massandra pact now seems to be a dead letter. The other agreement reached there, allowing Russia to take away strategic nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine, has also run aground, with the two sides differing about what they actually signed up to. Mr Yeltsin negotiated the naval deal from a position of strength. From a Russian viewpoint, it seemed financially quite generous. Mr Kravchuk had to take it or leave it. But back in Kiev Mr Kravchuk met stiff opposition inside and outside the government. The first question put by a journalist was how he felt about betraying his country. His defence minister at the time, General Konstantin Morozov, quickly distanced himself, saying he could not be responsible for defending Ukraine's southern flank if the deal was implemented. He quit the government last week. Ukrainian officials now say the agreement was only to study the question of a sale, emphasising that the ships-for-debt scheme was a Russian proposal. Last week's violent showdown in Moscow between Mr Yeltsin and his political opponents has complicated the issue still further - reinforcing the Russian military's political influence and at the same time making Ukrainians even more wary of their volatile big neighbour. The fleet, with 70,000 personnel, about 40 major warships, 18 submarines, some 250 other vessels and a similar number of aircraft and helicopters, has been the focus of tension between the two countries. But more contentious than the ships themselves are the shore-based support facilities, above all the Crimean headquarters, Sevastopol. Russia's now disbanded parliament outraged Ukrainian nationalists by questioning the Crimea's status as part of Ukraine and passing a resolution in July claiming Sevastopol. The Crimea, with a majority Russian population, was given to Ukraine in 1954, when no one foresaw the break-up of the Soviet Union. Mr Kravchuk, trying to justify himself on television, warned that pressing Ukraine's naval claims could have sparked a revolt. 'We could well have lost both the fleet and the Crimea,' he said. Kiev's position is that the Russian and Ukrainian navies must be separated and that the Russians must, in time, withdraw from Ukraine. Officials say facilities could be shared while Russia builds an alternative base. Ukraine proposed at Massandra including a protocol about renting Crimean bases. But, say the officials, the Russian side would not accept the concept of rent, since that would acknowledge Ukraine's ownership. Earlier accords have been equally flimsy. Moscow's first plan was to assign the fleet, or at least its main warships, to the Commonwealth of Independent States' joint forces. In January last year, a framework agreement was reached to give part to Ukraine. There followed three summit deals prior to Massandra: June 1992, in the Russian Black Sea resort of Dagomys. The fleet would in principle be split. August 1992, at Yalta. Up to 1995, the fleet would come under a joint commander, answering to both presidents. This was unpopular in Ukraine. June 1993, in Moscow. The fleet would be split 50-50, with joint use of Sevastopol. This latter plan, implementation of which was due to start in September, provoked near mutiny among the fleet's conservative, Russian-dominated officer corps. The joint commander, Russian Admiral Eduard Baltin, called it 'ruinous'. He had to stop his officers repeating their protest of the previous month, when two-thirds of the fleet hoisted the Tsarist-era Russian naval flag, a blue St Andrew's cross. For now, the fleet's warships have orders to fly the Soviet navy flag, one of the last remaining institutions to carry the old emblems. But tugs and other auxiliaries in Sevastopol fly Russian ensigns, and a corner of the harbour is reserved for the tiny Ukrainian-flag navy. It is, according to one military observer, 'a complete farce'. Ukraine is clearly ready to relinquish at least part of its theoretical 50 per cent share. Officials admit the fleet is of less military than economic interest to the country. 'Many of the ships are old. We can sell them . . . to Russia or another country.' On the other hand, the Ukrainians want to build up a proper navy to protect their 600-mile coastline and shipping lanes. By 1995 they will have 10 warships built. Shortly to join the fleet is a guided-missile cruiser, provisionally christened Bohdan Khmelnitsky, after the 17th-century leader of a Cossack rebellion against Poland. Ironically, the same man is held responsible for subsequently subjecting Ukraine to the rule of Moscow. For nationalist Ukrainians it might seem a bad omen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report from Dubai:"UAE to Compile a Blacklist to Combat </F> Market Fraud"]    [Text] Federal and local authorities in the UAE [United  Arab Emirates] announced plans to combat fraud and counterfeit  now that they have promulgated several laws to safeguard the  integrity of markets and commercial transactions.    At the conclusion of a seminar on commercial fraud held in  Dubai, economic circles called for strengthening all laws and  regulations dealing with commercial fraud and [urged] that they  be reexamined in light of modern techniques against fraud, and  especially those utilized for consumer protection.    The seminar, attended by representatives of various  government agencies in the UAE, called for blacklisting  merchants and producers who resort to fraud in marketing their  products to the detriment of consumers. They advocated the  compilation of a blacklist of unworthy products and called for  comprehensive coordination among all concerned agencies, be they  federal or local, in order that they may take more effective  measures to implement the laws to suppress commercial fraud, and  to institute penalties, or modify them, in a manner that would  deter all marketplace cheaters.    They emphasized the importance of creating channels of  communication among the various agencies concerned with  international economic and commercial fields, the exchange of  information, and studies. These agencies include local, foreign,  and joint chambers of commerce, banks, and international  organizations concerned with prosecuting marine fraud. [They  also called for] opening channels to exchange information on  agreements with overseas entities, and especially those with  which the volume of trade is substantial.    The Ministry of the Economy, represented by Undersecretary  'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Mubarak, emphasized at the seminar that  commercial fraud is a phenomenon alien to society and runs  counter to religious precepts that call for honesty in dealing.  He added, however, that all commercial markets in the world  suffer from the phenomenon of commercial fraud, which impacts  markets negatively, causes imbalances, creates a degree of  chaos, and denies the market its bulwark of honesty and  confidence that deals will be fair. He called for wider  cooperation between the ministry and chambers of commerce,  municipalities, and customs agencies in order to blunt that  phenomenon and protect consumers.    The Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in a study  presented at the seminar, attributed the phenomenon of fraud in  UAE markets to the expansion of commercial operations in the  state after the completion of infrastructure projects; to the  diversity of commercial activity and market openness to various  foreign products; to some contractor changeovers to trading in  goods and products; to the lack of awareness among some  consumers who rush to buy cheap products without considering the  ramifications of using them; the lack of merchant familiarity  with, and understanding of the need to abide by laws that  regulate commercial activities in the state such as the Company  Law, the Commercial Agency Law, the Law to Suppress Fraud and  Deception, Criminal Law, and Commercial Transactions Law; and  the fact that those merchants do not consult with the relevant  authorities before initiating all commercial transactions.    The [Chamber] added that some of the reasons for the  phenomenon are that certain merchants exaggerate the prices of  certain brands of goods and products, the flight of consumers to  cheaper look-alike goods in the belief that they are of equal  quality, dealing with exporters and companies before verifying  their validity, and opening letters of credit without adequate  protective stipulations.    The Dubai Chamber of Commerce argued in another treatise  that  fraud extends to three areas--goods; documents such as letters  of credit, invoices, and bills of lading; and fraud involving  marine shipping and its regulations. It advised importers to  avoid being victimized by fraud by securing adequate data on  producers and exporters from chambers and centers of commerce,  from their bankers, or from delegations that visit the Chamber  of Commerce. It further advised importers not to rely on foreign  company sales representatives who visit the country and not to  be taken in by appearances put on by the exporter or its sales  representative. The importers were further urged to ascertain  the status of local agents, if they handle the transactions, and  their relationships with exporters.    The [Dubai Chamber] said that in order to guarantee that the  goods arrive in sound condition as specified, importers must ask  shipping company representatives or agents at ports of loading  or unloading to audit and scrutinize stipulations and determine  which organizations are to carry out inspections and issue  certificates of inspection. They were also admonished to deal  with domestic shipping companies whenever possible or with  regular shipping lines which, preferably, have agents in the  region; avoid shipping on chartered vessels; insure the goods  with domestic insurance companies; and avoid using the fleets of  countries that allow open registry.    The Chamber also called upon importers when opening letters  of credit to be sure to record the specifications of the goods  in detail and exactly as they appear on the purchasing contract;  not accept bills of lading issued by shipping expediters and  insist on shipping documents issued by the original marine  shipper on its stationery; and to tap the services offered by  international agencies involved with fraud.    The Municipality of Abu Dhabi said in its study, however,  that fraud is connected with the large-scale import of  foodstuffs into the UAE and with the [related] laws and  laboratories. It recommended, for the containment of that  phenomenon, encouraging domestic food production and processing  operations which would make it easier to thoroughly oversee all  stages of production and therefore ensure that products are  received by consumers in good condition; cooperation among  relevant agencies, unification of decision and regulation  issuing bodies, and the expediting of uniform standards and laws  governing foodstuffs in the country; raising consumer awareness  through information media; encouraging public service  associations to expand their activities by supporting them  morally and materially; and tightening oversight at gateways  through which foodstuffs flow into the country.    The Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce asserted that the  government has issued enough laws and regulations to contain the  phenomenon of commercial fraud but that legislative containment  is not in itself [capable of accomplishing the task] and must be  supported by an analogous solidification of effort by all  entities concerned with information, security, and economic  affairs, each in its area of specialization.</p>

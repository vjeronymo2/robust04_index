			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Security Council is Murdering Security"] </F>   [Text] The concealed U.S. hands, and the United States'  flagrant involvement in fomenting the Yemeni war, have now begun  to appear. This was to settle the old accounts of the Gulf war  in reply to the Yemeni's pan-Arab position and to teach the  Yemeni leadership a hard lesson for its pan-Arab role in the  Mother of Battles.    When Yemen joined the Arab Cooperation Council, certain Gulf  states were outraged because they considered it the backyard of  the Gulf and the Roman theater in which they watch the rivers of  blood flow to kill their boredom of money and oil.    Since the Gulf War ended, the United Stats has been hatching  conspiracies to destroy the pan-Arab flame in Yemen and place  its shores and Bab el-Mandeb under U.S. control to complete the  occupation of the entire Arabian Peninsula and its long shores.    The UN Security Council's intervention in a domestic affair  without the request of the responsible Yemeni party also comes  to avenge the Jordanian stands, which certain Gulf states still  abhor because of, first, Jordan's fostering of the Arab  Cooperation Council; second, its rational position in the Gulf  war; and, third, its honorable mediation to spare Yemeni blood.    The new imperialist conspiracy did not stop at fragmenting  Yemen's unity, isolating it, and pushing it into the quagmire of  a long civil war. It went beyond that to the objective of  aborting the Jordanian mediation and destroying its plan for  pan-Arab renaissance -- the Arab Cooperation Council, as well as  destroying the effective Yemeni role in that Council. The more  important objective of the conspiracy was to curb the Jordanian  role and prevent it from contributing to the pan-Arab  renaissance because the Arab Cooperation Council plan -- which  certain Gulf states viewed as a challenge and an axis hostile to  their dreams and encroachment on their influence zones,  primarily Yemen -- was about to shatter the hopes of the U.S.  imperialism to impose control on the Gulf. To avenge that  position, certain Gulf states, acted quickly to complicate  matters and push the situation in Yemen to a dead end. They used  in the process certain Yemeni stooges to implement their  conspiracy, with promises that they will be put in control if  they implement their policies.    We denounce the UN Security Council's intervention in  Yemen's  internal affairs. We know in advance that any Arab subject that  enters the Security Council will come out of it more complicated  because the Security Council will not put things in the proper  context and will, instead, complicate the problem, knowing that  behind every Arab sedition there are American hands.    The Yemeni issue remains of concern to the legitimate Yemeni  leadership and any foreign intervention in rejected. The  Yemeni people will reject any Yemeni party that throws itself  into the lap of U.S. imperialism to impose on its people a  position that runs counter to their national aspirations. The  Yemeni people have always been invulnerable to attempt at  containment or hegemony and have crushed all conspiracies aimed  at colonizing them and subjugating them to foreign hegemony.    We urge the Yemeni people and leadership to deny the  conspirators every opportunity and to adhere to Yemen unity. We  also urge them to utilize every chance for dialogue in order to  foil the evil conspiracies and abort the big sedition.</p>

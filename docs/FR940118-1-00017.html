			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Content of Claims.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 252.3 describes the required content of a claim, and is more detailed than the former Tribunal's requirements. The Copyright Office is not yet prepared to issue claimant forms, and each claimant must therefore take care to insure that information meeting all the requirements of section 252.3 is contained in each claim. Each claim must state the full legal name of the claimant, and its address, telephone number and facsimile number, if any. The claimant must also identify at least one of its copyrighted works that was subject to a secondary transmission by a cable system in the previous calendar year, thereby establishing a basis for a claim to royalties. If the claim is a joint claim, there must be a concise statement of the authorization for filing the joint claim. For this purpose, performing rights societies will not be required to obtain separate authorizations from their individual members beyond their standard agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All claims must be signed by the claimant or a duly authorized representative, and the Copyright Office must be notified of name and/or address changes within 30 days of the change. Failure to notify the Office in a timely fashion is grounds for dismissal of the claim. If a party submitting an individual claim wishes to change it to a joint claim, the Office must be notified within 14 days of the agreement to submit a joint claim. All joint claimants must make available to the Copyright Office and, if applicable, to a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel_a list of all individual claimants covered by the joint claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compliance With Statutory Dates.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 252.4 underscores the importance of complying with the July filing period. A claim is considered timely filed if it is received by the Copyright Office during normal business hours in July, or is properly addressed to the Copyright Office with correct postage and bears a July U.S. postmark. Claims dated only with a business meter and not received in July are untimely. Absolutely no claim will be accepted if it is filed by facsimile transmission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proof of Fixation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, section 252.5 clarifies that the Copyright Office will not require claimants to file copies of their works. In the event that the issue of fixation arises, the CARP conducting the proceeding will resolve the controversy on the basis of affidavits and other appropriate documentary evidence. No affidavits need be submitted, however, unless requested by the Panel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Parts 253&hyph;256 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parts 253 through 256 adopt, with only minor technical changes, the provisions of the former Tribunal's regulations for use of copyrighted works by noncommercial educational broadcasters, adjustment of royalty rates for phonorecord players (jukeboxes), adjustment of royalty rates for making and distributing phonorecords, and adjustment of royalty rates for the cable compulsory license. These actions contain current royalty rates, as adopted by the Tribunal, and will be amended by the Copyright Office in the future as new rates are set by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel or the Librarian of Congress, as the case may be. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In adopting Parts 253&hyph;256, several regulations of the former Tribunal are being repealed. Former Part 303, entitled ``Access to Phonorecord Players (Jukeboxes)'' is repealed, as is former Part 305, ``Claims to Phonorecord Player (Jukebox) Royalty Fees.'' The need for these parts was eliminated by the Reform Act's repeal of the section 116 jukebox compulsory license and replacement with section 116A governing negotiated licenses. The need for former Tribunal Part 306, however, was not eliminated since it contains royalty rates applicable to periods dating back to January 1, 1982. These rates must be preserved, even though the compulsory license has now been eliminated for future years, in the event that parties making use of copyrighted works during the periods covered by the license may now, or in the future, make initial or supplementary payments. Part 254 therefore adopts Part 306 of the former Tribunal's rules, with only one minor technical change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Part 257_Filing of Claims to Satellite Carrier Royalty Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 257 implements exactly the same requirements for 17 U.S.C. 119 satellite carrier royalty claims that Part 252 adopts for cable claims. Like those for cable, claims in these cases must be filed during the month of July, and may be filed singly or jointly. Section 257.6 makes it clear that, although cable and satellite have the same filing period, separate claims must be filed by a party seeking both cable and satellite royalty fees for the same calendar year. Any single claim which attempts to file for both royalty funds will be dismissed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Parts 258&hyph;259 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parts 258 and 259 govern the adjustment of royalty fees for the satellite carrier compulsory license and the filing of digital audio claims, respectively. These two parts adopt Parts 310 and 311 of the former Tribunal's rules with only minor technical changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 37 CFR Parts 251 and 301 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Hearing and appeal procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 37 CFR Parts 252 and 302 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cable television, Claims, Copyright. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 37 CFR Parts 253 and 304 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copyright, Music, Radio, Rates, Television. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Plans for jobless are 'unsuitable' Government schemes to improve the job prospects of the unemployed are often unsuitable for the needs of the people who use them, the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux says in a report published today. The report, based on evidence from 138 bureaux in England and Wales, criticises assistance programmes for job seekers provided by the Employment Service and training and work experience schemes delivered mainly by the training and enterprise councils. It says the aid schemes are particularly inadequate for unemployed people with special needs, such as the disabled, because of rigid qualifying conditions. The report says several schemes are limited to those out of work for six months or more, and so exclude many people who need help. The report says many citizens' advice bureau clients were made ineligible because they took temporary work or attended short training courses. It says its clients reported that many employers used training or work experience placements as sources of cheap labour. The report concludes that Tecs should set national standards on the rights of trainees while in work experience. In Search of Work. National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, Myddelton House, 115-123 Pentonville Road, London N1 9LZ. Pounds 6.50.</p>

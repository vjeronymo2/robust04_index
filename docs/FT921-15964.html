			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted' COMPANIES are wasting thousands of pounds on headhunters and recruitment consultants in their search to find the right candidates for top jobs, according to an independent study released today. Some consultants are more concerned with keeping on the right side of job applicants than putting candidates through their paces, according to the survey of 365 executive recruitment consultancies. The study said some consultants were likely to use unstructured interviews and references - methods least likely to pinpoint the best candidate - rather than tests of aptitude and personality. Mr Timothy Clark, of the Open University's School of Management, will today present his findings to the annual conference of occupational psychologists, which is being staged in Liverpool by the British Psychological Society. He said the cost to companies of employing headhunters 'could outweigh any productivity benefits' of the new appointment. That was because the wrong people were often selected for important jobs. All the headhunters in the survey used interviews, and almost all also relied heavily on references. But only 40 per cent employed the psychological tests that have been shown to predict reasonably accurately how an individual will perform, said Mr Clark. Headhunters and executive search consultants are often not qualified to carry out psychological testing, he added. They are also often reluctant to subcontract the work to those who are qualified because of fears they will lose control of the contract. The findings could cause the increasing number of companies which rely on consultants to reconsider the way they spend their money. Mr Clark emphasised, however, that headhunters still perform one very useful function: if a company wants to target a particular individual for a vacancy, consultants remain expert at persuading candidates to quit their present employers.</p>

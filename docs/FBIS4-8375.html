			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "kn": "The Army of the Slovak Republic Will </F> Survive, but...."]    [Text] Major General Andrej Sabol, state secretary at the  Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic, stated yesterday  that, in dividing the CSFR Army, we performed "the largest peace  operation in Europe." Out of 7,000 professional soldiers of  Slovak nationality, some 5,000 have stayed on the territory of  the Czech Republic for various reasons. According to Sabol, the  Army, too, suffers from a shortage of money, but "our arms  systems will survive until approximately 2015." It is not true  that the Army of the Slovak Republic is weaker than Hungary's.  Slovakia abides by the international agreements on troop  numbers and armaments, and its compliance with those agreements  is being regularly monitored. Our involvement in the Partnership  for Peace is not conditional on the compatibility of our arms  systems. What must be common, however, is the method of  communication. The prerequisite for this is command of the  English language, which is still a problem for our Army.</p>

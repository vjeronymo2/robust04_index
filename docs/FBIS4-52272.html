			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The government has  liberalized disembarking and embarking in the country by foreign  seamen including Korean-Chinese crews, the maritime and port  administration reported on Monday. An official of the  administration said foreign seamen can now disembark at South  Korean ports with short-term visas only.    In the past, Korean-Chinese seamen were prohibited from  disembarking in the country in fear that they may illegally find  jobs while landing. To facilitate the new step, the government  has prepared a guideline for the issuance of visas to foreign  seamen for implementation retroactive to May 1. It replaces the  guideline for the issuance of visas to Chinese seamen.    Presently a total of 951 foreign seamen work at Korean-flag  freighters and fishing boats.</p>

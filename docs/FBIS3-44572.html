			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministry  spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a news briefing this afternoon:  China hopes to restore the Sino-French relations at the  earliest possible date on the basis of the principles for  establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries.    When asked to comment on French Foreign Minister Juppe's  recent reiteration on hoping to restore Sino-French relations as  soon as possible, Wu Jianmin said: "We welcome the positive  statement made by Foreign Minister Juppe. We have time and  again made clear China's principled stand and positive attitude  toward improving the Sino-French relations. We hope to restore  and develop the Sino- French relations at the earliest possible  date on the basis of the principles for establishing diplomatic  relations between the two countries."    When asked to comment on the prospect that a new  organization  would be set up after the Paris-based Cocom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] is disbanded in  early April and it would invite China to join in, he said: The  Cocom is a product of the Cold War and should have been  abolished earlier. Any new organization to be established after  the Cocom is disbanded should be conducive to the development of  economic and trade ties, scientific and technological  cooperation, and exchanges between nations.</p>

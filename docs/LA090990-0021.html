			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 ANTHRAX "PERSISTENCE OF TIME" ISLAND  </P> <P> Anthrax has always been the least apocalyptic of new-metal bands, obsessed with  Mad magazine instead of the post-nuclear battlefield; playing at a spare,  crunching walk where the competition screeches through warp-speed  diminished-seventh chords. They've been the first in the genre to accommodate  outside influences, too, from hip-hop to power pop to hard-core punk.  </P> <P> (Anthrax's biggest hit, "I'm the Man," is basically a rap song.)  </P> <P> Here, Anthrax use the bricks of their sound to construct something different,  way closer to the dissonant post-punk of Gang of Four or Fugazi than to the  death spew of Sodom or Vio-Lence.  </P> <P> The title song might be the first mature speed-metal meditation on middle age,  and "Blood" seems to be a full-on attempt at the fusion of metal and dub, with  Anthrax's patented blocks of pitched white noise taking the backbeat. The  lyrics are heavily anti-racist, anti-hatred, pro-togetherness. And the Joe  Jackson cover even fits in. "Persistence of Time" is more or less an art album  within the context of Anthrax, and a small masterpiece of metal. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

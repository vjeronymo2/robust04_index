			<p>Hosokawa     Visit to China Yields Mixed Results                              SUMMARY     Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's recent visit to China appears  to have yielded few concrete results, either on the economic or  political and security fronts.  Beijing evidently did little to  address issues of key concern to Tokyo, resisting Tokyo's call  for a more active Chinese role in resolving the North Korean  nuclear issue and for clarification of China's military spending.  Beijing, however, appears to have reaped a propaganda bonus for  use in its dispute with Washington, as Hosokawa, in keeping with  past Japanese policy, sof t-pedaled the issue of China's human  rights record.  In addition, Beijing used the visit to signal  Washington that it has other alternatives if China's most-favored  nation trading status is revoked.                                       END SUMMARY     Hosokawa used the his 19-21 March visit to China, his first trip  to the country since taking office last summer, to highlight the  burgeoning economic ties between Tokyo and Beijing.  In a 20  March news conference in Beijing, Hosokawa described the growth  of trade and investment between the two countries as a "very  desirable development" and stated that he and his Chinese  counterparts had agreed to "continue to exert efforts to further  develop our economic relations."  He also noted that, as  previously announced, Japan would extend a fourth yen-based loan  to China (NHK Television, 20 March).     Beyond the rhetoric, however, no significant new developments in  bilateral relations appear to have come out of the visit.  The  most substantial accomplishment during the trip on the economic  front, judging from media reporting, was the signing on 20 March  of an agreement designed to promote cooperation between the two  countries in the prevention and control of environmental  pollution (Xinhua, 20 March).  According to the 21 March Nihon  Keizai Shimbun,  Hosokawa and Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  also discussed Japanese investment in China's auto industry--an  area where the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has  been pushing Japanese investment for some time in an effort to  compete with U.S. and European ventures in China.     Disagreement on Approach to DPRK     On several issues of high concern to Tokyo, however, Hosokawa  appears to have made little headway.  One such issue was a  reported Japanese request for China to use its influence with the  DPRK to pressure Pyongyang to submit to full inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  An article in the 21  March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, sourced to unnamed Japanese  government officials, claimed that securing China's cooperation  on this issue was the main purpose of Hosokawa's trip.  The paper  and a 20 March Kyodo report portrayed Hosokawa as taking a tough  stance on this issue, telling Li Peng and Jiang Zemin that the  DPRK was using "delaying tactics," and as warning that "the  international community's patience is running out and attempts to  resolve this nuclear issue through dialogue may end in failure."  Kyodo also said that Hosokawa expressed to Premier Li Peng "grave  concern" about Pyongyang's recent stance on inspections, warning  that the possibility that the UN Security Council would take up  the issue was "rising," and asking the Chinese to convey the  international community's increasing impatience to North Korea.     Chinese leaders who met with Hosokawa, however, appear to have  done little more than reiterate China's long-standing position on  the issue--that the problem should be resolved through  negotiations.  A 20 March Xinhua report on Hosokawa's meeting  with Li Peng that day quoted Li as saying that the issue "should  be solved through dialogues and negotiations."  According to a 20  March Kyodo report, unnamed Japanese officials familiar with what  was discussed at the meeting reported that Li also stated that it  was necessary to offer North Korea "what it needs" in return for  agreeing to inspections.  The report did not indicate what, if  anything, Li said North Korea needed, although this would  presumably include economic aid.     Concern Over Chinese Military Spending     Tokyo also appears to have made little headway in clarifying  another issue that reportedly worries the Japanese Government-  -Beijing's recent increase in military spending.  During his 20  March Beijing news conference, Hosokawa stated that he had urged  Chinese leaders to "make efforts to increase the openness of  China's military programs"--a step he said would "assure a sense  of security and increase the international community's trust in  China."  Hosokawa added that he told his Chinese counterparts  that Japan would have to take the level of China's military  spending into account when considering future official  development assistance (ODA) loans to China (NHK Television, 20  March).  Li Peng, however, appears to have responded to  Hosokawa's comments with Beijing's standard defense of China's  military budget, telling Hosokawa at their talks on the 20th that  China's military budget was among the "lowest" in the world and  assuring him that the recently-announced increase in military  spending is aimed primarily at "offsetting inflation."   He went  on to dismiss Japanese concerns, saying that "any worry abroad"  over the recently announced increase in military spending is  "groundless" (Xinhua, 20 March).     Footdragging on Security Council Membership     Tokyo also appears to have gained no Chinese commitment to  support Japan's efforts to attain a permanent seat on the United  Nations Security Council.  According to a 21 March Asahi Shimbun  report, Li told Hosokawa during their meeting on 20 March that,  while China supported the concept of reforming the Security  Council "at an appropriate time," the issue would have to be  given "careful consideration" because "it will affect the  interests of various countries."     Soft-pedaling Human Rights     While Tokyo failed to secure Chinese support on issues of concern  to Japan, Beijing appears to have gained some ammunition to use  against Washington in its dispute with the United States over  China's human rights policy.  Despite reports that he had  promised Secretary of State Christopher that he would raise human  rights during his talks with the Chinese leadership, Hosokawa, in  fact, appears to have taken an extremely low-key approach on the  issue, alluding to human rights in only vague and ambiguous  terms.  According to a 19 March Kyodo report, Hosokawa, in a  speech at Li's welcoming banquet for him on 19 March, stated that  "each nation should make efforts on human rights problems" in  line with the declaration adopted at the June 1993 international  conference on human rights in Vienna.  Judging from both Chinese  and Japanese media reporting, however, in private comments to Li  during the banquet, Hosokawa appears to have undercut any impact  these comments may have had.  According to a 20 March Xinhua  report, at a press conference that day PRC Foreign Ministry  spokesman Wu Jiamin told reporters that during dinner Li briefed  Hosokawa on Secretary of State Christopher's recent visit to  China, and Hosokawa commented that "it is somewhat unwise to  impose Western concepts of democracy on other countries."  Wu  reportedly added that Hosokawa told Li that he "fully understands  [China's] viewpoint and position on human rights."  According to  a 21 March Kyodo report, in comments to reporters on his flight  home from China, Prime Minister Hosokawa confirmed that he made  these remarks.  To soften the effect of his comments on  Washington, the prime minister reportedly denied that he intended  them as a criticism of U.S. policy toward China.     Hosokawa also played down the human rights issue during his news  conference in Beijing on 20 March.  In his opening statement,  broadcast on NHK Television on 20 March, Hosokawa referred to  human rights only in passing, saying that he had had "a candid  exchange of views" on the topic, among several others, with the  Chinese leadership.  When questioned about what he had said to  the Chinese on the human rights issue, he stated ambiguously that  during the welcoming banquet he had told Li that "each nation  should make its own efforts to deal with the issue of human  rights, which has universal value."  Hosokawa refused to comment  on differences between the United States and China on the issue  or on China's recent detention of dissidents.     Japan's Low Key Track Record on Human Rights     While Hosokawa may have sof t pedalled human rights in part  because he did not want to disrupt his trip or detract from his  message on North Korea by raising a controversial issue, his  position is consistent with Japan's past stance on human rights  in China and other countries in East Asia.  Both the Japanese  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and past governments headed by the  Liberal Democratic Party have tended to focus on economic  relations with China rather than human rights.  To support their  position, they have maintained that promoting China's economic  development and keeping the country engaged in the international  community will promote development of human rights in China more  effectively than isolating Beijing over the issue.  For example,  in an article in the October 1993 issue of the Foreign Ministry's  journal, Gaiko Forum, Japanese Ambassador to the PRC Michihiko  Kunihiro stated that although the Japanese Government would ask  Beijing to take "corrective measures" if a specific incident  involving human rights occurred in China, Tokyo believed that  "with the development of a market economy in the PRC, the  consciousness of its citizens about human rights will be elevated  automatically and it will become impossible for the PRC to  disregard international opinions as the country becomes more  involved in the international community."  The ambassador added  that such a process would be, in his view, "more effective than  to hastily try to change [China's] opinion by force."     Beijing's Pointed Message to Washington     At the same time China appears to have used Hosokawa's trip to  China to signal Washington that Beijing has other economic  options should the United States decide to revoke China's MFN  status.  In his meeting with Hosokawa on 20 March, for example,  Li underscored the "tremendous potential for further growth of  bilateral economic cooperation, pointedly noting that the  economies of the two countries are "mutually complementary" and  that China's priorities for development are in "energy,  transportation, and telecommunications, in which Japan is  strong."  During Secretary Christopher's visit just days earlier,  Li, in identical terms, had held out the possibility of giving  U.S. companies preference in developing these areas.     A signed Xinhua commentary on 21 March similarly described the  great possibilities for expanding Sino-Japanese economic  relations.  Hailing the rapid development of relations, the  commentary noted the "wide scope" for further development of  cooperation in transportation, energy and communications.  "It  can be foreseen," the commentary stated, "that as Japan's  technology and capital continue to increasingly integrate with  China's market and resources on a wider scale, it will definitely  become a reality in the near future for the annual volume of  trade between the two countries to reach $390 billion."  Such a  figure would be much larger than the current volume of Sino-U.S.  trade.     Vice Premier Zhu Rongji had delivered a similar message about the  potential for the expansion of Sino-Japanese relations during his  23 February-4 March visit to Japan.  In an interview in Fukuoka  summarized by Xinhua on 2 March, Zhu pointed out that trade  between China and Japan reached a record high of $39 billion in  1993, making Japan "China's largest trading partner" and China  "Japan's second largest trading partner."  Zhu added that,  although this figure was record-breaking, "when we consider the  potential of Sino-Japanese bilateral cooperation, it is a very  small figure."  A 4 March article about Zhu's trip in the Chinese  Communist Party's organ, Renmin Ribao, stated that Zhu also  frequently pointed out during his trip that Sino-Japanese trade  had the potential to increase by ten times over its current  level.     Outlook     Prime Minister Hosokawa's weakening domestic political position  made it imperative that he appear to handle his visit to China  successfully.  Because of this, even had he been inclined to  raise the human rights issue, he would probably have been  unwilling to take a forceful position that would have offended  his Chinese hosts and marred his trip.  China will likely  certainly use Hosokawa's reported private comments to Li Peng in  pressing its case against Washington's criticism of Beijing's  human rights record.  On other fronts, Japan's growing concern  about the DPRK's nuclear program and the security environment in  North Asia will almost certainly mean that Tokyo will continue to  press China in other forums to intervene with the DPRK and to  clarify the nature of Chinese military spending.

Mainland China has made the  biggest contribution to growth, with the value of goods  transited via Hong Kong increasing by 33 percent from January to  October this year, followed by Singapore (27 percent), Germany  (23 percent), the United States (21 percent), the United Kingdom  (19 percent), France (18 percent), Japan (17 percent), Canada  (14 percent), and the ROK (12 percent). Mainland China is Hong  Kong's biggest transit market and 42 percent of its export  commodities are shipped abroad via Hong Kong. Hong Kong's  efforts to constantly improve its port facilities and  cargo-handling procedures have also contributed to the success  in its shipping industry. Operating procedures have been  improved. For instance, all incoming and exiting trucks are now  supervised and directed by computer as a result of the Port  Authority's decision to automatize and computerize procedures.  This has reduced the time required to load and unload a  container to less than one hour.    The container and shipping industry is very important to  Hong  Kong's economy. The industry handles 90 percent of the  territory's total cargo and contributes 15 percent of GDP,  providing jobs to 350,000 people. In the last five years, Hong  Kong's capacity has increased 15 percent annually, and its  marine cargo is predicted to increase from 100 million tonnes  per annum at present to 200 million tonnes by the turn of the  century, increasing further by 100 percent by 2011.

Mr Cheng said that foreign  contractors were not allowed to undertake projects alone; only  through joint ventures with local partners. Alternatively, they  could take the role of project manger if half or more of the  capital involved were foreign funds. In addition, according to  Mr. Cheng, the current contract tendering system in China does  not reflect market reality, because of favoritism shown towards  state-run contractors.

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / A price-tag on the promises: Martin Wolf examines the Conservative party's criticism of Labour's hidden agenda for increased public spending LAST WEEK saw the battle of the two main parties' plans for taxation. On Saturday, the Conservative party shifted its focus towards Labour's plans for public spending. Labour's manifesto, it claimed, has 37 policy pledges that would cost an extra Pounds 37.9bn annually by the last year of a full parliament, in current prices. These charges and counter-charges are at the heart of the election campaign. The Conservative party seems to have abandoned hope of convincing the voters that a fourth term would do them much good. Instead, it seeks to frighten them about Labour's harmful intentions. So is John Smith the sober and responsible chancellor-in-waiting that he appears to be? Or is he, as the Conservatives argue, the respectable face of the spendthrift socialist tiger? Whatever the truth, Mr Smith has been winning the battle of appearances. In his shadow budget, presented last week, he promised to raise additional net revenue of Pounds 3.3bn in 1992-93 (half a percentage point of gross domestic product) and Pounds 6.8bn in 1993-94 (one percentage point of GDP), by comparison with the budget presented by Norman Lamont. The Conservatives wished to make these proposals appear threatening to a substantial proportion of the electorate. They have failed. As the Institute of Fiscal Studies has pointed out, 48 per cent of the population would be better off under the Labour budget than under that of the Conservatives, 35 per cent would be in roughly the same position, while only 17 per cent would be better off under the Conservatives. The majority of the electorate would, therefore, either be unaffected by these proposals or - especially if they were on below average incomes and were either pensioners or parents - would benefit substantially. The Labour budget may be harshly criticised for the shock it would impose on the higher paid and for its longer term effect on incentives. But since each adult has one vote in an election, it looks politically invulnerable. The more Conservatives focus their attack on Mr Smith's shadow budget, the more a majority of voters is likely to appreciate the transfers proposed. The Conservatives need a knock-out punch. The campaign against Labour's wider spending plans is to be that punch. The items they enumerate in support of their case against Labour profligacy include commitments to: increased basic pensions, costed at Pounds 2,700m; equalisation of pension age at 60, costed at Pounds 3,000m; uprating of pensions in line with earnings, costed at Pounds 2,100m; improved and extended invalid allowances, costed at Pounds 2,140m; disability benefits, costed at Pounds 1,300m; increased child benefit, costed at Pounds 730m; increased spending on National Health Service, costed at Pounds 3,000m; increased investment in housing, costed at Pounds 3,000m; a high-speed rail network linking every region to the Channel Tunnel, costed at Pounds 3,000m; improved public transport for London, costed at Pounds 550m; increase in share of GDP spent on education to 1979 level, costed at Pounds 2,600m; reaching the aid target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, costed at Pounds 2,500m; increased powers for local authorities, costed at Pounds 3,000m; implementation of the European Social Charter, costed at Pounds 600m; and improved public sector pay and conditions, and introduction of a statutory minimum wage, costed at Pounds 3,600m. To this lengthy list, the Conservatives add another 22 items, costed at Pounds 4,075m, ranging all the way from improved legal aid (Pounds 115m), to increased spending on training (Pounds 200m), via free eye tests (Pounds 165m) and funeral payments (Pounds 80m). Yet what Mr Smith has definitively proposed would be an increase in public spending of only Pounds 6.8bn in 1993-94. Specified items would be the increase in the weekly state retirement pension by Pounds 5 for a single person and Pounds 8 for a couple, costing Pounds 2.3bn in a full year, and the increase in child benefit to Pounds 9.95 for all children, costing Pounds 750m in a full year. The Pounds 3.5bn left over from the shadow chancellor's proposed increase in net taxation would then go on health, education 'and other vital public services'. Included in Mr Smith's sums are immediate implementation of a Pounds 1.1bn 'Recovery Programme', embracing: enhanced first year capital allowances in manufacturing; measures to help small business; a new skills fund and restoration of cuts in Employment Training and Youth Training; a job experience programme for the unemployed; phased release of capital receipts held by local authorities from the sale of council houses; and a pilot leasing programme for British Rail. How plausible, against this, is the Conservative complaint of a not-so-hidden Labour party spending agenda? That Labour has intentions in all the areas listed by the Conservatives - some more, some less specific - is clear. But many of the costings must be doubted. Would increased powers for local authorities, for example, really cost Pounds 3bn? Would improved public sector pay and the implementation of the national minimum wage cost Pounds 3.6bn? Would a high speed rail link to the Channel Tunnel cost Pounds 3bn in a single year in the life of the next parliament? None of these numbers looks compelling. Nevertheless, Conservative charges cannot be ignored. Labour has many commitments in its programme and they will cost money. Where might it come from? Could Labour rely on the 'growth dividend' to fund substantial further increases in public spending? The plausible answer is 'no'. If Mr Smith goes to the Treasury cupboard, he is likely to find that it is already bare. The charts give the background, including forecasts based on the Financial Statement and Budget Report of 1992-93. The government's forecasts imply an increase in the share of non-north sea taxation in GDP, as the recovery takes hold. The current rise in public spending as a share of GDP is explained in large measure by the recession, as was the case in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. Nevertheless, the share of public spending in GDP would remain below levels reached between 1973-74 and 1986-87. The ratio is also expected to fall after 1993-94, but the public sector borrowing requirement will still not go below 3 per cent of GDP, the benchmark level agreed at Maastrich for the path to economic and monetary union, before 1995-96. What then might be the effect of a Labour government? Suppose, first, that Labour only increased public spending and taxation by the amounts already announced, plus the notional tax reductions pencilled in by the government for 1995-96 and 1996-97. The result, as shown. would be only modestly above the government's forecasts. Suppose, second, that the Conservatives were right about Labour's agenda. On the Treasury's assumption about economic growth, public spending would rise to at least 46 per cent of GDP. This is, it should be noted, no implausible figure. The burden would then still be lower than in both the mid-1970s and the early 1980s. But it would be at least 6 percentage points higher than the Conservatives forecast, possibly optimistically, for themselves. Nothing suggests that recovery would be faster under Labour than the Conservatives. Neither is the economy likely to do better than the Treasury now forecasts: economic growth at an average of 3 per cent a year between 1991-92 and 1996-97 period. This is as fast as the recovery from the last recession, even though there is to be no sterling devaluation this time, while real interest rates are high and the personal sector remains highly indebted. Even with such a recovery, public spending at 46 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 would not prove consistent with the Maastricht target, which is for a public deficit of 3 per cent of GDP in a normal year, absent tax increases. Without the government's proposed tax cuts in 1995-96 and 1996-97, but with Mr Smith's proposed tax increases, general government receipts would be about 40 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1996-97, on the Treasury assumptions for economic growth. This would imply an overall deficit - under full implementation of Labour promises, as costed by the Conservatives - of 5-6 per cent of GDP. To reduce that deficit to the target of 3 per cent of GDP would require not the tax increases that the Conservative are suggesting, but perhaps half that amount. The reason for the difference is that the Conservatives say they want to lower the borrowing requirement to  3/4 per cent of GDP by 1996-97, while Labour might stick to the Maastricht 3 per cent. Nevertheless, even with the hoped for recovery, Labour could not implement all its dreams without extra taxation of perhaps 2-3 per cent of GDP, equivalent to 6p on the basic rate of tax. Yet this is far from the worst possibility. What would happen if real economic growth were to average only 2 per cent over the next five years, not 3 per cent? Other things equal, revenue in 1996-97 might then be more than Pounds 15bn less than is now forecast by the Treasury for that year. Even ignoring the effects of lower growth on public spending itself, that would mean a PSBR at about 3 per cent of GDP. For a Labour party trying to meet all of its aspirations, the deficit might be 7-8 per cent of GDP. Underneath the smoke is a genuine battle. On plausible assumptions, the growth dividend may have already been fully spoken for by the government. If growth does not pick up as hoped, it may be impossible to enjoy increases in government spending above those already planned, without breaching the limit agreed at Maastricht. Even if growth were to be as fast as hoped, Labour might still have to choose between all the spending it desires and higher taxes. If Labour were determined to spend substantially more in real terms than it has already announced in its shadow budget, further tax increases do, indeed, look likely. Alternatively, Labour supporters will end up discontented. Conservative charges may be wildly aimed, but they are not entirely off the mark.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Balladur's rocky road to the Elysee: The PM's presidential hopes have been undermined Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's latest climbdown, over youth wage cuts, has triggered a period of political instability that will probably last until next May's presidential election. Supporters of Mr Jacques Chirac, Mr Balladur's rival for the Elysee, now smell blood. The triumphant students and the revived left-wing opposition have been crowing their victory over the prime minister, but more dangerous have been the calls for ministerial resignations coming from within the RPR Gaullist party to which Mr Balladur belongs, but which Mr Chirac heads. Most of the fire is directed at Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, who only a few days ago was claiming the government would stand as solidly in defence of its youth wage law as the French army did against the Germans at Verdun. But as the 'Chiraquiens' know well, Mr Giraud's successive tergiversations on employment policy are also those of his prime minister, and therefore the latter cannot decently sacrifice him without jeopardising further his own credibility. In terms of social unrest, the worst may be past for Mr Balladur. Calm may now return to the streets, though this is not certain if Air France staff take a page out of the students' exercise book and reject the government-supported restructuring for the ailing airline. As far as the economy is concerned, the worst is probably past too. Economic activity is continuing its very slow, but progressive, recovery from last year's trough. But the sight of a dejected Mr Balladur marking his first anniversary at the Matignon with a humiliating retreat has reinforced the feeling of many in the RPR party machine that they should stick with their founder-president, Mr Chirac, for 1995. So, whatever happened to Mr Balladur, the self-styled reformer riding so high in the polls? In a document designed to vaunt the achievements of his first year, the prime minister himself identifies his three problems. 'Public opinion which both desires and recoils from reform.' Mr Balladur had little problem with some reforms, notably giving the Bank of France independence in setting monetary policy and in launching his privatisation programme, though he has made the task of preparing more state companies for sale harder this week by extending until the end of the year his freeze on public sector redundancies. But on educational and labour reform, he has hit nothing but trouble, even though some reform is long overdue; parts of the employment law, which was passed last autumn but which has taken such a battering since, are designed to overhaul labour legislation dating back to the Popular Front in 1936-7. The upshot has been to reinforce Mr Balladur's natural caution, with the inevitable result that the pace of reform will be slowed in endless consultations. 'The economic situation, even if it improves, deprives us of the necessary budgetary and social room for manoeuvre.' Latterly, Mr Balladur has seemed to be paying scant attention to his budgetary constraint as he has successively bought off French farmers, state school teachers, fishermen, and now - in a manner of speaking - students. His FFr1,000-FFr2,000 (Pounds 117-Pounds 235) a month subsidy to employers giving young people their first job may cost FFr6bn this year. At the same time Mr Balladur has pledged to rein in steadily public spending in order to fit France for the future disciplines of European monetary union. This task is rendered more difficult by his decision, with an eye to running in 1995 on a strong defence platform, to raise slightly military equipment spending. Where is his political 'hush' money to come from? Privatisation is the obvious, but not inexhaustible, source now that Mr Balladur has postponed the sale of Renault. Mr Balladur is known to be frustrated at the Bank of France's cautious policy on interest rates, and must therefore have been pleased when the central bank on Thursday sliced another 0.1 point off its intervention rate to bring it down to 5.9 per cent. Though he would never say so publicly, he is almost certainly in agreement with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's recent call for French rates to come down further and faster. 'The presidential election campaign is weighing too early on people's minds.' Mr Balladur could, of course, deal with this problem simply by announcing that he is not a candidate for the Elysee, leaving the pundits only the minor pleasure of speculating about which Socialist candidate (probably Mr Michel Rocard) gets to be beaten by Mr Chirac. No one who saw Mr Balladur look so demoralised this week would rule such an announcement out. But next week he is visiting China. All his forays, unusual for a French prime minister, into foreign and defence policy indicate his persistent interest in the ultimate prize in French politics. No one knows how the Balladur-Chirac rivalry will play out, in the probable absence of any clean-cut mechanism like a US-style primary election taking place in France. One theory has it that only by climbing back in the opinion polls to where he was last year - which now seems improbable - can Mr Balladur displace Mr Chirac's natural hold over the RPR. But Mr Balladur has one ace - the centre-right UDF party among which he is more popular than among his own Gaullist ranks. If the UDF were to tell the RPR that the French right must field a single candidate, so as to avoid past divisions, and that that candidate must be Mr Balladur, this prime minister might still recover to go on to higher things next year.</p>

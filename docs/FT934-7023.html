			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Russia and its neighbours When President Boris Yeltsin suggested, earlier this year, that the UN should grant Russia 'special powers' to guarantee peace and stability in the former Soviet Union, he got a frosty reception outside his own country. Since then, public debate in the west has focused on Russia's internal affairs. Is Mr Yeltsin a democrat? What are the chances of real economic reform? These have been the central preoccupations of both analysts and decision-makers. No doubt that is correct. In the long run a democratic, market-oriented Russia would be a far more congenial and constructive member of the much-touted 'international community' than one that relapsed into dictatorship and state control. But that does not mean foreign policy is perfect so long as Mr Yeltsin remains in power, still less that western governments should ignore it. Indeed, they are now being invited to take an interest in it by the Russian foreign minister, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, who has revived Mr Yeltsin's proposal in more diplomatic language. Instability Mr Kozyrev points out that many of Russia's southern neighbours are wracked by internal conflicts and two (Armenia and Azerbaijan) are at war with each other. Russia, he says, cannot ignore such widespread instability on its borders, or its effect on the 25m ethnic Russians who now live as minorities in non-Russian states. Russia is blamed for not paying its share of the cost of peacekeeping operations elsewhere in the world, while other powers, already stretched and baffled by Bosnia and Somalia, are clearly reluctant to do much about similar problems in the former Soviet Union. There Russia, joined sometimes by other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is willing to do the job, but looks to the UN for political and financial support. And, Mr Kozyrev concludes in a seductive sotto voce, his own ministry would specially welcome UN involvement, as a way of strengthening civilian control over the Russian forces deployed. The worst way for western governments to react to these overtures would be to ignore them. That would convince Russians that the west was washing its hands of the region, and effectively giving them carte blanche to solve its problems on their own as best they can. On the contrary, the west should welcome the chance to monitor, and indeed to influence, Russian behaviour in the region. Official observers, whether from the UN or from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), could be a useful instrument for this. Acceptable role But if such organisations are to be involved, their members must make it very clear what they regard as an acceptable role for Russia, and what they do not. Where Russia is able and willing to play a genuinely impartial peacekeeping role there may be a case for setting off the cost against its UN arrears, which it is anyway unlikely to pay. But it would be grotesquely misleading to describe units such as the 14th army in Moldova or the 201st rifle division in Tajikistan as 'peacekeeping forces'. The former is the main armed force of the breakaway Transdniestrian region, while the latter is propping up a regime run by veteran communists and guarding the frontier against its opponents, who have fled into Afghanistan and are being radicalised into anti-Russian Islamic militants. Russia must be expected to assert its interests in a region of obvious strategic importance to it. But it should not be encouraged to do so by deploying military force in the guise of an 'impartial' peacekeeper. Nor should it be recognised as protector of all ethnic Russians, still less of all Russian-speakers, outside its borders. The ethnic composition of virtually all the ex-Soviet republics, and most conspicuously of Russia itself, requires all governments in the region to be very sensitive in their treatment of minorities. Where external help is required with this it should be provided on a multilateral basis, notably through the CSCE's High Commissioner on National Minorities, Mr Max van der Stoel, rather than by ethnic 'kin-states' whose intervention is more likely to exacerbate such tensions than to allay them.</p>

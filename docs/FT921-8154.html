			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: European plumbing awaits Wolseley touch - The Midlands-based group's expansion plans after the Brossette buy WHEN Wolseley, the Midlands-based heating and plumbing distributor, decided to investigate France, its two-man acquisition team prepared a short list of possible takeover candidates. Written beside Brossette, France's leading heating and plumbing supplier, was a single word: Bullseye. Some 18 months later, and about six months after Brossette was put up for sale by the Brossette family, Wolseley is paying FFr931m (Pounds 95m) for the French company. The acquisition, to be paid partly in shares, will push Wolseley's market capitalisation over Pounds 900m. It is a tidy deal. Brossette and Wolseley both mainly supply trade customers in their respective markets. Both rely on service and have started to introduce branded products. They have also invested heavily in computer systems to improve distribution. Analysts are divided as to whether the takeover will accelerate Wolseley's earnings in the short term. Pre-tax profits are expected to remain static at Pounds 80m in the year to end-July, but most agree Wolseley now has the opportunity to extend its leadership of the UK and US markets to France, and possibly further into Europe. Expansion, and the new European focus, add extra chips when Wolseley bargains about costs with its suppliers. Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman, says: 'We genuinely don't think this will do much to our earnings stream over the next two or three years. But if we were talking in ten years time, I can't see how this can fail to add to our value.' Mr Lancaster joined Wolseley in 1961, when the company was mainly involved in manufacturing. As central heating increased in popularity in the 1960s, Wolseley developed a branch network and became known as a specialist distributor of central heating supplies. In the 1970s it moved into plumbing distribution and built up the 211-branch Plumb Centre network. It has also moved into building distribution, through its 72-branch Builder Centre chain. Wolseley then went to the US, acquiring the eighth largest building supplies distributor, Ferguson Enterprises, which is now number one. Mr Lancaster, who took over as chairman from his father in 1976, is dismissive of 1980s short-termism and points to his handwritten profit and loss accounts which detail the company's progress over the last 30 years. 'If you have ideas above your station you're dead in the water. This is not a fancy business,' he says. Wolseley's optimism for Europe is based on two premises; European markets for plumbing and heating supplies will become more integrated and Wolseley's takeover strategy, successful in the US, can be repeated in a non-English speaking environment. Wolseley launched its European ambitions about three years ago, before recession hit earnings in the UK and US. During the 1980s it was faced with a maturing UK market. Yet its US acquisitions, Ferguson and Familian, were adding branches and increasing turnover by more than 15 per cent annually. 'The UK is too small compared to the US. One of the attractions of Europe is that we now have the prospect of strongly growing our US side and strongly growing in Europe too,' Mr Lancaster says. Wolseley also needed to respond to moves among its suppliers. Companies like Blue Circle, Pilkington and Steetley were already in continental Europe, or preparing European strategies. Wolseley wanted to move in tandem with these suppliers so it could remain on the same footing. Brossette is a well established company, with 176 branches throughout France. It is expected to announce pre-tax profits of at least FFr101.4m for 1991, compared with the Pounds 40m operating profits made by Wolseley's UK distribution business. The takeover will mirror Wolseley's US acquisitions. A senior manager will join Brossette as Wolseley's contact man, but the French company will remain largely independent. Mr Pierre Brossette is staying on as president, at least for the next few years. 'We've made it very clear to the French we will never put an English guy in to run them,' Mr Lancaster says. There will be some changes as the companies become familiar with each other's operations. Brossette is weak around Paris and a new Belgian operation may be developed further. 'They have expanded very rapidly in the last three or four years and they haven't yet got that sorted out, so I hope we can help them there.' Europe's markets for heating and plumbing supplies are diverse. Companies like Wolseley and Brossette have built leading positions in the UK and France, but the German and Spanish markets are more localised. Although suppliers are thinking about the unified European market, there is still little cross-over among suppliers even for France and the UK. And standards on heating and plumbing equipment are not yet standardised. As these markets become more integrated during the next 10 years, costs should come down and companies which depend on efficient distribution and service will be able to penetrate the more localised markets. Lower costs will help lift Brossette's margins, which at 4 per cent fall below the 7 to 10 per cent Wolseley generates in the UK. The main reason for the difference is France's higher labour costs. Mr Lancaster hopes Brossette's margins will increase to about 6 per cent. But he admits this will take several years. Wolseley's wider European strategy remains undecided. The company will obviously concentrate on Brossette in the immediate future before looking further afield. Brossette has already investigated opportunities in Spain. 'Spain is a more fragmented market as more business is done direct with the manufacturer. But specialisation will come because it is the best way to manage a market. As places like Spain develop, I think we can be the pioneers,' Mr Lancaster says.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CREW WORKING THE LATE SHIFT TO LAY NEW TRACKS ON SECTION OF COASTAL RAIL ROUTE  </P> <P> Sound carries far in the cold, clear nights of winter, so many residents of  northern San Diego County have awakened in the wee hours to ponder what all the  noise is about.  </P> <P> Not to worry. It's just a team of 210 workers replacing decades-old railway  track with brand-new spans of steel along the 52-mile stretch of Santa Fe  Railway from San Juan Capistrano to Sorrento Valley, south of Del Mar.  </P> <P> The crew and about 70 machines work in the dark -- from about 9 p.m. until 4:30  a.m. -- in a coordinated fashion that allows them to progress two or three  miles by dawn and lets passenger trains keep their busy daytime schedules.  </P> <P> The $45-million project will improve the ride and allow Amtrak trains to  maintain their 90-m.p.h. speeds on the Los Angeles-to-San Diego run, the most  profitable passenger corridor in the country.  </P> <P> Mike Martin, spokesman for Santa Fe, said the old track, laid in 1940-41, had  deteriorated to a point where safety concerns dictated that new track be laid  or train speeds be cut in half.  </P> <P> The new rail sections are 1,440 feet long -- more than a quarter-mile -- and  are welded into seamless spans. The rails are built in one piece and  transported to the site by special train.  </P> <P> The result may give nostalgia buffs a few pangs because the clickety-clack of  the passing trains, produced when wheels strike unwelded joints of existing  39-foot-long track sections, will go the way of the mournful steam whistle.  </P> <P> The project began after Thanksgiving and was scheduled to be completed before  Christmas. But because of delays caused by the weather and because equipment  must be removed each morning and replaced at night, work is continuing.  </P> <P> High-powered lights illuminate the work site, and the clang of mechanical  hammers echoes through the night, silenced only by the dawn.  </P> <P> Many of the crew members are Navajos, long known as skilled track layers.  </P> <P> As the crew moves south along the coastal bluffs and lagoons, they sometimes  attract irate onlookers -- residents who apparently missed the announcements of  the project published in local papers and are upset at the racket.  </P> <P> Also inconvenienced by the project are Amtrak riders who take late-evening  trains. The 8:45 p.m. trains from Los Angeles and San Diego turn into buses  between San Diego and San Juan Capistrano, dropping off passengers at each  train station along the way.  </P></p>

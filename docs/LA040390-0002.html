			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The weakness of the 1990 federal census is that it really won't give Angelenos  an idea of how they compare with the rest of the nation in several crucial  life-style categories.  </P> <P> For instance, a Security Pacific Bank study found that more than one out of  every two residents take vitamins, that 548,000 Angelenos bought backpacking  equipment over a 12-month period (and 228,000 of them never took it out of the  closet) and, perhaps most shocking, that only about 10% of the male population  bought new bathing trunks each year.  </P> <P> So how do we rank nationwide in these categories? Are the bathing suits of  Cleveland men less worn and frazzled?  </P> <P> The 1990 census will offer no clue.  </P> <P> The same with surfboard ownership. And what about poodles? L.A. has licensed  more than 16,000 of the grumpy little designer dogs. But most other cities  don't break their figures down by breed, so L.A.'s ranking is unknown.  </P> <P> And then there's the sunglasses issue. Some manufacturers say that Seattle  ranks No. 1 in the nation in per capita purchases.  </P> <P> Such a claim, if true, would seem to be an insult to the L.A. Convention and  Visitors Bureau (or is it Visitors and Convention Bureau?).  </P> <P> Not necessarily, though. Seattleites buy more, the theory goes, because they  tend to lose their shades during the many rainy periods. But we won't know for  sure. Maybe the 2000 census will address these issues.  </P> <P> In the meantime, don't forget to take your vitamins.  </P> <P> Just the other day, the city rejected a bid by local disc jockeys Mark and  Brian to paint the HOLLYWOOD sign green for St. Patrick's Day.  </P> <P> Someone couldn't let April Fools' Day pass without editing the 68-year-old  landmark, though. Police said pranksters used a camouflage parachute "and  twisted it around the first 'O"' to make the sign read: "HALLYWOOD."  </P> <P> A suspicious sort might point out that Sunday also marked the debut of the HA!  cable comedy network.  </P> <P> You may recall that a few months ago "Only in L.A." gave readers an exclusive  look at the secret life-style of Lassie, who is generally shielded from the  media by a team of press agents.  </P> <P> Though the dog has the female lead in a TV series, Lassie is actually a male.  What's more, the collie virtually refuses to perform on camera unless his young  mistress, Falcon, is seated nearby.  </P> <P> Now comes the news that a Beverly Hills interior design company has created a  7-foot-long, 6-foot-high, two-story Scottish manor house for Lassie. No word  yet on whether Falcon will move in.  </P> <P> The dog palace, a spokesman pointed out, contains "murals depicting antique  bookcases filled with Lassie's ball collection" as well as photos of his/her  favorite industry friends, "including Rin Tin Tin and Flipper."  </P> <P> Conspicuously absent, though, were shots of Morris the Cat. She and Lassie  feuded for years.  </P> <P> MiscelLAny:  </P> <P> A car or truck is stolen in L.A. at the rate of one every eight minutes.  </P></p>

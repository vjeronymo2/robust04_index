			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Venezuela restored some civil liberties, including the right to hold public  protests, that were suspended Feb. 28 to quell nationwide price riots that  claimed more than 250 lives. Soldiers will continue to patrol main avenues in  Caracas, the capital, and in other cities until "the situation is totally  normalized," government information director Pastor Heydra said. Restored  liberties include press freedom, the right to gather in public and the right to  travel inside and outside of Venezuela.  </P></p>

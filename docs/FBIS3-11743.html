Although their spying activities were initiated on 1  January,  they were reinforced as of 1 February. They have been  intercepting and copying the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation  Army] messages in the jungle, the mountains, and the city  through short wave radio. By using laser systems in the sending  and receiving of sound waves, high sensitivity microphones, and  satellites they were able to detect the messages and the exact  location of the Zapatist delegation and "subcommander Marcos"  within the cathedral during the peace dialogue.    With this same system military intelligence reportedly had  knowledge of the guerrilla delegates' private conversations,  their plans, and agreements. A Mexican Army officer, who  requested to remain anonymous for security reasons, confirmed  the spy actions. Not even Camacho knows that we know everything  he said. We know everything. The only thing we do not know is  what the Zapatists were thinking, he said.    He explained that Military Intelligence used communications  technology imported from the United States and Asia and  installed a sound tracking system. With the help of a Peace  Cathedral blueprint, and with the use of a laser, the  dormitories of the EZLN delegates of the "subcommander Marcos"  as well as the dining and meeting areas were located.    The sound waves reached us through a laser that was sent to  the interior of the cathedral. The laser is sent and it returns,  picking up sounds, words, sentences, and whole conversations,  the officer added.    The espionage's objective was the cathedral where the  negotiations between Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis, the 18  guerrilla delegates, and Bishop Samuel Ruiz were held. The  officer explained that on military bases there are desks with  communication radios, scanners, and telephones. Parabolic  antennas as well as reading monitors, and microphone recording  equipment -- called "little birds" ["pajaritos"] -- that read  the sounds inside the cathedral are located on other bases.    Four Military Intelligence members are engaged in 24-hour  shifts at each base. They carry earphones and maintain constant  communication with the main base. With the highly sensitive  systems they collect information. Military personnel write up  daily reports on the conversations. These are subsequently sent  to the 7th Military Region located in Tuxtla Gutierrez. The  same information is sent to National Defense Secretary Antonio  Riviello Bazan. In espionage houses, not identified by the  officer, monitors receive the sound waves.    "The system used during the dialogue currently includes very  sophisticated microphones that are placed in the exterior walls  of the Peace Cathedral. These are well hidden and they are able  to receive information through the walls," the informer added.  Besides the espionage activity, the guerrillas' communications  in the jungle and in the mountains are being monitored.</p>

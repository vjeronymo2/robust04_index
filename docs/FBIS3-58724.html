			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Simon Jenkins: "Where Next for NATO?"] </F>   [Text] Lift your eyes for a moment from "back to basics"  at home. Consider "back to basics" abroad. "You are risking a  third world war," said the Russian demagogue Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy of this week's NATO summit. Are we? If so, we  should be told. The seeds of appeasement are sown in every  vague communique.    President Clinton's exasperated speech in Brussels on Monday  [10 January] was understandable. Stripped of diplomacy it said:  you Europeans twitter on about collective security, yet you do  nothing about Bosnia. You want us to give you guarantees of  intervention when things go wrong, but you do nothing to keep  them right. You are all over the shop. You want us to push the  NATO border farther east. Then you want us to deter Russian  neo-imperialism. Well too bad. We are more interested in Japan  and China. We shall deal with Russia our way. You can comfort  the small fry.    At this point, blood drains from Europe's cheeks. Douglas  Hurd mutters that he might drop a little bomb on Bosnia to show  his machismo. But beggars can't be choosers. The rock on which  NATO rests is the old American willingness to fight anybody who  threatens to tear Europe apart. The willingness was activated  twice this century, against Germany. It was activated a third  time when NATO was set up, to defend West Europe against Russia.  It has now been requested by the former communist countries of  East Europe against the same threat. As a Polish ambassador  said on Monday, "We are lost in a grey zone. We have no allies,  no guarantees."    Let us go back to an argument in Washington 45 years ago.  It was between the drafters of the NATO treaty and the Senate  foreign relations committee. It was blunt. Europe wanted the  Americans to promise to go to war again if any NATO member was  attacked. The American response was, "Er, um, perhaps, if..."  Only Congress could declare war. Why not offer "measures"  rather than "military action." The Europeans, led by the  British ambassador, Sir Oliver Franks, said this was not good  enough. A less than wholehearted commitment might satisfy the  allies, but it would signal disastrous weakness to the Russians.  NATO security should mean what it said, and say what it meant.    The outcome was the famous Franks-Acheson Article five of  the  NATO treaty. An attack on one member of NATO "shall be  considered an armed attack against them all." In the event of  such attack, each member will "forthwith" take action to resist  it. This pledge was backed with American troops on the ground  and with often hysterical American demonology of Russians. The  American people had to accept the catastrophic implication of  the pledge, even where there was no threat to American soil. At  the formal signing of the NATO treaty, a marine band played "It  ain't necessarily so." Yet who can doubt that article five did  more than anything to keep the Cold War cool?    A year ago, the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev,  made what was treated as a satirical speech. He warned the West  not to take Russian liberalism for granted. Just imagine, he  said with a smile, if Boris Yeltsin were hamstrung by  reactionaries in Parliament. Imagine a surge of Russian  nationalism under a demagogue. Imagine a movement to push the  Russian frontier back to that of the old Soviet Union and even  beyond. Imagine a huge and disaffected Russian army summoned to  support all Slavs against oppression. He said this in December  1992. We laughed.    I wonder how history will see that speech, which has all but  come true within 12 months. If I were a Lithuanian or a  Ukrainian, a Pole or a Slovak, I would be more than jittery at  the rise of Mr Zhirinovskiy and the ambivalence of the Russian  generals. I would look urgently for a powerful ally. Hence the  request to join NATO.    Some NATO members have sympathised. America has not.  Washington's Realpolitik, led by the Deputy Secretary of State,  Strobe Talbott, will do nothing that might undermine President  Yeltsin. Any advance of the NATO guarantee near to, even up to,  the Russian border would, we are told, strengthen opposition to  Mr Yeltsin. More ominous, it would be dishonest. The American  people would not accept their troops confronting a Russian  Blitzkrieg through Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine or Moldova. They  would not do so even if the tanks rolled on into Poland or  Slovakia. Nothing has changed since 1956 or 1968. Americans  might be upset, as they were over Afghanistan. But upset  Americans do not stop tanks.    Military strategists are now realising that the  unthinkability of nuclear weapons has made limited conventional  war more plausible. Europeans are killing each other with  bayonets and hand grenades. The deterrent is losing its bite. A  battle to stop a Russian army advancing into the Baltics or  Poland would at first be conventional and extremely messy. It  would require huge numbers of soldiers with logistical support.  It might ultimately require tactical nuclear deterrence.  Without America, such conflict would be vulnerable to every  20th-century horror: Russian victory, German expansion, the  spread of Balkan atrocities, the rise of dictatorship, mass  migration of refugees.    America is deaf to such alarmism. It is led by a neo-  Orientalist president, a partly isolationist Congress and a  pathological fear of military casualties overseas. Hence the  formula put together in Washington to fob off the new  applicants: a Partnership for Peace with no security guarantee.  Hence the stalling ideas of new applicants "proving their  democratic credentials," of NATO becoming a united services club  for military co-operation and bonhomie, embracing even Russia.  This is like saying to a sinking ship that it can have a  lifeboat only if it makes it first to port. This is not the  NATO that Lithuania wants to join. It want NATO's territorial  guarantee at its shoulder now.    What is happening is a rerun of the old argument between  Franks, Dean Acheson and the Senate in 1949. Then a young  senator, Tom Connally, taunted the Europeans that their demand  was to "Do anything you want to do, you need not worry; as soon  as anything happens we will come over and fight your quarrel for  you." The Europeans won that argument. They persuaded America  that if it said yes to a NATO guarantee, Europe's quarrels would  never come to a fight. Throughout the Cold War they were right.    Now we have a fight in the former Yugoslavia. Europe  refuses, in my view rightly, to see Bosnia as a matter of  collective security. It does not regard Serbia or Croatia as  comparable to the threat that Russia might pose to democracy in  East Europe. NATO might have a role as "moral mercenary" in  what was Yugoslavia, but that has no bearing on its central  role. America disagrees. It sees Bosnia as a real test of  Europe's ability to act together to sort out a quarrel before  running across the Atlantic to nanny. Hence the endless  bickering about air strikes.    I am with Europe. Article five was a commitment by America  to defend Western democracies (and some dictatorships) against  external attack. Such was its success that the number of the  democracies has increased. So why not increase the boundary of  the commitment? The answer is that America's initial hesitancy  about committing itself to a European conflict has revived at  just the moment when such a conflict has once again become  remotely conceivable. Washington shudders at the thought, as  Britain shuddered in 1938.    So Russia must be appeased. Russians must not be subjected  to further psychological bruising. This might be  counterproductive. The grey zone countries may be vulnerable,  but invasion has always been their fate. Ask Tolstoy. Ask  Chamberlain. If war breaks out around Russia's borders, blame  history.    Perhaps the Americans are right. Perhaps the Russian threat  is not enough to risk inflaming the isolationism of Congress.  Perhaps the moment when a new line needs to be drawn across  Europe has not arrived, and we can comfort ourselves with  Santayana's well-founded belief that in the depths of every  American heart lies goodwill to the world. But in diplomacy,  timing is all. Europe is bad at timing. So remember Mr  Kozyrev's speech.</p>

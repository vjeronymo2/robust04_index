			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Somalia peace talks closer after US attack GENERAL Mohamed Farrar Aideed, Somalia's strongest warlord, last night caved in to pressure and agreed a tentative outline for a national peace conference after US Marines dealt him a devastating military blow in Mogadishu. Delegates at the exploratory Somali peace talks in the Ethiopian capital said the 57-year-old general, who has been blocking agreement between 15 factions since Monday, had finally agreed to three out of a five point proposal. The points accepted include an immediate nationwide cease fire and the convening of a national political reconciliation conference either in Mogadishu or Addis Ababa in late April. Yet to be agreed are a list of participants to the conference and an agenda. The breakthrough came after US Marines, backed by M1-A1 tanks and Cobra helicopter gun ships, blasted two compounds housing gunmen loyal to Gen Aideed and captured an arsenal of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, battle wagons and heavy artillery pieces. Delegates said both the US military action in Mogadishu and an eleventh hour intervention by Mr Meles Zenawi, the Ethiopian President, had persuaded Gen Aideed that if he did not join the growing consensus at the exploratory peace conference he would be completely isolated. But they warned that Gen Aideed could easily reverse his position. 'He has agreed tonight because of the pressure he is under,' said Mr Mohamed Farrar Siad, a member of self styled interim President Ali Mahdi's delegation. 'But the problem remains that Aideed wants the presidency and everything decided here could affect that ambition. He could change his face tomorrow ..we are in dialogue with an abnormal person.' Yesterday's dawn assault in northwest Mogadishu, which saw a 20 minute exchange of fire, was the most biggest military strike by US forces since they landed in Somalia last month and marks a new 'get tough' approach to Somalia's armed factions. There were no figures available last night for the number of casualties on the Somali side, but one Marine was wounded. Hours before the last minute agreement delegates from other factions could hardly hide their joy at the way the general's wings had been clipped by US forces. 'Good,' said Mr Ali Mahdi, Somalia's self-styled interim president and Gen Aideed's arch rival. 'It's very nice.' The warlords and political leaders are expected to sign a commitment today to hold a reconciliation conference but it is possible agreement may take several more days.</p>

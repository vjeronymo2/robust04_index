			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Travel: The rebirth of a bombed-out city - James Bentley visits Dresden and discovers that it is fast returning to its Baroque spleandour DURING THE second world war the citizens of Dresden considered themselves deliberately spared from the worst effects of the conflict. They welcomed refugees, evacuees and the wounded. Then, on the night of February 13 1945, allied aircraft turned the city into a fire bomb. Perhaps 60,000 people died, perhaps 130,000. Sixty per cent of the city was destroyed. For two days after the bombing the heat remained so intense that survivors dared not emerge from their cellars. The Frauenkirche - its 95-metre baroque dome was part of the characteristic silhouette of Dresden - remained standing. But inside, the eight columns supporting its roof were melting. After two days the church collapsed. What was saved of the city was cherished, even under communist rule. As soon as the communists departed, the pace of restoration quickened. The communist regime had decided to preserve the Frauenkirche as a ruin, a memorial to the bombing. Now Dresden plans to restore it to its original baroque splendour. Dresden is no longer a symbol of second world war devastation, nor of communist dreariness. The Georgij Dimitroff bridge, named after an obscure socialist theoretician, has been given back its proper name and is once more the Augustus bridge, named after Augustus the Strong, who had it built. So many street names were changed after the Russians departed that the joke was you went to bed in one street and woke up in another. Four years ago, industrial pollution had covered much of the city in a crust of soot. Today the pollution is no more and once again Dresden gleams. It is an east German city reborn. Augustus the Strong gave Dresden its baroque face. He also sired 17 legitimate children and several hundred illegitimate ones. A Protestant, he turned Roman Catholic when elected King of Poland in 1697. His gilded statue stands at one end of the Augustus bridge, an elegant structure with long arches and bastion-like refuges where you can pause to admire the River Elbe and the celebrated Canaletto view of the far side of the river. Across the bridge rises his sinuous court church, commissioned from the Italian architect Gaetano Chiaveri and built in the Italian late-baroque style. Ruined in 1945, its interior once again glitters, especially the ceiling frescos, the gilded pulpit and above all Gottfried Silbermann's 3,000-pipe organ. Its tower is scaffolded, soon to be restored to its former splendour, to rise above the building as it did from the early 18th century. Since most of Augustus the Strong's Dresden subjects remained Protestant, this court church is an oddity, designed so that on feast days the Catholics could process inside the building, to avoid being stoned by their religious opponents if they ventured outside. The court church also incorporates the royal mausoleum. The mortal remains of the Saxon royal house lie in bronze tombs. Only Augustus's heart is here, in a bronze container. It is said to flutter whenever a pretty woman passes by. West of the church stands Dresden's greatest treasure, the Zwinger palace. This, too, was built because of a conflagration, an earlier one than that caused by allied bombing. Dresden was gutted by a disastrous fire in 1685. Among the architects brought to rebuild the inner city by Augustus the Strong was the brilliant Matthaus Daniel Poppelmann. Augustus made him sculptor-architect to the court in 1704. Work began on the Zwinger in 1709. Initially, Poppelmann intended a much larger palace. What he left is an outdoor theatre: a square court, the ends U-shaped and closed with glass pavilions. Poppelmann seductively alleviated the severity of this design with luxurious curves, balconies, staircases, urns and statues. No-one ever lived in the Zwinger. Its purpose, quite simply, was to serve as a royal playground, its orangery to store in winter the plants which in summer would grace the grounds. Here were mounted dances, tournaments, opera  -any form of royal entertainment. Immense damage was inflicted on this palace in 1945. It has been almost completely restored. Go through the archway of the town pavilion (Stadtpavilion) and immediately turn round to spy a Glockenspiel whose bells are made of Meissen pottery. Augustus commissioned it, but no-one managed to create it successfully until the 20th century. The crossed swords carved above the Glockenspiel are the symbol of Meissen porcelain. Poppelmann was exceptionally fortunate that one of his collaborators was the Bavarian sculptor Balthasar Permoser. The statues of the Four Seasons on the Kronentor, or Crown Gate, as well as the drummer sculpted on its internal face, are his work. But you see him at his most brilliant in the rococo fountain of the three nymphs in the Zwinger palace. Here, out of stone, Permoser created diaphanously-clad luscious ladies. Since in winter the water freezes, the fountain of the nymphs has to be turned off. To cope artistically with this, Permoser and his assistants carved on its basin seaweed, moss, fishes and stones which appear to drip with water even when none is flowing. Not long ago all this was sootily black. In the past three years it has been exquisitely cleaned, another part of Dresden reborn. Poppelmann planned to create what he himself described as 'a stroll in the middle of the city which would delight the most refined ladies and gentlemen of the court.' But he never finished the Zwinger palace. His style fell out of favour, and work ceased in 1732. The north-east wing, the picture gallery, was added only in 1847 by the classical architect Gottfried Semper. Today it houses one of the most important collections of old masters in Germany. At the other side of the bridge, Augustus and his prancing steed look along pedestrianised, sensitively rebuilt Hauptstrasse, which is flanked with a startling number of bookshops, as well as foodshops, clothes shops and restaurants. Trees shade statues of artists, gods and goddesses. On the left are some surviving houses of the original street. In spite of its reputation as a pariah because of the second world war and communist neglect, Dresden today is a green city. Here the meandering River Elbe is some 130m wide, and on either side parks and gardens add to the ambience. Some of the suburbs are superb. Hellerau, to the north, for instance, is celebrated as the first German garden city. Dresden's finest and largest park, the Grosser Garten, laid out in 1676, is traversed by a little train, and houses a zoo with some 2,000 animals of 450 varieties, a baroque palace of 1683 and a couple of lakes. Further afield, the city is surrounded by mountains and castle-topped hills. One such castle defends the exquisite porcelain city of Meissen. The river winds its way below slopes covered in vineyards. This is a shallow river, but when there is enough water such lovely hotel ships as the Elbresidenz and its sisters, the Clara Schumann and the Theodore Fontane, cruise to Saxon Switzerland or as far as Magdeburg or Prague. At night, as you eat on board, moored beside Dresden, the great black river is streaked with gold from the city lights. James Bentley flew to Dresden with Lufthansa. In Dresden he was a guest of the German national tourist board at the Maritin-Bellevue hotel. Double rooms cost DM488 (Pounds 192.10). Tel: (010)-49-351-56620. Eastern Germany is still short of hotels, but for a small cost many local tourist offices will find visitors well-appointed and reasonably inexpensive bed and breakfast rooms.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Robert Wiseman Dairies valued at Pounds 64m in float Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor and distributor, priced its flotation yesterday at 100p a share, valuing the group as a whole at Pounds 63.7m. A total of Pounds 16.1m has been raised through an institutional placing, completed yesterday. The placing gives Pounds 14.5m net new money to the group, with the sale of 15m shares, and a further 1.08m shares have been placed on behalf of family members. The family is also taking Pounds 3.5m in a special dividend before the current year end on April 2. The float will leave the Wiseman family with nearly 74.8 per cent of the group, and, barring large acquisitions for shares, the family expects to retain control for some years to come. The group is forecasting pre-tax profits for the current year of not less than Pounds 5.09m (Pounds 3.19m), including a Pounds 327,000 exceptional profit on the sale of an investment. Excluding that profit, earnings per share are forecast at 6.61p (6.14p), giving a p/e at the issue price of 15.1. The notional net dividend for the year to April 2 is 2.5p giving a yield of 3.12 per cent, covered 2.6 times. The group, which has just acquired Mackies dairy in Aberdeen, has 21 per cent of the Scottish milk market, but only 2 per cent of the UK market. It specialises in supplying multiple retailers, which now take 65 per cent by volume of the group's milk. Mr Alan Wiseman, executive chairman, said that by being a low cost producer, the group could make good margins from selling to supermarkets in spite of low prices. Wiseman has expanded into England with the purchase of a dairy in Manchester in 1991 and now plans a sizeable investment programme there. With the Manchester project and other investments the group plans to spend Pounds 14m over the next two years before any acquisitions, using the cash raised in the float. Dealings in the shares start on March 28. The placing was arranged by Panmure Gordon.</p>

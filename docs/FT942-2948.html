			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / 'Play along' with cash launderers Banks should 'play along' with money-launderers, in co-operation with police, to maximise the chances of catching them and seizing their assets, officials of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. The officials were commenting on the latest annual report by the OECD's Financial Action Task Force on money laundering, the practice of legitimising ill-gotten gains from drug-trafficking and other forms of crime by investing them in legitimate assets or businesses. The FATF's chairman, Mr John Gieve, a senior UK Treasury official, said some progress had been made in the past year in the fight against money-laundering. A key recommendation of the task force is that banks report suspicions, either to the police or to specialist bodies in some countries, such as the Tracfin unit in the French Finance Ministry.</p>

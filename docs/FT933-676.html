			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Late-paying debtors - right to interest is necessary, but perhaps unenforceable Sir, While Lord Alexander is no doubt informed, many of his UK readers may not know that German industry usually settles its bills 'X' days, normally 30, after date of invoice. In the UK, terms of payment are unfortunately normally on the 20th or at the end of the month following the month of invoice. The German system allows suppliers to apply sanctions or stop further goods and services much more promptly when there are payment delays than is possible under Britain's archaic system. Another reason why settlement is prompt in Germany is that large companies have appreciated the importance of their smaller suppliers, some of which are undercapitalised. Also, companies in Germany are not constantly badgered by financial analysts, who in the UK calculate asset gearing without regard to soaring levels of trade creditors.

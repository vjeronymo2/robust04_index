			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Saks may launch scheme for international expansion SAKS Fifth Avenue, the upmarket department store group bought in 1990 by Investcorp, an Arab-led investment consortium, said yesterday it could expand into Hawaii within a couple of years and use this as a stepping-stone to the Far East. The international expansion hints came as Saks announced that Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, a private charitable trust set up with the aim of educating Hawaiian children, had acquired a 5 per cent interest in Saks. Yesterday, Mr Philip Miller, Saks' chief operating officer, said the relationship would facilitate Saks' expansion into the state, possibly by autumn 1995 or spring of 1996, and might then help the retailer to move into the Far East generally. It has stated that international expansion was part of its five-year plan, with the Far East, Mexico and Europe all possible markets. Saks has been privately-owned since Investcorp's Dollars 1.5bn leveraged acquisition of the retail chain from Britain's BAT group. But Investcorp recently pumped another Dollars 300m of new equity into the US retailer, and has since been placing out part of that commitment. Earlier this year, it announced that an 11 per cent equity interest had been sold to Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, chairman of United Saudi Commercial Bank for Dollars 100m. The Hawaiian trust is understood to have paid approximately half that sum for its 5 per cent inter-est. The trust was established in 1884 after the death of Princess Bernice Pavahi Bishopa, great granddaughter of Hawaii's King Kamehameha I, and is invested mainly in property in the Hawaiian islands. Its portfolio takes in ownership of some prime shopping centres.</p>

The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this review are certain internal-combustion, industrial forklift trucks, with lifting capacity of 2,000 to 15,000 pounds. The products covered by this review are further described as follows: Assembled, not assembled, and less than complete, finished and not finished, operator-riding forklift trucks powered by gasoline, propane, or diesel fuel internal-combustion engines of off-the-highway types used in factories, warehouses, or transportation terminals for short-distance transport, towing, or handling of articles. Less than complete forklift trucks are defined as imports which include a frame by itself or a frame assembled with one or more component parts. Component parts of the subject forklift trucks which are not assembled with a frame are not covered by this order. During the review period such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 692.4025, 692.4030, and 692.4070 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). The merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) item numbers 8427.20.00&hyph;0, 8427.90.00&hyph;0, and 8431.20.00&hyph;0. The TSUSA and HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes only. The written description remains dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The review covers sales made by Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) and Toyo Umpanki Company, Limited (TCM) during the period from June 1, 1989 through May 31, 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Such or Similar Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For all respondent companies, pursuant to section 771(16) of the Tariff Act, the Department established categories of ``such or similar'' merchandise on the basis of load (lifting) capacity of the forklift as imported. Within these categories, the product comparisons were based on six primary characteristics, to which points were assigned to indicate their relative importance. These characteristics and their point totals are as follows: Tire type, 6 points; upright style, 5 points; engine type, 4 points; transmission type, 3 points; maximum forklift height, 2 points; and engine size, 1 point. The sum of these numbers, the ``SSM Index Number'', was used to match U.S. and home market (HM) sales. We considered models that both summed to 21 points as identical. Where there were no identical products sold in the home market, the Department selected the most similar product on the basis of the point totals resulting from the six characteristics listed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Data Changes Included in the Final Results of Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We found that in TCM's purchase price (PP) sales analysis, we did not include in the credit expense calculation the time between shipment from Japan and subsequent shipment to the customer by TCM's U.S. subsidiary. Therefore, for the final results, we included these expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department gave interested parties the opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. At the request of the petitioners, (Hyster-Yale Company, Independent Lift Truck Builders Union, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, International Union, Allied Industrial Workers of America (AFL&hyph;CIO), and United Shop and Service Employees) and one respondent, a hearing was held on March 19, 1992. Case and rebuttal briefs were received from petitioners, Toyota, and TCM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

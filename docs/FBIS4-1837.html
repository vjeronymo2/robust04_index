			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 4 (CNA) -- Taiwan has enjoyed an  aggregate trade surplus for the past 18 years, but its annual  trade in high-technology products has remained in the red since  1988, Ministry of Finance statisticians reported Monday [4  April].    The officials said that although the government has offered  tax and other financial incentives to encourage investment in  high-tech industries, the imbalance in state-of-the-art products  trade continues to grow.    High-tech imports reached U.S.$37 billion in 1993, while  exports totaled about U.S.$29.1 billion. The U.S.$7.9 billion  imbalance, roughly equal to Taiwan's total trade surplus for the  year, was the largest gap since 1988 when the high-tech trade  deficit stood at U.S.$2 billion, the officials said.    And last year, Taiwan's high-tech exports even suffered a  year-on-year 5.27 percent decline, reversing the steady upward  trend recorded over the previous five years, the officials noted.    They blamed the phenomenon on high demand for high-tech  products here and slow progress in upgrading local industries.    Shih Chin-tai, key components development project chief at  the government-funded Industrial Technology Research Institute,  said local high-tech companies have not yet established  comprehensive overseas distribution networks, which has hindered  Taiwan's export expansion.    But Taiwan will soon be able to mass produce such key  electronic and machinery parts as liquid crystal displays, data  compressors and memory chips, Shih said. "These products will  help increase Taiwan's high-tech production by an estimated  U.S.$3.49 billion by 1997, and cut reliance on high-tech  imports," he explained.    Some economists suggested that the government offer even  more  incentives to encourage development of certain "strategic"  industries, such as telecommunications, machinery and key  electronic parts.    Computers, machinery and chemicals are Taiwan's major  high-tech exports, while electronic components and parts,  sophisticated machinery and car engines form the bulk of  Taiwan's high-tech imports, according to government tallies.</p>

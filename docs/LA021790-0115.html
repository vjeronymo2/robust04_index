			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROONEY SUSPENSION SHEDS LIGHT ON STATUS OF BLACKS, GAYS IN TV  </P> <P> Progress by minority groups in gaining equal treatment and justice need not be  measured only by looking at ballot box results. Television, that almighty  indicator of who's in and who's out, is another telling gauge.  </P> <P> Andy Rooney, of "60 Minutes" fame, has recently come under fire for derogatory  remarks made about gays as well as, and more conspicuously, for remarks made  about blacks. Even though he has denied making the racist comments regarding  blacks, he was suspended for three months without pay by CBS news.  </P> <P> Tellingly, his earlier remarks aimed at gays, and not deniable since they were  made over the air on a CBS special in December, met with no such response from  network bigwigs.  </P> <P> It is oddly fitting that two such varied responses by CBS to two Rooney slurs  should occur just as some are questioning the appropriateness of the new cable  offering "Secret Passions," a gay-oriented soap opera both produced and set in  Orange County. At the very least, TV's inconsistent manner in dealing with the  two minorities is revealed.  </P> <P> Images on television do much to shape our views of groups we have little or no  contact with. Opinions of gay men and lesbians, who are still underrepresented  on the air, have often been forged out of ignorance.  </P> <P> While blacks have made heavy inroads in the effort to bring varying images to  the tube, gays have had less success. The television industry has done next to  nothing, for instance, to correct the omission of various worthy contributions  made by gay men and lesbians to America's cultural history.  </P> <P> How many TV productions on the lives of poet Walt Whitman or on the first  native-born star of the U.S. stage, Charlotte Cushman, have you seen? What TV  Western has ever shown that Native Americans held an enlightened and accepting  view of homosexuality?  </P> <P> Nor has television done much to show accurate and varied portrayals of gays in  the present. The few attempts to go beyond stereotypes are invariably met with  heavy resistance.  </P> <P> A recent "thirtysomething" episode that featured a frank portrayal of two men  in a dating situation was met with strong protest by groups on the religious  right. A few days later, several sponsors bowed to the pressure and withdrew  support from the show.  </P> <P> In the real world, the list of gay-oriented groups in Orange County alone  indicates concerns and interests very similar to those of the general  population. Too lengthy to incorporate here, the list includes a gay bowling  league, a group for gay alcoholics, a gay parents group, gay Mormons, and even  a group of gay owners and admirers of classic autos.  </P> <P> Given the incredible variety existing within the gay and lesbian community, it  would take several shows offering gays as characters to even begin to portray  the real diversity of gays. But not surprisingly, opposition to the fledgling  gay soap, "Secret Passions," which is unique in its genre, has already begun to  take shape.  </P> <P> Those who fight the airing of these types of shows, aside from showing  disrespect for the First Amendment, are fighting portrayals of the real America  and are choosing ignorance over fact.  </P> <P> With groups such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, gays are  just beginning to find ways to effectively fight for honest and varied  portrayals on the small screen. But as the Rooney suspension indicates, black  power, on the tube at least, has already arrived.  </P> <P> JAN-AUSTIN FOUCHER, Anaheim  </P></p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Texas senator indicted A TEXAS grand jury has indicted newly elected Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison on charges of using her former office as state treasurer for political and personal ends. Mrs Hutchison, a Republican, won a sweeping victory in a June by-election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen's move to become Treasury secretary, thrashing Mr Bob Krueger, who had been appointed to serve as interim senator, by a 67 per cent to 33 per cent margin. The district attorney of Travis County, in Texas, said the grand jury had indicted Mrs Hutchison on two charges of misusing public property and workers while she was state treasurer, and two of tampering with government records and physical evidence. Two former state treasury officials were also charged. In a statement issued in Washington Mrs Hutchison said the allegations were 'false and unfair'. 'Today's announcement by the Democratic district attorney of Travis County is merely another chapter in the sleazy campaign tactics employed by Democrats during the US Senate campaign this year,' she said. Mr Ronnie Earle, the district attorney, said Mrs Hutchison's claims that his office was leading a partisan attack was a standard rebuttal from a public official under investigation. 'Every one of them says it's political, whether they are Democrats or Republicans,' he said. His investigation began just five days after Mrs Hutchison's by-election victory. Despite having won election only this year, Mrs Hutchison must defend her seat again next November, when Mr Bentsen's original six-year term comes up for renewal. Neither indictment nor even conviction entails expulsion from the US Senate.</p>

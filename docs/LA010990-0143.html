			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Electrical grounding -- A story in Sunday's Real Estate section on replacing  two-prong electrical outlets with three-prong receptacles is applicable only  for a grounded electrical system. Many older homes do not have a grounded  system and installing three-prong receptacles would create a potentially  hazardous situation. If you are considering such a conversion and don't know if  you have a grounded system, contact a licensed electrician.  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (4): Sell-off plans hit by delays - Privatisation PRIVATISATION has never been the buzzword in Ireland that it became in Margaret Thatcher's Britain. The Ireland of prime ministers Garret FitzGerald, Charles Haughey, and, since February, Albert Reynolds, has no great vision of the joys and virtues of ushering state-run bodies into the private sector. Nor has there been a big drive to widen share ownership among the population. There are good reasons for this. First, there are only 3.5m people in the 26 counties of the republic, and the economy is only now getting rid of its almost total dependence on agriculture. The economy has also been slowed by the recession of the early 1990s - although Ireland, not having reached the dizzy heights of the mid-1980s, was affected correspondingly less by the downturn. However, last year there was a limited foray into privatisation, with two part sell-offs of Irish Life, a financial institution, and the sugar producer Greencore. Other candidates for privatisation which were being discussed two years ago, such as the Irish telephone monopoly, Telecom Eireann, and the Industrial Credit Corporation (ICC), will not now be sold off for at least another two years. In the case of Telecom, the delay could be longer, depending on how long it takes the dust to settle from the IPounds 19.4m sale of a former bakery near the US embassy in Dublin to Telecom within a year of it having been bought for a much smaller sum. The roles of Mr Michael Smurfit, the former chairman of Telecom, and Mr Dermot Desmond, a leading Dublin stockbroker and former consultant to the communications body, are being examined by a government-ordered inquiry which shows little sign of clarifying the matter. 'Telecom will have to be whiter than white before the government sells it off,' said a leading Dublin business analyst. 'The privatisation process had virtually begun last year, before these matters arose, and now these so-called scandals have derailed it.' There is also stiff union opposition to the sell-off plan. Last September, when it became known that the government had suggested that Telecom commission a study of its prospects, including privatisation, the unions declared that the government had promised previously that privatisation was not on the agenda. A statement by Mr David Begg, the general secretary of the Communications Workers Union, extolled Telecom as 'a jewel of great price . . . it would be extremely unwise to sell it off for a once-off cash sum'. The union claims that because few Irish buyers could raise the estimated IPounds 1bn or more purchase price, it would probably be sold to foreign interests, which it sees as bad for Ireland. It also argues that, without any accompanying legislation to license other telephone operators, a monopoly would fall into private hands. UNIONS such as Mr Begg's are forces to reckon with, as the management of An Post (the Post Office) found during the recent six-week mail strike, which cost it millions of pounds in revenue. Telecom is profitable, but it does have a fairly high ratio of debt to equity. This would have to be reduced, and manning levels rationalised, before it was put on the market. Scandal allegations have also tainted Irish Sugar (Siuicre Eireann), which was brought to the market as Greencore in April last year, with 55 per cent of the shares on offer and the government retaining the other 45 per cent. The sugar company had been performing creditably in the six months before the float, or semi-float, with pre-tax profit climbing from IPounds 11,648,000 to IPounds 14,361,000. Hence the issue was six times over-subscribed, with more than 16,000 applications for shares valued at a total of IPounds 250m. However, a series of court hearings and investigations into the business practice of the former chief executive, Mr Chris Comerford, will have to end before more shares are offered on the market. The government did sell off another 15 per cent of its holding, but analysts say this did not help the prospects of full privatisation and served to undermine confidence in the company. Irish Life, the third largest financial institution in Ireland, was the other part-privatisation. It went to the market last July, when the government reduced its stake from 90 per cent to 34 per cent. Analysts believe the government will have to wait for the economy to improve before any appetite for Irish Life shares would justify the administrative costs of a sell-off. 'We don't have a policy on privatisation as such', said a spokesman for the Department of Finance, which handles such activity. 'Each situation would be handled as it arose, and on its own merits.' He referred to a general reference in the government's Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP), launched at the beginning of 1991: 'The government's objective in developing state companies is to enable them to contribute better to the economy and to employment. Private involvement in state companies can, in various ways and depending on the circumstances of each company, help the companies to achieve this objective.' While it is perhaps not enthusiastic about the idea of privatisation, the Fianna Fail government is as keen as anybody to boost the exchequer. However, the organisations equivalent to the big privatisations achieved or scheduled to go ahead in Britain (British Telecom, British Gas, British Rail) are often not in the right shape for offers to the public. The Irish railway, Iarnrod Eireann, is far from robust and has never been a likely candidate for privatisation. However, Bord Dais, the gas authority, is reasonably strong, with very competitive, market-conscious consumer policies. The Electricity Supply Board (ESB) is also a competent performer. However, Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy Stockbrokers, questions the benefits of privatising either the electricity or gas authorities. 'What would you gain?', he says. 'They would inevitably be split into generating and supply units, so instead of one utility which was doing OK you would have two, each with its own costs and administration.' The Industrial Credit Corporation (ICC), a bank set up in 1933 to help small businesses, was described confidently in 1990 as 'next in line' to be privatised. Since then nothing has happened except the queue for privatisation has disintegrated. The government's 98 per cent share remains untouched. Should it wish to sell, which is still spoken of as 'in about two years', it would not have to pass enabling legislation as the ICC works in some ways like a trustee bank. The Ulster Bank, Banque Nationale de Paris and Kredietbank have at times been named as likely buyers. However, a spokeswoman for ICC's newly installed chairman, Mr Ted MacRedmond, said the ICC accepted that the climate is not right for bank sell-offs, and that situation will not alter for at least two years. Mr Kevin Barry, head of research at National City Brokers (NCB) in Dublin, suggests Bord Gals and Aer Rianta, the Irish airports authority, as likely candidates. Aer Rianta, unlike the national carrier, Aer Lingus, has stayed in profit in recent years, although it experienced a blip in 1991 which was put down to the Gulf War. 'Aer Rianta is not even a semi-state body yet, but a department of the administration, so it would have to be made a semi-state body in the first place,' Mr Barry pointed out. Aer Rianta's annual profitability of around IPounds 25m should make it easy to attract buyers.</p>

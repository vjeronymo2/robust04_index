Over the past  few days, all districts in the municipality have conscientiously  implemented the arrangements of the emergency conference of the  municipal government and the measures for stabilizing prices.  They rapidly stabilized prices in two days, thus winning the  support of the masses. The markets have been stable,  commodities ample, and supplies good.    Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee,  emphasized: We should intensify inspection and rely on the  supervision by the masses to ensure that measures for  stabilizing grain, oil, vegetable, egg, and meat prices are  conscientiously implemented. Workers of grain departments have  worked hard, and some of them receive a low income. We should  conduct earnest investigation and study and pool efforts from  various fields to change such a situation through reform. Mayor  Li Qiyan emphasized that the present inspection proved that the  municipality is determined to stabilize prices and to set the  people's minds at ease for happy New Year and Spring Festival.    Chen Xitong, Ouyang Wenan, Meng Zhiyuan, Meng Xuenong, and  Fan Yuanmou conducted inspection in Chongwen and Fengtai  Districts. All the grain and oil shops and markets of farm  products implemented the regulations on price ceilings, and all  people and retailers expressed understanding and support.  [passage omitted]    On that morning when inspecting environmental sanitation,  Chen Xitong did not forget to inspect prices and listen to the  masses' opinions. In a market of farm products on the Hepingli  Middle Street, an old teacher met with the former mayor and said  frankly: "Vegetable prices have dropped today when you are  conducting inspection. They will go up right after you leave."  Chen Xitong said to her: "Inspections by the municipality and  various districts are necessary, but people's supervision is  more important. You may report whenever you discover wanton  price hikes, calling Mayor Li Qiyan, Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa, or  me." An old comrade went forward and said: "What if the  telephone line is dead?" Chen Xitong said: "You may write  letters." "Can you receive the letters?" Chen Xitong said:  "Yes, we can. Please rest assured." When a person said that  the noodle price of the Qingniangou no. 1 grain shop was higher  than the price ceiling, Chen Xitong immediately ordered  Dongcheng District leaders to inspect and handle this matter.  Some retailers talked about their views on the price difference  between wholesale and retail sale and on fixing prices according  to quality. Chen Xitong asked pertinent departments to  conscientiously study and handle these issues. [passage omitted]</p>

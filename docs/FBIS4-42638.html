			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Winfried Muenster: "Brussels From Its Best </F> Angle"]    [Text] EU [European Union] Commissioner Martin Bangemann  could not miss such an opportunity to deliver a side-swipe. His  Danish colleague Henning Christophersen had worked out for the  public what it would cost the taxpayer to cover the European  Union with a transportation infrastructure, especially one for a  high-speed railroad service, in line with the ideas of the  Brussels Commission. Christophersen arrived at a figure of  between 30 and 40 billion German marks, which would account for  between a quarter and a third of the total investment cost,  excluding credit financing through EU institutions. The Dane  then gave up his place before the television cameras to the  German, who began his presentation with the words: "Our project  does not require any public money."    Both commissioners were talking about "trans-European  networks" (TEN), which the EU is already dreaming of as a symbol  of the integration and economic renewal of the old continent.  However, black and white have seldom been so close to each  other. On the one hand, the Commission has been truly indulging  in gigantic expenditure programs. The idea of European  integration has already become perverted into the Right to put  one's hand into one's neighbor's pocket, and it would appear  that the people in Brussels want to go one further than that  with their fast railroad network. On the other hand, they  created the concept of the "information society" with which they  have prompted a new "industrial revolution." "It is a  revolution," begins the report that was prepared by Bangemann  along with top European businessmen from the computer sector,  "based on information. Technical progress places us in a  position to communicate information in any form, irrespective of  distance, time, and quantity." The opportunities for new  economic activity and thus for work and jobs that this  technology promises is something that today's ordinary mortal  cannot imagine.    The report shows "Brussels" from its best angle. It is the  European Commission's fundamental task to think for the  community about what it must do if it does not want to drop out  of the high performance economy league. That is what is  happening, and the people in Brussels are not afraid to tell  hard truths to the Europeans, who have been fixated about their  superiority for ages: If they believe that the state will carry  on fixing things, then they are lost. What counts in the future  are not ministers, taxpayers, and regulations, but entrepreneurs  and free markets.</p>

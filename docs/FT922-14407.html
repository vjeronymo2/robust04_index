			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Steelmakers' legacy faces a stern test: Robert Thomson on why the back-to-basics ethic is popular in Japan With a colourful catalogue of new businesses that includes an artificial beach, burglar alarms and a retirement village, as well as biotechnology and electronics, Japan's steelmakers have been furiously diversifying. These ambitious plans, inspired by an industry downturn in the mid-1980s, and funded with the easy money of the late 1980s, are now being put to the test. Sometimes with unhappy results. The reassessment comes as Japanese industry is embracing the back-to-basics theme. Projects that were affordable, but not necessarily profitable, when earnings were on the rise in 1989 have been left exposed by the ebbing tide of profits. Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, forecasts a 37.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year just ended, and admits that most of its new areas, ranging from laptop computers to a Space World theme park, are still lossmakers. Mr Hiroshi Saito, president, has admitted that the pursuit of some projects had been 'amateurish' and 'haphazard'. Such difficulties are an embarrassment for the big five Japanese makers, Nippon Steel, NKK, Kobe Steel, Sumitomo Metal and Kawasaki Steel, who presumed that their access to funds, their size and, in the case of electronics, their use of the product, would ensure success. Now that demand in the Japanese economy is declining, the steel companies have realised that they are more skilled as producers than as salesmen. Having relied on long-established relationships and the marketing skills of trading houses for steel sales, they are now having to court customers for new building materials or semiconductors. A Japanese saying tells of the humiliation felt by the samurai forced to do business, but the steel samurai were forced to think as salesman in 1986 when crude steel production fell from 105m tonnes to 98m tonnes and the five leading companies reported pre-tax losses. Each company then launched programmes of rationalisation and diversification, expecting steel output to decline to 90m tonnes by 1990. Instead, the Japanese economy entered its longest economic boom which halted late last year. The sprouting of construction projects and a surge in demand from other traditional customers such as the car industry lifted steel production to 110m tonnes in 1990 and restored the companies' confidence. The industry correctly perceived that the boom would fade, and that diversification programmes must continue, but its perception of the costs of diversification was distorted by the gravity-defying Tokyo stock market. In the late 1980s, there were easy profits to be made from selling long-held stocks, and the market painlessly absorbed new equity issues. Confidence in the market's strength prompted an interest in warrant bonds - Nippon Steel issued Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.04bn) in warrants between mid-1988 and early 1989, and Kobe Steel issued Dollars 2.1bn in warrants from October 1988 until June 1989. But the stock market peaked at the end of 1989 and began its fall. Official interest rates were pushed higher by the Bank of Japan, demand slowed for new cars, while housing starts fell from 1.70m in 1990 to 1.37m last year. The result was flat or slightly lower sales for the steelmakers and forecast falls in pre-tax profit ranging from 11.5 per cent at Kobe Steel to 46.6 per cent at Kawasaki Steel. Mr Minoru Hasegawa, steel industry specialist at SG Warburg Securities, estimates that if diversification was 'focused', the companies' profits would be 20 per cent to 30 per cent higher. 'Some of the companies really didn't think seriously about their capabilities. They thought computer-related business would be important in the future, so they got involved in electronics,' he said. 'The successful diversifications have been those closely related to their existing businesses.' The steelmakers were particularly interested in semiconductors because they presumed electronic devices would be the 'industrial rice' of the future. They also chose projects in electronics and the service sector, including restaurants, because these areas were suitable for absorbing workers left idle by the rationalisation of steel oper-ations. Sumitomo Metal had employed 30,000 workers in steelmaking, but by 1990, reduced the total to 21,000, with 4,000 dispatched to new areas. The shift into high technology and services was also important in renovating the image of companies concerned that their reputations had rusted. Companies have found that adventure does not come cheap, and that steel remains their most profitable business. They have revised downward their ambitious goals for new areas and readjusted management styles. NKK says: 'We have learned that a business quite new to our traditional operation as a steel supplier also needs a different management system.' Kobe Steel, which has the longest-running and most successful diversification programme, has announced 'Target 2000', an overhaul of a long-term plan adopted in 1988. The company had expected new business to account for Y90bn (Pounds 390m) of sales in 1991, but now the figure is reckoned at Y66bn, while sales in long-established materials and machinery divisions exceeded expectations. Even for Kobe Steel, the outlays necessary to keep pace in the semiconductor and biotechnology business have become a burden. Yet Kobe hopes that the percentage of new business sales will increase from 5 per cent last year to 13 per cent in 1995 and 21 per cent by the year 2000. However, the steelmakers are quietly shedding new businesses. One has scaled down plans in ceramic products, another has put a low ceiling on biotechnology, and yet another has halted production of a new line of building materials. As Nippon Steel confessed, 'climbing a mountain is very hard and there are still many more mountains to climb'.</p>

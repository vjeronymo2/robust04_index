			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Sang-sok from Washington] </F>   [Text] On 21 April, the U.S. press reported that the ROK  has agreed with the United States to purchase a series of latest  weapons, including Apache offensive helicopters, to hasten its  plan to modernize the Army's war capabilities.    Quoting U.S. officials' remarks in an article dispatched  from  Seoul that day, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL reported: "The ROK  agreed with Defense Secretary William Perry to purchase a series  of latest U.S. weapons, including Apache helicopters. The list  of U.S. weapons to be purchased by the ROK also includes  ultramodern anti- tank missiles, night fluoroscopes, a  satellite-using graphical site picture system, communication  equipment that guarantees higher security, and battery-sensing  radars."    This paper also reported: "Because of the ROK-U.S. agreement  on the purchase of weapons, major U.S. defense industrial  companies -- such as McDonald Douglas; General Motors; and  Raytheon, which manufactures Patriot missiles -- have been able  to sell their military equipment to the ROK.    On the same day, in an article on Secretary Perry's ROK  visit, the LOS ANGELES TIMES reported that the ROK agreed with  the United States to purchase latest U.S. weapons, including  battery-sensing radars.    Quoting U.S. officials' remarks, THE WASHINGTON POST also  reported: "The ROK and the United States have reached an  agreement on the purchase of ultramodern U.S. weapons. The  ROK's commitment on the weapons purchase, however, does not  fully satisfy the U.S. original expectations.</p>

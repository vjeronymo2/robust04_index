			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / All eyes on the Nazis: As They Say in Europe THERE IS a rule now. If you cannot write yet again about the horrors of Yugoslavia, or indulge in yet more catatonic speculation about 'what if the French vote No,' you turn to neo-Nazi attacks on refugees. Events in eastern Germany have been a godsend. Corriere della Sera of Milan can run off the typical editorial: 'Germany finds itself in grip of the Nazis. There grows fear of a people's uprising against the 'human flood' from eastern Europe. Neo-Nazi violence spreads throughout the eastern Lander like an oil slick . . . the Germans have lost all feeling of national solidarity . . .' In Poland, the considered contempt for east Germans of last week has turned into something more apocalyptic. The editor of Gazeta Wyborcza is the old Solidarity activist Adam Michnik, who contributed the following personal comment: 'What is happening in Germany must be understood as an alarm bell. 'Germany - a stable and democratic state - has become a region of the explosion of hate. One-time nationalistic fringe groups are now starting to alter the spiritual and political landscape of the state. The moment of truth for German democracy nears . . .' As usual, the story seems less sensational the nearer you are to it. Thus Tagesspiegel of Berlin, after a particularly awful night of anti-refugee mayhem a few miles away, ran as its front page lead a story about the choice of architect to redesign the Potsdamer-Platz. If alarm bells are ringing in Germany, it is over the state of public finances and the fragility of the government rather than the ghosts of the past. People are getting worried about the qualities of Chancellor Kohl, who seems to be able to tackle almost anything except problems. And if the Germans have got things the wrong way round, it could be the result of their peculiar tendency to focus on the ramifications of an issue, rather than the issue itself, in the belief that they are really getting to grips with it. A few years ago, a Munich weekly ran a cartoon which said it all: a group of Germans, near the pearly gates, were passing a signpost which pointed left to Heaven and right to Lecture on Heaven. The Germans were going to the lecture. It could be that west Germans still do not care greatly about what goes on in the east. It is difficult to know how surprised the readers of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung were last week when they read a page of letters from children in the east. From Plauen, Sylvio Flugel wrote: 'Suddenly, everything is quite different - in Germany, in the world, in me. My name is Sylvio and I am in the third form. Our teacher has told us much about united Germany. 'I am specially happy about the many beautiful toys that there are now. I have many wishes and dreams. But unfortunately they cannot be fulfilled, for both my parents have no work any more and most toys are very dear. I can't really understand why mummy and daddy have no work.' Another small boy wrote to say how nice it was to see so much of his mother when she lost her job - but then father lost his, too. The letter continued: 'Grandpa is very dear to us, but he swears at everything. First he swore at the GDR (the former East Germany), now he swears at the new government. 'Grandma is always calling him a whingeing fool. She says what's best about unity is the jam and the coffee. I don't know if things are better now or not.' On the same day, the Suddeutsche Zeitung carried an interview which started: 'When the (east German) pop star Inka Bause thinks back to her first confrontation with the western music business, she immediately recalls that evening in Munich. 'It was a meeting with enormously important music industry people and such types, says Inka, 'make me nervous, anyway.' They sat in an expensive restaurant, spoke about recording contracts, charts, competition strategy. 'As the main course was ordered, a music executive turned jovially to the young East Berliner and asked: 'Now, little one, what's it like to get something nice to eat for once'?'

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Arts: Muldowney tracks a trumpet - Concert Dominic Muldowney's Trumpet Concerto, which John Wallace and the Premiere Ensemble under Mark Wigglesworth introduced on Monday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, is his sixth concerto and probably his most successful orchestral work to date. It is an attractive, catchy piece, a single movement that plays for just under 20 minutes and effortlessly parades Muldowney's array of skills, with deft orchestration and a teasing patchwork of melodic tags. The easy accessibility of the score belies its mechanics. As another of Muldowney's explorations of tempo layers, the players and conductor all have to listen to computer-generated click tracks to keep them on their metronomic course. The concerto operates on three carefully geared tempi - the solo trumpet and a piano have the fastest pulse, the strings and other wind (the only players controlled by the conductor) the slowest, while widely spaced pairs of clarinets and marimbas take a speed between them. But the result is much more than a neat piece of clockwork; the music pans easily and smoothly between the groups, adroitly changing perspective. Behind the trumpet the piano functions almost like a continuo instrument, filling in textures, highlighting the solo line. Muldowney has likened the piece to a latter-day Brandenburg Concerto; the outline is a sonata shape with clearly marked points of development and reprise. The lingering flavour, though, is provided by the melodic material, derived in part from a theatre song which Muldowney wrote a couple of years ago. It dodges in and out of the solo line, is caught from different angles and in different shades, and provides the trumpet with some fine opportunities for nimble virtuosity; Wallace played it quite superbly. The new concerto was wedged between two Mozart symphonies, the E flat K543 and the Jupiter K551. The Premiere Ensemble offer small-band Mozart, played on modern instruments but informed with some of the lessons of authentic practice, including the affectation of observing the second-half repeat in the finale of K549. In such music Wigglesworth is a puzzling, unsatisfying conductor, producing bustling, superficially acute playing with cosmetic expressivo which seems to mask a basic instability of tempo and phrasing; at a particularly awkward moment, it seemed, click tracks might have helped in Mozart too.</p>

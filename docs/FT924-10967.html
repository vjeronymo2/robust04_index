			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Hong Kong firm lifts stake in Invesco MIM to 14.9% PEREGRINE Investments, the aggressive Hong Kong securities house backed by Mr Li Ka-shing, the colony's richest man, has taken a 14.9 per cent stake in Invesco MIM, the UK fund management group. It purchased 4.4 per cent of Invesco MIM earlier this year, and on Monday acquired a further 10.5 per cent for Pounds 19.7m. Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that most of the shares came from portfolios managed by Invesco MIM itself. Some 18m shares in discretionary client portfolios managed by Invesco MIM were sold through brokers Smith New Court yesterday at 77p per share when the market price was 70p. However, Invesco was apparently unaware of the identity of the purchaser when it agreed the sale. Invesco was approached directly because its US-based chairman, Mr Charles Brady, had earlier made it known he wished to sell the Invesco shares purchased under his predecessor Lord Stevens' tenure for discretionary client accounts. As of the end of last year, clients owned 7.9 per cent of the company, a practice which earned it much criticism from analysts. Invesco, whose share price has been hard-hit by mismanagement within its UK operations, yesterday declined to comment officially on the stake. Senior management is said to be inquiring into whether the stake was purchased as a corporate investment or on behalf of Peregrine's own fund management clients. Mr Frances Leung, Peregrine's managing diretor, said Peregrine was not considering a bid for Invesco MIM, but would not rule out further share purchases. Analysts discounted the possibility of a hostile bid for Invesco, noting that to do so would undermine its client relationships. 'Under US Erisa (pension fund) laws, clients must agree to a change of ownership of their fund manager,' said Mr Phillip Gibbs, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. However, Invesco had mismanaged its balance sheet, and the slide in its share price has made them cheap given the fee income generated by the Pounds 30bn of funds it manages worldwide. However, senior executives at Invesco privately doubt the share purchase merely reflects Peregrine's desire for joint enterprises.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The Lebanese newspapers on 26 February  give front page prominence to the Hebron massacre, publishing  various reports and pictures and offering angry editorial  comment.    Beirut AL-ANWAR in Arabic publishes on page 1 an  approximately 800-word editorial signed by Rafiq Khuri, the  newspaper's chief editor, under the headline "Some Anger and  Some Thinking." Contending first that "there is nothing worse  than the Hebron massacre except the policies leading to it,"  Khuri says reaction to the killings "needs more than Rabin's  'sense of shame,' 'Arafat's 'anger,' the Security Council's  'elegies,' and the world's 'condemnation.'" He maintains: "The  forces that planned and perpetrated the crime were carrying out  an organized political act, not an act of revenge or 'gratuitous  killing' as was said." Khuri says he believes: "What matters  now is not what Rabin and 'Arafat say, but what they do. The  world is awaiting not hot public reaction, but cool action  behind the scenes."    The writer notes that opponents of PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat  and the peace process are calling for halting the negotiations  and adopting armed struggle to liberate the occupied  territories, while the United States, Europe, and many other  concerned parties believe that the best reaction to the massacre  is to speed up the peace process. Commenting on this, Khuri  says: "The call for armed struggle needs different  circumstances and different balances of power" and the call for  accelerating the peace process "needs different American and  Israeli policies." He explains: "When Israel wants to take  settlements, peace, security, and share water and resources  without giving up the land, then this is not a solution. And  when Washington plays the role of a spectator at negotiations  between a strong side and a weak side, then this is not a just  and comprehensive settlement." Khuri concludes: "The problem  has two sides: While war has no horizon, the road to peace is  long, very difficult, and planted with massacres and dangerous  policies. What is required is an aggressive U.S. position and  some Arab anger and thinking."    In an approximately 500-word front page editorial in the  Beirut paper AL-NAHAR in Arabic entitled "The Big Question,"  Chief Editor Ghassan Tuwayni describes the Hebron killings as  "the second Dayr Yasin" [a Palestinian village that witnessed  killings in 1947]. The paper poses its "big question:" "Does  the Israeli mentality accept peace with others, Muslims or non  Muslims, Arabs or non Arabs, or Palestinians or non  Palestinians?"    Referring to talk of peace and normal relations with Israel,  the paper asks: "What kind of normalization do they want if the  Israeli Government, no matter how strong, remains  unable--assuming it wants to do something--to confront the  madness of instinctive killing?" Continuing to cast doubt on the  possibility of peace with Israel, the paper asks whether the  massacre means there is only room for terrorism and  fundamentalism in Israel and whether the only dialogue with  Israel is that of extremism, hatred, killing, and terrorism.    Beirut AL-SAFIR in Arabic publishes on page 1 an  approximately 1,000-word article by chief editor Talal Salman  headlined "Palestine Has No Reference Other Than Its Blood."  Salman laments that Palestine and its people are left alone to  face the "Israeli ghoul." He notes that the world dealt with the  massacre as "a security incident" in Israel concerning only the  Israeli Government. Salman criticizes the "impotent"  Palestinian leadership and says peace with Israel is only an  illusion: "Israel is Israel, Palestine is Palestine, and the  divide between them is the edge of the sword. The spilled blood  washes away the barriers and drowns the illusions of an  impossible settlement between the executioner and the victim."  Salman maintains that the Israeli Government, army, settlers,  and people are one and the same thing. He concludes: "Israel  is Israel. It did not change. It won't change unless we grow  strong and force it to change."</p>

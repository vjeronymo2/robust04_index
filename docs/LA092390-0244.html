			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FIGHTING FIRE WITH . . . COMPUTERS!;  </P> <P> ARSON: FIRE-SETTERS RANGE FROM ABUSED CHILDREN TO PROFESSIONAL "TORCHES." NOW,  EXPERTS ARE COMPILING COMPUTER PROFILES OF THOSE WHO COMMIT SUCH CRIMES.  </P> <P> It's been called the coward's crime, one of the most underreported in the  country, and one of the least understood. Its practitioners include the  mentally unstable, little children and hired professionals.  </P> <P> The tools are everywhere -- cigarette lighters, matches, newspapers, many  household products. The crime is arson, and it requires no planning.  </P> <P> The power of fire is also the most power some of these people will ever  possess.  </P> <P> But who is this arsonist?  </P> <P> "He's the kind of guy who likes to walk in the misty rain," said John  Barracato, chief investigator for Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, a man who has  interviewed 900 arsonists in a 32-year career.  </P> <P> "There is no such thing as the generic arsonist," said David J. Icove, the  FBI's top arson investigator who, along with the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms  and Tobacco, is creating profiles on a computer that may help local law  enforcement agencies find arsonists.  </P> <P> Arson kills 1,000 people a year in this country, injures an additional 10,000  and costs the American public $10 billion to $20 billion a year.  </P> <P> Examples:  </P> <P>  -- In April, a ferry from Norway to Denmark, the Scandinavian Star, caught  fire and 158 lost their lives. Police called it arson but made no arrests.  </P> <P>  -- In Puerto Rico, the Dupont Plaza hotel burned on New Year's Eve and 97 were  killed at the dawn of the year 1987. Three disgruntled kitchen workers were  convicted of the crime.  </P> <P>  -- Last Christmas eve, an arson fire raged through Westwood's posh condominium  row, igniting 15 buildings, chasing 150 people from their homes and inflicting  $25 million in damage. No one has been arrested.  </P> <P> The crime of arson has fascinated psychiatrists and criminologists for years.  Even Sigmund Freud wrote a paper on the arsonist in the early '30s.  </P> <P> One of the reasons is that there are different types of arsonists, and although  some overlap, the motive for the arson somewhat determines the profile. Why  does the person set the fire? Is it a rational act or is it a compulsion? Is it  a business operation with cold cash on the line or is it revenge?  </P> <P> Is there immediate of delayed sexual gratification as the flames leap? Is there  a feeling of anger or just power as the individual stands in a crowd watching  the destruction that he has wrought?  </P> <P> Fire officials have created six or seven categories of arsonists, with the two  extremes being the true pyromaniac and the top-of-the-line hired "torch."  Although accounting for a small percentage of arson, psychologically these two  are the farthest apart.  </P> <P> Half of the reported cases of arson in the country are the work of juveniles,  ranging from children playing with matches to teen-agers looking for thrills.  In reality, they probably account for many more. Parents frequently put out the  fires before they get out of hand and don't call the authorities.  </P> <P> For very young children, it is often a cry for help -- or an accident. Older  juveniles often set fires for excitement. The hard question is whether they  will outgrow it.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert Cole of the University of Rochester and a private consultant has  studied the problem extensively. He believes that the label "arsonist" should  not be used too freely with some of these youngsters.  </P> <P> He stresses that most juveniles who set fires have no serious or emotional  handicaps.  </P> <P> "the problem is that we should not start going around labeling any child who  had made a fire as a potential sociopath, or even a potential criminal," Cole  said. "A lot of it is curiosity fire-setting and some of it is plain  old-fashioned vandalism, but I don't think this is a different kid than the kid  who breaks windows, or soaps windows or knocks down stop signs.  </P> <P> "Maybe one-third of them may have serious problems."  </P> <P> According to one study, 85% of the victims of fires set by children are the  children themselves.  </P> <P> Easy access to matches, cigarette lighters, candles and stoves killed 69  children in the last three years in New York. Nationwide, burns are second only  to transportation accidents as the cause of death during childhood.  </P> <P> Although there is no generic arsonist, there are certain characteristics that  keep cropping up.  </P> <P> It is generally accepted that arson is predominantly a male crime. The arsonist  is usually not well educated. One study showed an average ninth-grade  education. He is often mentally deficient or possessing below-average  intelligence. He comes from an unstable home where he may have been abused. He  is usually short and slight. He is usually divorced or has never been married,  has poor relations with others, particularly with women, and probably has a  menial job. He may be known already to the local police and has little or no  self-confidence.  </P> <P> He is, in a word, a loser.  </P> <P> The professional "torch" is the smartest of the arsonists and tends to come  from a higher socioeconomic background. He makes relatively big bucks burning  buildings to collect the insurance. His counterpart, the "thug torch," is not  nearly as good, but far cheaper.  </P> <P> "They hire a stiff from the local bar and give him $150 to $500. I know of one  buy who got $1,000," said Barracato, a New York City deputy fire marshal before  he joined Aetna.  </P> <P> "The guy you hire at the bar is probably a low-level criminal type, maybe with  a drug or alcohol problem, not well-educated, and probably already familiar to  the police."  </P> <P> His counterpart, the pro, is smarter.  </P> <P> "He wants to see the paper that shows the face value of the property,"  Barracato said. "He'll take 10%, half up front, and guarantee the job will be  done in three weeks. By the time the fire department gets there, he's at the  airport. We don't get many of them. They fly in and out of town and don't leave  tracks."  </P> <P> The real pro tends to be older, in his late 20s to early 50s. He often is a  heavy drinker, but unlike some arsonists who need alcohol to give them courage  to start the fire, the pro is likely to be stone sober when he enters a  building to take it down.  </P> <P> He is probably a fairly nocturnal individual, possibly nomadic, likely to be  single or divorced.  </P> <P> Another type well known to the firefighting world is the "vanity" or "hero"  fire maker. He might be the security guard whose job is threatened. So he  starts a fire one night, calls the fire department, but manages to subdue it  himself before the firemen arrive.  </P> <P> What happens? His job is safe. He might even get a promotion or a raise. He  also will go right up to No. 1 on the fire marshal's suspect list.  </P> <P> He may also be a superintendent of a building who has put out one too many  fires for the investigators' antennae. Although he may appear a hero, Fire  Marshal James McSwigin says he sometimes tries to become too big a hero and  ends up killing himself and others.  </P> <P> The federal study will be released in about 18 months, Icove said. It will be  based on in-depth interviews with 100 serial arsonists convicted of setting  three or more fires and imprisoned.  </P> <P> It is notoriously easy to get away with arson -- only 16 arrests for every 100  confirmed incendiary fires, contrasted with 75 arrests per 100 homicides.  </P> <P> Insurance officials say half of all residential fires are arson, but charges  are brought in only 19% to 26% of the cases. They can't prove it.  </P> <P> The FBI study found that women turn up in significant numbers only in the  revenge-motivated category. Twenty-eight percent of the arsonists in this  category are women; the category itself makes up only 14% of all arsons.  </P> <P> Another finding was that juvenile vandals and thrill-seekers tended to act in  groups, not as loners. Juveniles also said they did not use alcohol or drugs  before setting fires. Many adults said they did.  </P> <P> New York City Chief Fire Marshal John Stickevers has prepared a paper on the  true pyromaniac. He says the disorder is an extreme form of  obsessive-compulsive behavior.  </P> <P> Stickevers says pyromaniacs usually follow rather rigid patterns, starting  fires when and where no one is likely to be around. The fires also tend to  occur in geographic clusters.  </P> <P> The pyromaniac, he says, is often a male loner whose background includes a  domineering mother and a weak or absent father.  </P> <P> Ironically, the principal male figure in his life probably worked at a job in  which fire played a significant role, such as a firefighter, steel mill worker  or incinerator operator.  </P> <P> "Anyone who is obsessed with fire is probably a pyromaniac," Cole said.  </P> <P> The few female pyromaniacs become active at menopause, while the men start out  as youngsters. The female pyros typically set a number of small fires inside  their homes.  </P> <P> Some arsonists are simply starting the fire to conceal other crimes, such as a  murder, burglary, or even industrial espionage.  </P> <P> John Hall, director of fire analysis and research at the National Fire  Protection Assn. in Quincy, Mass., says there is no hard data, but he would  guess that 14% to 20% of arsonists have severe psychological problems. His  organization has been keeping statistics on arson for nearly 100 years.  </P> <P> "There is a lot we don't know," Hall said. "I would be very suspicious of  anyone going around making a living giving a profile of an arsonist."  </P> <P> Barracato agreed.  </P> <P> "It is the most misunderstood of all crimes," he said. "We understand very  little of the pathology and nobody is keeping accurate records."  </P></p>

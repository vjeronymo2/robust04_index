			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Trouble at the Hammer and Sickle engine plant: The problems of collapsing trade among former Soviet republics AT UKRAINE'S Hammer and Sickle plant in Kharkov, diesel engines cannot be sold for lack of one missing component from Russia. Meanwhile in the Russian city of Rostov, combine-harvesters sit in the Rostselmash plant waiting for the Ukrainian-made diesel engines. The mismatch is one of thousands of examples of how trade has sharply declined among former Soviet republics since they gained independence a year ago and have tried to switch from central planning to market economics and separate currencies. The contraction in trade is one of the main reasons for a fall of more than 20 per cent in Russia's industrial output and exports last year - with similar results in other republics. Echoing the complaints of industrialists on either side of the Russian border, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, says trade must be revived among former Soviet republics 'because we cannot compete on any other markets'. At the same time, he and various ministers served notice that cash-strapped Russia would stop subsidising other republics with cheap energy and raw materials. The problem of inter-republican trade now tops the agenda of many politicians in other republics too. Lithuania's new president, Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, the former communist leader, owes part of his victory this week to promises of improved trading ties with other republics and cheaper energy supplies from Russia. Ultimately, the republics expect to move to a system of dealing enterprise to enterprise through a normal banking system. But such an option will take time while other republics are weaned off traditional dependence on cheap energy, and fully switch to their own currencies. The day before Mr Brazauskas was elected, the country's finance minister said Russia had agreed to take roubles to pay a backlog of energy debts, but that the two sides had agreed to use hard currency settlements from March 1. It is unlikely in the meantime that Mr Brazauskas will be able to restore hot water to Lithuanian homes. A more immediate solution - which is making little progress - is an inter-state bank which commonwealth states agreed to establish at their summit in Minsk last month. This would have acted as clearing system for other republics to continue trading freely in roubles, but would have required Russia to subsidise the trade deficits of other republics, and it would only have covered deliveries under inter-state agreements. But Mr Vladimir Mashits, chairman of Russia's committee for relations with other republics, confirming suspicions that Russia would drag out the issue, has said it was not even being discussed because most republics, apart from Belarus, were refusing to co-ordinate financial policies with Russia for the privilege of continuing to use the rouble. While private entrepreneurs have found numerous ways of paying each other and getting around various rules to limit flows of currency and goods between borders, many of the enterprises are still closely connected to the state and indirectly depend on some form of state subsidy. Meanwhile the banking system - already very inefficient within Russia - has made virtually no progress in establishing efficient settlements among republics. Russia took the first step in cutting off a life-support system of cheap energy to other republics this summer by preventing them from issuing rouble credits to cover trade. Now Mr Mashits says that Russia will insist that they reimburse Rbs1,000bn 'technical credits' advanced to them by the Russian central bank for energy imports. He said also the central bank should start quoting exchange rates for the other currencies issued by republics. Russia is clearly trying to force other republics to drop the rouble or co-ordinate financial policy with Russia's. .But once that is decided it will have to weigh the benefits of subsidising trade against the disadvantages of breaking it off.</p>

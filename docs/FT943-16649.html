			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / SPD and Greens near Saxony-Anhalt accord The Social Democratic party (SPD) was yesterday edging towards a minority government with the Green party in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt, a move which will require the tacit support of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the reformed East German Communist party. Mr Reinhard Hoppner, the SPD leader in Saxony-Anhalt, said negotiations were in progress to clear the way for the formation of a state government. He had earlier rejected the idea of forming a so-called 'grand coalition' between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the SPD, the two biggest parties in the state parliament. The SPD said it had opted for the so-called red-green coalition, regarded by many as a risky experiment, to show that it was serious about winning the general elections in October and would not accept any pacts with the CDU. If the experiment in Saxony-Anhalt works it could bolster the SPD which is now trailing the CDU in most opinion polls. However, the closer ties between the SPD and the PDS will give Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats valuable political ammunition in the run-up to the October elections, allowing them to cast the SPD as allies of a party which is regarded by many people in western Germany as unacceptable. In Bavaria the PDS is ranked alongside the far-right Republicans and both are under surveillance by the interior ministry. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian equivalent of the CDU, opened what is likely to be a barrage of criticism by accusing the SPD of giving a 'helping hand to the drawing-room Bolsheviks'. The CDU emerged as the biggest party in the state elections last week with 37 seats in the state parliament. The SPD has 36 seats, the PDS 21 and the left-wing Greens five.</p>

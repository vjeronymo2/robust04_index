			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent For all its adventures in waste management, Severn Trent has outperformed the sector due to its attractions as a utility. The water business was endowed with cash at privatisation and has been well managed since then. Capital expenditure was skewed towards the early years, which allowed the company to benefit from low construction costs during recession. Investment spending last year was Pounds 25m less than budgeted as a result. Despite losing business from British Coal, the impact of recession on turnover has been generally less severe than in regions such as Anglian. Such considerations have outweighed the drag from Biffa, the waste business bought for Pounds 212m three years ago. The quality of Biffa has rarely been questioned, even if the price Severn Trent paid for it has. As Biffa's operating performance improves, the drag on earnings should lessen. Still, it will be some years before the waste side is covering the financing costs of the acquisition. A Pounds 4.7m loss on international business hardly instills confidence in other non-utility activities. But the merits of Severn Trent's water business show no sign of diminishing. Capital spending through the second half of the decade should be low relative to cash flow, so the company should end up less heavily geared than many of its peers. High dividend cover also points to flexibility on the pay-out. If Severn Trent can avoid embarrassments elsewhere, the utility looks well positioned to shine.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HUNTER THOMPSON CHARGED  </P> <P> Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson says drug and sexual-assault charges filed  against him are part of a "witch hunt" because of his anti-Establishment views.  </P> <P> Thompson, 52, was charged Monday with five felony drug charges and three  misdemeanor counts, including sexual assault, stemming from a Feb. 21 incident  at his Woody Creek home.  </P> <P> Thompson pleaded not guilty to the three misdemeanors. No pleas were entered on  the felony charges, but a court date of April 23 was set for a preliminary  hearing.  </P> <P> Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, a former pornographic movie actress and producer,  claimed Thompson took drugs in her presence and touched her breast while  roughing her up. She told authorities she had gone to his home to discuss a  business enterprise and he became angry when she refused to conduct the session  in the hot tub.  </P> <P> Thompson claimed the woman was drunk and was pressuring him to have sex when he  pushed her.  </P> <P> Palmer-Slater's allegations led to an 11-hour search of Thompson's home, in  which authorities seized drugs and explosives.  </P></p>

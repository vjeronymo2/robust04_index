			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BARTON HILL HEARING DELAYED  </P> <P> At the request of the developer, the Los Angeles City Council's Planning and  Environment Committee has delayed a public hearing on a controversial project  that calls for 100 condominiums and 68 apartments for senior citizens to be  built in the Barton Hill section of San Pedro.  </P> <P> The project has generated opposition from those who say that the site, 515 N.  Beacon St., is unsuitable for senior citizens and that the condominiums will  spark the gentrification of Barton Hill, which is home to many low-income  people.  </P> <P> About two dozen San Pedro residents, many of them elderly, came to Tuesday's  committee meeting to oppose the project. The president of the San Pedro  Peninsula Homeowner's Coalition said his group opposes it. And an aide to Los  Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said that at Flores' direction, he, too,  came to Tuesday's hearing prepared to speak against the project.  </P> <P> Douglas Ring, a lawyer for developers George and Michael Tumanjan, said he  requested the delay because Flores -- whose recommendation will carry weight  with the committee -- is in the Soviet Union on city business. "I think it's  appropriate that the councilwoman be in town," he said.  </P></p>

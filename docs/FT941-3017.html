			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Kinkel: undiplomatic voice abroad Mr Francois Scheer, France's extremely able and experienced ambassador to Germany, was not the only man in the firing line in Bonn yesterday. To be sure, his injudicious briefing of German correspondents on current strains in the vital Franco-German relationship was the immediate cause of an audible outburst of German indignation. German officials were adamant that he had been 'summoned' to the Foreign Ministry to explain himself, and persuaded to issue a retraction of his reported words. The French version was that the meeting was pre-arranged, and the whole affair blown up out of all proportion. Yet behind the diplomatic flurry, and the anxious telephone calls between Bonn and Paris, lay the hand of the man who was clearly the target of much of the real French concern about Germany's new foreign policy style and direction: Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister. It is his manner of speaking and short fuse in delicate negotiations which have clearly upset some of his counterparts, both in Paris and Brussels. He is clearly a man who arouses strong feelings on both sides. 'He is like a breath of fresh air,' according to one European diplomat in Bonn. 'He is certainly a bit of a bull in a china shop, but sometimes deliberately so. That is his way of getting things done.' One member of the French government puts it rather differently, albeit diplomatically: 'We have been a little upset by his dynamism,' he said yesterday. In Brussels, officials involved in the recent enlargement negotiations on the admission of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the EU - negotiations on which the German government set great store - described his behaviour as 'extraordinary'. 'He was cursing people on all sides, saying he was wasting his time,' according to one senior official. 'He managed to offend the Spanish, the Irish, the Norwegians and the French, to mention just a few.' Yet he has his admirers. One fairly neutral observer declared: 'The enlargement talks were his finest hour. If it had not been for Kinkel, they would never have been finished. 'The Germans moved in and took over the whole thing. They set up informal working groups under German chairmanship. It was a thoroughly impressive operation.' Mr Kinkel is the unlikely combination for a foreign minister of an undiplomatic, unpolitical animal. Yet he was singled out by his former boss and mentor, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, as the right man to take over his mantle, not only as foreign minister but also as leader of the Free Democratic party, the eternal king-makers in the German system of coalition governments. The pressure on him today is enormous. Not only does he have to carry out all the functions of a foreign minister, but he also has to rescue his party from the threat of political oblivion. The FDP slumped last weekend in the state elections in Lower Saxony below the magic 5 per cent needed to gain any seats. It was a result certain to fuel grumbling about his leadership. His lack of frontline political experience also makes him hypersensitive to criticism. 'He has a very short fuse, and he is sensitive about being sensitive,' one Bonn observer said yesterday. 'He is under attack on the domestic front, where his party is in grave trouble. And he faces criticism about his lack of diplomacy. 'Mr Scheer could scarcely have chosen a worse moment to criticise him personally.' Odd Couple's tiffs, page 19</p>

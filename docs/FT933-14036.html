			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Pay rises at lowest level for 26 years: Average earnings up 3.75% AVERAGE earnings across the economy rose an underlying 3.75 per cent in the year to May, the lowest figure for 26 years. In a further sign of low inflation, wages per unit of output in manufacturing in the three months to May declined 3.6 per cent compared with the same period last year. This is the biggest year-on-year fall since the Department of Employment started records in 1970. Due to low wage increases and substantial rises in output, production per employee in manufacturing increased 8.7 per cent between March and May on the same period last year. The employee production figure was last bettered at the end of 1986. The year-on-year rise in the index of earnings for all economic sectors has come down substantially from 7 per cent in April last year. The figures are seasonally adjusted and also take out erratic influences such as delays in the payment of wages. In November the rise in the index was 5 per cent, while in April it was 4 per cent. Average earnings have fallen particularly sharply in service industries, for which the year-on-year increase was 3 per cent in May, after a revised 3.25 per cent the previous month. In manufacturing the equivalent figure was 5 per cent in both months. In June last year, average earnings in both sectors rose 6.25 per cent compared with the equivalent month a year previously. In a sign of improved demand in manufacturing, an average of 9.75m hours per week of overtime were worked in May, an increase of 1.45m hours on April. This was the highest overtime figure since July last year. New job vacancies recorded at government Jobcentres rose a seasonally adjusted 183,900 in June, the highest monthly rise for 2 1/2 years. This may be a sign that employers are trying harder to recruit people. Jobcentres are thought to be notified of about a third of all job openings.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Success of excess - How to profit from a visit to the energetically capitalist city of Budapest A Budapest education begins as soon as a visitor lands at Ferihegy airport. Capitalism is at its rawest at the taxi rank. Appropriately known as 'hyenas', private cab drivers puncture rivals' tyres, collude cosily with the airport authorities and the police, and charge more than double the going rate. But as ever in Hungary, there is a kis kapu, a side door, a way around every problem. To avoid the hyenas, take the airport minibus. Or order a cab run by Fotaxi, a state-owned company, by going to the Fotaxi desk or phoning 222-2222. Not only will you save Ft1,000 (Dollars 10); you can feel you have done your bit for the free market. The rule holds in town. Do not get into unmarked cars. Look for the oval light and red checks of Fotaxi, or order one. Anyone who can get the better of Hungarian taxis should coast through the rest of a business trip. Economic reform started earlier in Hungary than elsewhere in eastern Europe. The culture and infrastructure of commerce have had longer to develop and mature. Despite all the frustrations, Budapest works. After all, about half the direct investment in eastern Europe has gone to Hungary. Budapest, which is the most populous city in east-central Europe with more than 2m inhabitants, has regained its pre-communist position as a regional hub. When it comes to accommodation, for luxury and convenience stay in the new post-modern Kempinski hotel, in the commercial centre of Pest. For character and architecture try the art nouveau Gellert on the Buda bank of the Danube. Buy forints, the local currency, at the hotel. Hard currency is no longer preferred tender. Those in search of east European adventure and a better exchange rate can try the grey market. Deal only with the Arab money-changers, who won't cheat you, on Petofi Sandor utca (street) or in the Italian restaurant on Regiposta utca. When you set out on your business appointments, make sure you have a thick wad of business cards. Hungarians rival the Japanese in their enthusiasm for the ritual of card-exchanging. Running out is embarrassing and damaging to credibility. Be careful how you read a Hungarian's name. The Hungarian style is to put surname first, familiar name second. Foreigners often get confused, and are inadvertently over-familiar with senior officials and executives. No matter how many people are in the room, shake hands with everybody on arriving and leaving, and on first and subsequent meetings, no matter how awkward it seems. It is imperative to ask someone with local knowledge - a consultant, investment banker or commercial counsellor - to suggest or arrange meetings. Go to the top, but not necessarily the very top. In many ministries and Hungarian companies there is a younger English- or German-speaking official who can tell you far more than his or her boss would. Business attire is relaxed. Air-conditioning is rare at ministries and local companies, so it is acceptable to wear short-sleeved shirts in summer. Hungarians loosen ties and often dispense with them altogether by late afternoon. Inviting a business partner to lunch is a good way to establish a more personal relationship, as it is in the west. The Kempinski, Kacsa and Szinbad restaurants are safe choices. To impress, opt for the Gundel, a grand restaurant next to the city zoo, refurbished at great expense by George Lang. Western expatriates often grow sick of Hungary's rich cuisine. Suggest Amadeus or Cyrano, both in the city centre, for something lighter. Alcohol with a meal is cus-tomary. Budapest is more than a collection of hotels, ministries and company headquarters connected by taxi rides. The city has one of the world's most dramatic urban geographies. The Gellert hill in Buda rises sheer above the Danube - it looms over the grand boulevards of Pest and the great Hungarian plain beyond it. Budapest is livelier than pretty Prague, better preserved than bombed-out Warsaw. Start a summer evening in the courtyard of Kis Buda Gyongye, which offers Hungarian food as light - and service as good - as it gets. Then sample the nightlife, which has a rather raunchy tradition. Edward VII, while Prince of Wales, was a fan of the notorious turn-of-the-century night clubs. Nincs Pardon, Crazy Cafe and Paris Texas are among the better bars. The discos of the moment are Saigon and Mad Block. The Tilos az A is a three-level club where live bands and DJs vie to play some of the best and worst music in town. Ring the bell at the Piaf piano bar, and round off the evening watching drunken actors stumbling against the backdrop of red velvet decor. Saturday is no day to sleep in. The thermal baths close at noon. The Gellert is the most famous, but insiders prefer the Rudas, which dates back to the Turkish occupation. Spend the afternoon drinking endless coffee and scoffing pastry in one of Budapest's cafes, legacies of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The Gerbeaud is the grandest, but overridden by tourists, so a better choice is the Muvesz, opposite the neo-Renaissance Opera. The elegant Cafe Gusto offers an alternative to the usual heart-attack cakes; it has the best salads in town. Then again, this is Budapest, so perhaps excess is in order.</p>

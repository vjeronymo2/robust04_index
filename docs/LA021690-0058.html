			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> NORIEGA CASE PILOT ENTERS GUILTY PLEA  </P> <P> Panamanian pilot Eduardo Pardo pleaded guilty to one racketeering count in the  drug conspiracy case involving Manuel A. Noriega and is expected to testify for  the prosecution when the deposed Panamanian dictator goes on trial.  </P> <P> Pardo entered his plea in Miami to a charge that he flew $800,000 in cocaine  proceeds from Florida to Panama in 1983. He faces a maximum possible punishment  of five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. The plea by Pardo, 44, who will  be sentenced in April, could lead to similar pleas from some of the four other  co-defendants who are accused with Noriega of importing cocaine into the United  States through Panama, according to sources close to the case.  </P></p>

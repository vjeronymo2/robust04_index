The engine manufacturer would be responsible for selecting and testing one engine from each engine family which is most likely to be that engine family's worst case emitter. The criterion for selecting the worst case engine would be that engine configuration which has the highest weighted brake-specific fuel consumption over the appropriate engine test cycle. EPA could verify the test results by requiring Administrator testing of this engine. EPA would also have the option to test any available test engine representing other configurations in the engine family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before emission testing was carried out, the manufacturer would perform service accumulation on each test engine over the dynamometer hour accumulation cycle of its choice based on good engineering practices (for example, a cycle representative of typical ``break-in'' operation of a new production engine in actual use). For each engine family, the manufacturer would determine the number of hours required to stabilize the emissions of the test engine. However, the number of hours which the manufacturer chose could not exceed 12 hours. EPA does not believe a break-in time greater that 12 hours is necessary to stabilize new engine emissions. In addition, this cutoff is necessary to ensure that EPA gets an equitable view of stabilized emissions over all engine families which may vary with respect to HC and CO emission degradation and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission improvement with time. The manufacturer would maintain, and provide in its application to the Administrator, a record of the rationale used both in making the dynamometer cycle selection and in making the service accumulation hours determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures lead an erratic equity sector ECONOMIC and currency worries continued to overhang the UK stock market yesterday and share prices again traced a sharply erratic pattern, often directed by the trend of stock index futures. Although there was no lack of specific features, trading volume overall slipped back from last week's slightly improved levels. The stock market was unsettled by the growing sounds of the political battle building up ahead of this year's general election in the UK. The latest statistics on domestic consumer credit, showing a dip in new credit and also the fourth consecutive monthly fall in net credit, together with a very modest increase in November's retail sales, appeared to undermine further hopes that consumers will lead the UK economy out of recession still overhanging the broad range of manufacturing companies. Concern over the outlook for UK interest rates continued as the pound, although calmer yesterday, softened further against the German D-Mark. Hints of further strains among the home loan companies were no help to underlying investment confidence in the equity sector. The first day of the new equity account opened with share prices generally lower in reaction to falls in stock prices in both Tokyo and New York. London's setback was emphasised when an early premium on the FT-SE March contract immediately brought in sellers, first of the future and then of the underlying stocks. A loss of 21 on the Footsie scale, however, was recovered as sterling performed steadily and London picked up hints of a firmer opening on Wall Street. The early setback in the Footsie was converted into a 13.7 points gain. In the event, the Dow Average was a few points easier in UK hours but the Footsie received further encouragement in late dealings from a renewed rally in the futures market. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,490.1 for a rise of 12.2 on the day. At the session's best, the Footsie was still more than eight points short of the 2,500 mark, and traders said there was not enough support behind equities yesterday to give credence to this fresh move towards an important chart hurdle. Seaq volume slipped to 429.3m shares from Friday's 589.7m and dealers believed that yesterday's total took in an increased proportion of intra-market business. Customer, or retail, business increased at the end of last week as some profits were taken. Some disappointment was expressed yesterday that the new account had not brought much sign of institutional buying. Among the heavyweight blue chip stocks, bullish views on the US dollar kept share prices firm. Oil shares staged a recovery as some UK securities firms restored BP and Shell to their buying lists. But the UK financial sector remained nervous, and modest losses were scattered across the leading names. Pharmaceuticals, however, still seen as the most favoured sector for the 1990s, moved forward again, led by Glaxo. The disappointing data on UK domestic credit made little impact on a retail sector which had already failed to sustain its Christmas rally. Share prices for the high street stores edged higher yesterday, but traders said this was a technical rally rather than a change of stance by investors.</p>

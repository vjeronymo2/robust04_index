			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Shell to expand research centre Shell is to spend Pounds 70m over seven years modernising and expanding its main UK research centre at Thornton, Cheshire. Thornton, which is one of the largest of Shell's 15 complexes of industrial laboratories worldwide, currently employs 600 staff. By the end of next year it will take in 140 scientists from a centre in Sittingbourne, Kent, which Shell is closing. The Cheshire centre's best known work is on automotive fuels and lubricating oils. It has also become one of the world's foremost centres for combustion science and hazard analysis, where its work on gas explosions in confined spaces has enabled safer design of offshore oil and gas platforms since the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> 'PRIESTESS' GUILTY OF PROSTITUTION  </P> <P> A Canyon Country woman who claims to be a priestess of an ancient Egyptian  religion was convicted today of two misdemeanor counts of prostitution.  </P> <P> After 3 1/2 days of deliberations, the six-man, six-woman Municipal Court jury  returned the guilty verdict against Mary Ellen Tracy, 46, also known as Sabrina  Aset, high priestess of the Church of the Most High Goddess. The jury also  convicted her husband, Wilbur, 51, of one count of operating a house of  prostitution.  </P> <P> The couple had contended that under the tenets of their religion, sex was used  as a purification ritual and that Mary Ellen Tracy had to have sex with  thousands of men to attain her standing as a high priestess. But the jury  apparently decided the Tracy's West Los Angeles two-story, Spanish-style  "church," complete with an office, living room and four bedrooms, was a thinly  veiled brothel.  </P></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (3): Strategies which yield inadequate results - Why the trade gap is widening EUROPE'S semiconductor manufacturers have been forced to play a desperate game of catch-up with their Japanese and US rivals, computer makers are struggling for survival, and the consumer electronics groups have yet to show that they can translate big spending in the laboratory into timely commercial products. These problems are not new. In November, 1988, the European Commission presented its first report on the state of science and technology in Europe and concluded that Europe was still gripped by technological dependency in key areas. The report said that in spite of a dramatic increase in research and development spending in Europe, Japan and the US were well ahead in terms of the amount of R&amp;D spending, the number of research scientists and engineers, and in successfully enticing the private sector to invest in R&amp;D. It then identified three main targets for research, improving competitiveness, improving quality of life and concentrating on basic research. In their attempts to revitalise Europe's flagging IT and electronics sectors Europe's policy makers have consistently emphasised R&amp;D. In particular, they have encouraged IT companies to pool their R&amp;D efforts, particularly in the area of 'pre-competitive' research. This policy is set to continue with the EC planning to spend Ecu5.7bn between 1990 and 1994 to support research and development, 40 per cent of it on collaborative research in IT. The Commission wants to channel this money into fewer, larger schemes, but complains that its spending is diffused because its member governments each insist on a share of the pie. There is no doubt that companies have rushed to join EC-subsidised research programmes such as Esprit and Race as well as pan-European programmes like Eureka which includes costly flagship projects such as the Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative (Jessi) and the High Definition Television (HDTV) project. But there is a continuing debate over whether the EC has got its R&amp;D strategy right, not least because the results are at best inconclusive - and there seems to be much more research than development of commercial products and processes, something Europe has recently fallen down on. Last year, the European Court of Auditors joined the fray arguing that in spite of Ecu5.4bn spent on research between 1987 and 1991 only a small fraction of research work had resulted in concrete applications. The Court of Auditors report recommended diverting more funds into the practical application of research and reorganising the manner in which research findings are disseminated. Supporters of the EC, strategy, however claim that although EC funding for European collaborative research is tiny compared with many national, or even some corporate R&amp;D budgets, it has encouraged the European IT industry to increase its R&amp;D spending significantly. Nevertheless, the performance of the Europe's indigenous IT and electronics industries has shown little improvement. Europe's IT trade deficit has continued to deteriorate in the past decade, most of the region's large computer and semiconductor companies are losing money, their share of the global IT market is disproportionately small and falling, and despite higher R&amp;D spending there are still very few developing product markets in which European electronics companies can claim to be world leaders. Europe's large semiconductor companies, Philips of Holland, Siemens of Germany, and the French/Italian SGS Thomson, produce only about 10 per cent of the world's output of chips and are dwarfed by their US and Japanese rivals. All three continue to be heavily subsidised in their efforts to catch up in chip technology and Siemens has now turned to IBM as a partner to develop 64Mb D-Rams, the next generation of memory chips. Similarly, nearly all the large European computer companies are in financial trouble because of falling sales, increased competition, the high cost of research and development, and demands from larger customers for open systems which yield inherently lower gross margins than proprietary systems. In Europe, the situation has been worsened by the plethora of small national markets, which has made economies of scale difficult to achieve, and a tendency to support 'national champions' which has hampered collaboration and co-operation. The sale of a controling stake in ICL of the UK to Japan's Fujitsu in 1990 effectively ended any hopes for a pan-European coalition which might have linked ICL with the other leading players - Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, Groupe Bull of France and Olivetti of Italy. By 1995, according to some estimates, the European-owned full-line computer makers could have less than 7 per cent of the worldwide market for data-processing equipment, compared with just over 10 per cent at present. As Groupe Bull's recently announced technological and marketing agreement with IBM indicates, it is probably only a matter of time before they are forced into strategic alliances with foreign competitors to ensure their survival - but at the expense of their independence and national identity. Inadequate home demand has been blamed for the industry's weaknesses, including its difficulties in producing innovative products. Although Europe's spending on IT has been rising, it is still lower per head than in the US and Japan, and large European information systems users are notoriously cautious about pioneering leading-edge applications. Brussels is now considering plans to boost demand by persuading national authorities jointly to back a plan hatched by the big European computer companies for a multi-million-dollar computer network to span Europe. The intention is to provide both an IT infrastructure for the Continent and at the same time provide a boost for the ailing computer companies. But there are already doubts about whether the large contracts it would generate could legally be reserved for the European-owned suppliers it is intended to benefit, and whether it would not simply repeat at the regional level European countries' largely unsuccessful use of public procurement to bolster national champion suppliers. A similarly gloomy picture emerges in Europe's consumer electronics industry where competition has dramatically shortened product cycles. In order to compete, therefore, companies must get innovative products out of traditional R&amp;D labs and into the marketplace fast. The need to address this and other pressing challenges, like responsiveness to customer demand, has now been recognised in some European boardrooms. Philips has just announced it managed to swing back into profit in 1991 following the record Fl4.24bn loss sustained in 1990 which prompted an ambitious restructuring including the sale of non-core businesses, and the re-focusing of the company's technological strengths on new consumer products. In order to maintain a foothold in the fiercely competitive global consumer electronics marketplace Philips has been investing heavily in the three emerging technologies of Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), High Definition Television (HDTV) and, in conjunction with Sony, Interactive Compact Discs (CD-I). The Dutch group's performance is being carefully watched as a barometer of Europe's electronics industry. As one of the few remaining diversified European electrical and electronics companies, Philips is a champion of a cause - the maintenance of an independent European capability in electronic technologies. The only electronics equipment sector in which Europe consistently boasts profitable world leaders is telecommunications, where the long established monopoly procurement of network equipment in most countries shelters entrenched suppliers from competition and maintains high margins. Two other possible growth areas for European IT are custom-chips, and the parallel processing field in which European companies are believed to have an edge. Europe is also well represented by software development houses and IT service companies. There are some 13,000 computing software and services companies in Europe and, if the region has a future in IT, it probably lies with these companies rather than the troubled giants of the hardware business. As Mr Vittorio Cassoni, Olivetti's managing director, said recently when referring to Europe's weakness in computer technology, the Commission should not spend money trying to catch trains that Europe had already missed. What is certain is that competition for indigenous European IT companies will intensify, and that US and Japanese companies will continue to be active in establishing plants in Europe. If Europe's industrial strategists fail to halt the decline, the future of European IT and electronics may rest in these foreign owned plants.</p>

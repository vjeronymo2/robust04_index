			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Banham changes Ridings' boundary A shift in the boundary between the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire is the only change in plans from Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission for Lincolnshire, Humberside and North Yorkshire compared with its provisional findings for the area last June. Lincolnshire will remain the same while the other two counties each see the removal of one 'tier' of government, and the amalgamation of several existing authorities. The change shifts Selby District Council, and the portion of Boothferry District Council which includes Goole, from the East Riding to the West Riding. The new creation is closer to the old boundaries of the West Riding, according to Sir John, but produces a disparate collection of communities spreading from the banks of the River Humber to the border with Lancashire. York is to be turned into 'greater York' in a move welcomed by the local Confederation of British Industry. Surrounding district councils attacked the plan, and said it did not have popular support.</p>

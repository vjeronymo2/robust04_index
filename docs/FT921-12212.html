			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / US and Russia take heat out of PLO demands LAST-MINUTE talks were being held last night to ensure the Middle East multinational forum due to open in Moscow today goes ahead as planned, following demands by the Palestine Liberation Organisation for broader Palestinian representation. US and Russian co-sponsors of the forum feared the issue of Palestinian representation could provoke a walkout by the Israeli delegation. PLO calls for the Palestinian delegation in Moscow to include representatives from the diaspora, among them Jerusalem-born Palestinians, have cast a shadow over the multilateral talks, the third stage of the latest Middle East peace effort launched in Madrid last October. Seeking to play down the argument, US and Russian officials made it clear the Palestinian delegation must be restricted to the 'Madrid formula' allowing only representatives from the West Bank and Gaza strip, occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. A two-tier Palestinian delegation was due in Moscow last night. At the Madrid opening last October, the Palestinian team included representatives from east Jerusalem, but these did not participate directly in the discussions with Israel. Representatives from about 18 countries, including permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, are expected to sit down today in Moscow's Hall of Unions to discuss such issues as regional disarmament, economic development, water and the environment. Syria and Lebanon are boycotting the talks, claiming Israel has shown no commitment to a Middle East settlement based on the 'land for peace' formula outlined in United Nations Security Council resolutions. Radical Palestinians have condemned Arab participation. The US wants to use the Moscow meeting - involving Israel for the first time in discussing Middle East questions with Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey as well as Arabs from the Gulf and Africa - to lessen the Jewish state's regional isolation. Israel and delegations representing Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian Palestinian team have conducted three rounds of bilateral talks in Madrid and in Washington marked by procedural argument. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state and originator of this latest Middle East peace effort, is anxious for the Moscow meeting to establish the framework for tackling multilateral Middle East issues before the general election in Israel later this year brings the peace process at least to a temporary halt.</p>

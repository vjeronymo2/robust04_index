			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FOX SHOWS HIT TOP 10 IN L.A. NIELSENS  </P> <P> In Nielsen ratings for Los Angeles, two Fox network shows placed in the top 10,  "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children" -- their highest local ratings  ever.  </P> <P> The Sunday night cartoon show finished third in local ratings for the week with  a 24.2 rating, beaten only by Nielsen warhorses "Cheers," with a 27.4 rating  and "The Cosby Show" with 26. Fourth was "60 Minutes" with 24.2. Fox's offbeat  "Married" was seventh with 23. Fox programs are aired on KTTV, Channel 11.  </P> <P> Local ratings are an important gauge for Fox Network programs since the  syndicated shows are not aired in all communities covered by the nationwide  Nielsen ratings.  </P></p>

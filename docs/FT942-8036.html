			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Campaign Diary: Foreign hopefuls liven up contest Obscure it may be; dull it is not. The departing European parliament includes some remarkable MEPs including an Italian representing his fourth political party and a Dutch Roman Catholic priest who is a Green. The hopefuls standing on June 9 also include the biggest-ever crop of 'foreign' candidates standing in countries other than their own. Mr Pedro Canavarro, a Portuguese candidate for the Northern league in Italy, will no doubt win support for announcing that he is learning Italian - just in case he is elected. For sheer eccentricity however, it is hard to beat our own Screaming Lord Sutch, perennial by-election candidate of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party. Sutch planned to put up candidates in France and Germany as well as the UK under the slogan 'Loonies of the World Unite'. Unfortunately, the party seems to have failed to register in time for the ballot - the European parliament says the only Loonies it knows of are British. Sutch himself is too busy to stand for Strasbourg. He plans to fly the Loony flag in the Barking, Eastleigh and Bradford South by-elections. But he has no doubts about the main opposition. 'Every time we come up against the Greens we poll double their vote,' he says.                           *       *       * Two non-nationals trying their luck in Britain have had contrasting receptions. Parisian-born Conservative Christine Adamson, nee Piot, wife of a Harrogate chartered accountant, says she has been well received in Yorkshire South-West. But then she has little chance of ousting Labour. Gisela Gschaider, a German-born college lecturer, is having a bumpier ride for Labour in Worcestershire and Warwickshire South. Her opponent, Conservative candidate John Corrie, says voters want a British MEP. He adds gracefully: 'I hope that the German candidate enjoys her short sojourn in this beautiful heart of England.' Brian Wilson, Labour MP for Cunninghame North, may be a sought-after ally in Labour's leadership election - he is the only Labour MP who owns a newspaper. This week's issue of the staunchly Labour West Highland Free Press pays dignified tribute to John Smith, the late leader, but ignores the leadership contenders. 'The paper will make its choice clear over the next few weeks, at the same time as me. But I can't imagine our readers are waiting desperately for our verdict,' Wilson says modest-ly. At least he can't complain about newspaper proprietors trying to hijack the election. Let no one accuse the Greens of hypocrisy. The party opposes pollution, so naturally it omitted to inform Fleet Street's political correspondents about the launch of its manifesto. Result: the launch went unpolluted by journalists, and the manifesto went largely unreported. A pity, because it includes some interesting ideas. For example, Greens not only oppose a single European currency, they want more currencies - local ones to promote recirculation of money. They have obviously never tried to spend a Scottish fiver in Kent. Green candidates are standing in all 84 mainland constituencies with hopes of repeating their 1989 haul of 2.3m votes. Sadly, the list of candidates excludes David Icke, the former television presenter who claims a direct line to the Almighty. 'He left the party some years ago,' a party official says sniffily.                           *       *       * Lindi St Clair, otherwise known as Miss Whiplash, will also be absent, following the collapse of her Corrective party last year. Miss St Clair, a doughty campaigner for courtesans' rights, is understood to have retired from politics. But watch out for the Natural Law party, which is standing in every constituency, in spite of losing deposits in the 350 seats it contested in the 1992 general election. The party, which demonstrates Yogic Flying at election meetings, polled an average of 150 votes. It hopes for take-off this time. 'We got 3 per cent in the West Lancashire local elections,' it says hopefully. Observer, Page 19</p>

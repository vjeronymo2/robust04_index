			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved ahead strongly, leading the cash market for most of the session and racking up the best day's trading volume for some weeks, writes Jeffrey Brown. Contract numbers powered ahead to 15,363 from 10,862 on Tuesday, and with spread trading holding at nominal levels it was nearly all genuine two-way business. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,115 at the official 4.10pm close, up 44 points. The premium to cash equities was 14 points, with fair value premium running at around 7 points. Traders said the improvement in activity was the most striking feature of the session, with much of the day's buying pressure coming from US houses, notably Goldman Sachs. The contract lost some of its impetus in the final hour of trading, and the premium to cash equities, which had been 20 points for much of the session and underpinning a reasonable level of arbitrage business, narrowed. The key to further upwards progress is clearly Wall Street, which showed signs of flaggging towards the end of the London day. In late, screen trading the December contract slipped below 3,100. Traded options activity jumped to 35,998 lots, from 28,478 on Tuesday, with FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business coming to 15,854.</p>

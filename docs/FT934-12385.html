			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / BR may win right to bid: Compromise considered to halt Tory rebellion on railway sell-off THE GOVERNMENT is considering a compromise over its railway privatisation proposals which would allow British Rail to bid for some franchises under certain conditions. The potential compromise is designed to win over Conservative rail rebels who support a Lords amendment giving BR the right to become a franchisee. Ministers believe the Lords amendment would negate the effect of its proposals because BR would have an in-built advantage in bidding against the private sector. Under the terms of the possible compromise discussed with some backbench Conservative MPs, regarded as potential rebels, BR would have the right to bid for some franchises - but less than half of the total. The successful BR franchisees would have to operate as single units, publishing separate and transparent accounts. That condition would be designed to prevent BR submitting artificially low bids for routes by cross-subsidising them with revenues from other services. Lord Caithness, the government's transport spokesman in the Lords, recently argued that allowing BR to bid for the franchises would 'undermine the whole franchising process'. BR's inside knowledge of the financial performance and potential of its passenger services would give it an unfair advantage over the private sector in pitching its bid, he said. Supporters of railway privatisation fear that, irrespective of proposals to stop cross-subsidising, BR would still win all the franchises if it were allowed to take part. Putting a ceiling on the total number of franchises BR could bid for would guarantee an element of competition from the private sector. At a meeting of the Conservative backbench committee on transport Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday declined to say whether he would consider a compromise. The Railways Bill is due to go back to the Commons from the Lords for its third and final reading on Monday. If the cabinet decides to put forward new proposals, they would take the form of a clause seeking to amend the Lords amendment. Mr MacGregor has been meeting Conservative MPs during the past few days and privately brought up the possibility of a compromise. One MP close to the minister said: 'The government will press ahead with its rail privatisation proposals. But politics is the art of compromise and ministers are confident they have a formula which will receive the support of all Conservative backbenchers.' The transport secretary has already climbed down twice over aspects of his rail privatisation proposals. He agreed to commit the new rail regime to maintaining concessionary railcards, and to write pensions guarantees into the bill. However, the concession over the industry's pension fund gained a frosty response from the fund's trustees. Mr Derek Fowler, trustee chairman, said in a letter to Mr MacGregor that he is still concerned by the government's plans, which seek to water down its obligations on Treasury contributions to the fund.</p>

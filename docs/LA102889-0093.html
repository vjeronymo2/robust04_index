			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. OFFICIAL WHO RESIGNED DENIES ANY WRONGDOING  </P> <P> A U.N. official who resigned amid allegations of financial impropriety denied  any wrongdoing Friday and said he stepped down because repeated attacks had  made his job increasingly difficult.  </P> <P> "It is quite clear that the function of the high commissioner requires a total  commitment and availability to act, to convince and to galvanize," said  Jean-Pierre Hocke, who resigned Thursday as high commissioner for refugees.  </P> <P> Such commitment had been "reduced by repeated and irresponsible attacks," he  said. "These were the considerations that led to my resignation, which should  not be seen as a withdrawal in the middle of the storm."  </P> <P> Hocke's resignation was announced in New York after U.N. Secretary General  Javier Perez de Cuellar ordered a broadened inquiry into allegations that Hocke  misused agency funds to subsidize first-class air travel.  </P> <P> Calling a news conference after his return from New York, Hocke read a  statement saying his resignation does "not reflect any sentiment of culpability  on my part concerning any of my doings."  </P></p>

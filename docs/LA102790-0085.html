			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 ARRESTED IN KIDNAP, GANG-RAPE OF WOMAN;  </P> <P> CRIME: SAN FRANCISCO WOMAN WAS ABDUCTED AS SHE WALKED TO BUY FORMULA FOR HER  BABY, AUTHORITIES SAY. ONE SUSPECT IS A SCHOOL SECURITY GUARD.  </P> <P> A Long Beach school security officer and three other men were arrested Friday  in the kidnaping and gang-rape of a San Francisco woman who was abducted as she  walked to buy formula for her baby, authorities said.  </P> <P> The 20-year-old woman, visiting the Los Angeles area with her husband and  child, was intercepted on her way to a store early Friday morning, forced into  a car and driven several blocks to where she was raped, Sheriff's Sgt. Bob  Olmsted said.  </P> <P> After an hourlong ordeal, she was rescued by two sheriff's deputies who  happened onto the scene, Olmsted said.  </P> <P> Deputies assigned to patrol the Metro Rail Blue Line spotted the car -- its  license plate covered with tape and plastic bags -- and approached two men  standing alongside it. As the two men started to walk away, deputies saw a gun  tucked into one man's waistband.  </P> <P> The two men were detained and when the deputies reached the car, they found  another man holding a semiautomatic pistol to the woman's head in the back  seat. A fourth man was sitting in the front seat, Olmsted said.  </P> <P> The suspect in the back seat was identified as Victor Lopez Jr., 27, a security  officer for the Long Beach school system and a reserve-duty Los Angeles County  Parks and Recreation safety officer. The three other men were identified as  gang members.  </P> <P> Olmsted said the woman was apparently abducted near the intersection of Martin  Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway about 1 a.m. The men drove  her to the 1300 block of Lime Avenue, a row of commercial buildings and  residences near Polytechnic High School, where Lopez was waiting.  </P> <P> The car and both guns were registered to Lopez, authorities said. One of the  guns -- a 9-millimeter Beretta -- was Lopez's county-issued weapon.  </P> <P> All four men were booked at the Carson sheriff's station on suspicion of rape,  conspiracy to commit rape, sodomy, forced oral copulation and assault with a  deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Lopez's boss said he was shocked at the allegations and described Lopez as a  reliable employee who never caused trouble.  </P> <P> "He's been a dependable officer," said Joe Romero, chief of security for the  Long Beach school system. "He's real quiet and just goes about and does his  job."  </P> <P> He said Lopez had worked for Long Beach for 2 1/2 years. Lopez is single and  lives with his mother in Burbank, Romero said.  </P> <P> As a school security officer, Lopez's duties included responding to fire or  burglary alarms at any of Long Beach's schools. He was not on duty at the time  of the alleged kidnaping and rape.  </P> <P> The other suspects arrested with Lopez were identified by authorities as Oniva  David Tautolo, 21; Owen Fuimaono Jr., 22, and Lau Talo Jr., 22, all of Long  Beach.  </P> <P> Lopez was being held in lieu of $50,000 bail, while bail was set at $30,000 for  the others.  </P> <P> The woman, whose name was not released, was treated at a local hospital. She,  her husband and their child had been staying at a Long Beach motel for several  weeks while visiting relatives in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

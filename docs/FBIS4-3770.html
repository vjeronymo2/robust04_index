			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By So Lai-fun] </F>   [Text] A "radical democratic party" is needed in Hong Kong  as 1997 approaches because the dominant liberal bloc is likely  to soften its stance towards China, says prominent dissident Lau  Shan-ching. Mr Lau envisaged that the radical democratic party,  which would confront the future sovereign power, would become an  anti- government force after the changeover. The dissident, who  was jailed for 10 years in China for "counter-revolutionary  activities", said the radical faction believed China was a  totalitarian state. Mr Lau did not say who might join the party,  but that he would devote himself to setting it up.    He said the newly-announced Democratic Party would be  nothing  but a bloc put together for election purposes and its weakness  would gradually be exposed as 1997 approached. The party would  not be able to endure political pressure from Beijing and would  backtrack on its opposition to China. Mr Lau cited as evidence  the case of Law Cheung-kwok, former vice-chairman of the  Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. He had been  widely attacked by the liberals for supporting the dismantling  of the three-tier election structure in 1997 in the recent  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference after being  appointed as a local delegate. "They are very naive if they  think that their relationship with China can be mended because  of the new composition of the party or the middleman role played  by (Meeting Point chairman Anthony) Cheung Bing-leung."    The emergence of a radical party was a natural development  in  the worsening political climate, and Mr Lau believed people  would accept this line. Mr Lau said United Democrats and  Meeting Point had never played a leadership role in Hong Kong's  democratic movement. "They are only eyeing their own political  interests. They are not genuine democrats," he said. "If they  are so, why don't they seek full democracy by 1995?"</p>

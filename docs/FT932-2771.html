			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: Dollars 21bn covers more than new Hong Kong airport Sir, Your report on Hong Kong's airport in the Aerospace survey ('Plethora of airports - Hong Kong', June 8) does us less than justice. Simon Davies wrongly suggested we are building an airport costing USDollars 21bn, which would indeed be very expensive when compared with Japan's Dollars 10bn airport at Kansai and Singapore's Dollars 1.3bn expansion at Changi. In fact, our airport is only costing Dollars 8.8bn. The Dollars 21bn (all the figures are out-turn prices) also covers 34 kilometres of highways and a railway, including the world's longest suspension bridge carrying road and rail traffic, plus 350 hectares of reclaimed urban land and a new town for 20,000 people. Along with other port and railway schemes, these interlinked infrastructure projects will form the basis for Hong Kong's economic expansion into the next century. They will ease problems in congested urban areas and open new areas for development, as well as starting a new highway to the border with China. That is more than just an airport] Mr Davies might also have noted that we are making outstanding progress with construction of the Dollars 21bn programme: we have awarded contracts worth some USDollars 4.4bn, all on time and within budget - a significant achievement by international standards. This is going ahead on a step-by-step basis while we continue talks with the Chinese government on financing arrangements for the airport and airport railway.

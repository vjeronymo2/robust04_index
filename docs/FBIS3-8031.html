			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRY Ambassador to Bulgaria Rados Smilkovic </F> by Plamen Kulinski; place and date not given: "Relations  Between Sofia and Belgrade Are Good, But Not What They Could and  Should Be"]    [Excerpts] [Kulinski] Mr. Ambassador, how do you assess  the latest developments in the situation in Sarajevo following  the NATO ultimatum? Do you agree with the calls made by certain  Western politicians and by Ankara that one should also proceed  along the same path to settle the problems in other disputed  enclaves in Bosnia?    [Smilkovic] I used to explain to my students that the NATO  pact was a military factor in the tragic balance of fear during  the years of the cold war. Now the eastern bloc has disappeared,  together with its bastion -- the Warsaw Pact, thus making NATO  superfluous. Accordingly, NATO is now seeking a new role, so as  to prove that it is still needed. It was scared by the end of  the civil war in the Balkans, so it launched a campaign with its  most terrible weapons against the Serbs to make it impossible  for them to conclude a peace treaty. Knowing that the Serbs are  a proud and brave nation, it issued an ultimatum to them to pull  out of Sarajevo and leave their compatriots defenseless. NATO  knew that the Serbs cannot accept such a solution, just as they  rejected it in 1941 and rose to arms to help their allies --  Great Britain, France, America, and Russia.    Yet again, in this century, Russia is saving Europe from its  own evil by returning to the labyrinths of the Balkans to  establish order by force. On behalf of Russia, President  Yeltsin appealed to the Serbs in Bosnia to withdraw their heavy  weapons from the territory of Sarajevo and allow Russian blue  helmets to take over peacekeeping in this region. Europe has  been saved from being plunged into a new war without borders.    It will be bad it they attempt to act in a similar way in  future, if other states, especially Turkey, join in the  conflict. The warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be  given the chance of achieving peace themselves by peaceful  means. When, in the past, others separated them [the warring  parties], as certain of our former allies are attempting to do  now, peace was always pushed further away. It does not become  democratic Europe to establish a new world order by air strikes.  Those who speak on behalf of the old Europe should know that  "blood is the wrong food for men." [passage omitted]    [Kulinski] Is the idea still alive that the Macedonians are  "southern Serbs?"    [Smilkovic] Ideas do not die; they are realized, disappear  into history, or are forgotten. As regards the expression  "southern Serbs," it was not invented. From the time of their  arrival in the Balkan peninsula, most of the Serbs lived in  compact groups in the southern part of the peninsula. Their  centuries-long sense of statehood and spirituality are tied up  with these territories, monasteries, schools, hospitals, and  graveyards. Although they are now destroyed and neglected, they  continue to serve as a living proof, Apart from this, it is  well-known that, in medieval times, Skopje was the capital of  the most powerful Serbian rulers.    As regards the Macedonians, in the Serbian perception, they  are a separate fraternal Slavonic nation that lives in Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], where  Serbs, Bulgarians, and other nationalities also live. In former  Yugoslavia, this fact was suppressed and never mentioned. The  Serbs also disregarded it in the socialist period, so as to  demonstrate greater broad- mindedness toward the other peoples,  especially the Macedonians. Unfortunately, some questions  relating to the position of the Serbs in Macedonia are still not  resolved, and for this reason various sides are misusing them in  their everyday politics. What is worst of all, the same thing  is also being done by those who are working from outside to  poison the relations between the peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  [passage omitted]    [Kulinski] The Bulgarians in Serbia are also suffering  privations at the present. There is apprehension that political  pressure is being applied to them to make the Bulgarian  population forget their national identity. How well-founded are  these claims?    [Smilkovic] The population is finding it difficult to live  in Montenegro as well as Serbia. All share this same fate,  including the Bulgarian national minority. The sanctions were  imposed against the citizens of Yugoslavia, irrespective of  their national affiliation. The Bulgarian minority is finding  it a little easier to bear the sanctions than the others, partly  because of the humanitarian aid that is sent directly from  Bulgaria, and partly due to the other benefits that living close  to the border in such circumstances provides.    There are no grounds for concern whether the Bulgarians in  the FRY can preserve their national identity. They enjoy all  the rights that the other citizens possess, and have every  opportunity to express their Bulgarian nationality in education,  culture, and other field of life. The best example is  Dimitrovgrad Municipality: There one in every three citizens has  a job. Although 52 percent of the population of the  municipality are Bulgarians, there are very few non-Bulgarians  occupying municipal posts or directorships of enterprises.  Although there are about 25,000 Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, you  can find them in the highest posts in the economic sector and  state administration. In Serbia, each deputy represents on  average 50,000 electors, yet a Bulgarian is a deputy in the  Serbian Skupshtina, even though the Bulgarians only have  one-third of the necessary votes. The Bulgarians in Serbia are  clever people and are against living in the ghetto that  individual chauvinist nationalists want to drive them into. The  length to which their so- called "champions" are prepared to go  is simply ludicrous. I recently read somewhere that they  [Bulgarians in Serbia] are deprived of their own language even  in the churches in Serbia. If one follows this logic, the Serbs  are threatened as well, because the language used in religion is  Church Slavonic. It is not good to claim, in these bad times  that the Serbian people are experiencing, that the Bulgarian  minority is threatened in the Serbian state. I have yet to read  in the press here that Bulgarians living as a minority in any  other land have greater rights than in Serbia and are more  satisfied with their lives. I will not raise any other issues,  because I do not want to create difficulties for our Bulgarian  brothers; it is quite enough that others are making difficulties  for them.    [Kulinski] How do you assess relations between Sofia and  Belgrade?    [Smilkovic] Our relations are good, but not what they could  and should be between two neighboring states and peoples. There  is a widespread view and feeling among the people of Yugoslavia,  especially in Serbia, that compared with similar situations that  have arisen during this century -- this is already the third  blockade of Serbia, relations between Bulgarians and Serbs have  never been better. The statements by Bulgarian leaders and  citizens protesting against the air strikes on the Serbian  positions in Sarajevo and calling for peace talks to end the war  had a good reception. The rally in Sofia was regarded in both  the Yugoslav republics as the voice of reason, as a warning to  the gods of war. The links between our two peoples are very  deep, because we have been living side by side from time  immemorial. They cannot be severed by any blockades. Since  cooperation and dialogue has not been broken off among the  people, it should not cease between our leaderships either. The  country of Yugoslavia is open to any kind of democratic dialogue  and cooperation, and I am here to help in ensuring that our  cooperation is intensive and fruitful. [passage omitted]</p>

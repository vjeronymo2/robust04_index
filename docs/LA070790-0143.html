			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMEN SHOULD STICK CLOSE TO THEIR GLUE GUNS  </P> <P> Next time you tackle a construction job around the home, reach for your gun.  I'm talking about your caulking gun. Load it up with one of a variety of  specialized construction adhesives now available in caulking gun cartridges,  and you'll have a potent tool for shooting down a wide variety of construction  problems. Examples?  </P> <P> Decking: The traditional way to fasten down deck planking is with two nails at  every joist. This holds the planks down, at least initially, but with time, it  also causes problems. One is splitting. Another is rust. Even the best  hot-dipped galvanized nails will rust eventually. This causes stains and  eventual deterioration of the decking. Nails can also work loose, pop up and  injure bare feet.  </P> <P> The answer to all these problems is deck adhesive, a special formula designed  to work well with pressure-treated stock. Using this adhesive won't eliminate  the need for nails entirely. You'll still need a few here and there (follow  directions on the glue cartridge) to restrain warped boards and keep good  contact between planking and joists. But you'll use far fewer nails than you  would without adhesive, and you'll get a stronger, more durable job in the  bargain.  </P> <P> Sub-flooring: Here's another ideal application for construction adhesive.  Typical floor construction calls for one layer of five-eighths or sometimes  half-inch plywood followed by another layer of plywood under-layment to provide  a smooth base for your finish flooring. By using adhesive and special  three-quarter-inch tongue-and-groove plywood, you can do the job with just one  layer. The adhesive should go on all joists, plus along the mating edges of the  plywood sheets. Nail according to adhesive instructions and you'll get a  sturdy, squeak-free floor with less labor than required for the old-fashioned  two-layer system.  </P> <P> Finishing off walls: There are also special adhesives for installing drywall  and paneling. I always like to use at least a few fasteners when installing  drywall, but with paneling, you may be able to get by without any nails at all,  using this trick:  </P> <P> Run a fat bead of adhesive on each stud and the panel in place, pressing it  firmly into the adhesive. Immediately pull the panel away to let the adhesive  dry for a short time (this varies according to brand). Then press the panel  back in place. When you do, it will stick like, well . . . glue.  </P></p>

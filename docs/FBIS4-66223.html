			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chi Yen-ling (4764 1693 7117): "You Want the KMT </F> to Give Up Power? That Must Wait For Another Generation!"]    [Excerpts] In recent years, although there has been a  significant decline in the KMT's governing position in the  political arena, its ruling position in the social area not only  shows no sign of loosening indication, it is showing a tendency  to grow stronger. [passage omitted]    Take enterprise circles as an example, with at least 1,000  entrepreneurs summoned by the Gejianyuan [7245 6432 7108] for  instruction; after their return, these people called each other  classmates, and formed cliques and groups to pursue common  interests. These "blue seeds" are now breeding and growing  throughout Taiwan, in every location and trade.    These entrepreneurs were used to ordering their employees  about at will, but because they had received the KMT's favors,  whenever there arose such issues as renewing the heads of  industrial and commercial associations, they all became very  obedient to the KMT. The general secretary of the Shekunghui is  equivalent to several big bosses, and for business which the  general secretary cannot handle, if the director of the union  handled it himself, after "persuading with major reasons" and  "promising profits," there are few examples of big bosses who  can turn it down.    Because entrepreneurs are always absolutely obedient to the  KMT, it is natural that the KMT views enterprise circles as its  organized external groups. So, even though elections in  enterprise circles are obviously their own internal matter, the  KMT will still present a slate of so-called "Party nominated  candidates" and "party planned list"; persons who have not been  nominated or are not listed will then be persuaded to withdraw  one by one from the election for "other, better candidates." To  the KMT, handling matters of this sort is much like handling  violations in one's "household affairs"; some people in  enterprise circles look upon this as the natural course of  events, and although there are some complaints, they accept it  in the end. Although there are many examples of minor  politicians "betraying the party" to run for election, one never  hears of big bosses "violating discipline" and "betraying the  party."    Behind the enterprise community, there are concealed persons  who hold in their hands life and death power over them. The  situation is no better in the sports world; the General Athletic  Association and the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee made  personnel changes which showed clearly that the KMT's dominance  in sports not only has not declined, but has risen. [passage  omitted]    Everyone knows that it was "Party Chairman" Lee Teng-hui's  [2621 4096 6540] nomination of Kuo Chung-ching [6753 1350 3237]  that landed him his position on the General Athletic  Association, and that kept Chang Feng-hsu [1728 0023 4872] in  office as Chairman of the Olympic Committee. Prior to the  reorganization, although there were many candidates, there was  also a strong offensive of persuading them to withdraw, so that  all of the "party nominees" passed, and none of those on the  "party plan list" lost. How envious were the members of the  Tsukunghui, working in the same building, at the Shekunghui's  two great sports world victories!    Although personnel moves in the sports world have always had  a strong political flavor, these had all taken place behind the  scenes in the past, and were limited to high level personnel  only. But this time, from higher to lower levels, from behind  the scenes to out front, everyone fought for power openly, even  playing in a big way the game of sharing booty, which has just  become popular in political circles.    A lot of "old timers" who had made contributions to the  sports world in the past were swept out the door, pushed aside  for "not belonging to the same clan"; some of them even had  their "names removed from the rolls forever."    Take as examples Chi Cheng [4764 2398] and Yang Chuan-kuang  [2799 0278 1639], the earliest Taiwan Olympic level athletes to  gain international reputations. Chi Cheng just resigned his  position as Secretary-General of the Track and Field  Association, while Yang Chuan-kuang is still at Tso Training  Center in charge of training. No matter whether one is speaking  of international reputation, or their contributions to the  nation, or their age and experience, these two people have not  reached the age of being too old, having to be replaced, or  having no more useful value. But the Olympic Committee and the  General Athletic Association treated them as trash and just  swept them out of door, while looking for some younger, less  qualified fellows to replace them.    Maybe it is unavoidable for politics to interfere with  sports, but such ugly interference is actually rarely seen in  the world. It is due precisely to Chi Cheng not supporting the  public voting law, and Yang Chuan-kuang being "so naive" as to  join the Democratic Progressive Party, but the outcome was that  both of them had the fate of having their names stricken from  sports circles. This is the sort of thing that Olympic Chairman  Samaranch, who has a strong political sense, will disagree with.    The fact that the KMT is declining in its governing position  in politics is not something they are doing voluntarily but  rather because multilateral pressures from both inside and  outside the system forced them to do so. By the same token, if  people want to break the KMT's traditional dominance in the  social sphere, enterprise circles and the sports world should  not wait for the KMT to voluntarily announce it is "abandoning  power" either.</p>

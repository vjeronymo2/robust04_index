			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ayrshire Metal surges to Pounds 1.35m Shares in Ayrshire Metal Products jumped 17p to 95p yesterday after the producer of cold rolled steel profiles maintained its first half progress with a surge in pre-tax profits from Pounds 209,000 to Pounds 1.35m in the year to end-December. After a two year absence, the dividend has been restored with a final payment of 1.5p. The company attributed the sharp recovery to the impact of cost reductions implemented over the past three years, together with small improvements in trading conditions. Cost cutting had continued in areas where there had been no sign of improved trading conditions - this resulted in further redundancy costs of Pounds 133,000 being incurred. Turnover on continuing operations grew from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 32.8m in the year. Earnings per share came to 8.3p (2.1p).</p>

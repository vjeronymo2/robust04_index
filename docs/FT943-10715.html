			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Earnings warning hits Newbridge Networks Newbridge Networks, until recently one of North America's best-performing technology companies, saw its share value drop almost a third yesterday after the company warned that first-quarter earnings would not match analysts' expectations. Ottawa-based Newbridge has emerged as a leader in the development of asynchronous mode transmission (ATM) switches and frame relay equipment. These products are a crucial link in the rapidly growing transfer of interactive information across telephone lines and computer networks. Newbridge claims to have captured about half the North American market for ATM wide-area network switches. Its customers include phone companies, government agencies and universities. Newbridge shares tumbled CDollars 17.87 to close at CDollars 40.38 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They reached a peak of CDollars 97.50 a year ago, but have gradually lost ground in line with investors' general disillusion with the high-technology sector, and concerns that Newbridge's share price exaggerated its earnings potential. At its peak, the share price was equal to more than 60 times earnings. The share-price shake-out follows Newbridge's announcement that earnings for the three months ended July would fall short of the 41 US cents a share posted in the preceding three months. However, the company said that earnings for the quarter - to be published on August 23 - would be higher than last year's first-quarter of 30 cents a share. Revenues, orders and an end of quarter backlog have broken records but have been offset by higher expenses. The jump in expenses was ascribed to expanded research and development staffing and a 'very busy' trade show and advertising programme. Mr Terry Matthews, chief executive and Newbridge's largest single shareholder, is no stranger to the vicissitudes of North American high-technology companies. He was a co-founder in the 1970s of Mitel Corporation, the Canadian telephone equipment maker, which enjoyed a period of rapid growth but suffered severe financial problems in the late 1980s. Mr Matthews left Mitel in 1986, shortly after British Telecommunications bought a controlling stake. He joined Newbridge shortly afterwards. BT sold its Mitel shares at a heavy loss in mid-1992. Newbridge's sales have more than quadrupled in the past four years. Wood Gundy, the Canadian investment house, recently estimated fiscal 1994 sales at USDollars 547m. Although the growth rate is expected to slow, Wood Gundy said annual demand for its advanced network systems would grow by at least 40 per cent over the next two years.</p>

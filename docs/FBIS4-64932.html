			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article including interview with Liberal Party Secretary </F> Peter Orn by Anita Kratz; place and date not given: "Tight in  the Middle for Liberal Party"]    [Text] With its defense of the welfare state, the Liberal  Party risks having the voters regard the party as the keeper of  a Social Democratic society. But this is not the case!    One of party secretary Peter Orn's major tasks, before he  leaves his job after the election and becomes secretary general  of the Swedish Red Cross, will be to show how hard the Liberal  Party has fought in order to build the welfare and how intensely  one is now working on a renewal of the welfare state. Because  there is no doubt that it has its flaws and shortcomings, the  way it has developed.    The public monopolies must be abolished, according to Peter  Orn. And that is what the party is working on as part of the  government, now that, for example, the family doctor and school  allowance are being introduced and Cultural Minister Birgit  Friggebo [Liberal Party] is breaking down the media monopoly.    Recently the Conservatives have talked increasingly loudly  about scrapping the welfare state and instead backing a basic  security system, in which private insurance solutions would  replace the principle of lost income in today's social insurance  system. At the same time tax cuts are high on the Conservatives'  list of measures.    Liberal Party leader and Social Minister Bengt Westerberg  has  clearly indicated, to the Conservatives, that the Liberal Party  will not agree to any tax cuts that force reductions in the  welfare system.  <H5>  Powerful Motives </H5>   Despite these basic ideological differences between the two  parties, Peter Orn sees no hesitation in governing with the  Conservatives.    "It is possible to govern together. We still have several  important points in common," says Peter Orn.    What is common is getting the economy straightened out. That  was also the principal reason for the parties joining together  in the previous election campaign on the program "New Start for  Sweden."    "There are strong motives for this government continuing for  at least one more mandate period. The economic reorganization is  far from complete. The Social Democrats have not shown that they  have an economically good program," says Peter Orn.    That is why he does not believe that the Social Democrats  will succeed in coping with unemployment, one of the most  important issues during the next election period, since their  economic policy does not hold up.    In Peter Orn's opinion the Social Democrats also fall short  in their view of the welfare state when they want to scrap the  family doctor system and eliminate the school allowance. But on  the EU [European Union] issue as well the Social Democrats are  much too vague, and membership in the union is of major  importance to the Liberal Party.    Peter Orn can see that the neoliberal proponents within the  Conservatives have hurt the Liberal Party to some extent.    "Sometimes that debate can give a picture of the Liberal  Party being a defender of status quo. It is important to show  that we want both to keep the welfare standard, which we  participated in establishing, and at the same time renew it  through reform of the major freedoms of choice for schools,  child care, health care, and media."    Altogether, the conclusion for Peter Orn is that the  invitations from the Social Democrats for cooperation or shared  government are categorically rejected.    "This government will be a majority government," says Peter  Orn.  <H5>  Social Democrats Most Unhappy </H5>   What will happen if the election result shows that it is not  possible to get a majority government is another story:    "Then one must be prepared to create a government across the  bloc boundaries. But what that will look like, whether we will  participate in it, that we have not taken a position on at all."    It is not all that easy to implement one's dearest issues  even in a government position. At the moment the family doctor  system is threatened by the fact that New Democracy intends to  vote against the proposal together with the Social Democrats.  Then, as far as Peter Orn is concerned, it will have to become  an election issue again, and he is not worried about that debate.    "We will take that fight if it becomes necessary. Most  unhappy about that will be the Social Democrats. They realize  that when a system is in the middle of changing, it backfires on  the one who wants to tear it up."  <H5>  Important Reform </H5>   The dissatisfaction, or disinterest, which has shown up in  opinion polls and in the debate by the Swedish people and the  physicians against the family doctor system is something that  Peter Orn takes with equanimity -- opposition is always present  during changes.    "This reform is important because it establishes the basic  principle that the patient should have the right to choose the  doctor he wants. The day that is accomplished the family  physician is anchored in the hearts of the Swedish people."    Equality between men and women is another urgent question,  on  which Peter Orn himself has vigorously worked for the  introduction of a paternal month.    He hopes, as liberal as he is, that the necessity of a  month's paternal leave will get the employer to change his  attitudes toward the men who want to remain at home with their  children.    The next major equality issue will be work for equal pay by  men and women.    Another Liberal Party profile issue is a generous refugee  policy. During this mandate period, however, concern about the  former East Europe has increased pressure on the borders, and  Immigration Minister Birgit Friggebo has tightened the refugee  policy by introducing, among other things, the need for visas  for Bosnians.    "The refugee issue has been very difficult," admits Peter  Orn, but he believes that the party has nevertheless been able  to stick to the humanity principle.  <H5>  Own Identity </H5>   Criticism of the refugee policy within the party has been  harsh but good, according to Peter Orn. The result was that once  again the humanitarian reasons for refugees being able to stay  weigh more heavily.  <H5>  Stricter Application </H5>   He also states that application in asylum matters, in view  of  the large stream of refugees, has become stricter. One way of  preventing the Alien Commission from being tougher is, according  to Peter Orn, that the government once again can take over cases  for decision that can then become guidelines.    Just before ending the interview, Peter Orn examines the  diagram that shows that the Liberal Party has a major base of  voters who could envision voting for them (but when it comes  down to it do not). He states that this problem is nothing new.    "Possibly it is so that this center position that a liberal  party occupies can be mistaken from both the right and the left.  The great challenge for us is to show that we have an identity  of our own and that it is based on our liberal values. We do not  reflect them with respect to other parties."</p>

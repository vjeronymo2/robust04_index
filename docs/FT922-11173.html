			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: SBC fails to match previous year SWISS Bank Corporation said its after tax operating income 'did not quite match 1991's excellent first quarter performance'. No figures were revealed, but the bank, Switzerland's second largest, said income from trading was 3.9 per cent lower and net interest earnings were below last year's levels. On the other hand, it claimed, commission income was up a substantial 16.4 per cent and income from the derivatives business also grew. The bank's total assets grew by SFr4bn (Dollars 2.6bn) since the beginning of the year to SFr172.7bn, primarily as a result of currency movements. The shift towards customer lending continued with interbank lending down 3.4 per cent and customer lending up 4 per cent to SFr109.7bn. Interbank deposits dropped by 5.1 per cent, or SFr2bn, while customer deposits, mainly in demand and time deposits, rose 6.3 per cent. Union Bank of Switzerland, Switzerland's largest, said its net profit in the first quarter was higher than in the same period last year, with all businesses except capital markets contributing. Also, the contribution from foreign branches and subsidiaries to the consolidated result was slightly weaker. Bank Leu said this year's first quarter profits were satisfactory but did not give figures. It said earnings from foreign exchange and precious metals trading rose substantially, while interest earnings and commission income increased slightly. The bank, part of the CS Holding group, was unable to repeat the very good result achieved in securities business in the first quarter of 1991.</p>

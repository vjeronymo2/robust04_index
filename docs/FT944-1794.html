			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Tory party hit by sharp drop in business donations The Conservative party faces sharply mounting difficulties raising funds from its traditional supporters in British business. A Financial Times investigation shows a steep fall in donations from Britain's biggest companies and a poor performance by the secretive fund-raising network set up among business leaders. A survey of Britain's largest 100 companies shows that donations to the Tories fell 34.3 per cent in real terms last year compared with 1988, an equivalent year in the election cycle. The FT has also found that the fund-raising network of business executives is likely to fall well short of its financial targets this year. The party already has a Pounds 15m overdraft and is expected to face a struggle to break even in the financial year ending in March. Up to half the donations made by companies and individuals to the party are channelled through a network of 10 regional councils, each one comprising up to 12 Tory-supporting business leaders. In the past the network has provided up to Pounds 4m a year but reports from the councils suggest some may raise no more than half their targets. Lord Laing, former chairman of food company United Biscuits and former joint treasurer of the Conservatives, said the councils accounted for 30 per cent to 50 per cent of total donations. Of the 10 councils, the most important is the London-based City and Industrial Liaison Council, which has accounted for donations of up to Pounds 1.5m a year. Midlands Industrial Council, based in Birmingham and covering the west Midlands, is believed to have a target this year of about Pounds 800,000. It is thought unlikely to raise more than half this amount. As one council chairman commented: 'This year is bloody hellish. Everybody hates me (when I ask for money).'

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Fund managers take stock of weighty issues: The availability of investment cash for the equity market Every time the equity market hits new highs company finance directors rub their hands in glee. The higher the market, the more they can raise through rights issues or flotations. Last week BICC, the UK cables and construction group, took advantage of the rise in its share price since the election to launch a Pounds 154m rights issue, taking the total value of rights issues so far this year to more than Pounds 1bn. It is not only quoted businesses that are looking to take money from the stock market. There is a lengthening list of private companies planning to sell their shares. And the government is not missing out either. Its privatisation programme may be going through a quieter patch, but the exchequer's coffers still need filling and gilt sales will be higher than for many years. All these calls on the market could begin to put a strain on investors' cash. The fear is that if their available cash is all absorbed by capital raising issues, there will not be sufficient money invested in existing shares to keep the market rising. The 'weight of money' argument is an old favourite in the stock market, often used to support forecasts of rises or falls in the market when commentators have run out of other reasons. The argument depends on weighing up the supply of cash available to invest against the demands on that cash. If supply exceeds demand, the theory goes, the market will rise. However, accurate figures for both sides are hard to forecast, with official statistics for last year subject to revision. Mr Mark Brown, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker, has estimated the notion-al excess demand for equities in real terms since 1978. His chart suggests there is an increasing level of excess cash to invest which he says is a favourable influence on the equity market. On one side of the scales is the money coming into the market as institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance groups, receive cash to invest. Although pension funds' cash inflows have been depressed by contributions, holidays and redundancies, the picture is brighter among insurance companies, for instance as people set up personal pension schemes. Between them institutional investment reached Pounds 38.3bn in 1991. Estimates are for a similar level this year. There are other sources of funds. Private investors may also increase their holdings of UK equities, either directly or through unit trusts. And there is the hope that takeover activity will increase with cash bids allowing recipients to reinvest the proceeds in the market. However, the current uncertainty on this side of the balance relates to overseas investors. It is hard to forecast how much money is flowing into the UK stock market from abroad, but the consensus is that since the general election, flows have been significant. County NatWest, the securities house, estimates foreign purchases of gilts alone total Pounds 4bn since the election. Large international securities houses have been advocating clients switching their investments into the UK. The day after the election, for example, Morgan Stanley advised its clients to increase the proportion of assets invested in the UK by 5.5 percentage points to 14 per cent, moving from an underweight to overweight stance as the UK accounts for 11 per cent of the value of European equities. Weighing down the other side of the balance, the biggest call on the market will be gilt sales. The public sector borrowing requirement, which was Pounds 13.9bn in 1991-92, is forecast to more than double in the current year. Following the election, the Bank of England moved fast to sell new gilts, and there are a lot more to come. Last year net gilt sales were nearly Pounds 11bn; this year they are expected to near Pounds 30bn. The increase in gilt sales will more than offset a decline in money raised in privatisations. Even these will not dwindle completely as there are many calls due from earlier partly-paid privatisations such as the electricity companies and the BT sale. Rights issues took more than Pounds 10bn from the stock market last year but may raise less this year as much work has already been done on restructuring balance sheets. Companies have been attracted to the corporate bond market too, as yields have fallen, although many of these securities are bought by international investors. New issue activity will jump however. Names such as MFI, GPA, 3i, The Daily Telegraph group will be joining the stock market. There is also the unusual sale of shares by Wellcome Trust in Wellcome, the pharmaceutical group, which may involve a Pounds 4bn issue. But with overseas demand expected to be high and the trust aiming to reinvest the proceeds in the stock market, this could add cash to the UK market rather than take it away. There is to some extent a self-correcting aspect to the mechanism. If there are too many rights, the market will sag, so discouraging other companies from making issues. A sudden fall in the market would put off flotations. And as Mr Brown admits, the equity market did well last year, in spite of a high level of rights issues. By contrast, it did badly in 1990 when there was in theory much spare cash. Institutions allowed their cash holdings to increase in 1990 and then ran them down again in 1991. However, this year most stock market strategists expect a Pounds 10bn or Pounds 15bn shortfall in available cash compared with the likely level of bond and equity issues, if purchases by overseas investors are excluded. At present it seems that foreign investors can more than plug the gap, meaning that the equity market could go higher. But foreign investors can be fickle and on their own they do not provide a sound basis for a bull market.</p>

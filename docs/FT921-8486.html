			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Rocket men think it's going to be a long, long time: A look at the delays to the Asraam missile project THE TRIALS of British Aerospace in an era of tight and declining defence spending are not yet over. After a fresh wave of cuts in its military activities this month - costing 1,900 jobs - the UK's largest defence contractor is awaiting the denouement of one of the country's longest and most troubled arms procurement sagas. At stake are not only hundreds more jobs but also the outlook for BAe's independent existence in the missile business, which it has dominated in the UK until now. The Ministry of Defence is to decide soon whether it wants to go ahead with BAe's Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (Asraam) or buy an alternative close-combat weapon for the RAF. The final verdict on the contract, expected to be worth about Pounds 700m, will probably be made at cabinet level, as BAe's future in guided weapons largely rests on the decision. After more than a decade of work on Asraam the MoD has indicated it wants to move quickly to a decision. For BAe, it represents the only new missile development programme in prospect, and the chance to open up a multi-billion-pound market. Failure could cost up to 1,000 engineering and production jobs at its Dynamics division - which has already shed 10,000 jobs since 1989. It has announced a further 450 redundancies this month, leaving a workforce of 6,000. The group's strategy was scuppered last year when it failed to agree with Thomson-CSF of France on terms for merging their guided-weapons businesses to form a dominant European manufacturer. GEC-Marconi, the company that has made the guidance systems for BAe weapons, is meanwhile setting itself up as a maker of complete missiles through the planned takeover of Ferranti International's activities in the sector. In conjunction with Matra of France, it is leading the competition to BAe for the new close-combat missile. Not even BAe could claim that the Asraam project has gone smoothly. Veteran air force chiefs and MoD civil servants wince at the mention of it. It began with a transatlantic memorandum of understanding in 1980, covering two types of missile. The US would develop a medium-range missile - known as Amraam - to replace the Sparrow weapon. The plan was for this missile to be produced under licence in Europe, under BAe's leadership. That idea has since been forgotten. Europe was to take charge of developing a replacement to the short-range Sidewinder, which has dominated the market for more than 30 years. With Germany in the lead, a joint venture was set up between BAe and the specialist German company Bodensee-werk Geratetechnik (BGT). Norway and Canada joined the Asraam project, and over the years the four defence ministries put about Pounds 100m into it. The venture was not a success, however. In 1988, when the programme should have been going into full-scale development, the UK took over the lead role, with BAe as prime contractor. A year later the German government pulled out, leaving a 40 per cent gap in funding. Norway and Canada also withdrew. BAe, needing a partner to provide the infrared seeker for the missile, turned to Hughes Aircraft of the US, lead company in the Amraam sister-programme. In September 1990 BAe was poised to be told to go ahead when the MoD decided to open the programme to competition. That led to further delay. In the meantime, attempts to hold the US Defense Department to the original agreement under which it would be committed to buying the European-development short-range missile were becoming futile. The MoD 'invitation to tender', a 7lb document, was issued last April. Bids were submitted in August, and 'best and final' offers presented by January 30. Ranged against the original Asraam are a proposal by GEC-Marconi and Matra, based on the French Mica missile, and an upgraded version of the Sidewinder, proposed by none other than BAe's former partner, BGT. The US manufacturer Raytheon was reported to want to enter its own improved Sidewinder, but did not submit a bid. Both BAe and GEC-Marconi argue that even an updated Sidewinder would fall short of the requirements for the RAF's European Fighter Aircraft, due to come into service in the late 1990s. But a cheap new version of the US missile would be a strong competitor in export markets. BAe is worried not only about its competitors but also about possible further delay. Its funding from the MoD dried up two years ago. It says it desperately needs a firm UK contract in order to start marketing Asraam in the US. BAe estimates a potential worldwide market of more than 30,000 missiles, worth at least Pounds 5bn, out of total estimated requirement for Sidewinder replacements of 85,000 units. The initial contract, however, is likely to be much smaller than was once anticipated. When there were four partner countries in Asraam their requirements were put at 10,000 missiles. It is understood that the quantities for which companies were asked to bid were scaled down from between 2,000 and 4,500 missiles to a range of 1,000 to 3,500. BAe says that even 1,000 missiles are a worthwhile proposition. Both BAe and GEC-Marconi say their missiles would be mostly British-made - 80 per cent for BAe's Asraam, in spite of having a Hughes Aircraft seeker system and a warhead from Germany's Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, and 70 per cent in the case of the Franco-British proposal. Several other British companies have a lot at stake on Asraam - notably Thorn EMI, maker of the missile's infrared proximity fuze. 'This is the only guided weapon we see coming in the next five years,' said Thorn. It has a 'unique UK capability' in fuze technology, and will have to make redundancies if it loses the Asraam programme. 'If in 10 years the MoD came back and wanted another guided weapon fuze, we would not be able to do it.'</p>

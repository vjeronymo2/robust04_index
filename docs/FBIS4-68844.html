			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KOMMERSANT correspondents Sergey Topol, Dmitriy </F> Pavlov, and Igor Fedorov under the rubric "Terrorist Acts in  Moscow": "Criminals Blow Up Armenian Family's Apartment"]    [Text] Two powerful explosions went off in Moscow  last Saturday. The bombs had been placed in residential  buildings on Leo Tolstoy and Zelenodolskaya Streets. As a result  one person is dead, and six are seriously wounded. The  terrorists were not apprehended right away. KOMMERSANT  correspondents Sergey Topol, Dmitriy Pavlov, and Igor Fedorov  visited the sites of the incidents.    At 0800 on 16 April residents of the apartment house on 7  Lev  Tolstoy Street (formerly the property of the USSR Council of  Ministers) were awakened by a powerful explosion that went off  on the second floor stair landing of entrance No. 3. The shock  wave knocked out the doors of several apartments, shattered  windows from the first to the fifth floor, and damaged the  elevator. According to militia personnel who arrived at the  incident site, the explosion tore off the arm of Valeriy  Chernikov who happened to be near apartment No. 118. In  addition, Maria Chetvertkova, the building's grounds keeper who  was cleaning the stairs, ended up with a head bruise. Chernikov  and Chetvertkova were taken to a hospital. Also injured was the  apartment owner's dog--boxer Gretta's fur was singed on its back  and sides.    As KOMMERSANT correspondents were able to establish, the  explosion took place under the following circumstances. The  occupants of the apartment were Irina Ulyanova, a housewife, and  Sergey Ostroukhov, director of Cafe Cherkizovo. Early in the  morning they had a visitor--their friend Valeriy Chernikov. He  noticed a suspicious plastic parcel next to the apartment (half  a year ago, in November, an F-1 grenade was tied up to the door  handle of the same apartment, but on that occasion the explosion  was averted). Chernikov attempted to carry the package out to  the street, but the bomb inside the package went off. Chernikov  lost his left hand. On the same day the militia searched Cafe  Cherkizovo, which is currently under repair. They were looking  for explosive devices, but did not find any.    In an interview with KOMMERSANT correspondents, militia  personnel said that the package contained a homemade explosive  device. According to them, so far there is no clear hypothesis  as to the motive for the terrorist act (in the November  incident, both the apartment owners and the militia assumed that  the grenade had been tied to the apartment door out of  "hooliganism"). A criminal case was opened on the subject of the  explosion, which was transferred to the procuracy for  investigation.    At 2320 the same day a powerful (500 g of TNT) explosive  device, secured to a first floor window bar, went off at  building No. 2, 9 Zelenodolskaya Street. The impact of the  explosion was such that it made a hole more than a meter in  diameter in the building's bearing wall. In addition, partitions  between rooms were destroyed, the apartment's entrance door  knocked out, and windows broken from the first through sixth  floors. The shock wave lifted a Moskvich car standing about 20 m  from the point of the explosion and threw it onto a Zhiguli car  standing nearby. The victims of the explosion were an Armenian  family that had lived in this apartment for about three years.  The head of the household, Eduard Kuzikyan, died on the spot;  his mother, wife, brother, and four-year-old son were seriously  wounded. The victims' neighbors told a KOMMERSANT correspondent  that they pulled Mr. Kuzikyan from under the rubble and tried to  resuscitate him, but to no avail. Militia personnel refrained  from commentary, citing confidentiality of investigation.    [begin box]  <H5>  KOMMERSANT Experts' Advice on Personal Safety </H5>   The actions of a person who discovers an unidentified object  depend first and foremost on whether he has reason to believe  that this object may contain an explosive device.    1. If you do not have reason, but are not certain that the  object is harmless, you can attempt to evacuate the object you  have discovered from the zone of potential danger to others.  Select for this purpose a nearby place not frequented by people.  Lift the object very carefully and do not press against any part  of it under any circumstances. If it is a briefcase, carryall,  or suitcase, never lift it by the handle--it may be connected to  a detonator.    2. If you have reason to believe that you have discovered a  bomb, it is best not to touch it altogether. Homemade explosive  devices (HED), which are the kind most often used by criminals,  are the most dangerous of all types of explosive devices. Even  professional explosives experts are advised to destroy them on  the spot.    3. A person who discovers a bomb should take immediate steps  to ensure the safety of others. If a bomb has been found in a  building stairway, you need to warn the tenants to either leave  their apartments or stay in them under the cover of bearing  walls. Remember that the entrance door is poor protection  against flying fragments and the shock wave. It is preferable to  open the windows in the apartments and on the staircase--the  shock wave (in the event of an explosion) will escape to the  open space without doing too much damage.    4. If you are approaching an apartment and see a burning  cord  leading to a suspicious object, try to avert an explosion. In  order to do this, hold the object in place (but do not put  strong pressure on it, and with the other hand jerk the cord out  and throw it away. Find cover immediately. Wait for at least 15  minutes, then leave the cover and do not forget to report the  incident to the militia (make sure that your report is  registered). [end box]</p>

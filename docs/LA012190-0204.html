			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RILEYS WIN AIDS HUMANITARIAN AWARD;  </P> <P> HONORS: SUPERVISOR AND WIFE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE AND VISIBLE IN CAMPAIGNS TO RAISE  MONEY FOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION.  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and his wife, Emma Jane, received the Orange County  Humanitarian Award on Saturday night for their support of AIDS research.  </P> <P> "We're happy to see AIDS talked about and for something to be done," Emma Jane  Riley said, just before the couple accepted the award at a dinner and reception  at the Disneyland Hotel.  </P> <P> About 400 people attended the dinner, sponsored by AIDS Walk Orange County.  Proceeds are to be used for research and education about acquired immune  deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> The Rileys were chosen for the first-time award by a committee made up of the  AIDS Walk board of directors and community representatives.  </P> <P> "They just emerged as the leaders," said Elizabeth Dorn Parker, co-executive  director of AIDS Walk. "They work as a team.  </P> <P> "We wanted recipients who lived, worked and did their community work in Orange  County."  </P> <P> Riley said he first became aware of the gravity of AIDS when he saw a baby  stricken with the disease.  </P> <P> "I knew we had something very insidious here that isn't limited to a particular  kind of person," he said.  </P> <P> Riley was one of just two supervisors to support a measure that would have  barred discrimination against AIDS victims.  </P> <P> Riley said his support of AIDS causes "has raised a few eyebrows" but said some  people do not understand what he is trying to accomplish. After he voted for  the anti-discrimination law -- which lost, 3 to 2, in June -- Riley said that  because Orange County is conservative, "it's a little more difficult perhaps to  (vote with) a more open . . . sense of responsibility."  </P> <P> The Rileys have supported AIDS Walk Orange County, which raises money and  awareness of AIDS, since the walk's inception three years ago.  </P> <P> Emma Jane Riley said she hopes that the event will raise attention about the  need for an AIDS cure.  </P> <P> In its three-year history, AIDS Walk has raised about $500,000.  </P> <P> Cathy Winthrop, assistant director of AIDS Walk, said raising money for AIDS in  a county with such a strong conservative bent has sometimes proven difficult.  </P> <P> "It was a little hard the first year. Things got better after that, but the  need is greater" because growing numbers of people are being afflicted by AIDS,  she said.  </P> <P> About 1,000 cases of AIDS have been reported in Orange County, according to  Winthrop.  </P></p>

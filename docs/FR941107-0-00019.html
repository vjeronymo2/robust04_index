			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Standards provide a method for sizing whole pitted fruit on the basis of illustrations and approximate diameter ranges (&sect;52.3754, Table I). For example, olives that are ``Jumbo'' in size are those that are approximately 22 to 24 millimeters in diameter and conform closely with the applicable illustration in Table I. The committee believes that this sizing method may be more appropriate for whole pitted olives, which now account for a substantial majority of the California olives packaged in the whole form. Thus, this rule authorizes the sizing of whole pitted olives after pitting in accordance with the illustrations and approximate diameter ranges provided in the Standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Standards also provide allowances for size variances for whole pitted olives in &sect;52.3756. The requirements of U.S. Grade C (the minimum allowed under the order), provide that of the 60 percent, by count, of the olives that are most uniform in size, the diameter of the largest olive cannot exceed the diameter of the smallest olive by more than 4 millimeters. These variances will be applied to whole pitted olives when handlers choose to have their pitted olives sized by diameter, after pitting. The committee believes that these guidelines for sizing whole pitted olives are sufficient and that no additional specifications relating to size are needed at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide for this change in whole pitted olive sizing requirements, paragraph (f) of &sect;932.152 is revised to add authority for sizing by diameter as provided in the Standards. In addition, paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;932.152 is revised by deleting the sentence which requires sizing prior to pitting. Also, paragraph (b)(2) is revised to reflect the elimination of the in-line inspection and sizing prior to pitting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule changes the interim final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  July 27, 1994 [59 FR 38104]. That rule modified Table II in &sect;932.152, paragraph (g)(1), to conform to rule changes made in 1991. However, further changes were made to Table II in an interim final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 13, 1994 [59 FR 46907]. This final rule therefore conforms with the changes in the most recent interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 8e of the Act, olives imported into the United States are subject to comparable size requirements as established for domestically grown olives under the order. Those requirements are found in Olive Regulation 1 [7 CFR 944.401].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the import regulation, canned pitted ripe olives are subject to minimum size requirements in terms of a minimum diameter and a specific tolerance for undersized fruit. The undersize tolerances set forth in the import regulation are based upon those established for canned whole olives under the California olive marketing order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

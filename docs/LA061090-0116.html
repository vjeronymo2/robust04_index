			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY THERE WON'T BE A TOP 43 LIST;  </P> <P> DESPITE THE URGINGS OF THEIR DEFENDERS, THERE WERE REASONS THESE THREE DIDN'T  MAKE THE FINAL CUT. AND SURPRISE, THEY ARE STILL VALID  </P> <P> It was while I was operating on their canary, one writer began, that I  discovered my best clients were also the owners of my favorite restaurant.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, this letter writer had a hard time understanding that the  canary's parents were not the owners of my favorite restaurant. She was shocked  and disappointed.  </P> <P> The veterinarian's letter was just one of a flood that came pouring in after  the publication of my Top 40 Restaurants (Los Angeles Times Magazine, May 6).  "Do you actually eat in the restaurants that you review?" one writer wanted to  know. Another spoke of my "poor little Gucci-clad tootsies" tootling around  town in a Rolls-Royce that is reluctant to stray far from Westside roads. There  was a flurry of similarly worded cards about San Pedro's Papadakis Taverna  saying that it was not one of the best restaurants in the area, but one of the  best restaurants in the world. We heard from neighbors. We heard from  celebrities. We heard from the restaurants themselves.  </P> <P> But what we heard most, in the final analysis, was about three particular  restaurants. In fact, all of the following restaurants had so many defenders  that despite the fact that I have eaten in each several times, I decided to go  back and try them again. I was completely prepared to eat my words.  </P> <P> L'Orangerie is, without any doubt, one of the most attractive restaurants in  L.A.  </P> <P> Tonight it seems especially lovely; we have arrived early and sit for a long  time watching the light fade from the windows and the room grow golden with the  light of candles. Dinah Shore is at one table with a group of people who seem  to be having a taste-off of Jack Daniels and Wild Turkey. There's a gorgeous  starlet at another. Virtually everybody in the room looks beautiful. It is hard  not to be happy to be here.  </P> <P> Provided, that is, that you are not paying the bill. For these prices are hard  to swallow. Take this salad. It is a wonderful salad dressed in a delightful  vinaigrette sprinkled with big chunks of Roquefort cheese and what the menu  calls croustillants de pommes de terre (these turn out to be the world's  fanciest potato chips). It's a swell salad. An extremely swell salad. But I  have yet to meet the salad that is worth $17 to me.  </P> <P> Price isn't the only problem. Take these eggs with caviar. It is one of the  most beautiful dishes I know -- two egg shells filled with soft, creamy,  perfectly scrambled eggs and topped with so much black caviar that you feel you  are getting your money's worth, even at $26. But whoever spooned this king's  ransom of caviar onto the eggs has left his mark: distinct black fingerprints  decorate the shells. It is -- at the very least -- disconcerting.  </P> <P> The problem with the white asparagus soup is different again. It's a pale and  lovely soup, and the waiter did not lie when he said that it was made without  cream. Unfortunately, it was also made without flavor. Blindfolded, I could not  tell you what kind of soup it was.  </P> <P> The entrees are good. But they are not great. I love the conceit of the lotte  with lobster sauce. This fish is often called "poor man's lobster" because its  texture is somewhat akin to lobster tail. And the sauce on this fish is a  wonder; it is amazingly intense, so that the flavor of the lobster comes  shining through. But the lotte itself has been so thinly sliced that the  texture is nothing like lobster. It's too bad; the whole point of the dish has  been lost. The noodles with which it is served don't help; they sit miserably  on the plate in a stuck-together clump.  </P> <P> This grilled turbot, on the other hand, is a fabulous piece of fish. It comes  with three delightful little ovals of potato puree and some rather wonderful  caramelized leeks. Even at $36, I don't feel I'm being overcharged.  </P> <P> But it is the only dish of the day that seems worth the money. The white peach  tart is a nice tart -- but the peaches have no flavor. The sorbets are not as  flavorful as they might be. And as I plunk down more than $100 per person for  this meal, I can't help thinking how glad I am that it is not my money.  </P> <P>  L'Orangerie, 903 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood. (213) 652-9770.  </P> <P> "If you don't want this table," says the maitre d' with a gesture, "you can sit  in the gazebo. It's even nicer." He points off into the interior of La Serre. I  am instantly suspicious. Why are they being so good to us? Have I been spotted?  </P> <P> I certainly hope not. Because if the restaurant is out to impress, it ought to  come up with something better than this mealy bit of bread. We are not off to a  good start.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, things don't get better. The service is sweet, helpful and  professional. The room is lovely. But the food is just not up to snuff.  Consider this warm foie gras. A few skimpy slices are served in a blueberry  sauce so full of vinegar that the strong smell of hot acid comes wafting  unattractively across the table.  </P> <P> In fact, I can't say that anything we're eating is much of a hit. Soupe au  pistou is just an unimpressive puree of vegetables. The croutons in the salad  are sad. And when the very sweet waiter removes the dishes from the first  courses, it is only to replace them with plates of complimentary sorbets.  Served on rose petals, these are lovely to look at. Too bad they taste so much  like iced perfume.  </P> <P> The main courses are not an improvement. Duck with mangoes is overcooked.  Grilled rouget comes in a clumsy wine sauce. There is too much garlic in the  potatoes, and the asparagus has been cooked until it starts to turn brown.  </P> <P> Without any doubt, the best thing we eat all night is a hot apple tart served  with whipped cream melting across the top. La Serre may be a nice place. It may  have a lot of fans. But the prices are high, and I certainly wouldn't call it  one of the 40 best restaurants in Southern California.  </P> <P>  La Serre, 12969 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 990-0500.  </P> <P> "We come here every year on Valentine's Day," announce my friends as we meet at  Le Chardonnay. Walking in the door, their faces shine; they link hands, they  each take a deep breath.  </P> <P> It is a breathtaking restaurant -- a room so charming that your heart lifts as  you sink into your seat. A faithful replica of a turn-of-the-century Parisian  bistro, Le Chardonnay manages a sort of restaurant magic that makes you feel as  if you have walked right out of time.  </P> <P> This is such a magical room that you don't notice when the noise goes up and  you start shouting. It is, in reality, one of those loud Los Angeles  restaurants everybody is always complaining about, but it is visually so quiet,  the service so pleasantly solicitous, that you hardly bother to notice.  </P> <P> People go out to eat for lots of reasons. They may love the way a restaurant  looks, or the way it makes them feel. It may be the restaurant where they fell  in love, or it may be the one where they always get a good table. Food is often  completely incidental to the restaurant experience. But not to me.  </P> <P> I always want the food to be wonderful. The more beautiful the room I'm eating  in, the higher my expectations. This can be hard on my friends. While they are  eating up the atmosphere, I am complaining about the food.  </P> <P> Right now, for instance, I can't help noticing that the Louisiana crab cakes  one friend is eating, have all the appeal of soggy bread crumbs. The texture of  the cakes is mushy, and the mustard sauce in which they sit so overwhelming  that any crab flavor that might have been present is totally masked. He seems  blissfully unaware of all this. "Aren't these wonderful?" he asks happily.  </P> <P> His wife is eating cold tomato soup filled with lots of basil and little balls  of melon. She thinks it's wonderful; I think it has a sort of silly "be  creative with your food" sort of quality. I try not to say so.  </P> <P> But my grumpiness must be catching. Although I try to be nice about the three  tiny soft-shell crabs on my plate, they have been crisped beyond redemption.  All at once my friends start looking at their own plates in dismay. "This  Chinese duck," says Ken very distinctly, "is dry."  </P> <P> "So is this grilled breast of chicken," says Patty. I point out that the  vegetables -- especially a buttery little bundle of whole leaf spinach -- are  very nice. My friends are no longer so easy to impress. By dessert time, Patty  is looking at her profiterolles with suspicion and Ken is expressing outrage  over the price of a dish of unripe berries.  </P> <P> "Maybe we'll go someplace else next year for Valentine's Day," he says as we  exit.  </P> <P>  Le Chardonnay, 8284 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, (213) 655-8880.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Family Assurance status move FAMILY ASSURANCE has become the first friendly society to apply to become a corporate body under new legislation allowing societies to extend their range of financial services. Friendly societies grew out of the co-operative movement, providing protection for workers against sickness and unemployment. Investment by individuals in societies' tax-free savings schemes is limited to Pounds 200 a year. Under the Friendly Societies Act 1992, designed to allow them to compete more effectively with other providers of financial services, societies can incorporate and offer their members and the public a variety of financial services, including unit trusts and personal equity plans, insurance broking and fund management services for pension funds. Family Assurance, which has Pounds 600m funds under management, has secured the approval of its members to become a corporate body and expects to incorporate on July 1. It said yesterday it is to acquire Family Equity Plan, a company limited by guarantee which manages a unit trust, to market Peps to its 530,000 members and the public. Liverpool Victoria, the largest friendly society with Pounds 2.7bn under management, said it intended to incorporate after choosing the most suitable products to market. It said: 'There is a danger that you could leap in and then find you are in the wrong place.' Mr Peter Gray, chief executive of Tunbridge Wells Equitable friendly society, said the society would be putting the question of incorporation to its members at its annual meeting in October.</p>

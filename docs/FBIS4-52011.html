			<p>BFN     [Text] Four local financial institutions have signed a 110  billion won (about $137.5 million) syndicated loan contract with  a petrochemical arm of Hyundai Business Group. If extended, it  will be the first large loan made to a subsidiary of the group  since the inauguration of the current government, which has had  strained relations with the group.    The syndicated loan will be extended to Hyundai  Petrochemical  Co. by Boram Bank, Korea Long-Term Credit Bank, Kwangju Bank and  KKBC International, Ltd., financial sources said yesterday. The  four institutions together will extend the company the loan  composed of 87.6 billion won in Korean won and the remaining sum  in U.S. dollars.    The Korean currency portion of the syndicated loan will  carry  an annual interest rate of 12.4 percent and be paid back in  installments over four years after a three-year grace period.    Hyundai Petrochemical Co. will pay back the U.S. dollar  fraction carrying an annual interest of 4.7 percent over five  and a half years after two and a half years of deferment of  interest and principal payments, the sources said. The company  reportedly plans to use the money in importing capital goods and  setting up a synthetic rubber plant in a petrochemical complex  on the western coastal area of Taesan, South Chungchong Province.    The financial sources pointed out that despite the signing  of  the contract, it remains to be seen whether Hyundai will  actually borrow money from the institutions. Initially, the  group contacted the state-owned Korea Development Bank [KDB] for  an investment loan for expanding the petrochemical company but  was rejected.    Speculation was rampant that the government had ordered KDB  to turn down Hyundai's request for political reasons. Hyundai  allegedly failed to get the loan because Chong Chu-yong, founder  and honorary chairman of Hyundai Group, angered President Kim  Yong-sam during the 1992 presidential election campaign by  vilifying him.    Meanwhile, Chong announced in a news conference Tuesday that  he would not interfere in the management of Hyundai Group and  will devote himself to managing his mammoth farm on reclaimed  land in Sosan, South Chungchong Province.    The presidential office of Chongwadae was reportedly  dissatisfied with Chong's announcement and the financial sources  presumed it is still unclear whether Hyundai will get the loan.  The four financial institutions, however, said that they had  signed the loan contract independent of the political circle.  The loan contract, the sources said, provides ample grist for  the rumor mill that local banks and nonbank financial  institutions have lifted their restrictions on loans to the  conglomerate.</p>

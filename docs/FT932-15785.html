			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Subsidies provide fertile ground for budget savings - Agriculture THE 1994 US agriculture budget reduces programmes by 5.8 per cent below last year's level but still leaves Dollars 63bn (Pounds 41.7bn) with which to manage the nation's food supply. Farm subsidies, Dollars 17bn in this year's budget, are supposed to shrink to Dollars 12bn in 1994 if the weather, the Russians and the competition co-operate. The Agriculture Department plans to limit payments to farmers who earn less than Dollars 100,000 in off-farm income; this is expected to save Dollars 75m this year and Dollars 470m in 1994-97. This assumes that farmers - who have a record of creativity in avoiding payment limits - play along. The administration also proposes to save Dollars 12m this year by cutting honey subsidies and Dollars 10m by limiting wool and mohair incentives. Another Dollars 52.3m will be deleted from the 1994 market promotion programme, which provides assistance to trade organisations and private companies in overseas promotional activities. After 1995 the administration expects even larger savings by expanding from 15 to 25 per cent the acreage which will be ineligible for subsidies. While increasing payments for food stamps and other programmes for the poor, the Agriculture Department expects to save further through agency consolidations, charging user fees, reforming the crop insurance programme, and reducing the statistical output of the Economic Research Service.</p>

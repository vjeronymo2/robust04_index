			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Modestov under the rubric "Special </F> Services": "CIA Director Presents Report to U.S. Senate  Containing Undisclosed Secret Chapters: U.S. Intelligence  Community Attentively Watching Russia and Other CIS Countries"]    [Text] Several unpleasant surprises sprung on us by fate  not only during the period of the September-October crisis but  also at the time of the December denouement, and the subsequent  finger- pointing, prompted the Russian Federation president to  comment quite disapprovingly on the quality of the  information-analytical work of his immediate entourage.    Judging by all signs, he was not alone in his desire to be  well informed on events in Russia. But while he does not have  any particular choice and will have to turn to the same--or  similar, in terms of professional level and motivation--experts,  his foreign colleagues do not have to step on the banana peel  twice and again trust what they hear from Moscow.    In the beginning the West, particularly the American  leadership, cherished more than enough romantic hopes. For  instance, Senator D. Moynihan (D) from New York state proposed  in 1991 to abolish the Central Intelligence Agency and transfer  its functions to the State Department. Although this quite  radical proposal was not accepted, intelligence organs could not  fail to sense that establishing new relations with their former  main enemy does not improve their prospects for the future.    Very soon, however, the tentative "thaw" in the area of  intelligence lost its urgency. It turned out that one cannot  rely on the quality of information of the Russian side, even  though it may be willing to share with the former opponents its  appraisal of the situation in Russia and other republics of the  former Union.    In this connection the U.S. President set CIA Director James  Woolsey the task of boosting intelligence and  information-gathering on Russia and the states of the former  USSR. The result was a classified intelligence report analyzing  the situation in critical points of the planet and an evaluation  of the threat to U.S. interests emanating from there. A  sanitized version of this report was presented on 25 January  1994 at hearings in the Senate Intelligence Committee. As James  Woolsey put it, the complete and original text of the report may  only be presented to senators at a closed hearing.    Judging by all signs, it may contain: (a) characterization  of  the political and physical state of "first persons" of the main  countries under intelligence evaluation, including the Russian  Federation; (b) confidential estimates of the intentions and  plans of these countries' leaderships; (c) information on plans  for conducting intelligence activities, including mention of  most sensitive active measures; (d) commentary on so-called  "black programs" in the consolidated draft federal budget for  the 1994-1995 fiscal year; (e) references to agent sources of  most valuable information; and so on.    Actually, even the sanitized version of the report, which  was  quite voluminous (31 pages), was presented to the gathering only  in the form of a summary. The other speaker--Defense  Intelligence Agency Director Lieutenant General James  Clapper--was in keeping with military tradition concise and  limited himself to a document half as long (14 pages).    We will skip the parts of James Woolsey's report dealing  with  North Korea, China, Libya, Near and Middle East countries,  Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti. We can also bypass the sections of  the report dealing with the topic of international problems of  proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons among  developing countries, and the problems of combating terrorism  and drugs.    What is worth looking at is Page 10 of the report presented,  which covers the situation in Russia and other republics of the  former USSR.    Analyzing the results of the December elections in our  country, the CIA director first and foremost emphasized  Russians' ambivalence. The new parliament elected in our country  combines political forces that are more united in opposition to  the old course of reforms than in the desire to make clear and  constructive corrections to it. At the same time, it is obvious  to the head of American intelligence that the voters supported  the expansion of President Yeltsin's constitutional powers, and  this is precisely what could guarantee consistent continuation  of the reform. James Woolsey also noted that the Russian  leadership is aware of the hopes of all electoral groups  (regardless of political orientation) for increased social  protection of the population and the securing of proper public  order.    Next, James Woolsey outlined four basic directions of  intelligence and information-gathering work with respect to  Russia.    First, providing decisionmakers with the most  important and sometimes unique information of a political and  economic nature in order to be able, in an environment of high  uncertainty, to warn them of the risks they may encounter in  relations with Russia. While giving credit to what has already  been done on the road of far- reaching socioeconomic reforms,  James Woolsey pointed out that it is still unclear when the  subsidizing of unprofitable industrial and agricultural  enterprises will cease. Nevertheless, he expressed the hope that  our president will continue the reforms that are already  underway, although perhaps at a somewhat different pace (if this  may provide sufficient grounds for compromise with his critics).  The most important part, the CIA director continued, is to make  sure that a softer finance and credit policy aimed at  attenuating the pain of the reform does not untie the hands of  those who will push the country into the abyss of hyperinflation.    Second, the plan is to continue surveillance of  places of deployment and the status of approximately 27,000 of  our nuclear warheads, as well as the means of their delivery. In  this respect the greatest concern on the American side is the  decline in esprit de corps in armed forces ranks. This appears  especially dangerous in light of the provocational approaches  undertaken by some countries with the aim of getting their hands  on samples of the most important weapons and military equipment  and nuclear technology and materials. Intelligence-gathering  activities in this area will be combined with practical help to  our side in ensuring the necessary physical security of nuclear  weapons and fissionable materials.    Third, American intelligence intends to continue  monitoring our general-purpose forces. The CIA director already  reported in 1993 on the state of these types of Russian armed  forces, which are experiencing serious difficulties in providing  their commissioned personnel with housing, decent cash pay, and  supporting the needed moral and psychological state of mind of  servicemen. As James Woolsey correctly noted, the Russian  military does not have any special immunity and suffers equally  from the political, economic, and social adversity in which our  reforming country is so rich.    Fourth, the CIA is concerned over the development  of relations between Russia and its new independent neighbors,  which until recently comprised a unified Soviet Union. The  presence of 25 million Russian-speaking people outside Russian  borders, as well as the economic interconnection and  interdependence of the former Union republics, which developed  historically and in many instances naturally, are seen by the  report's authors as key factors determining the evolution of  their policy.    In this connection the presenter dwelled at length on  Russian- Ukrainian relations, particularly the problem of  Crimea. Woolsey informed committee members of the CIA forecast  regarding the outcome of presidential elections on the  peninsula, which were to take place five days later--on 30  January. The subsequent development of events confirmed the  American analysts' conclusions. Later, Langley experts predict  increasing instability in this region, exacerbated by the  worsening general economic situation in Ukraine. They view as  quite probable new attempts to involve Russia in a resolution of  the Crimean problem, which will inevitably affect the state of  Russian- Ukrainian relations.    Concluding his chapter on Russia, which accounted for about  10-15 percent of the total volume (approximately the same amount  of space was allocated to Ukraine and other republics of the  former USSR), James Woolsey reminded the senators that the  political system that existed in our country for several decades  has left a perceptible imprint on Russian society. Therefore it  should come as no surprise that this legacy will be felt for  many years to come in the form of some or other crisis both in  Russia proper and among its immediate neighbors.    Let us sum up. It was not at all our task to present the  viewpoint of expert analysts from the CIA or the U.S. Defense  Department intelligence arm as the most faithful reflection of  the real situation in Russia and the most convincing picture of  our immediate future prospects. And the reason is not a priori  suspiciousness stemming from lopsided professional thinking.  While the American special services' approach is thorough, they  have a long way to go to achieve a deep understanding of the  substance of events taking place here, which is quite excusable  in intercultural interaction of such different social formations.    The resultant mutual cognitive dissonance represents an  academic and practical problem that should be interpreted by  theoreticians and methodologists of intelligence services of  both countries within the framework of the dialogue between  American and Russian special services that has been developing  lately.    This is why, acting at the very least from a desire to  better  understand the position of American experts and even more so in  order to react usefully, some (or better still, all)  observations of our counterparts can and should be perceived,  weighed, and evaluated with due attention and without any  partisan bias in research units of Russian special services.  Which is made easier by the fact that they are now directly  subordinated to the president, who is above all branches, above  the political ambitions of some or other groups. This at least  partially exempts our analysts from a prejudiced, biased  approach.    The latter assumption may perhaps be a little optimistic and  does not square well with the harsh opinion presented at the  beginning of the article. But the intellectual and moral  potential of Russian intelligence officers and the presumption  of their loyalty to their civic duty give one the right to hope  for it.    There are also other applied aspects in the detailed study  of  an outside view of Russian reality. For example, this may enable  us to better understand the American reality and to have a  better picture of the potential attitude toward us in the  highest echelons of state power in the United States.</p>

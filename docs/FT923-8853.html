			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Books: Big wheels in a flat spin BIOGRAPHY OF A BUICK by Bill Morris Granta Books Pounds 8.99, 337 pages SNAP question: What do you know about David Dunbar Buick? Not a great deal? You didn't know that he perfected a process for enamelling cast-iron bathtubs that broke a German monopoly? Or that, by the turn of the century, this ingenious tinkerer had become fascinated by the internal combustion engine? Produced his first car in 1904, and called it a Buick? Sold out to General Motors? Speculated in oil? Ran out of luck? Died penniless in 1929? Do not worry. You cannot know everything. But perhaps you like fiction? A well-researched read? Pacily-pitched action? Snip-snappy dialogue? Enthusiastic sex? Then journey not on your holiday without picking up Biography of a Buick, a volume full of zest and zing that can serve as a blessed counterweight to the posh literary novels that we all pick up in airports and profoundly wish we hadn't. Author Bill Morris is a columnist on the Greensboro News and Record. He is also a Buick fanatic. He bought his first Buick in 1975. Parts of her survive in a made-up 1954 Buick Special, the colour of lipstick and anthracite, that he loves with great joy. This is not an industrial novel. Instead, it concentrates on goings-on within the Buick division of General Motors in the single year of 1954. What a year that was. Inflation was low and employment high. Everyone was making money. Marilyn married Di Maggio. A small hamburger joint was franchised by the McDonald twins. Jack Kerouac was writing a book about a car ride. A white boy was starting to sing like a black man. Ike and Mamie were in the White House. And there was something called the H-bomb materialising from the folds of space-time to strike a horror-note. It was also the year that Buick production in Detroit hit 500,000 cars a year. In the design department at GM, however, something was badly wrong. The bumper of the new, rival Plymouth was a virtual replica of the Buick Century's. Somehow, Plymouth had pirated Buick's design work. Was there a traitor in the camp? In Detroit in 1954, the rapaciousness of cutting-edge capitalism was rampant. Cars were sexy. Money was sexy. Sex was sexy. Everyone was grabbing some. With enviable skill and energy, Bill Morris shows us what it was like on the inside of the automobile industry in its raunchiest era. But the success of his novel lies equally in its numerous sub-plots and his marshalling of an exotic parade of characters from way beyond Detroit. A good example is Elvis - 'shifty-eyed and suspicious. White trash all the way . . . bad skin, bad diet, loud clothes, wild hair, good manners masking inferiority and resentment.' What do you play? Elvis is asked. 'A little git-tar. Mostly I sing.' Whom do you sound like? 'I don't sound like anyone you ever heard before.' If you have felt, this August, like giving the Booker crowd a shove - Bloomsbury, too: all those boring, dead folk - you could do far worse than Biography of a Buick.</p>

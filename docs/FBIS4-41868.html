			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen invited Russia to participate in a tender for the right  to ship equipment for a cascade of hydropower stations on the  Yangtze river.    The proposal was made at his meeting on Wednesday with First  Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets who welcomed the idea  saying "Russia should not lose long-standing relations with  Chinese partners especially in those industries where it has  good chances and advantageous positions".    Soskovets called on China to "specify its interests in trade  and economic, as well as in military and technical cooperation".  Russia is "actively opening new markets now, including that of  weapons", he said.    Qian responded by saying that "trade and economic relations  and military-technical ties comprise a very important part of  our relations in general".    Although the Chinese minister said trade relations are  developing successfully between the two countries and the  turnover reached eight billion dollars last year, he opposed the  so-called "shuttle trade" when individual traders fill the  Russian market with low- quality Chinese goods. He proposed to  replace them by reliable and major companies.    Soskovets, however, said that he can give no guarantees  about  any of the companies advertising themselves on the Russian TV.    Soskovets expressed big interest in the Chinese experience  of  economic reforms and especially in creating free trade zones.  "The Chinese experience is of great interest to us", he said.</p>

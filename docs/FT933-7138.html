			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Japanese boost for car output JAPANESE carmakers accounted for more than a fifth of UK car output in the first six months this year. Sharply rising production by Nissan and the start-up of Toyota and Honda plants are compensating for falling output by the traditional car producers. Overall production rose by 8.2 per cent in the first half of the year to 743,000, helped by a near doubling of output at Nissan's Sunderland plant in north-east England. Nissan added a second model, the Micra small car, to its plant in the second half of 1992. It still forecasts a 51 per cent rise in output to 270,000 this year from 179,000 last year, in spite of a sharp decline in demand in mainland Europe. In the first half of the year Nissan increased its output by 90 per cent to 141,000 from 74,000 a year ago, while Honda produced 13,000 cars at its plant at Swindon, Wiltshire, and Toyota assembled 15,300 cars at its plant at Burnaston, near Derby, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Ford, Peugeot and Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, all suffered from falling production as exports were hit by the decline in mainland European sales. Overall UK output has benefited from the growing popularity in Europe of four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicles, which are carving a significant niche in the car market. The society's figures also disclose the full impact on UK commercial vehicle output of the financial demise of Daf, the former Anglo-Dutch van and truckmaker, which collapsed into receivership at the beginning of February. Both UK production operations have since been rescued by management buy-outs, but in the first half of the year Leyland Daf van production fell 58 per cent and Leyland truck output dived 62 per cent. Overall UK commercial vehicle production dropped 24 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK VEHICLE PRODUCTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   1993        1992     1993/92                                Jan-Jun     Jan-Jun    % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                          742,969     686,747        +8.2 Rover (British Aerospace)      199,914     203,822        -1.9  -cars****                     176,626     185,154        -4.6  -Range Rover/Discovery         23,288      18,668       +24.7 Ford group                     177,959     198,346       -10.3  -Ford                         163,628     188,086       -13.0  -Jaguar                        14,331      10,260       +39.7 General Motors group           153,499     160,673        -4.5  -Vauxhall                     132,492     146,675        -9.7  -Lotus                            154         505       -69.5  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)***    20,853      13,493       +54.5 Nissan                         140,713      74,214       +89.6 Peugeot                         40,355      47,187       -14.5 Toyota                          15,300           -           - Honda                           13,014           -           - Rolls-Royce (Vickers)              559         618        -9.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMERCIAL VEHICLES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                          105,797     138,933       -23.9 Ford                            72,249      85,217       -15.2 General Motors group            12,038      19,423       -38.0  -Vauxhall                       6,915       8,772       -21.2  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)**      5,123      10,651       -51.9 Rover (British Aerospace)        9,150      10,944       -16.4  -car-derived vans                 967       1,655       -41.6  -Land Rover Defender            8,183       9,289       -11.9 Leyland Daf Vans                 4,664      10,993       -57.6 Iveco-Ford (Fiat)                2,363       2,852       -17.1 Leyland Trucks                   2,351       6,178       -61.9 ERF                              1,113         978       +13.8 Dennis (Trinity Holdings)          635         614        +3.4 Seddon Atkinson (Fiat)             377         578       -34.8 Renault VI                       166         572       -71.0 Volvo Bus                          295         223       +32.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Car-derived vans. ** Medium and small vans sold in Europe variously under Vauxhall, Isuzu, GME, Bedford and Suzuki names. *** Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. **** Includes Honda Concerto.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

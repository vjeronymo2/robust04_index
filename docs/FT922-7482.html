			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Base rate policy - suck it and see Does the shock of German unification not only jeopardise further progress towards monetary union but put in jeopardy the progress already made in the ERM? The main worry that market-inclined economists have had about fixed exchange rates or a single currency is the loss of a useful safety valve in the face of what they call 'real shocks'. In fact, there have been hardly any such shocks confined to a single member country, and the shock of German unification is the first clear-cut example. The problem as usually stated is that because the German government has not financed more of the costs of unification from taxation, the Bundesbank has had to double interest rates in the past three or four years to contain inflation. This has led to a level of real interest rates supposedly quite unsuitable for other EC members. What then are the alternative courses for countries saddled with a high German-induced level of real interest rates? I shall talk about the alternatives facing the UK, but much of the discussion applies to France and others. 1) Leave the ERM and surprise the financial markets. The advocates of this course are mostly those who never wanted to join in the first place - with the addition of a few fainthearts and weathercocks. 2) Stay in the ERM, and devalue. This is put forward as a less provocative alternative. But it is not in fact available. Of course a realignment would be technically possible - but UK interest rates would be higher, not lower, afterwards. For the risk premium over German interest rates - now almost eliminated - would widen out again. 3) Yet another course would be to make more use of small realignments. A problem with taking this route now is that it is not even clear in which direction any realignment should go. If the expected trend were for the D-Mark to rise, other countries would need to have still higher interest rates than they have today. Such a shift would only be helpful if Germany failed so badly to contain the inflationary effects of unification that the D-Mark was expected to fall against other currencies. This would be over the dead body of the Bundesbank. So much for the backward-looking choices. For those who accept the progress made towards fixed exchange rates, there are other courses. 4) The simplest is to grit our teeth and bear it for as long as it takes until German interest rates pass their peak and the Bundesbank decides that they can safely come down. We simply do not know whether present British real interest rates are compatible with recovery or not. During the long upswing of the mid-1980s real base rates (adjusted by the RPI excluding mortgage interest) hovered around 5 per cent to 7 per cent, compared with 4 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent now. 5) Make much more use of the room for manoeuvre provided by the margins around the central parity. This course has been made less likely by the decision of the Treasury and Bank of England to let the return of confidence after the election take sterling up to near its central DM2.95 parity. But the chance may return; and there is still some room before the upper end of the band is reached. International movements of funds are of course influenced by interest rate differentials combined with expected exchange rate changes. Anatole Kaletsky of The Times has provided a useful chart showing that if sterling were at DM2.885, the lower boundary of the narrow band, and were expected to reach the central parity in a year's time, base rates could be just above 7 per cent instead of 10 per cent. On the more extreme assumption that sterling went to the bottom of the existing wide band against the D-Mark, base rates could fall to below 4 per cent. Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs has poured cold water on this analysis by saying that currencies which are low in their band against the D-Mark are seen in the market as a devaluation risk, and that the interest rate premium then has to be higher, not lower. Market sentiment could change. But in any case making use of the margins can only buy time. For once sterling has risen to its central point or its upper limit, depending on how policy operates, there would be nothing more to go for by holders of the pound. To maintain base rates below Germany's for any length of time, markets would have to see at least a possibility of an upward realignment of sterling. 5) A more ambitious variant would be for sterling or the French franc to try to take over the anchor role from the D-Mark. Advocates of wrenching the anchor from Germany vary in their sincerity. Some Europhobes are obviously thinking: 'Take advantage of Germany's weakness to set interest rates below German ones now; and having regained the habit of setting our own interest rates, leave the ERM when the time is ripe. But not say anything to John Major about it at the moment, if you want to stay a junior minister.' Questions of sincerity apart, becoming an anchor is not entirely a bed of roses - the Bundesbank never wanted that role for the D-Mark. But the way to achieve it, if desired, is through tighter rather than looser monetary policies than are currently expected. In other words, keep real interest rates high in the hope of killing inflation and reduce nominal interest rates later. A little cold water needs to be thrown on the idea that British inflation rates have fallen behind Germany's. We must allow for the distorting effects of German VAT increases and the timing of British mortgage rate cuts. If we do so the underlying German increase in consumer prices is 3 1/2 per cent to 4 per cent, comfortably below the British underlying rate of 5 1/2 per cent. Fortunately the range of choice is not in practice as bewilderingly large as the number of theoretical courses. If we leave aside the catastrophist options of devaluation or leaving the ERM, all the others point in the same operational direction. That is to say, stay in the ERM at the present parity, but make as much use as possible domestically of the room for manoeuvre provided both by the margins and the new post-election credibility of the British government. To succeed in this course there are two policy requirements. The first is to keep the 6 per cent margin for as long as possible, which means until the formal start of Stage Two in 1994. The British government's original reason for wanting to move to narrower margins earlier - to reduce the downside risk on sterling - in now obsolete. Second, the government and the Bank of the England should be much less fearful, with the election out of the way, of making interest rate cuts they may have to reverse. Interest rates are a price. Like all prices they need to move in both directions without loss of prestige. The only way to find out whether British interest rates can indeed move below German ones is to suck it and see at a time when there is a domestic case for going lower. The French government did not get away with such a manoeuvre last year, but the British government might in 1992. If moving interest rates by  1/4 per cent at a time would help two-way movement, so be it. The root of many of the problems supposed to surround the ERM - and it is the theme of Europhobic economic utterances - is that Germany will need much higher real interest rates than the rest of the world for the foreseeable future, and it is thus a folly for us to link our currencies to the D-Mark. This begs the question of how Germany can maintain much higher real interest rates than, for instance, the US in a world of free capital movements? There is only one way: for the dollar to undershoot so far against the D-Mark that a correction is expected. That is, the market must expect the dollar to rise and the D-Mark to fall. In that way a lower return on American financial assets would be offset by an expected dollar appreciation. Something of this kind is indeed consistent with the pattern of short-term interest rates and forward quotations. But if you look at, say, 10-year bonds, you find a completely different picture. American yields are only just over  1/2 a per cent below German yields, thus suggesting a long-term expectation of convergence of nominal interest rates in the two countries. If the market is anywhere near right then the present high level of German short-term interest rates is an aberration and/or US interest rates are abnormally low; and in any case the two will converge over the next few years. How does this observation fit in with German difficulties over unification? No problem, once you strip away the veil of money and look at underlying realities. Capital is internationally mobile. Its price, to which real interest rates are an approximation, tends to equality in advanced market economies. The less mobile factor of production is labour. Because of the addition of the east German working population which did not bring with it a corresponding increase in the amount of usable capital or knowhow, German real wages need to fall. More precisely, unskilled wages need to fall and parity between east and west German wages needs to be postponed until the next century; while wages of key workers with the skills required for reconstruction in the east should rise. Such changes are difficult to implement in an economy with powerful unions and national pay deals. But the resulting tensions will not necessarily produce more inflation, apart from the present hiccup. The strain is more likely to be taken by unemployment, open or hidden. Once this begins to damp down wage push - and this always happens - German interest rates will come down to a more acceptable level. Thus the German economy may become less and less a model for the rest of Europe, but may still provide it with the public good of low inflation. It would not be surprising if German enthusiasm both for political union and the single currency cooled further. During this period the task will be to hold together the ERM and to build up the European Monetary Institute which will try to co-ordinate European monetary policies during Stage Two of the move to monetary union.</p>

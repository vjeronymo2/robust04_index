			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Euro-sceptics rebuked over bill EURO-SCEPTIC Tory MPs faced angry protests from other Conservatives last night for voting against the government and slowing progress over the Maastricht bill. At a stormy meeting of the backbench 1922 committee government loyalists led attacks against the rebels, including some members of the 1922 executive. The row reflected growing disquiet within Tory ranks over the snail-like progress the bill is making through the Commons. The loyalists complained that defying the government on matters of principle was understandable, but that attempts to deliberately delay and extend debates were unacceptable and unprecedented. In the Commons a Labour attempt to re-ignite the Commons' debate over Maastricht's social chapter had to be put on hold last night. Mr George Robertson, Labour's Europe spokesman, formally announced that the party's frontbench would support a fresh amendment intended to force the government to include the chapter in the treaty. But Mr Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker who is presiding over the bill's committee stage, refused to say whether he would select the amendment for consideration or whether he will allow a general debate on the social chapter. The earliest the issue can now be debated is Thursday when the Commons next considers the treaty. Labour is confident there are other procedural devices available if the latest attempt is thwarted. During the 13th day of the bill's committee stage yesterday, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, reaffirmed that the government would consider all parties' views before deciding how the 24 UK members of the committee of the regions - set up under the treaty - should be appointed. An all-party campaign for a British referendum on Maastricht was launched yesterday by the Maastricht Referendum Campaign which has Baroness Thatcher as a patron.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposed to strengthen and expand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of administrative capability for participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, addressing areas previously not regulated or for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which there were only guidelines (pages 9544&hyph;9549);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed to amend the provisions governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default reduction measures to reflect statutory changes made by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Amendments of 1992 and current departmental practices. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions in the Technical Amendments of 1993 that address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional appeals of cohort default rates were not included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the NPRM (pages 9549&hyph;9551);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed to clarify the terms used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory definition of a fair and equitable refund policy (pages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9551&hyph;9556);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed to implement the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that institutions have annual compliance audits. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposed to extend the audit requirements to foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions (pages 9556&hyph;9557); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed to amend the Federal Pell Grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program regulations to implement section 487(c)(7) of the HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provides that an institution may offset the amount of Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV, HEA program disbursements against liabilities or may receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement from the Department for those amounts if, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course of any audit conducted after December 31, 1988, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department discovers or is informed of any Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance (specifically, Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution has provided to its students in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program requirements, but the institution has not previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received credit or reimbursement for these disbursements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (page 9558).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 17, 1994, the Secretary published an NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing amendments to parts 668 and 682 in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (59 FR 8044). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in the proposed changes. The following list summarizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on which a discussion of those issues can be found:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed a definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> third-party servicer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as applicable to those individuals or organizations that contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an institution to administer any aspect of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs (page 8045);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed to expand the factors of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility of an institution to take into consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial control over both institutions and third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers (pages 8046&hyph;8047);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed annual audit requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers as necessary to implement statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions under the Amendments of 1992 (pages 8047&hyph;8048);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed notification requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers against which the Secretary has assessed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (pages 8048&hyph;8049);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed to create a new section to codify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract requirements between institutions and third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers. As one of the conditions in the contract, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer would be required to assume joint and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several liability with an institution that the servicer contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program requirement (pages 8049&hyph;8050);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed to apply against a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer the sanctions under subpart G of the Student Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Provisions that currently solely apply to institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (pages 8050&hyph;8051);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed to apply the fiduciary standards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently only apply to institutions to third-party servicers so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that third-party servicers would be required to act at all times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the competency necessary to qualify them as a fiduciary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (page 8051);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed a definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> third-party servicer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to those individuals or organizations that contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a lender or guarantee agency to administer any aspect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lender's or guarantee agency's participation in the FFEL programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (page 8055);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed to require a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contracts with a lender or guaranty agency to assume joint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and several liability for any violation of any FFEL program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement or applicable statutory requirement. Collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities from the violation would be collected first from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lender or guaranty agency (page 8055&hyph;8056); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed a new section to codify Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for third-party servicers that contract with lenders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or guaranty agencies. A third-party servicer would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet certain standards of financial responsibility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability to be considered eligible to contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a lender or guaranty agency. In addition, this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require a third-party servicer to have performed an annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit of the servicer's administration of a lender's or guaranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's participation in the FFEL programs (page 8056);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Integrity Triad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the student financial assistance programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized under Title IV of the HEA (referred to as ``Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA programs'') and many other Federal programs, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the HEA and many other Federal statutes, one element of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that definition requires an eligible institution of higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the quality of the education or training provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. Another element requires an eligible institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary level in the State in which it is located. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution must be certified by the Secretary as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA provides the framework for a shared responsibility among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the ``gate'' to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to those institutions that provide students with quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education or training worth the time, energy, and money they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility have traditionally been referred to as ``the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triad.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;325,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bodies must meet if they are to be recognized by the Secretary as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``gatekeepers'' for Title IV or other Federal purposes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in detail. Part H also provides a new oversight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for States: the State Postsecondary Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program. Altogether, part H establishes a set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities for accrediting agencies, States, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of institutions that participate, or wish to participate, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> COMIC DRAWS FIRE OF AIDS PROTESTERS  </P> <P> About 25 protesters from an AIDS coalition smashed watermelons in front of the  Coach House concert club Wednesday night as comedian Gallagher was preparing to  perform.  </P> <P> The protest, sponsored by ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) Orange  County, was in response to a recent show at Lake Tahoe at which Gallagher  included an AIDS joke in his act.  </P> <P> "AIDS is not funny," screamed protest organizer Jan Speller as concert-goers  were driving into the club parking lot. "We're here to express our outrage of  Gallagher's recent statements. We're not about to sit back and let these  comments go by."  </P> <P> "It's particularly painful," said protester Joseph Amster, "considering that  this week marked the passing of Orange County's 1,000th AIDS death."  </P> <P> Gallagher -- who uses sledgehammers to smash, pulverize and spray his audience  with watermelons and other food items -- would not comment directly. But a  Coach House official released a statement from Gary Proper, the comedian's  manager. "The Lake Tahoe AIDS reference was an isolated event," said the  statement. "It was a one-time event. Gallagher has and will never include  material about AIDS again."  </P> <P> Gallagher ends a six-night stand at the Coach House on Saturday night.  </P> <P> ACT UP Orange County demonstrated last month at the Pacific Amphitheatre in  Costa Mesa, where comedian Andrew Dice Clay was performing.

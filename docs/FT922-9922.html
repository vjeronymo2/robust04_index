			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Falling wages spell rising crime in black America THE LOS ANGELES riots were sparked by what appeared to many to be a miscarriage of justice; and slow burning resentment arising from past decades of judicial inequality are the historical background to this latest bout of race-related discontent. But the tinder which inflamed the anger of the rioters has an important economic element: the collapse in the legal economic opportunities of badly educated young black men over the past two decades, and the rise of crime as a substitute. The poor and poorly educated, regardless of race, have been hardest hit by the economic shifts which have affected the US economy over the past two decades. The virtual disappearance of high-wage, low-skill manufacturing employment and the rising demand for educated and technically literate graduates have opened wide gaps in wage and employment opportunities. The real wages of the lowest-paid 10 per cent of workers fell by more than 30 per cent between 1970 and the late 1980s while the percentage of unskilled men without jobs doubled to more than 30 per cent over the same period. This long-term decline in the probability of, and return from, unskilled employment has affected young black men particularly badly. Young blacks are less likely to graduate from high school, less likely to find employment and can expect to earn a third less than young white males. A quarter of all 18-24 year olds, but 30 per cent of young blacks, failed to complete high school in the late 1980s; the employment rate of less experienced black men is now 10 percentage points lower than that of whites, as the upper chart shows; and the gap between the earnings of young blacks and whites is growing again. Poor employment opportunities have led directly to a large rise in criminal activity among young black men, according to Mr Richard Freeman, an economics professor at both the London School of Economics and Harvard University. One-fifth of all black men aged 16-34 year of age had a criminal record in the 1980s, compared to 7 per cent of all men in that age group. Criminal activity is also concentrated among the badly educated. According to Mr Freeman, 'the proportion of disadvantaged young black men with criminal records grew so large in the 1980s that crime became a major determinant of their economic life rather than deviant behaviour on the margin.' Over two-thirds of all prisoners aged 18-24, and three-quarters of black prisoners in that age group, are high school drop-outs; more than three-quarters of black male high school drop-outs aged 16-34 have a criminal record; and 26 per cent of all black male drop-outs aged 25-34 were in prison in 1986, compared to 7.4 per cent of all male drop-outs. This rise in criminal activity partly reflects the higher relative return from crime in recent years. The rather sketchy US evidence suggests that badly educated young men can triple their take-home pay though crime. A survey in Boston in 1989 found that over two-thirds of young men believed they could make more money 'on the streets', up from a third in 1980. Crime also brings risks. Mr Freeman reports a survey of regular drug-dealers in Washington DC which found they had a 50 per cent chance of being charged with a drug offence in any given year, while those arrested had a 50 per cent chance of imprisonment. A criminal record also stunts future legitimate job opportunities. A past spell in jail reduces the probability of future work by 25-30 per cent, of which only a third is due to future imprisonment. Any serious attempt to reduce inner-city poverty and non-employment in the US will have to reduce the incentive to become involved in crime. Mr Freeman argues that a rise in legitimate labour force participation will require a combination of spending on law enforcement, rehabilitation for past offenders and education for likely drop-outs. The scale of the recent destruction suggests these programmes would be worth the money.

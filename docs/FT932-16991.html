			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Intel invests Dollars 1bn in chip plant INTEL, the world's largest computer chip maker, plans to add a Dollars 1bn expansion to its plant near Albuquerque, New Mexico. It will be the largest single investment in a US computer chip factory. The expansion will begin immediately and production is scheduled to start in 1995, creating up to 1,000 new jobs. 'This is our first billion-dollar factory, but it won't be our last,' said Mr Gordon Moore, chairman. 'Chip factories are getting bigger and more expensive as our manufacturing technologies continue to become more complex. The entry fee to be a major player in the global semiconductor market of the 1990s is Dollars 1bn - payable in advance.' For the past three years, Intel has invested more in new plants and equipment than any other semiconductor company in the world, and more than it had spent in the 22-year history of the company. In 1993, the company will spend Dollars 1.6bn on new plants and equipment. The company's US-based manufacturing work force will expand by approximately 18 per cent this year. The expansion calls for completion of 180,000 sq ft of the existing building and a 1.3m sq ft addition. This will include 140,000 sq ft of Class 1 clean room, the ultra-clean area where computer chips are actually made. In the new part of the plant chips will be made on eight-inch diameter wafers and the circuit lines on chips will be 0.40 microns in width, smaller than at any other US chip plant. (One micron is approximately 1/100th of the thickness of a human hair). The New Mexico factory, which is Intel's largest wafer fabrication plant, produces microprocessors, the brains of personal computers, and other advanced logic chips. Intel employs 2,400 workers at the site, with several hundred additional support staff working for Intel suppliers.</p>

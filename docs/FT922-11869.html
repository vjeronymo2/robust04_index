			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT plans new index THE Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, has signed a letter of intent to co-operate with Knight Ridder Financial to develop an international commodity index future. The index will be calculated and disseminated by the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB), a subsidiary of Knight-Ridder Financial. It will be production-weighted and consist of 18 commodity futures. Mr William O'Connor, CBOT chairman, said the exchange believed that the contract will appeal to institutional investors and commodity trading advisers around the world. A CRB index future currently trades on the New York Futures Exchange, but it is weighted differently.</p>

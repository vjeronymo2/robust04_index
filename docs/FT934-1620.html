			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Citroen predicts bleak outlook Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot-Citroen, the French car manufacturer, yesterday forecast a slow recovery in the European car market next year and said that demand would be constrained by economic conditions. At Citroen's annual press conference Mr Calvet predicted that European car sales would grow by just over 3 per cent next year to 11.78m cars, while the French market would grow by 5.7 per cent to 1.85m cars. The estimate for the French market is lower than the 9 per cent growth forecast that the company made last month. 'The last few months seemed worse than expected. We do not feel that there has been an upward move in orders,' said Mr Calvet. He said a sharp increase in car purchases at the end of last year, as consumers anticipated higher prices resulting from new safety and environmental regulations, had a distorting effect with this year's comparisons. According to Mr Calvet, the European market will see an uneven pattern of growth next year. In the UK, he expected car sales to rise by just under 4 per cent. In Italy sales are expected to remain stable, Spain's forecast is for strong growth of 12 per cent. In Germany a contraction of 3.1 per cent is forecast. But Mr Calvet said Citroen should continue to strengthen its market position in 1994. This year, the company said it represented between 4.9 per cent and 5 per cent of the European market, up slightly from 4.8 per cent in 1992. Mr Calvet described the economic climate this year as the worst since the second world war. He criticised 'the religion of monetarists' and said the current environment required a looser monetary policy.</p>

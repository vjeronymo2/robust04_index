As we reported earlier, Aleksandr Lysenko arrived in the  U.S.  last summer and was declared persona non-grata in connection  with the Ameses case. Aldrich Ames and his wife Maria were  accused of spying in favor of the Kremlin for many years.    To quote Kobaladze, Moscow's decision to expel high-ranking  American diplomat James Morris, officially introduced as the CIS  resident, "is a matter of mutual accounts, rather than a return  measure."    Kobaladze expressed hope that the damage caused by Lysenko's  and Morris's exile would be minimized. "We reckon on this," he  said.    Asked if Lysenko's successor would be officially introduced  in Washington as the Russian resident, Kobaladze said that the  agreement on this was still in force. "However, details will be  discussed with Americans, on whom very much would depend. We  have channels for such a discussion," he said.    Speaking about Lysenko's career, Kobaladze said that some of  the American media's reports about Lysenko's further exile to  Siberia were ungrounded. "His experience and knowledge can be  used by the EIS where he will continue to work," he said.</p>

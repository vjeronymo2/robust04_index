			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Costain's coal activities in US hit by bad weather Shares of Costain, the construction and mining group, fell almost a tenth yesterday following a warning that US coal profits had been hit by bad winter weather and operational problems during the first three months of this year. Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, told the annual meeting that it would not be possible to recover the profit shortfall during the remainder of the year. Costain's share price fell from 33p to 30 1/2 p. The group said later that it had suffered from some minor geological problems which now had been resolved. Costain returned to the black last year making pre-tax profits of Pounds 68.7m compared to a Pounds 204.6m loss in 1992. All but Pounds 200,000 of the 1993 figure arose from the sale of the group's Australian coal mining business to Peabody, part of Hanson, the industrial conglomerate. The sale, together with proceeds from last autumn's Pounds 83.9m rights issue, enabled Costain to reduce net debt from Pounds 331m to Pounds 83m and gearing to 37 per cent of increased shareholders' fund of Pounds 228m. Since the year-end the group has sold its remaining Australian property interests for ADollars 27.1m (Pounds 12.8m), making a small profit on the deal. The engineering and construction division had also won some valuable new contracts, Sir Christopher said. Nonetheless, conditions remained very difficult in the UK and overseas. UK construction margins, in spite of reports of increased orders won by the industry, remained slim. As a result Sir Christopher said short-term profitability remained under pressure.</p>

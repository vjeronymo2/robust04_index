			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN special envoy to Liberia, Mr. Trevor  Gordon-Somers, has been exposed for giving misleading  information to the leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic  Front of Liberia], regarding the definite timing of the  deployment of Ugandan expanded ECOMOG [Economic Community of  West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] troops to  Maryland County and other parts of the southeastern region of  Liberia. President Charles Gankay Taylor said Ambassador  Gordon-Somers had misinformed the NPFL that the expanded ECOMOG  was to have been deployed in Maryland County. This, he said,  led the NPFL to send a team of senior military officers to  Maryland to receive the ECOMOG troops, only to realize that the  troops were not coming.</p>

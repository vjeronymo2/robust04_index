			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The guru who gives babies a human voice / Interview with Penelope Leach LAST Thursday was a big day for Penelope Leach. The woman who has encouraged millions of parents around the world to treat their babies and toddlers as free-thinking young human beings had just scored a triumph. The Scottish Law Commission recommended that the slipper, the belt and the ruler should be outlawed as intruments of punishment for children - a ban for which Leach has been compaigning for years. 'I'm being rung for comments all the time,' she says, inhaling deeply on a cigarette and running downstairs to the pine kitchen in her north London house for another cup of coffee. Throughout our conversation the phone keeps ringing, and not just about smacking. Leach is being invited to write articles and asked for views on child modelling, day care centres and other assorted themes. Indeed, she has become a rent-a-quote expert. But she sticks to her liberal principles. She is AGAINST smacking, regimentation, bottle feeding and communal child care. She is FOR demand feeding, democracy within the family, and attending to a baby as soon as it cries. What makes her feel so strongly about it all? Did she herself have a desperately strict upbringing that she is rebelling against? 'I'm afraid you are on a bad wicket there,' she says. 'We were a very close, extended family. We were part of an arty tradition. My mother was a writer, my stepfather was a painter and sculptor. We were never smacked - my mother believed it was important that children should be allowed to argue, reason their case, be heard.' It was revolutionary stuff in those days. Dr Spock, Leach's forerunner and inspiration, was still unknown in England. Baby and Child Care, which dared to question the strict rules by which post-war children were brought up, was not even published in Britain until 1955. Four decades later, it is almost impossible to find an expert who is not in broad agreement with some variant of the liberal ideas Spock introduced. And Leach, with her smash-hit book Baby and Child - which has sold 2.5m copies in the US alone and has been translated into 28 languages - is one of the loudest voices in the new orthodoxy. But isn't it odd that there seems to be a consensus on such an unscientific business as bringing up children? Are the child-care experts so slavishly fashion-conscious that they follow the liberal school for now, ready to change everything should the mood swing back to discipline and routine? Or is it that the liberals are, somehow, right? Leach laughs and, after a bit of thought, plumps for the latter explanation. 'People have just recognised something that has always been perfectly obvious. Children are people and it is more sensible to treat them as people. It is better for everyone if you do.' Her trademark is to write explicitly from the baby's point of view which, she argues, is the same as the parent's. Surely, though, this is nonsense. A two-year-old's interest is to throw toys all round the floor, but the exhausted parent's is to get them cleared up as soon as possible and get the child off to bed. 'Of course, the interests are not the same in that sense,' Leach replies. 'But what I passionately believe to be true is that getting it right for the child is to get it right for the adult. You, as a parent, need the room to be cleared up but you can't - you physically can't - force your child to pick up the toys. If you want them up, well, look at it from her point of view. By making it part of a game, or part of a race, you can get it done and everyone will be happy.' I look unconvinced. Might it not be quicker and easier just to exert your will and put up with the screams? 'The issue here is power,' she says. 'Parents who say: 'What matters is my power, my authority over the child' ' - she looks disapproving and takes another long puff on her cigarette - 'those parents do not want my book.' But even if you accept that parents should not be on a power kick - which scarcely seems controversial - surely it is still unrealistic to expect weary mothers and fathers to come up with a fun game at the end of the day. Leach looks out onto her sunny garden backing onto Hampstead Heath, quite unruffled. Confident in her own ideas, she treats dissent with tolerance, almost with sympathy. 'If people disagree with something I have written, then that at least makes them think and helps them work it out in their own minds. 'When people complain that I have too idealistic a view of parents and children, I say you have to aim high. We teach people to drive well, and to observe speed limits, but that doesn't mean we always obey them. I am not saying we can all do it right, but you have to aim high.' I am still worried. I wonder if aiming high is responsible for all those loving parents who bring their children to dinner parties and proceed to keep them up throughout the meal, and those anarchic households where toddlers rule the roost. Hasn't there been too much of democratic tolerance and seeing the child's point of view? Leach takes no responsibility for such behaviour. 'Children need adults, and being an adult is about setting limits. People are extraordinarily bad at setting limits.' But how do you police the limits once you have set them - especially if, going by her book, you are not allowed to punish and must avoid conflict? 'If you've set good limits, you don't have to police them,' she insists. 'A good limit is one the child can't break.' I wonder if someone with these views has children of her own, or has been blessed with such good ones that conflicts never arose. This is another poor wicket. Leach shudders. 'My daughter, in particular, was a difficult toddler. Very difficult indeed. She was highly strung, very bright, strong-willed, and understood an awful lot more than she could do.' Didn't this experience of a difficult child make her question the views she had formed, both as an academic and then while carrying out practical research with thousands of parents? 'You don't believe things if the data contradicts them - at least, not if you are any good. I had written about the validity of avoiding confrontation; and when I got myself into a confrontation situation with my daughter, it simply proved to me that this disastrous scene could have been averted if I had seen it coming and taken another route.' But what about ordinary mums? Does their experience also tally so well with the Leach doctrine? Or are they leaving children to cry behind closed doors knowing they will fall asleep eventually? Leach, who speaks and writes with evangelical fervour, sighs. 'I come across too many people who do not realise that very young children have feelings, and that they matter. People still say of a three-year-old, in complete amazement: 'She knows what she thinks]' On a good day, they think it is quite sweet if a toddler has its own point of view; otherwise, they think it extremely disrespectful'. Leach feels, however, that most people have accepted the theory of modern child-care - even if they do not actually put it into practice. 'Take breast feeding,' she says. 'All the evidence we have is that breast feeding is better for the child. Yet, fewer and fewer mothers breast feed in hospital and an infinitesimal number go on until the baby is six weeks old. This raises a difficult dilemma. If you, as an expert, believe differently from common practice, then by stating your views you risk making a lot of people very cross. If people don't want to breast feed, that is fine. But they must accept that books should not blur the decision just to make them feel better. Parents do not want to be lied to.' Such intransigence has got Leach into trouble. Her opposition to communal care for very young children has gone down badly with some working mothers. 'The media tends to leap to the conclusion that I am against women working, but that is not true.' She adds, however: 'We need to recognise that work is not everything. Our caring roles are just as important as our working ones. We must de-genderise home-based roles. If women take equal responsibility in the market place, men must do the same at home.' It is easy to argue that this predictable stuff is distant from present-day realities. But Leach, who still clings to a belief in flower power and peace, might say justly that this is the reason it needs to be said - again and again and again.</p>

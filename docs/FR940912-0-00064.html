Section 810(c) authorizes the Secretary to refer to the Attorney General matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements by respondents for enforcement. Regulations found at 24 CFR parts 103 and 104 govern the conduct of investigations under the Act by the Assistant Secretary and the taking of enforcement action in a number of situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39955), HUD published a final rule that amended its Fair Housing Complaint Processing regulations, which are codified in 24 CFR part 103. The purpose of the August 5, 1994 final rule was to advise the public that the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement), rather than the General Counsel, is authorized (1) to make and issue determinations that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred and direct the issuance of charges based on such determinations, and (2) to refer matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements to the Attorney General. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This authority was previously delegated to HUD's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel by the Secretary. Through the August 5, 1994 final rule, the Secretary transferred the delegation of this authority from the General Counsel and the Deputy General Counsel to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement. In transferring this delegation, however, the Secretary intended for the General Counsel to be consulted and to concur in a determination of reasonable cause before the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity directs the issuance of such a charge. The language requiring concurrence of the General Counsel in reasonable cause determinations was inadvertently omitted from the August 5, 1994 final rule, and therefore does not correctly reflect the Secretary's intended delegation of authority on this matter. The purpose of this document is to correct this error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, FR Doc. 94&hyph;19178, a final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39955) is corrected to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. In the preamble, on page 39955, in the second column, under the heading ``Supplementary Information,'' the second and third paragraphs under this heading are corrected to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This rule amends portions of 24 CFR part 103 to advise that the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement) is authorized, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, to make and issue determinations that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred and to direct the issuance of charges based on such determinations. The Assistant Secretary also is authorized to refer matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements to the Attorney General. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This authority was previously delegated to the General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel of the Department by the Secretary. Through this final rule, the Secretary has now transferred the delegation of this authority from the General Counsel and the Deputy General Counsel to the Assistant Secretary. However, before determining that reasonable cause exists to believe that discriminatory housing practice has occurred, and directing the issuance of a charge based on that determination, the Assistant Secretary must receive the concurrence of the General Counsel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

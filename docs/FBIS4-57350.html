			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Josias de Souza] </F>   [Text] Classified documents sent to President Itamar Franco  reveal the growing problem of land distribution in Brazil.    Official investigations show the risk of an escalation of  violence in the countryside.    The reports were prepared by the SAE, Strategic Affairs  Secretariat, headed by Admiral Mario Cesar Flores. The  investigation of the landless peasants began nearly two years  ago.    Flores said: "The growing agrarian conflict is worrisome."  According to him, the landless peasants "have adopted violence  as a political method."    The landless peasants were the main subject of the three  meetings President Franco held with his military ministers this  week.    During a conversation with Justice Minister Alexandre  Dupeyrat on 12 May, Deputy Luciano Pizzatto (PFL-PR) [Liberal  Front Party-Parana] wondered whether the peasants are "arming  themselves."    In the evening during another meeting, Minister Dupeyrat  said  seriously: "The situation is far more serious than you can  imagine."    Contag [National Confederation of Farmworkers] President  Aloisio Carneiro said the government is not well informed. "We  do not buy weapons, nor do we support radical positions."    Adm. Flores did not rule out the possibility of the land  distribution problem reaching an "untenable" stage.    In case it did, the problem would have to be dealt with as a  "national security subject," and he even admitted an eventual  intervention by the Armed Forces to control it.    The president and his advisers are convinced that CUT [Sole  Workers Center], the labor union branch of the PT [Workers  Party], is behind the radicalization of the landless peasant  problem.    CUT has denied any inclination in favor of radicalizing the  problem to use it for electoral purposes.</p>

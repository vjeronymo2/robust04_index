			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GROUPS SUPPORT RESEDA EXTENSION  </P> <P> Your article (July 21) on the extension and paving of Reseda Boulevard to  Mulholland Drive failed to include the testimony before the Fire Commission of  the Encino Hillside Traffic Safety Organization and the Encino Property Owners  Assn.  </P> <P> These groups jointly and vigorously support the extension of Reseda Boulevard  into the Santa Monica Mountains. We want road access to Mulholland Drive and  the paving of Mulholland Drive so that the residents of Tarzana and the West  Valley will have their own access to the San Diego Freeway and stop using our  already overly burdened hillside streets as a bypass to the freeway.  </P> <P> The narrow, winding, hazardous streets in the fire-prone hillside area of  Encino have become a threat to our public safety and need relief now.  </P> <P> In no way can our streets absorb increased traffic from the 350 homes planned  along both sides of Reseda Boulevard around the country clubs of Braemar and El  Caballero. We protest our street conditions where cars damage our gardens,  smash our fences, total our cars and crash through the walls of our homes.  </P> <P> Opponents of the extension and paving of Reseda Boulevard talk about preserving  hiking trails, while we cannot walk along our streets without getting hit by  cars. We cannot allow our children to play on the sidewalks in front of their  own houses. How can we allow them to walk to school?  </P> <P> MADELINE DeANTONIO  </P> <P> Encino  </P> <P> DeAntonio represents the Encino Hillside Traffic Safety Organization and the  Encino Property Owners Assn.  </P></p>

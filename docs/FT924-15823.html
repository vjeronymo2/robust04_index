			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Accounts TV service attracts interest MORE than 11,000 acc-ountants have already registered an interest in subscribing to Accountancy Television, the service for accountants launched yesterday. The interest in the weekly programme - the latest offered by BBC Select - is greater than expected. BBC Select uses BBC transmitters to deliver specialist programmes in the early hours to a special video recorder - a BBC Selector - that unscrambles and records the hour-long programmes. Mr Mike Lickiss, chairman of ATV, which has been set up by five of the main accountancy bodies, said accountants were often in the spotlight in a way that was alien to them. 'The accountancy bodies now recognise that while training has focused on technical issues, it has not always created sufficient awareness of the current issues of the day,' Mr Lickiss said. Individual subscribers will pay Pounds 750 a year but international firms could pay up to Pounds 10,000. The programmes, produced by Workhouse Productions, the independent television production company, will range from news and views to technical training. 'There will be a lot of emphasis on things that are about to happen in the next few months which will affect accountants,' said Mr Peter Williams, editor of the programme and a former editor of Accountancy Age magazine. The first BBC Select service, Executive Business Club, has more than 2,500 corporate subscribers and is expected to have a turnover of more than Pounds 1m in its first years. The go-ahead has been given for a service for lawyers. The pilot programme for the service is expected to be produced next month. By the end of next year the BBC expects to have at least six subscription services.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> ARSON IS BLAMED FOR STORE FIRE  </P> <P> A raging fire that destroyed a large Thrifty Drug Store and caused an estimated  $2 million in damage was deliberately set inside the store, a Fire Department  official said Wednesday. There were no injuries.  </P> <P> The fire, which required the efforts of nearly 50 firefighters and 12 pieces of  equipment, damaged four adjoining small businesses.  </P> <P> No suspect has been identified, and the motive for the arson is unknown, the  fire official said.  </P> <P> During the fire, aerosol cans exploded, leading to initial reports -- later  found to be false -- that the explosions had set off the fire.  </P> <P> "The fire didn't start by exploding hair spray cans. It was started by someone  setting some paper goods on fire," said Bill Dumas, a fire captain and arson  investigator for the department.  </P> <P> The spectacular blaze, which broke out about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday and continued  burning until about 1 a.m. Wednesday, destroyed the Thrifty Drug Store at a  shopping center at Katella Avenue and Euclid Street.  </P> <P> "The cause of the fire was arson," Dumas said at the fire scene Wednesday. "It  started in the area of the (hair spray cans), and it was the heat from the fire  that made them explode. The paper goods were down low, and the cans were up  high above them. We don't have any suspects at the present time, but we're  working on some leads," he said.  </P> <P> Dumas, in response to questions, said there is no indication that the arson is  gang-related, although he noted that the area has a lot of gang activity. He  also said that there were no juveniles in the drugstore at the time the blaze  started and that investigators are not looking into any disgruntled or former  employees.  </P> <P> "We think we know what happened, but I can't go into it while the investigation  is in progress," Dumas said.  </P> <P> Dumas said a customer inside the drugstore first noticed the fire about 9:30  p.m. "He saw the fire in an overhead mirror -- you know how these stores have  mirrors that can view things back in the store," Dumas said. "The man told the  sales clerk, and she placed the alarm."  </P> <P> Dumas and others at the fire scene on Wednesday morning said about four  employees and five customers were in the store when the fire broke out.  </P> <P> "The employees attempted to contain and control the fire but were  unsuccessful," said Dumas. "When the Fire Department arrived, there was smoke  showing out of the front of the building, and guys pulled up right in front. As  soon as they got off the engine, the whole front of the building blew out --  what we call a back-draft condition."  </P> <P> On Wednesday morning, only the shell of the 10,000-square-foot stucco-and-tile  building remained. The roof had caved in and burned. The interior of the store  was heap of blackened rubble.  </P> <P> Richard Guest, owner of the nearby The Guest Gallery store, said he arrived at  the scene about 10 p.m. Tuesday, at the height of the fire.  </P> <P> "It was a picture of hell, that's what it was," said Guest. "It was an  inferno."  </P> <P> Guest's store sustained extensive smoke and water damage. He was carrying out  damaged paintings on Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> "This is the second time I've had a fire damage my store," he said. "There was  a fire in my store about 15 years ago, and I had bad losses then, but this  damage this time is worse."  </P> <P> Dumas estimated total damage to the drugstore and adjacent stores at between  $1.5 million and $2 million, of which $750,000 was in damaged merchandise and  other contents.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 19, BNS -- The Lithuanian Union of  Peasants, which resumed its activities in 1990 after a 50-year  break, was reorganized into a political party at the union's  congress last weekend.    The union said "neither the leftists nor the rightists care  about peasants in Lithuania, therefore there is nothing left to  do but to unite ourselves into a party."    The new party's principal aims will be to implement the land  reform and the law on cooperatives.    During its congress, the union sharply criticized the  previous parliament for its "ruinous" land policy and the  present government for reducing import tariffs on agricultural  production. The union qualified such measures as "the  government's direct aggression against local farmers."    The congress elected independent MP Albinas Vaismuzis to  head  the new party. Vaismuzis, who was elected in a single-mandate  district, said his party's orientation is "to the left of the  center."</p>

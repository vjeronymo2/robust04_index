			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / China-UK rift cuts HK share prices Share prices in Hong Kong fell sharply yesterday as investors reacted to the apparent breakdown in Anglo-Chinese co-operation over the territory's political future. Hong Kong's politicians called on Governor Chris Patten to give a full account of the talks when he appears before the Legislative Council (LegCo) on Thursday. The Hang Seng index, the blue chip barometer of investor confidence, ended down 261.65 points, or 2.82 per cent, at 9,012.77. Traders attributed the fall to concerns about an aggressive reaction by China, as Mr Patten proceeds toward tabling his democracy legislation without Beijing's consent. However, they said that unless China was prepared to sacrifice Hong Kong's economic well-being for political gains, other factors would prove more important. Mr Adrian Faure, head of research at Baring Securities, said: 'There are two things that matter: interest rates and the Chinese economy. The rest of it is largely irrelevant.' Mr Richard Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie, a local brokerage, said: 'It doesn't really matter what Mr Patten does; it is how China reacts to it.' Exactly a year ago, China first threatened to damage Hong Kong's economy in retaliation for Mr Patten publicising his democracy plans. It questioned the Hong Kong government's right to develop the colony's next container terminal  -the contract is still a matter of dispute. Beijing limited itself to blaming Britain for the lack of progress in the 17th round of talks, which ended in the Chinese capital on Saturday. Britain offered an 18th round of talks but the two sides did not set a date. Mr Jimmy McGregor, an elected member of LegCo, yesterday urged Mr Patten to push ahead with the first stage of his legislative programme. After these measures have been passed he should then seek to engage Beijing in talks about the more difficult issues dividing the two, he said. Mr Tam Yiu-chung, a pro-Beijing legislator, said it was worrying that the UK and China had not given a date for future talks. He said if Mr Patten decided to table his reform bill, the talks would break down irrevocably. Peter Wise adds from Lisbon: China said yesterday Britain was entirely to blame for the breakdown in talks. Mr Wu Jianmin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Beijing was deeply disappointed by the collapse of the 17th round of negotiations and that 'the responsibility lies solely with the British side,' but declined to elaborate. Mr Wu was speaking during a state visit to Portugal by Chinese President Jiang Zemin for talks on the transfer of Macao to Chinese rule two years after Beijing takes over Hong Kong in 1997. No difficulties had been raised over the transfer of Macao and good relations between the two would ensure the territories' prosperity and stability, he said.</p>

He made the statement in response to a call of the Young  Officers Union (YOU) to the new graduates of the Philippine  Military Academy (PMA) to pursue their goals of initiating  reforms within the military establishment.    De Villa was the guest of honor at the parade and review and  awarding ceremonies of PMA's Bantay Lakas [Watch Force] class.  The graduation ceremonies will be held Sunday with President  Ramos as guest.    The 224 graduating cadets include De Villa's son Patrick.    De Villa said he has brought to the attention of the  government negotiating panel headed by Professor Alfredo Tadiar  recent propaganda tactics of the Nationalist Revolutionary  Alliance [as published] and YOU which he said sow confusion in  the peace process.    He said he has also asked the government panel to ascertain  if statements purportedly released by the group of former Lt.  Col. Gregorio Honasan were genuine and authentic. [passage  omitted]</p>

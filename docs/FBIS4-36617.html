			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "After the Revolution"] </F>   [Text] The government logged a political achievement in  its agreement with Jordan. Even the opposition did not find  fault in it. If the prime minister's meeting with the Jordanian  monarch gave birth to an agreement to conduct further  negotiations in Elat and al-'Aqabah instead of Washington; and  if there will now be deliberations on demarcation of borders and  jointly combating terrorism, as well as the distribution of  water resources, this will mark important progress. Even if in  practice most of those components already exist, formalizing  them in a joint, official, and signed document is significant.    Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres, who were weaned on the  Hashemite theory in Israeli foreign policy, remain loyal to it  despite the historic breakthrough they made in the dialogue with  the PLO. They feel they have achieved a great deal up to now,  but they appear to be depending on King Husayn to reach another  bilateral agreement with them, which would lead to full peace.  If that is the case, they will be disappointed.    In November 1993, Peres returned from extensive discussions  with King Husayn in Amman. They agreed on a far-reaching  document. The king did not want to leave the ceremony to his  brother, the crown prince. He insisted on including his  signature on the agreement. After that, Peres pursued him like a  groom chasing after a reluctant bride, and repeatedly heard from  the monarch that the wedding ceremony would be held "in the  spring" and then "in the summer," and now the best we can hope  for from these warm ties is the fall and autumn leaves.    Why do Rabin and Peres believe that Husayn cannot trick them  a third time? Because there is a limit? Because one cannot go  on cheating forever? There are people who really do not dare  deceive and cheat, but there are leaders for whom the third time  is easier than the first. Husayn, who is ailing and left  yesterday for medical tests in the United States, is one of them.    The renewed clinging to Husayn is due to the political  weariness of the prime minister and foreign minister. Historian  Arnold Toynbee once explained that a leadership cannot carry out  two revolutions. It is possible that the gambit with the PLO  along the Oslo-Washington-Cairo axis was a revolution by Rabin  and Peres, or by one of them, and that they do not have any more  steam to continue on to other destinations. This fatigue also  explains their tortuous and bewildering stands about the  uncovering of the Jerusalem document following a thorough  parliamentary investigation by Dan Meridor and Ben Begin.    Under these conditions, Rabin and Peres do not have the  strength to race ahead to full autonomy as the stage before a  permanent solution. It is easier for them to hope that the  Palestinians will not manage to organize elections or uphold for  long the (so far successful) Gaza-Jericho agreement. In fact,  there is a new target date: By the 1996 Knesset elections,  Rabin and Peres want to make do with the early empowerment stage  on the West bank. That is much less ambitious than the year of  strategic decisionmaking they had earmarked for 1994.    The alternative to quickened negotiations with the  Palestinians is not pulling back to the granting of sewage,  education, transportation, and tourism rights to the residents  of Janin and Nabulus. Yasir 'Arafat received an undertaking to  hold serious negotiations and Israel has an interest in  fulfilling that promise. It would be wrong to treat subclauses,  in themselves sound, as an adequate alternative.    Rabin and Peres are not advancing the negotiations with  Hafiz  al-Asad. True, that is difficult. Al-Asad came under  constructive criticism in recent weeks. He is stubborn and  archaic, and immersed in a long gone world. His guests found  him worried that he will end up like Nicolae Ceaucescu, who  started by opening a narrow skylight to a new gust of wind and  was hurled away by a hurricane. For the first time, western  leaders refer to al-Asad as an "idiot."    Al-Asad wants the entire Golan Heights, and is even  including  al-Hammah, which did not belong to Syria prior to 1967. He is  demanding the demilitarization of the eastern Upper Galilee,  which will return Tel Hay to the days of Yosef Trumpeldor in  March 1920. His stubbornness over the time factor for the  withdrawal and the security arrangements are annoying.    Patience has so far characterized the Israeli position in  the  negotiations and it seems that it is being replaced by  desperation and preparations for a anemic scenario: to reach  the 1996 general elections with early empowerment in the pocket  and an advanced Israeli-Jordanian agreement.    That will not happen, and that cannot be all there is. If  the government focuses only on those two important but secondary  elements, Labor will move into the opposition benches. If the  idea is to disrupt the political settlement, then Israel has  better governments for the job.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The British United Nations commander in Bosnia  warned today that he was prepared to order fresh air strikes  against Bosnian Serb forces beseiging the Muslim enclave of  Gorazde if United Nations troops were put at risk.    But Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose said he hoped  yesterday's NATO air strike against Bosnian Serb positions round  Gorazde, a designated "safe haven," would not interfere with  efforts to bring peace to the war-torn country.    He said he did not want to over-dramatise the air strike.  But he warned: "If we find ourselves in a similar condition we  will have to take appropriate action."    The NATO air strikes were ordered under the authority of a  United Nations Security Council resolution after Bosnian Serb  forces ignored repeated warnings to halt an assault on Gorazde.    Sir Michael said: "I remain hopeful that what was a limited  military tactical action yesterday will not interfere with  something which is far more important -- bringing peace to  Bosnia-Herzegovina in toto."    But earlier on the same programme a spokesman for the  Bosnian  Serbs warned: "If the air strikes go on we are in a position of  war with the United Nations."    Sir Michael said the UN was a peace-keeping organisation.  Its troops were in Bosnia to help feed 2.7 million people in  conditions of war, and remained neutral, impartial and  non-combatant.    He went on: "But we have the right to self-defence if people  fire on us. I would use the best means available to preserve  the lives and limbs of my soldiers," he told the BBC Radio 4  programme Today. "If the best means available is air, then I  will use air, and that is what happened last night. But I do  not want to over-dramatise what happened last night. We were  acting in self-defence in support of UN Security Council  resolution 836.    "I very much hope that shelling will not start again. If we  find ourselves in a similar condition we will have to take  appropriate action."    He went on: "We have a peace process developing here. I  hope we can extend the peace process to the Bosnian Serb side.  We were close to it. We remain, I hope, close to it. We  should not allow a tactical situation of response by our troops  to abrade this peace process, which will bring peace throughout  Bosnia Herzogovina."    There were continuing discussions over the whole of last  week  on developing some peace process, and considerable progress was  made.    "I remain hopeful that what was a limited, military tactical  action yesterday will not interfere with something which is far  more important, bringing peace to Bosnia Herzegovina in toto."    Sir Michael added: "There is no shelling going on in Gorazde  at the moment according to my reports. Five minutes ago the  town was quiet I am delighted to say."    Two isolated shells fell in Gorazde during the night, he  said, but were not significant in terms of the overall situation  in the town.    Sir Michael said last night that he called in a strike by  two  American F-16s after a Serb tank started firing directly into  Gorazde.    Earlier, Bosnian Serb spokesman Jovan Zematica told the  Today  programme: "There was no shelling of the town of Gorazde before  or at the time of the air attack on Serb positions." Military  activity in the area was started by the Muslims, he claimed,  adding: ``We have every right to defend ourselves and to take  whatever military action we deem necessary to defend ourselves.    "If the United Nations acting from the air threaten Serbian  lives, the behaviour of our troops on the ground towards  UNPROFOR (UN peace-keeping) troops on the ground cannot any  longer be guaranteed. And if the air strikes go on we are in a  position of war with the United Nations."</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITIES CALLED KEY TO NEW O.C. GROWTH PLAN  </P> <P> The Orange County Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted a growth-management  plan Tuesday, but county officials said its effectiveness depends on cities  imposing similar mandates to ensure that development does not outpace needed  improvements in roads and other public facilities.  </P> <P> And some officials raised the specter of holding back revenues from a proposed  sales tax increase for transportation to any city that would not cooperate to  control growth.  </P> <P> "It is vital that cities in the county follow suit to strengthen our work on  the county level and make this document (the county's plan) really work," said  Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who last year appointed the 11-member citizens'  panel that drafted the county's growth-management strategy.  </P> <P> "It doesn't take a brilliant person to figure out that countywide solutions  need countywide participation," former Supervisor Bruce Nestande, who chaired  the citizens' committee, told the board Tuesday. "We don't have that right  now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jams to Affect Other Areas  </P> <P> He said all cities must adopt such a plan or traffic that jams one community  will back up into an adjacent area.  </P> <P> The growth-management plan, adopted on a 4-0 vote, divides the county's  unincorporated areas into five zones that will be closely monitored to ensure  that new development does not outpace needed improvements in roads, libraries,  flood control, and police and fire protection. Developers will be required to  pay for needed public facilities before their commercial and residential  projects are completed.  </P> <P> The plan comes in the wake of last June's $2-million election battle over  Measure A, the slow-growth ballot initiative rejected by voters, 56% to 44%.  But the plan does not apply to the county's 28 cities.  </P> <P> The only vehicle on the political horizon for persuading cities to cooperate  with the county's growth-management strategy is the threat to deny  county-controlled traffic improvement funds to the cities, county and building  industry officials said.  </P> <P> A proposal by a committee of the League of Cities' Orange County chapter calls  for withholding revenue from a planned countywide sales tax increase from any  city that failed to adopt specific growth-management policies, including strict  traffic-flow standards at intersections.  </P> <P> The committee is led by Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young and Huntington Beach  City Councilman John Erskine, who also is executive director of the Orange  County Building Industry Assn., a politically influential group of builders and  developers who generally favor adoption of a local sales tax to fund new  highways.  </P> <P> Nestande said the best way to get the cities to follow the county's lead is to  tie revenues from the proposed half-cent sales tax to approval of  growth-management plans.  </P> <P> Such a move, Nestande said, would be a "test for those who really want good  growth management in this county and really want to do away with the  inconveniences and congestion they deplore. If they want it, they'll support  this half-cent measure."  </P> <P> Nestande was referring in part to slow-growth advocates who in June, 1984, led  the successful effort to defeat a 1-cent countywide sales tax increase intended  to help fund transportation projects, and partly to cities that have talked  about growth management but have done little about it.  </P> <P> As an example, Nestande cited Irvine, which has several badly congested  intersections that could back traffic up into adjacent unincorporated areas if  Irvine fails to adopt growth-management strategy consistent with the county's  effort.  </P> <P> Nestande has advocated placing a sales tax before voters as often as necessary  until it passes.  </P> <P> The Orange County Transportation Commission has developed a 20-year,  $11.6-billion spending plan based on a state law that requires such a plan  before submitting a sales tax measure to the voters.  </P> <P> The spending plan focuses on completion of the massive Santa Ana  Freeway-widening project, new car-pool lanes on existing freeways, and the  initiation of new commuter rail services between Riverside and Irvine and  between Los Angeles and several stops in Orange County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contra Costa Plan  </P> <P> The spending plan and sales tax effort are being modeled after a similar  package approved by Contra Costa County voters last November.  </P> <P> But county supervisors have not yet approved plans for a sales tax election,  fearing a repeat of June, 1984, when county voters rejected the 1-cent sales  tax proposal by a 2-1 margin.  </P> <P> The growth-management requirements proposed for cities as part of the sales tax  effort will not come before the League of Cities' general membership until  April 20, and League Executive Director Bob Dunek said that some cities, such  as Fullerton, have indicated objections. He said he has asked the cities to  explain whatever reservations they have before the April meeting.  </P> <P> "I suspect that some cities are concerned about how this will affect  redevelopment areas, in which they're trying to attract new development," Dunek  said.  </P> <P> Both Young and Erskine were unavailable for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation  Commission, has indicated he will support the growth-management language  proposed by the league's subcommittee.  </P> <P> Oftelie contends that the county's approach in dealing with cities is generally  less punitive than has been the case elsewhere.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County, for example, recently adopted rules that deny  road-improvement funds to cities that fail to synchronize traffic signals.  </P> <P> "In Orange County, we give the cities some money to synchronize the signals,  then we see if they do other things we have asked of them as well. We think our  way is better," he said.  </P> <P> But Oftelie acknowledged recently that the current policy has not prevented  hundreds of instances in which the cities have failed to comply with the  county's Master Plan for Arterial Highways, a document that is supposed to  guide all road work.  </P> <P> "Enforcement of the Master Plan has been in shambles for years," said Tom  Matthews, an aide to Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who has  persuaded some developers to pay for road work intended to fill gaps in major  arterials in his district.  </P> <P> And so part of the current debate among county officials concerns who should  enforce the Master Plan -- Oftelie and his agency, the county Environmental  Mangement Agency, which currently handles the task, or some new agency yet to  be created.  </P></p>

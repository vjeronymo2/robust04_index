			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Despite the yen's rise since  early last year, prices of many domestic products have not seen  much of a decline, in contrast with a fall in yen-based import  prices of comparable products, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC)  said Friday [8 April].    The commission conducted a survey on the effects of the  yen's  appreciation on prices of products from the angle of market  structure, comparing wholesale prices of 45 items last December  with year-earlier levels.    The 45 items surveyed were limited to those covered by both  the import price index and domestic wholesale price index.    A considerable fall was noted in prices, in yen terms, of  imported cigarettes, pig iron, motors and farm tractors, but  wholesale prices of comparable domestic products rose, the  survey said.    Wholesale prices of 19 items in which foreign access to the  markets is limited -- such as beer, whisky, brandy and cheese --  posted almost no decline, compared with an appreciable fall in  yen- based import prices of comparable foreign products, it said.    The survey said that in the case of 15 of the 23 items, the  Japanese market is in an oligopolistic state with the combined  market share of the top three makers reaching 60 percent or  above.    Like monopoly, oligopoly tends to stem a fall in market  prices.    The more imported raw and semifinished materials are used,  the more the prices of products using those materials will fall  if there are no factors limiting competition, the survey said.    It said the more oligopolistic the market is, the less  tendency there will be for lower prices.</p>

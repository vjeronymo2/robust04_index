			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Arts: Homegrown stars - Proms THERE ARE not many visiting international orchestras available to the Proms this year, but that matters less than it did. British audiences are being persuaded to accept that homegrown celebrity orchestras are in season from July to September as well. The reception given to the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra clearly accorded it celebrity status, which it has won in its own way. Whereas the top Austrian and German orchestras want to play the music for which centuries of tradition have made them the world's finest exponents, British orchestras claim no exclusive territory. Their specialism is diversity itself - the music of all periods, of all nations. Arriving a week after the Leipzig Gewandhaus, Simon Rattle and the CBSO chose their ground well. In a straight fight over the German classics they would surely lose a bloody battle. The Birmingham orchestra's sound is not as refined, its ear for balance nothing like as acute. But its two concerts had impact, as a result of the vivid clash of musical styles. On Monday, BBC2 viewers probably tuned in to see Maurizio Pollini play Mozart's C Minor Piano Concerto, K491. It would be interesting to know how the performance came across on television. In the hall, Pollini played inwardly, often not trying to dominate, sometimes unhelpfully obscured. One sensed that his classical integrity was being questioned by a subversive orchestra, always trying to draw from him statements more passionate than he wanted to give. The orchestral sound there lacked bite; surprising, when the musicians sank their teeth so incisively into Schoenberg's First Chamber Symphony and Stravinsky's Pulcinella. Rattle took the Stravinsky rather doggedly, but brought it closer to the vulgar Neapolitan street theatre than I have heard before. Horns that swaggered, lumbering basses, a trombone that blew the rudest of raspberries - every instrument played a new character in the commedia dell'arte. The Tuesday concert journeyed to Scandinavia, but with a couple of surprising detours, perhaps to lighten the mood. Rattle's performance of the Sibelius Violin Concerto with Ida Haendel was gloomy, on the heavy side. His account of Nielsen's Fifth Symphony was more impressive by far, summoning from its depths climaxes of formidable power. There was no logic to including Debussy's Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune and the short, pithy, sardonic Ciaconna sinfonica by Berthold Goldschmidt; only a desire for adventure. The ominous goose-step that stamps across the latter leaves little doubt as to its date of composition: the 1930s, when its Jewish composer was forced to leave his native Germany. Growing interest in the music of that era means we shall soon be hearing more of Goldschmidt (90 this year, but still sprightly). Typical of Rattle to bring him to the Proms.</p>

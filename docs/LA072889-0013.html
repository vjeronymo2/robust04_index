			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TWO YOUTHS ARRESTED IN BASEBALL-BAT ATTACK ON 9-YEAR-OLD BICYCLIST  </P> <P> San Diego police arrested two youths on suspicion of attempted murder Thursday  night in connection with a brutal attack on a 9-year-old boy who had been  riding a bicycle.  </P> <P> The two boys, 16 and 17, were being held in Juvenile Hall, San Diego Police Lt.  George Saldamando said.  </P> <P> Joshua Garrett was struck in the head Wednesday with a baseball bat by someone  in a passing car. He was in serious condition but improving Thursday,  Children's Hospital officials said.  </P> <P> The arrests were made after another 16-year-old turned himself in to Chula  Vista police about 4 p.m. Thursday, Saldamando said. San Diego police were  notified, and the youth gave detectives the identities and addresses of the  other two.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'He Felt Real Bad About What Happened  </P> <P> "He felt real bad about what happened and said he had no knowledge about what  the other two were going to do," Saldamando said. The youth was in the back  seat of the car when the 17-year-old said that "he felt like hitting someone,"  Saldamando said.  </P> <P> As the car the youths were riding in pulled up beside Joshua, the 17-year-old,  who was seated on the passenger side, struck the boy, Saldamando said.  </P> <P> "It was an isolated, vicious attack," Saldamando said, adding that the attack  was not believed to be gang-related.  </P> <P> The three youths all live in the South Bay, he said. San Diego police arrested  the two boys without incident at the home of the driver of the vehicle. The boy  who turned himself in was not arrested and was released to the custody of his  parents, Saldamando said.  </P> <P> The victim's mother, Theresa Garrett, and other relatives kept an all-night  vigil Wednesday night at the boy's bedside at Children's Hospital, which first  had listed him in critical condition.  </P> <P> When the boy regained consciousness early Thursday morning, Joshua "asked for  water and a $1 bill" that had been in his pocket at the time of the attack,  Garrett said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Victim Awoke and Asked, 'Where's My Dollar?'  </P> <P> "I was so happy. He knew who I was," she said. "He looked much better. All he  kept asking about was 'Where's my dollar?"'  </P> <P> Joshua suffered a skull fracture, concussion and internal bleeding, hospital  spokesman Mark Morelli said. It will be a few days before physicians know  whether Joshua suffered brain damage, Morelli said.  </P> <P> Police had not yet questioned the boy about the attack, Garrett said.  </P> <P> Joshua had been in a coma since being taken to the hospital by Life Flight  helicopter Wednesday afternoon, Morelli said. He carried no identification,  police said.  </P> <P> Ann Maddox, a retired nurse, found the boy lying in a ditch in front of her  house in the 1600 block of Hollister Street, across from Southwest High School.  Maddox had been alerted by two other boys about 12:35 p.m.  </P> <P> Joshua "had a knot the size of a fist" on the back of his head and was bleeding  from the mouth, Maddox said.  </P> <P> "I tried to talk to him, but he wasn't consciously aware of what was going on  around him," Maddox said. "I just tried to keep him from going into shock."  </P> <P> After Joshua was taken to the hospital, Maddox was walking her dog about 4:35  p.m. when she ran into Garrett, whom she did not previously know and who was  looking for Joshua.  </P> <P> Maddox described the boy and the bicycle to her, noting Joshua's "unusual  flattop haircut." A neighbor had kept the boy's bicycle and belongings.  </P> <P> Maddox "showed me the bike and his shirt, and I couldn't believe it. I still  can't," Garrett said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mother Has Considered Moving Out of District  </P> <P> Garrett, who also lives on Hollister Street a few blocks from where Joshua was  found, said she had considered moving out of the area before the attack because  of concerns for the safety of her children.  </P> <P> Joshua, a fifth-grader at Harbor View Elementary School, is the second of  Garrett's three children. Garrett said there is substantial gang activity in  the neighborhood, which is near Nestor.  </P> <P> "This has just got to stop," she said. "It don't make no sense. I don't know  why they (would) be doing something like this, I just don't know."  </P></p>

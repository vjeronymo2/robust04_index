			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Wales 'expects to accelerate away from recession' BUSINESS CONFIDENCE in Wales, encouraged by rising new orders, has shown the strongest increase since the CBI Welsh industrial trends survey started in 1978. The CBI says the recession in Wales may be over. 'The indications are that Wales may in fact be somewhat ahead of the UK as a whole.' The positive balance of 35 per cent of Welsh companies which are more optimistic this quarter compares with 22 per cent in the previous quarter. The CBI says that much of the improvement in orders, has come from exports but there has also been a marked increase in domestic orders. The positive balance of 30 per cent of companies reporting overall higher orders is the highest for five years. There was a positive balance of 26 per cent of Welsh companies reporting higher output, the largest increase since July 1988 and an improvement not seen in the UK as a whole. There is also more optimism on employment. A small positive balance of 6 per cent of Welsh manufacturers reported that employment levels had increased over the last quarter. Greater increases in employment are expected over the next four months, although the CBI gives a warning that these may not materialise because of the need to stay competitive. The CBI says a shortage of internal finance is now the most significant factor limiting capital expenditure authorisations over the next 12 months and 48 per cent of Welsh companies mentioned this. Sir Peter Phillips, chairman of the CBI Wales industrial trends panel, said the survey suggested 'Wales manufacturing has at last turned the corner and expects to accelerate away from recession'.</p>

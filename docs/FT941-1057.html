			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / This is Germany calling . . .: How former rival radio stations are struggling to work together in unified Germany Once they were the big guns in the front line of the cold war, hurling salvoes of propaganda into the airwaves across the east-west divide. Now, 4 1/2 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, broadcasters from the two big radio stations, which fought for the hearts and minds of Germans across the divided city, are supposed to be on the same side. But the old antagonism dies hard, and their recent struggles show some of the difficulties of integrating the former East and West Germanys. During the cold war, Berlin was at the centre of the battle of the airwaves between the two great powers. The US established Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, with headquarters in in Munich, Bavaria, to beam news, current affairs and music across the Iron Curtain. The Soviet Union retaliated with dozens of propaganda language services. After years of heated debate about the future of these relics of the cold war, a national radio station has been created in Cologne, the first in Germany since the second world war. It began broadcasting on new year's day. But even if the new Deutschland Radio, is national, it certainly has not achieved unity among the broadcasting staff of formerly warring stations. Deutschland Radio was intended to combine three radio stations with extremely different histories: Rias (Radio in the American Sector), based in west Berlin; DS Kultur, set up in east Berlin after the dismantling of the Wall; and Deutschlandfunk, set up by the Bonn government in Cologne during the years of a divided Germany. In cold-war Berlin there were two radio stations: Rias in the west, and Stimme der DDR, Voice of the German Democratic Republic. They broadcasted every minute of the day from opposite sides of the Wall. Stimme der DDR tried to monopolise the airwaves throughout eastern Germany, while across Berlin the US-backed Rias station kept alive the hopes of reunification with powerful transmitters, among west and east Berliners. But the night in November 1989, when at last the Wall came down, was not just a glorious victory for the ideology of Rias, it also removed the main reason for the station's existence. Siegfried Buschschluter, director of programmes at Rias since 1988, said his station was deluged with letters from listeners in eastern Germany, able at last to communicate without fear of interception by the Stasi, the East German A few miles away the same event brought a bewildering sense of disorientation for staff in the East German station. Stimme der DDR was losing its voice. 'The events were overwhelming. What could we do?' said Monika Kunzl, who for five years had worked at Stimme's radio drama department. She said that between November and mid-1990, Stimme's headquarters underwent its own revolution: the long, wide corridors echoed to the sound of people rushing 'to create a new, democratic radio station for the people of eastern Germany'. Scores of producers, technicians and staff left, aware that their Stasi past would catch up with them. Those who remained broke up the old broadcasting structure and set up four new stations. Only one survived: Deutschlandsender Kultur, or DS Kultur. 'It was a time of traumatic change, but also a time of genuine democracy for us when we formally set up DS Kultur in June 1990,' explained Kunzl, who was elected by the staff as the station's first director. 'We had to adapt to so much. Finding money. Coping with a new system. Getting the right to broadcast. Understanding new laws, and above all, addressing the impact of unification on our lives. We wanted DS Kultur to be the new voice for the eastern Germans, to reflect this sense of incredible change.' The station, with its staff of 169, organised the network in such a way that its audience of 60,000 - mostly east Berliners - would have classical music 24 hours a day interspersed with documentaries and discussions focusing on the problems thrown up by unification. But its days were numbered. Buschschluter said: 'There was little chance that DS Kultur would survive as a separate station because of the Staatsvertrag, or state treaty, which said the former east German radio stations and televisions would have to be dissolved. 'However, the prime ministers from all 16 states decided to set up a new radio station which would replace Rias and DS Kultur. After all, both stations had lost their raison d'etre,' he said. Deutschlandfunk and Rias, on the other hand, had much in common. They shared the same aim of keeping alive the possibility of unification of the Germanys; both stations were financed by the state - with Rias receiving some support from the US; but each had a different audience. Rias homed in on Berlin and other parts of eastern Germany; Deutschlandfunk captured parts of western and southern eastern Germany. And so, on new year's day, Deutschland Radio, an amalgam of Rias, DS Kultur and Deutschlandfunk, began broadcasting with a DM300m (Pounds 117m) annual budget financed through a public licence fee of 75 pfennigs (35p) a month. But already programme makers in Cologne's Deutschlandfunk are unhappy. They say they can work with Rias, but not with the DS Kultur programme, which they accuse of elitism. The Cologne station has also refused to use Deutschland Radio as its new signature title and has declined to take staff from Berlin to ease the integration of westerners and easterners and to promote a genuine national broadcasting service. Dettmar Cramer, programme director of Deutschlandfunk, says the Berliners do not want to move: 'It's that typical attitude of the Berliners, complaining that Cologne is too far. Only three of the DS Kultur people have joined us.' Buschschluter hits back by saying: 'Cologne has not opened it doors to Rias or to the people from DS Kultur. Cologne has made no compromises. They act as if nothing has changed since unification. 'It reflects the attitude from Bonn/Cologne about moving the government to Berlin. These people do not want any change. It wants to preserve the status quo ante-1989.' The listeners are disorientated too: in the mornings, they hear Rias's old programme - news and current affairs, along with easy-listening music - and in the early afternoon, DS Kultur, a classical station, takes over. Despite the bickering, which barely conceals the tensions of unification, Buschschluter and Kunzl recognise that the real issue is listeners. 'We have to integrate the two Berlin stations and hold on to our listeners,' said Buschschluter. 'We have to make this new station work on a truly national basis,' he added. 'Here is a chance to make something new, and truly united with easterners and westerners pulling together to make this national network succeed,' said Kunzl. 'It means we will all have to integrate, even though the easterners might feel they have lost their voice in the process.'</p>

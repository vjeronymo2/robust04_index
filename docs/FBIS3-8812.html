			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Right Wing Wants To </F> Publish Its Own Paper; In A Few Days, NOWE PANSTWO"]    [Text] Rightist coalitions that have been established in  recent months want to publish papers that would represent their  policy. In several days, the first issue of NOWE PANSTWO [NEW  STATE] will come out; it will be a paper related to the alliance  of Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Wieslaw Chrzanowski.    NOWE PANSTWO appeared last year (also during the election  campaign); there were 10 issues, with a circulation of 3,000  copies, which were internal leaflets of the Center Alliance [PC]  published by the office of PC Vice President Adam Lipinski.  Lipinski is also the organizer and editor in chief of the new  publication.    The first issue, which will appear in several days, will  consist of 16 pages; its format will resemble that of GAZETA  WYBORCZA, and it will cost 6,000 zlotys. "We imposed a very  strict financial discipline; we prepared this issue along with  several people from beginning to end," says Adam Lipinski. The  publisher of the paper was supposed to be the "New State"  Foundation; however, the court of law refused to register it,  and it has been for the time being registered as a noncommercial  partnership.    NOWE PANSTWO has, for the time being at least, decided not  to  use the distribution services of "Ruch." Representatives of the  editing team claim that it is too expensive. Lipinski's paper  will be distributed by private companies, rightist parties, and  Solidarity.    The subtitle of NOWE PANSTWO reads: "To the right of the  center." This paper is not directly linked to the bloc of the  Christian-National Union, teh PC, Movement for the Republic,  Peasant Accord, and the Conservative Coalition [KK]. The first  issue has been prepared, among others, by the leaders of the  Union for Real Politics [UPR] such as Stanislaw Michalkiewicz,  Rafal Ziemkiewicz, and Tomasz Gabis; Ludwik Dorn of the PC;  Marek Budzisz of the KK, as well as people related to such  papers as ARKA, DEBATA, and SPOTKANIA. The main subject of the  first--strictly political--issue is a debate on what is the real  right wing; however, the paper also wants to inform readers  about cultural issues and comment on current events. "It is  easiest to obtain political material," admits Adam Lipinski. In  the beginning, NOWE PANSTWO will appear irregularly, and after a  few months it is supposed to become a weekly. The organizers  are for the time being not even dreaming of turning the paper  into a daily, even though they do not rule out such a  possibility in a more remote future.    Also, the Agreement of 11 November, which consists of the  UPR, the Christian-Democratic Party [PChD], the Conservative  Party, and the Peasant-Christian Party, would like to start a  publication "close" to this alliance. Primarily, politicians of  smaller parties are making efforts to achieve that because the  UPR already has at its disposal NAJWYZSZY CZAS, which is quite  an influential paper, coming out twice a week (also as NAJWYZSZY  CZAS-BIS). PChD leader Pawel Laczkowski recently announced that  such a paper will be established; so far, however, this has  remained up in the air--it is still not known where the money  for financing such an initiative should be taken from.</p>

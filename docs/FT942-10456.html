			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Strasbourg awaits a change of guard Strasbourg airport at dawn is a desolate place at the best of times. But for many Euro-MPs, flying out early last Thursday from the final plenary session of the European parliament before next month's Euro-elections, this is not the best of times. The forlorn expressions on some MEPs' faces bore eloquent testimony to widespread predictions that between half and two-thirds of them are not coming back. When the Parliament reassembles in July - as 567 members rather than 518 now, to reflect adjustments triggered by German unification - there will be a lot of new MEPs. Less clear is how much of the 1994-99 intake will represent genuine new blood. Party barons in Strasbourg say there has been more intense competition for Euro-seats than at any time since the parliament became a directly-elected body in 1979. But they acknowledge that, as in the past, many new members will be refugees recycled from national politics, and some party lists will be headed by figures who have no intention of setting foot in the parliament, except to collect their credentials. In France, for instance, a host of former Socialist ministers have emerged at the top of two lists, one headed by by Mr Michel Rocard and Ms Elisabeth Guigou, and another non-aligned list led by businessman-politician Bernard Tapie and environmentalist Brice Lalonde. But this looks more like an attempt to salvage something from the wreckage of last year's Socialist defeat. In Italy, by contrast, where past list leaders such as the disgraced former Socialist prime minister, Mr Bettino Craxi, or the former Communist leader Achille Ochetto, hardly ever turned up, the victor of the March election, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is contemplating heading several lists for Strasbourg. It can be safely predicted that the new parliament will be more socialist in complexion and more German in accent. Germans will almost certainly lead the Christian Democrats and the Greens, and could lead the Socialists too. As witnessed in recent months, notably over ratification of EU enlargement, the Strasbourg assembly will also become more assertive of the new legislative rights it won through the Maastricht treaty. The Socialist Group, already a dominant force with 197 MEPs, is expected to gain beyond 220 members. Its main rival, the Christian Democrat European People's party group, is likely to see its representation fall from 162 now to about 150. In the outgoing parliament, the two big blocs collaborated closely, parcelled out the key positions, and even shared the presidency. The current incumbent, German Christian Democrat Egon Kelpsch, succeeded Spanish Socialist Enrique Baron halfway through the five-year term. But this bipartisan approach looks less assured with a probably larger and more cohesive Socialist bloc, and a more fragmented right. The main axis of the Socialist Group will be Anglo-German. The UK Labour party, already the largest national group at Strasbourg, with disproportionate influence, appears likely to win 60 or more seats from 46 now. With the increase in Germany's allocation from 81 to 99 seats, the SPD should get around 45. 'An Anglo-German deal in the Socialist Group is vital,' says one senior parliament official, not only for the cohesion of the Group, but for the smooth running of the assembly. The leadership of the socialist bloc is the single most influential position at Strasbourg, and both Labour's Pauline Green and the SPD's Klaus Hansch want it. A possible compromise might see the job go to Ms Guigou, European affairs minister in the last French Socialist government. The group leaders as a whole - assembled as the Conference of Chairmen  - have become the driving force of the parliament, with increasingly professional staff, and a cadre of experienced rapporteurs to steer legislation. But the other great prizes are the chairmanships of the most important committees. Parliament has the right to veto most legislation passed in Council by qualified majority vote, and to reject the new European Commission due to take over next year. The ability to turn these blocking powers into legislative influence will depend on the skills of committee chairmen and secretariats and on the apparats of the political groups. Bodies such as the parliament environment committee, headed by UK Labour MEP Ken Collins, already wield real legislative influence, and are among the most heavily lobbied units in the EU power structure. The struggle to control them will be fierce, but the parliament as a whole is beginning to set store by having experienced people in charge of them. As a condition for approving entry for new members Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway, the parliament has won political pledges that MEPs will have a voice in the 1996 review of EU power-sharing. As a body, Strasbourg is moving closer to the centre of EU decision-making. If all four applicants join next year, increasing the parliament's size to 639 members, MEPs may even get their wish to move to Brussels, the seat of EU power. France has persuaded its partners to make Strasbourg the assembly's permanent seat, but the existing parliament building there is too small. Building work on a new chamber in Strasbourg has started, but parliament has alsoacquired a huge building in Brussels that could fit in everyone - an environment of vaulted prominence matching the assembly's new ambitions.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT  ------------------------------------------------------------------- The parliament can:  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Amend or veto most European measures passed by qualified majority voting, including single market laws, consumer protection, regional development, R &amp; D. reject the Commission's draft budget and ask for it to be revised help decide share-out of EU regional funds help determine future Commission through end-of-year approval dismiss entire Commmission with censure motion.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- It cannot  ------------------------------------------------------------------- initiate legislation dismiss individual Commission members decide EU revenues  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

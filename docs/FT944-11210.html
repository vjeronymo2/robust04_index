			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (23): Market revival measures in China Rowing the boat out 1993: October 13: The Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZE) announced that the minimum time allowed between buying and selling B-shares would be reduced from three days to one day, as of 18 October, in order to stimulate market activity. Reportedly, from November 1, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHE) would allow investors to see B-shares on the same day they bought them. 1994: February 22: The SZE announced that new listings of A-shares on the SZE would be suspended until further notice. The suspension was lifted on April 6, apparently because the measure failed to help revive the market. March 12: Securities Supervisory Committee chairman Liu Hongru announced four measures, effective immediately, to revive the market: The issue of Rmb 5.5bn-worth of new shares planned for 1994 would be postponed until the second half of this year or early next year. No stock transaction tax would be levied for 1994 or 1995. State and legal person shares would not be listed on either stock exchange, and would not be merged with individual shares this year. Rights issues by listed companies would be strictly controlled. April 7, 25: Both the SZE and SHE reportedly set a target of USDollars 100m for this year's new B-share issues, the same as in 1993, in order to restore market confidence. May 13: The State Council Securities Committee announced that, with immediate effect, all companies preparing for listing on the SZE or SHE had to undergo six months' coaching by the relevant department before being listed. This was to enable companies to set up a system comparable to a share-holding company. The introduction of the new rule effectively postponed all new A-share listings planned for 1994 until next year. July 28: No more A-share issues in 1994. A-share issues in 1995 to be controlled tightly. New rules on placements. Domestic mutual funds to be encouraged. Sino-foreign investment trusts to be allowed. Credit to be made easier for securities companies.</p>

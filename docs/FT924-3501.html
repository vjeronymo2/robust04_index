			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Bentsen ready to confound the sceptics: Experienced legislator is likely to fill top Treasury post EVEN before Mr Bill Clinton won the US presidency some of his advisers made no bones of their belief that the next Treasury Secretary should be capable of reassuring even the most sceptical in the financial markets that the administration would give priority to economic and fiscal affairs. Although some backed Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, every shortlist included the name of Mr Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Senate finance committee and as heavyweight a legislator as any in Washington in the last generation. The announcement of his selection now appears imminent. To the wider public Mr Bentsen's reputation rests on one immortal sound bite. In 1988 he figuratively undressed Mr Dan Quayle in their televised vice-presidential candidate debate by interrupting his young opponent with the words: 'I knew Jack Kennedy and, senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.' In the nation's capital, however, Mr Bentsen, 71, has long been known as a man to be reckoned with. He arrived after beating an up-and-coming Republican, George Bush, in the 1970 Texas Senate race. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, emerged unscathed from his performance in 1988 as Mr Michael Dukakis's running mate and was still mentioned this spring as a compromise candidate should Mr Clinton falter. The Bentsen record in Congress is substantive, especially in the last six years as finance committee chairman. He may not be the 'new kind of Democrat' Mr Clinton promised to bring into power, but no legislator knows more about the budget and taxation. Like the president-elect, Mr Bentsen is a non-doctrinaire conservative on fiscal matters. He has always favoured business-related tax breaks, logically given his connections to the Texas oil and gas industry, but he was an architect of the 1990 Budget Act which produced the tax increase that, in the end, helped undo President Bush. He also had a reputation as a closet protectionist. In 1988 he spoke of the need for a new relationship with Japan which might take away some of its competitive advantages. If elected vice-president, he told the Financial Times that year: 'I would not consider it beneath my office to push US products abroad.' But he has been a careful supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is popular in Texas, although sceptical of the fast-track authority under which it was negotiated. He has long fought for personal pensions, known as individual retirement accounts (IRAs), on the grounds that they offer the most workable solution to the country's savings shortfall. His proposal to extend IRAs to the 55 per cent of two-income families currently ineligible fell victim to Mr Bush's veto of the urban aid bill in October. Still unanswered is why Mr Bentsen should want to sacrifice being a grand panjandrum on Capitol Hill, particularly if it means, as Governor Ann Richards of Texas has warned, the loss of his Democratic Senate seat. Perhaps he was persuaded by the arguments that only he could break the gridlock between the executive and legislative branches. This must have been Mr Clinton's pitch, as it was from another old Texas friend, Mr Robert Strauss, now returned to Washington from the US Embassy in Moscow. They are a persuasive pair.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL AND THE PLO  </P> <P> It strikes me that Rabbis Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper have somehow lost  touch with reality in their column "U.S. Should Urge Arabs to Reverse 1975  Stand" (Op-Ed Page, March 7).  </P> <P> Once more, these hard-line Zionists are demanding another exercise in words  from Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat to rescind the  statement that "Zionism is racism." How many more "I yield" word games must the  Zionists demand of the Palestinians before they sit down and discuss peace with  them?  </P> <P> This hit home when I read "Arab Dies in Shin Bet Interrogation Cell" (Part I)  in the same issue, reporting yet another death by beating of a Palestinian  during a three-day interrogation he underwent by the Israeli Shin Bet security  services. This is simply one more in a series of beating, choking and  "mysterious" deaths of Palestinians under interrogation by the Shin Bet to be  added to a U.S. State Department assessment of Israeli human rights violations  against Palestinians.  </P> <P> Jews were beaten, tortured and gassed to death by Nazis simply because they  were Jews. Blacks are beaten, shot and tortured to death by whites in South  Africa simply because they are black. Palestinians are beaten, tortured and  tear-gassed and shot to death by Zionist Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza  simply because they are Palestinian Arabs.  </P> <P> All three sound like racism to me. What is the exception, Rabbis Hier and  Cooper?  </P> <P> PAT McDONNELL TWAIR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WILCOX GAINS SUPPORT IN ASSEMBLY RACE  </P> <P> Republican State Assembly candidate Rob Wilcox gained several endorsements  Wednesday, including those of Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and  the Los Angeles Police Protective League.  </P> <P> In a statement released by Wilcox, who is an aide to retiring Assemblywoman  Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), Bernardi described Wilcox as "a  knowledgeable, experienced, energetic leader."  </P> <P> Frank Grimes, vice president of the union that represents Los Angeles police  officers, said the group made its endorsement after meeting with Wilcox and his  chief opponent in the June 5 Republican primary, Granada Hills businesswoman  Paula Boland.  </P> <P> The police union decided to endorse Wilcox because of his support of additional  prison construction, Grimes said. He said the union preferred this over  Boland's position, which blamed the Legislature for not passing laws to toughen  criminal sentencing.  </P> <P> Wilcox also received the endorsement of the California Young Republicans, the  California Republican League and the California League of Conservation Voters,  the candidate announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Carlos Rodriguez, a campaign strategist for Boland, said she has been endorsed  by Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson and Los Angeles County supervisors  Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich.  </P></p>

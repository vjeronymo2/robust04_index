			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN TO MEET WITH NEIGHBORS OF NURSERY  </P> <P> City Councilman Les Robbins plans to meet with Stevely Avenue residents in east  Long Beach this weekend to air complaints of pesticide over-spraying, dust and  other problems associated with a large commercial nursery operation.  </P> <P> Robbins delayed for two weeks a move to ask the City Council to send a letter  to Sunrise Grower's landlord, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,  asking for their removal from the power line right of way near Carson Street.  </P> <P> The growers maintain that their operations are perfectly legal, a contention  supported by Los Angeles County health and agricultural officials. But Robbins  said that residents want the operation removed because it is near their back  yards.  </P></p>

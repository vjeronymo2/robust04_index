			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Gallery headhunting AWAITING confirmation on the prime minister's desk is the name of the next director of London's National Portrait Gallery. Rumour has it that the NPG's trustees, headed by Henry Keswick of Jardine Matheson, have selected Charles Saumarez Smith of the Victoria and Albert Museum. He replaces retiring director John Hayes. Gossip columns claimed yesterday that waves of protest and indignation were sweeping the London art world. What has actually happened is that supporters of the defeated candidate, long-serving deputy director Malcolm Rogers, have been venting their spleen. They do so knowing that Whitehall's archaic rules governing public appointments mean that, until Number 10 pronounces, the museum, trustees, and the victorious candidate, are gagged. Why is there such media interest in the directorship of a popular but second-rank museum? The fond hope is that Saumarez Smith, a dome-headed, mild-mannered, architectural historian, may provide juicy controversy of the kind that followed the appointment of his present boss, Elizabeth Esteve-Coll to the V&amp;A in 1988. The following year, eight senior curators were sacked, the museum's structure was reorganised, and voluntary charges were introduced. A lingering effect of the great V&amp;A scandal is that museum people have developed a taste for press exposure which has earned them the reputation of the bitchiest profession. At 40, Saumarez Smith is part of the trend towards appointing scholars rather than curators, a move not surprisingly deplored by the conservative faction. However, the definition of what makes a suitable museum director has become much broader. Neil McGregor's appointment to the National Gallery, now seen as an inspired choice, was criticised because he had no museum experience but was an academic art-historian. In comparison, Saumarez Smith is distinctly less of a maverick after 11 years in the V&amp;A. It is hard to see any intellectual basis for the petty opposition to the NPG's choice. The study of portraiture has become much livelier since, under the influence of the 'new' art history, it moved away from traditional connoisseurship (asking who painted whom) and into the domain of social history. Saumarez Smith has written that museum scholarship should move out of its 'methodological backwater governed by empiricism', and embrace instead the new interest in the relationship of artefacts to the societies which produced them. It is hard to think of a better place than the NPG for this kind of 'new' - but actually, well-engrained - approach to be translated into exhibitions. Outsiders like the idea that the museum world is split between 'Thatcherites', men with clip-boards spouting management-talk, and old-fashioned scholar-curators. This is a ridiculous picture. No one now gets anywhere near the top without attending management courses. Everyone at the top realises that museums are part of the entertainment business, and that fund-raising is a sine qua non. It is doubtful whether there could again be such a furore as a new broom caused at the V&amp;A. Noises from the museum world suggest there is a merging of new and old attitudes, to challenge the crudity of the government thinking. Last month the V&amp;A, demonised as the test-case of a Thatcherised public collection, published an anonymous pamphlet. Directed at the government, it proclaims the essential part that research of all kinds, including pure research, has to play in the health of a museum. Its author is Saumarez Smith.</p>

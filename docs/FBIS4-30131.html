			<p>BFN     [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll on  18-19 June to investigate such data as trends in the rate of  public support for the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata. The results of the poll showed that the support rate for  the cabinet fell to 48.2 percent, a drop of 3 percentage points  over the previous month. This is the first time the cabinet  support rate has fallen below the 50-percent mark since the  formation of the coalition government last summer. The  percentage of poll respondents who said they did not support the  cabinet rose to 36.9 percent, a rise of 3 percentage points over  the previous month. Apparently, the fragility of the current  administration, which lacks stability in carrying out its  policies, has accounted for the drop in its support rate. For  example, 46 percent of non-supporters said they did not support  the administration because "it lacks stability." Although its  support rate is still high in comparison with those marked by  past administrations during the days of Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] rule, the Hata administration, which runs a minority  government, is expected to face a severe test in managing  government affairs as the current Diet session approaches its  final rounds. On the other hand, however, the support rate for  the LDP -- which has made firm its plan to submit a  no-confidence motion against the Hata administration and is  stepping up its moves toward overthrowing the administration --  dropped to 23.2 percent, the lowest support rate recorded ever  since the party was established. Thus, the party has so far  failed to gain public support for its strategies.    The support rate for the Hata administration was 51.6  percent  in a poll conducted last month immediately following the  inauguration of the administration. This is the fourth highest  in Japanese history among support rates marked by an  administration immediately after inauguration. Although the  latest support rate for the Hata administration dropped slightly  from last month, it is still higher than the highest support  rates marked by past LDP administrations under former Prime  Ministers Takeo Miki, Masayoshi Ohira, Hayato Ikeda, and Eisaku  Sato.    Among supporters of the Hata administration, 37 percent said  they supported the administration because "it is better than  past LDP administrations"; 32 percent said they supported it  because "it is likely to do something new"; and 28 percent said  they supported it because "it is eager to achieve political and  economic reform."    As reasons for their not supporting the Hata administration,  36 percent of the non-supporters cited a "lack of stability."  Another 36 percent said they did not support the  administration because "the prime minister does not have real  power." Still another 36 percent said they did not support the  administration because "it seems to be unable to get anything  done at all."    Among male respondents to the poll, 49 percent, or nearly  the  same percentage as last month, expressed support for the Hata  administration. However, the support rate among female  respondents fell to 47 percent, a drop in 6 percentage points  over last month. Among respondents in their 30's, 46 percent  expressed support for the Hata administration, while 43 percent  of those in their 40's expressed support. In either case, the  support rate dropped by a noticeable 7-8 percentage points over  the previous month.    Regarding support rates for political parties, 23 percent of  the respondents expressed support for the LDP, 11 percent for  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 9 percent for the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and 4 percent for the Japan  New Party [JNP]. For the last three months, the LDP's support  rate has increased slightly, but in the latest poll it dropped  by 3 percentage points over last month, falling below the  previous record low of 23.7 percent marked in a poll conducted  last February. The support rates for the SDPJ and the JNP  increased slightly, while that of Shinseito remained at the same  level as last month.</p>

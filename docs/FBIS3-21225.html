By  applying the technology on stainless steel, the group discovered  that surface modification by means of silver ion plating was the  most effective way to obtain an ultra-high vacuum material.    The technology involves irradiation of the surface of a  material with an ultra-high-speed molecular beam, which passes  through a rotating disk with slits and is cut into small  segments, and the detection and analysis of the scattered  molecular beams. This technology is suitable for composition  analysis of a material's surface in many fields, including  semiconductor surface analysis.    Ultraviolet, light-dissociated atomic oxygen exists more  than  100 km above the ground, and oxygen atoms are the main component  200-700 km above the ground. Thus, the materials used to  construct a space shuttle are exposed to these elements in space  and subjected to surface corrosion due to chemical reactions.  Also, the interference and adsorption of gaseous molecules on  vacuum container material surfaces have caused problems.    Many studies have been conducted to modify the surfaces of  vacuum materials, which have been evaluated by measuring the  quantities of gases emitted by the materials. In particular, for  the development of a new material, it is necessary to clearly  understand the behavior of gaseous molecules at the material's  surface. For this reason, Professor Fujimoto's group developed a  gaseous molecular beam method that enabled direct examination of  material surfaces.    The molecular beam used by the group involved two noble  gases, helium and argon. This molecular beam was irradiated  obliquely on the surface of a stainless steel piece, which is a  commonly used vacuum material, and the reflected molecular beams  were analyzed with a quadrupolar mass-spectroscopic analyzer.  From these data, the group clarified the correlations between  kinetic energy, surface temperature, incident angle and  reflection angle, and the group was able to confirm that the  superimposition of two spectra corresponding to the scattering  and the adsorption/desorption processes was effective for the  analysis of the spectra of reflected molecular beams.    As a result, the group concluded that ion plating was  necessary to reduce the adsorption of gas molecules on the  surface of stainless steel. The experiment was repeated with a  piece of silver ion-plated stainless steel, and it was proven  that the silver ion plating was an effective surface  modification technology in obtaining ultra-high vacuum. Various  ways to apply this technology are being examined to check  material surfaces contaminated by gas molecules. Separately from  this research project, Professor Fujimoto's group is in the  process of developing a laser technology for detecting dilute  gases.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- During the drafting of the  1994 budget the Russian Government chose an intermediate way  between a tough fiscal policy, which could help bring inflation  down to 5 per cent a month, but would be too painful, and the  policy of pumping money into the national economy, which could  lead to a 50 per cent inflation, Acting Minister of Finance  Sergey Dubinin said at the State Duma today, presenting the  draft law "On the Federal Budget for 1994". He said that budget  revenues were planned to reach 120.7 trillion roubles. The  deficit will be 62.4 trillion roubles and the spendings will  amount to 183.1 trillion.    Inflation continues to be "enemy No. 1", he continued. Now  it is planned to remain on the level of 10 per cent a month and  will be brought down to 7 per cent by the end of the year.  Budget deficit for 1994 is planned to be 8 to 9 per cent of the  gross domestic product. Part of the deficit -- about 6 per cent  of the gross domestic product -- will be covered with the help  of credits of the Central Bank.    Speaking about budget revenues, Dubinin pointed out that a  dramatic increase in tax collecting can hardly be expected.  Last year taxes accounted to 10 per cent of the gross domestic  product for the federal budget and 14 per cent for regional  budgets, while this year tax collecting is going to amount to 12  per cent of gross domestic product. The speaker stressed that  tough measures against tax evaders are expected to be taken.    There is one more complicated problem: In what way should  the  money, that came from privatization, be spent? The government  is facing a difficult choice: Should it channel the  privatization money to the federal budget, or should it leave it  with the enterprises, so that they will be able to invest it? A  final decision on that problem has not yet been taken.    According to Dubinin, discussion is going on over the  problem  of what part of the federal budget should be channelled to  subjects of the Federation. Now 22 per cent of the value added  tax will be spent for that purpose.    Speaking about the distribution of budget spendings, Dubinin  said that 48.5 trillion roubles would be spent on defence and  law-enforcement agencies, 48.1 trillion -- on state support for  individual branches of the national economy, 24.5 trillion -- on  assistance to the regions, 16.8 trillion -- on the federal debt  servicing and 12.2 trillion -- on social programmes.</p>

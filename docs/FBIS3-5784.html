			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jerry Esplanada] </F>   [Excerpt] Fort Del Pilar, Baguio City -- President Ramos  yesterday said rightist extremists were still dividing the ranks  of the Armed Forces [of the Philippines] and trying to derail  the peace process. Speaking before this year's 224 graduates of  the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) here, the president said,  "There are still those among us who -- instead of helping to  rebuild -- offer the counsel of reaction and retreat, who want  to stop reform by fair or foul means." Mr. Ramos said he was  referring to people who were pushing for a "short-cut change  outside of our constitutional system."    Defense Secretary Renato S. De Villa also said rightist  groups were "creating an atmosphere not conducive to the peace  process." De Villa cited recent press statements issued by the  Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance [as published] and the Young  Officers Union (YOU) criticizing graft and corruption in the  government.    Peace negotiations between the government and rightist  rebels  have stalled over several issues, including disagreements on the  "talking points." In the government's program of rebuilding and  reforming society, Mr. Ramos said, "Our Armed Forces must be the  bedrock of support to government."    In the face of the "confusion of the times," he urged the  PMA  1994 Class, called "Watch-Force," to "talk of programs for  growth, not coups and military adventurism. We debate policies  and reforms, not who does what to whom, and when we look at the  world, we think of catching up, not of falling farther behind,"  he said.    Mr. Ramos, however, cited several hopeful signs that the  country was moving toward peace. Most of the brightest rebels,  he said, "are now realizing that the battle of ideas is best  fought in the hearts and minds of our people, and not in urban  centers turned into bloody battlefields."    Mr. Ramos also predicted that the 25-year communist  insurgency would soon collapse. He said the country had regained  its internal political stability and was in a position to  achieve high economic growth. "The communist insurgency will  soon end altogether," he said. "Our brothers in the hills, who  waged war under a failed concept of revolution, are coming to  see the practical wisdom of working together for peace."    Mr. Ramos was apparently referring to the several thousand  New People's Army guerrillas whom officials said had applied for  amnesty under a reconciliation policy he launched after taking  office in 1992.    The military has estimated the present strength of communist  rebels around 8,000, from a peak of more than 25,000 in 1987.  Officials have said more than 40,000 people, mostly civilians,  have died in fighting between government forces and rebels since  the Marxist insurgency began in 1969.    Mr. Ramos also said Muslim rebels in Mindanao "are seeing  that talking peace and development are better alternatives than  violent secession."    He also stressed that all over the world, military forces  "are redefining their missions to put people's protection,  relief work and conservation of the environment on par with  combat duty."    "The AFP's [Armed Forces of the Philippines] concurrent  mission of community development and environmental protection  possesses the attributes most conducive to economic development  and nation building," he said.    Mr. Ramos also stressed the need to begin the long-term task  of modernizing the Armed Forces to meet the needs of the new  time. "Though the Cold War is over, our strategic importance in  our Asia-Pacific region remains, and we must be prepared to meet  both the challenges and opportunities this strategic importance  confers," he said.    Mr. Ramos asked the new AFP officers to be "models of social  responsibility'' and "paragons of citizenship." He also reminded  them "never to mistake an increase in personal wealth and power  as a replacement for growth in moral strength and character. Our  country will ask you always to place integrity above careerism,  honor above self-interest, loyalty to country above loyalty to  individualism and class," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US/China wheat deal shows trade war is still on - A heavily subsidised sale that appears to defy the spirit of the Gatt settlement The floor of the Chicago Board of Trade reacted like a firework to a lighted match last Tuesday morning to news that China wanted to purchase 1.1m tonnes of US soft wheat. Traders roared and wheat futures soared to all-time highs. China, once the US's largest wheat customer, has not purchased grain since July 29 and if this huge sale is completed US soft wheat stocks could be drawn down to unexpectedly low levels. In the midst of the tumult several puzzled traders stumbled out of the pit and punched their calculators. China had bid Dollars 88.50 a tonne for the wheat, about Dollars 2.40 per bushel, well under the world export price. For the sale to go through, the US government would have to escalate the US/European Union grain war to new heights, kicking in more than Dollars 60 a tonne to subsidise the sale through its Export Enhancement Programme. Only weeks after the US and EC had agreed to begin to reduce farm trade friction through a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would the US government back aggressive subsidies for the China sale, the traders wondered, or would it pass, causing the futures rally to fizzle on news of an incomplete sale Wednesday morning? As it turned out, the Gatt agreement had done nothing to cool the trade war. The US Department of Agriculture agreed to pay a Dollars 53.5m subsidy to induce China to buy 815,000 tonnes of wheat, with an average 'bonus' of Dollars 65.61 a tonne, the biggest export subsidy awarded this year. US taxpayers will contribute about Dollars 1.78 and the Chinese government Dollars 2.40 for each bushel. Before the Gatt settlement it was understandable for the US to keep up trade pressure on the EC, says Mr Dale Gustafson, cereals analyst for Smith Barney Shearson. 'The intent was to keep the negotiators at the table.' Now, he says, for the US to escalate the subsidy war 'is a bit surprising'. Other analysts are more outspoken, calling current world export subsidy levels 'insanity'. Since 1985 the US has spent Dollars 6.2bn to subsidise wheat exports, including Dollars 470m since October. The EU, trying to market a mountainous surplus, has done the same. The trade war has distorted domestic farm programmes and crumpled markets for countries which do not subsidise exports. While the US has maintained world market share with subsidies, the supply situation at home has shifted dramatically. Floods, drought and frost have eroded US wheat yields and quality for the last two harvests, leaving supplies historically short. Mr Dick Lowey, president of the research firm AgResources, estimates that only 35m to 45m bushels of soft red winter wheat, the variety most competitive with EU wheat, will be left in farmers' bins at the end of this season, barely enough to prime the export pipeline. Arranging a ceasefire in a 9-year trade war is difficult. 'The wheels of government move slowly,' says one USDA export analyst who asks not to be identified. 'What happens to EEP after Gatt remains to be seen.' The Gatt settlement calls for a gradual reduction in cereals subsidies. One of its aims is to draw down the EU's 23m-tonne wheat stock over a six-year period. AgResources' Mr Lowey believes the US will soon begin to lower its subsidies to destinations like Morrocco, allowing a modest shift in its wheat exports to the EU. He says US wheat prices, now nearing Dollars 4 a bushel, reflect concern that US wheat supplies may not rebuild quickly without that shift. 'We're at a stage where we should begin to phase out subsidies, and I think we'll begin to see that (reflected in EEP bonus levels) soon,' he suggests.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To value electricity, we used PAPI from the Asian Development Bank. To value coal and natural gas, we used Indian Import Statistics for 1992 and the Monthly Statistics of Mineral Production, Indian Bureau of Mines dated November 1992, respectively. To value water, we used a public cable from the U.S. consulate in Pakistan which was originally provided in the investigation of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sulfanilic Acid From the PRC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> because we could not locate a value for water in any Indian or Pakistani publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all material and energy prices that were for a period prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period in question and the POI using wholesale price indices published in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> International Financial Statistics (IFS) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by the International Monetary Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value labor amounts, we used the International Labor Office's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1993 Yearbook of Labor Statistics.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine the number of hours in an Indian workday, we used the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Country Reports: Human Rights Practices for 1990.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period in question and the POI using the consumer price indices published in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> IFS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages based on elements of industry group income statements from The Reserve Bank of India Bulletin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (RBI),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> December 1992. We based our overhead percentage calculations on the RBI data, adjusted to reflect an energy-exclusive overhead percentage. For selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, we calculated percentages based on the RBI data. We used the calculated SG&amp;A percentages because they were greater than the ten percent statutory minimum. We also used the calculated profit percentage because it was greater than the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory overhead, and SG&amp;A expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We made no adjustments for selling expenses. We added surrogate freight costs for the delivery of packing materials to the factories producing pencils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Best Information Available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because information has not been presented to the Department to prove otherwise, any PRC companies not participating in this investigation are not entitled to separate dumping margins. Potential exporters identified by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) have failed to respond to our questionnaire. In the absence of responses from these and other PRC exporters during the POI, we are basing the PRC country-wide rate on BIA. As discussed above, we are also applying BIA to SFTC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and more adverse margins for those respondents which did not cooperate in an investigation. As outlined in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products From Argentina (``Argentina Steel''),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 7066, 7069, 7070 (February 4, 1993), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. Here, since some PRC exporters failed to respond to our questionnaire, we are assigning to them the highest margin in the petition, as recalculated by the Department for the initiation and for this determination using petitioner's updated information submitted May 1994. This rate applies to all exporters other than those responding exporters which have shown their independence from central government control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since SFTC has been cooperative in this proceeding, and since we have preliminarily determined it is eligible for a separate rate, we are assigning a margin based on the highest calculated rate for any respondent in the investigation (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Argentina Steel <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify all information determined to be acceptable for use in making our final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Suspension of Liquidation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of pencils from the PRC that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV exceeds the USP as shown below.

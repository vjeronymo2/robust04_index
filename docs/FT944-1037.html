			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Former Thatcher adviser chosen to head Downing St policy unit Mr John Major yesterday began to reconstruct his inner team of advisers at Number 10 Downing Street by naming a little-known party loyalist as his main backroom strategist. In a surprise choice, Mr Major appointed Mr Norman Blackwell, a 42-year-old management consultant, to run the No 10 policy unit, which will formulate the prime minister's political planning in the run-up to the next general election. Mr Blackwell, who replaces Mrs Sarah Hogg, the former economics journalist, was an adviser to Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, in her successful 1987 election campaign, particularly on industrial and employment issues and inner-city regeneration. The selection of a political unknown for one of the top jobs in government was seen at Westminster as Mr Major's latest effort to freshen the party's ideas and policies. Apart from Mrs Hogg, at least three other members of the policy unit - Mr Damian Green, Miss Jill Rutter and Mr Nicholas True - are about to leave. At Conservative Central Office, Mr Tim Collins is expected to quit as director of communications. There have also been suggestions that Mr Andrew Lansley will resign as head of the Conservative Research Department, which is in charge of policy planning for the party as a whole. These changes partly reflect Mr Major's determination to reinvigorate his top team. Some Tory MPs have pinned the blame for the party's problems - particularly last year's ill-fated 'back-to-basics' policy - on Mrs Hogg's former team. Mr Blackwell, a Cambridge natural sciences graduate, comes to the job from McKinsey and Company, the management consultancy. He was described by friends as a free-market thinker with a social conscience. The government is planning to stage a large conference next year highlighting Britain's role in world affairs. Both Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, are said to be taking a close interest in the planned event which will mark the 75th anniversary of Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Gilt prices volatile after surprise cut in base rate The timing of yesterday's half-point cut in the base rate from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent took the UK government bond market by surprise and sparked a sharp initial rally in the cash and futures markets. After a volatile day, gilt prices ended between  1/8 and  1/2 point higher, with long-dated issues seeing the biggest gains, helped by the prospects of continued low inflation. Dealers reported keen buying interest in the cash and futures markets after the rate cut announcement but prices later fell back. 'Investors liked the news, but then they appeared to be pausing for breath as they tried to make up their minds about the longer-term implications and the Budget,' said one dealer. Expectations of a rate cut at the time of the Budget had been priced into the short end of the gilt market, although dealers said the cut had been expected slightly closer to the November 30 Budget. Mr John Kendall, UK economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, noted there was 'a lot of yield curve play - a lot of people are borrowing at the short end and buying the long end' of the gilt market because the gilt yield curve is positively sloped. German government bonds closed lower, with dealers blaming the gloomy international background rather than any domestic features. Monday's disappointing October money supply figures, which showed M3 growing by a higher than expected 6.8 per cent, pushed back expectations of a Bundesbank easing. However, dealers said hopes of a cut in key rates could be revived if the November cost of living data for the regions (due this week) lead to a decline in the west German October's figure of 3.9 per cent. Some economists are predicting a November figure of 3.7 per cent. Dealers noted some extension trades, from medium to long-dated bunds, but despite the switches the long end of the market still underperformed the five-year area. Italian government bonds suffered another substantial fall on panic selling by foreigners in the wake of the weekend municipal election results. Following Monday's tumble of nearly two points, Italian debt prices lost a further two points yesterday but clawed back some of the losses to end about a point lower on the day, with dealers arguing that the market had been oversold. The local elections dealt a blow to Italy's established political parties, and raised questions about the possible impact on the 1994 budget. However, yesterday the finance minister told reporters nothing had changed regarding the 1994 budget. Italy's ex-communist opposition yesterday guaranteed approval of the 1994 austerity budget by the end of the year, adding that the turmoil on financial markets after the weekend local polls was completely unjustified. The BTP futures contract settled at 112.64 on Monday. It opened at 112.03 yesterday and dropped as low as 110.50 as investors rushed to sell their bond holdings, but later recovered to trade at around 111.50 by late afternoon. Italian 10-year yield spreads over German bunds have widened to about 400 basis points, from around 300 basis points just over a week ago. Spanish government bonds were dragged lower by the combination of turmoil in Italy, general weakness in the European bond markets, and threats of a general strike by some Spanish trade unions in protest at the government's proposed labour market reforms. Hopes of a  1/4 point cut in Spanish interest rates were disappointed at the repo. Longer-dated US Treasury securities jumped sharply yesterday as short sellers were forced by rising prices to buy large amounts of bonds to cover their positions. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up 1 1/16 at 99 5/32 , yielding 6.308 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/8 at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.201 per cent. After Monday's losses, dealers were not surprised when the market staged a rally from the opening yesterday. Technical buying related to the price of the December Treasury bond futures contract was one reason for the early gains. Prices remained firm until midday and then climbed sharply in mid-afternoon as short-covering began in earnest. The activity was mainly restricted to dealers and speculators who had sold bonds short in anticipation of further losses.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (2): Why projects stay grounded - The country's most important economic failing Last month, Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, visited the bleak sandbanks of the river Jamuna in central Bangladesh to lay the foundation stone of the country's biggest-ever investment - a Dollars 700m bridge. The bridge is sorely needed to link north-west Bangladesh with the rest of the country. Today, lorries must queue all day to cross the river by a three-hour ferry ride. Monsoons, floods and droughts disturb the traffic, as does the constant shifting of the sands in the Jamuna's shallow bed. Bangladesh is crying out for investment. From the Jamuna bridge to automatic spindles in the textiles factories and tilling machines on the farms, the country needs capital to help promote economic growth. Without faster growth, it cannot hope to meet the needs of its swelling population. The government and development organisations monitoring Bangladesh, led by the World Bank, regard the lack of investment as the country's most important economic failing. Moreover, at least as far as public investment is concerned, the problem is not a shortage of funds. It is a lack of experienced and well-motivated politicians and bureaucrats able to implement the projects on the country's books. For private investors political uncertainty, bureaucratic foot-dragging and the poverty of potential consumers all hold back business activities. Local investors have been as slow to commit themselves as foreigners. However, there are signs that a few large private projects now under consideration could come to fruition and perhaps stimulate the drawing up of other proposals. Thanks to the skill of Mrs Zia's government in bringing public borrowing well under control and curbing inflation to about 2 per cent a year, there is plenty of scope for the government to expand the public investment programme. World Bank officials believe that, far from crowding out private investment, an increased flow of public investment would stimulate private activity. The Jamuna bridge is a good example - it will permit farmers in the rural north west to bring more of their crops for sale in central Bangladesh, including Dhaka, while also giving Dhaka-based manufacturers better access to distant markets. Mr Zaifur Rahman, the finance minister, is committed to increasing the ratio of investment to economic output to an estimated 14.5 per cent in the year to June 1994 from 13 per cent in 1992-93. The eventual target is 18-20 per cent. Foreign aid donors would be ready to increase the amount of aid pledged to Bangladesh above the Dollars 2.1bn promised for 1994-95, which is roughly the same as in the past two years. However, with Dollars 5bn in unspent funds in the pipeline, there is no reason to raise contributions. One western diplomat involved in aid projects blames 'a weak government, low quality ministers and civil servants' for the delays in public investment. Among the serious losses Bangladesh suffered in its 1971 independence war was the flight to Pakistan of many senior administrators who were of west Pakistani origin. Nor did the new country's espousal of socialist economic policies enable civil servants to acquire experience of running open economies. Mr Rahman says improved monitoring of schemes will accelerate the investment flow, but diplomats of donor countries say they see little change as yet. The controversy surrounding the Dollars 510m Karnaphuli fertiliser plant, a joint venture between the government, foreign aid donors and Japanese companies, has also cast a shadow over large-scale investments. First conceived in 1980 and coming on stream later this year, the plant has been dogged by arguments about the wisdom of using Bangladesh's scarce gas resources for fertiliser production instead of fuel. Whatever the merits of the dispute, its effect has been to call into question the government's ability to implement mega-projects. However, the donor countries' decision to back the Jamuna bridge scheme, which has also been under consideration for over 10 years, shows they are still willing to take risks in Bangladesh. Similarly, they are supporting a wide-ranging flood action programme to reduce the impact of future floods following those which devastated the country in the late 1980s. By comparison, private sector investments in Bangladesh are mostly small. Factories for garments, leather and handicrafts, rarely cost over Dollars 100,000. The returns can be spectacular - recent investments in the garments industry have seen entrepreneurs recover their money in a year. Mr Jamal Uddin Ahmad, a former deputy prime minister turned business consultant, says: 'Bangladesh generates these small high risk, high return investments. But what we need is to create a more stable environment to encourage more long-term local investment and eventually foreign investment as well.' A handful of larger investments are in the pipeline. Tootal, the British subsidiary of Coats Viyella, which operates a spinning mill in Bangladesh, is building a Dollars 25m extension to increase capacity threefold. Bangladesh Tobacco, an affiliate of BAT Industries of the UK, is considering a Dollars 60m plan for modernising tobacco and cigarette production. In the longer term, foreign companies are interested in investing in telecommunications, transport and energy, if these state-dominated industries are opened up to private investment as the government plans. In oil and gas, Holland Sea Search of the Netherlands and Cairns Energy of the UK are the first of seven international oil exploration groups to have completed exploration and production agreements. Other potential investors include Occidental Oil of the US and France's Total. In electricity, International Energy Group of the US and RP Goenka group, an Indian business group, have proposed plans for building and operating privately-owned power stations - but detailed rules for the entry of private companies have not yet been established. The government hopes to complete a new energy policy, including rules for private sector participation, next month.</p>

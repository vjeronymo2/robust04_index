			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Books: Doomed guru of the divided self - Christian Tyler on the spectacular failure of the charismatic analyst who tried to redefine madness RD LAING: A BIOGRAPHY by Adrian Laing Peter Owen Pounds 25, 248 pages It takes courage to dig out the case notes if the subject is your own father  -real courage if his name is RD Laing. Perhaps Adrian Laing found the experience cathartic. For what emerges from his biography is pure Greek tragedy. RD Laing was a gifted, musical, only child from lower-middle-class Glasgow who hated his mother and broke with his father, who revolted against the prevailing medieval treatment of the insane, craved fame for himself and found it as a cult figure of the 1960s, and who was driven by an egoism of heroic proportions into a self-destructive vortex of drink, drugs, violence and despair. Laing's own analyst characterised him as 'a special case' who had 'an extremely effective schizoid defence mechanism against exhibiting signs of depression'. Ironic, because Ronald Laing's most influential work, The Divided Self, was a study of schizophrenia, a condition he refused to call a disease but associated instead with family tensions. To label someone a schizophrenic was, he once said, 'a political act'. Indeed, he regarded all madness as mere behaviour, a healing process for some existential impasse. For all his radicalism RD Laing was not, says his son, an anti-psychiatrist. He had an extraordinary skill and sympathy with patients but an extraordinary contempt for authority, too. The peak of his career was in the mid-1960s when the fashionable intelligentsia gathered at Kingsley Hall, his experimental hostel in the East End of London. There, in an haze of recrimination and LSD, things began to fall apart. Though he remained as energetic and prolific as ever, Laing's love- life was a mess (he fathered 10 children by wives and lovers), his books began to fail and his American lecture audiences to yawn. A meditational sojourn in Sri Lanka and India restored him temporarily as a guru for the pot-smoking generation. But the tide of fashion was turning. Laing tried to stay with it by jumping onto American bandwagons like 're-birthing' and the natural childbirth movement. But he was a follower now, not a leader. One daughter suffered a breakdown, another died of leukaemia at the age of 21. The old brilliance became more fitful and the charisma wore thin, exposing a violent, hard-drinking, bad-mouthing, bitter Glaswegian. The final indignity came in 1987 when Laing was struck off by the General Medical Council, accused of being unfit to practise due to alcoholism. Although he gave up drink and retired to Austria it was too late for the comeback he planned. He died two years later at the age of 62. Little wonder that the author says his relationship with his father has greatly improved since the latter's death. Admiration, disgust and love are all evident in this portrayal, though one is left wondering whether the picture is too black - or not black enough. Adrian Laing has not passed judgment on his extraordinary father's life. Nor, as a lawyer, has he attempted to assess RD Laing's place in the short history of psychiatric medicine. What seems obvious even to the layman is that Ronald Laing was not really interested in providing solid scientific justification for his theories, humane and liberating though they may have been. Modern neuroscientific research seems to be mainly propelled by the hunt for 'schizophrenia genes'. In other words, madness is seen as a chemical aberration not a social construct. If RD Laing was a failure, he was a spectacular one. But if he was a failure it seems to have been not so much because he was wrong about madness. He was just too obsessed by himself.</p>

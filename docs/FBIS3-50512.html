			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Supreme Court [CSJ] Chairman  Edgar Oblitas today accused the government of unleashing a dirty  war against him, and announced a criminal trial against the  newspaper ULTIMA HORA of La Paz, which had published accusations  by a drug trafficker of alleged bribery affecting the judicial  branch.    Oblitas' remarks have aggravated to an even greater degree  the confrontation between the Judicial and Executive Branches,  which has prompted a movement for impeachment for corruption  against the CSJ chairman and a CSJ member which has not yet been  cleared by the Legislative Branch.    Oblitas also accused the U.S. Embassy in La Paz and the Drug  Enforcement Agency (DEA) of being involved in "a truly dirty war  to tarnish the image of the CSJ chairman."    The CSJ chairman made these accusations because of the  publication on 26 December of a statement made under oath by  drug trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominquez, who was arrested again  eight months after his escape, in which he said he had bribed  several judges.    Dominguez, captured on 24 December in the eastern town of  Santa Cruz, after his escape from a police clinic in La Paz on  17 April, said in his statement, which was published by ULTIMA  HORA, that from Sucre, the site of the Supreme Court, he was  asked for $120,000 "so as to be acquitted in the trial against  me for drug trafficking charges."    According to Dominguez, the money "would be for Edgar  Oblitas, Ernesto Poppe, and Edgar Rosales," all members of the  Supreme Court, but that it was not given, according to what he  said, because "I did not have the money, and I decided to  escape."    Oblitas said that "in face of the collapse and failure" of  the impeachment, "where absolutely nothing has yet been proven  in the Ibarra case, the government is now resorting to  complicity with a well-known and morally discredited drug  trafficker, setting up a new scheme in an effort to try to  involve (the CSJ chairman) with that criminal."    Jose Maria Antonio Ibarra, former Nicaraguan deputy minister  of the presidency, had accused Oblitas and Poppe, in addition to  former Justice Hugo Galindo, of extortion in order that the CSJ  might rule illegal his extradition, as had been requested by the  Managua Government.    Ibarra handed over to the Bolivian Government a videotape,  obtained with the technical support of the U.S. Embassy, which  shows the moment he was handing over to Galindo the money that  was allegedly intended to achieve the court's favorable ruling.    The video was submitted to a Chamber of Deputies committee,  which has concluded its investigations but has not yet announced  a decision establishing whether or not impeachment against the  CSJ chairman in the Senate is legal.    Oblitas has asked his lawyers to file suit against Ted  Cordoba Claure, director of the newspaper ULTIMA HORA, for  "manipulating in a dirty and criminal manner" the news "and for  leading public opinion astray."    The newspaper limited itself only to stating that it had  published a summarized version of Dominguez' remarks to the  authorities after his arrest on Christmas Eve.    Meanwhile, the suspended justices, on trial for having  granted a medical dispensation that facilitated Dominguez'  escape, have warned the detainee that he must convincingly prove  his denunciations of a $10,000 bribe, or defend himself in the  trial they will conduct against him.</p>

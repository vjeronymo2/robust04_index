			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Arts: Buxton Festival ARRIVAL in Buxton for this year's festival brought one unpleasant surprise. The elegant neo-classical Crescent near the Opera House, for some years in a dilapidated state, is now boarded up, its future apparently uncertain. A petition has even been started to try to save the building - one of the region's outstanding architectural landmarks. There seems to be a tradition in these parts that anything worth preservation has to wait until the 11th hour before action is taken. The festival itself has been on the brink of financial collapse more often than one cares to remember, so it is heartening to report this year that its finances are in a relatively healthy position, thanks to a substantial grant from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. One of Buxton's permanent assets is the classic Matcham theatre, which was lovingly restored in the late 1970s. It is a friendly and intimate venue, which is just the right place for the foraging into little-known operatic territory that is the festival's aim. This year, the two operas were by Handel and Rossini - ideal fare for this theatre, if not both as rare as they might have been. The greater novelty (and the better performed of the two) was Handel's Agrippina. This is one of those early Handel Italian operas which is spiced with a surprisingly sharp wit. The familiar figures of Roman history are there, but their story is twisted into satire with some topical references. It is a slippery style to master and Adrian Slack's production sometimes had a grasp on its wry sense of humour, sometimes not. It was at its best when the sharpest individual characterisations were parading the stage. Susan Roberts was a particularly masterful Agrippina, who exhibited the inner concentration, the way of uttering her wickedest lines through clenched teeth, that makes this monster of a woman come to life. Fiona Janes was a convincingly adolescent Nerone, Sally Harrison the luscious blonde bimbette of a Poppea. There were two very reasonable counter-tenors in Timothy Wilson as Ottone and Simon Clulow as Narciso. The standard of singing was not, however, flawless, with several of the cast coming unstuck on the coloratura and parting company with the orchestra. The players were from the Manchester Camerata, directed with fine musicianship, though not always enough dramatic momentum, by Roger Vignoles. Perhaps the most consistent pleasure came from the designs of Dermot Hayes, whose mini-Colosseum in flames was an amusing contribution from one participant who clearly had his tongue firmly in his cheek. The other production also looked good on a small budget, even if the designer, Ruari Murchison, seemed set upon painting the whole stage red, white and green in the Italian colours. Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri flies the national flag pretty blatantly and the main aim of Jamie Hayes's production was not to let us forget it. As the patriotic Isabella, Jean Rigby was in every sense the standard-bearer of the evening. The warm resonance of her voice and the quality of her singing, though neither very Italianate in style, carried all before her. The other singers admittedly offered little resistance. Justin Lavender sounded out-of-sorts as Lindoro. Mark Richardson sang decently, but never grew into the grotesque and comical Mustapha; Richard Suart's Taddeo worked the comedy hard enough for the whole cast. Still, there have been worse tributes to Rossini this bicentenary year and, indeed, less appealing productions of this opera in the past. The conductor, giving the performance much of the nimbleness of spirit it wanted elsewhere, was Jane Glover. She takes over as Artistic Director at Buxton in 1993, initially for a one-year period, and in her the festival will be looking for new vigour and ambition. The festival continues until 2 August (Box Office 0298) 72190</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Rescue agreed for French benefits THE French government, employers and unions yesterday agreed a FFr25bn (Pounds 2.84bn) a year rescue over the next decade for the country's unemployment compensation system, writes David Buchan in Paris. Mr Michel Giraud, labour minister, said the deal, which will see a FFr4.6bn a year cut in unemployment benefits 'settles the future' of the system, which recession has pushed into a deficit of more than FFr30bn. Under the terms of the rescue package, the state is for the first time making a sizeable contribution to the fund by providing an extra FFr10bn a year. Hitherto, the scheme has been largely financed by employer/employee contributions, which will be increased under the terms of yesterday's deal.</p>

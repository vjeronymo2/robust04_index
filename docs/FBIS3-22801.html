			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mark Watts and Bill Goodwin: "UK Clamp on Iraqi </F> Bomb Clues"]    [Text] Key documents containing potentially the most  embarrassing details about Britain's "arms to Iraq" scandal have  been suppressed, THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH has learned.    The papers, part of a United Nations dossier which was  passed  to the British Government more than two years ago, related to  the role of UK industry in building Saddam Hussein's nuclear  bomb.    Since the Gulf war, UN inspectors have found that UK-made  computers, electronics and machine tools were used in Iraq's  nuclear bomb production line.    The findings imply that British companies were not only  exporting arms to Iraq, but were also supplying parts for the  country's nuclear programme. Yet Customs has not prosecuted any  of the companies alleged by the UN to have been involved.    Six members of the defence team in the "nuclear triggers"  case, the only "arms to Iraq" trial in Britain where people have  been jailed, have obtained copies of the crucial UN papers from  Customs and Excise in preparation for an appeal that is due to  be heard within the next two months.    Customs has persuaded the Lord Chief Justice to make an  order  banning the six from divulging the contents of the papers.    Lord Taylor granted an application at a secret special  hearing, and any breach would be a contempt of court punishable  by up to two years' jail.    The UN papers have been kept secret during the time of John  Major's government, and blame cannot be laid on Margaret  Thatcher's administration as other "arms to Iraq" fiascos have  been.    Sources suggest that civil servants have tried to avoid  further embarrassment for the Government by deciding not to  volunteer to disclose the documents to the Scott inquiry, which  is due to hear evidence from the Prime Minister next week.    A DTI spokeswoman would say only: "The Scott inquiry has  been  set up to look at all these matters and it is for the Scott  inquiry to consider all questions related to this subject."    Lady Thatcher told the Scott inquiry last month that when  she  was Prime Minister, she was "particularly concerned" that no  exports for Saddam's nuclear bomb programme should leave  Britain's shores. She told Lord Justice Scott: "The thought of  anything nuclear getting into the hands of a government in Iraq,  who would have no scruples about the use of the ultimate weapon,  was absolutely horrific."    The Sunday Telegraph has not asked any of the  "gagged" six to defy the banning order. An 18-month undercover  US-UK customs operation -- which was praised at the Scott  inquiry by Lady Thatcher -- resulted in the conviction of Ali  Daghir and Jeanine Speckman in 1991 for trying to export  capacitors allegedly destined for the detonation device of  Iraq's nuclear bomb.    Senior Customs figures were so concerned about keeping the  embarrassing UN documents secret that they discussed seeking an  injunction to prevent the broadcast last month of an ITV  programme about the nuclear triggers case, in the mistaken fear  that it would disclose the contents of the papers.    A producer at the programme "The Big Story" said: "There was  even a call to the office on the day of transmission from  someone claiming to be from Customs who said we were about to  have several injunctions served on us. A newspaper newsdesk was  then tipped off that we were being banned. But it never  happened."    Daghir and Speckman were sentenced to five years and 18  months respectively, and Speckman has completed her sentence.  Both are appealing on several grounds.    Two years ago, THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH revealed that a secret  Iraqi report seized by UN inspectors cast doubt on the  convictions. The report suggested that electronic components  intercepted by British Customs officers in a highly publicised  "sting" at London's Heathrow Airport in 1990 had nothing to do  with Saddam's nuclear bomb project. On the strength of this,  Daghir was released from jail on &pound;200,000 bail pending  appeal.    Other evidence in our possession points to their innocence.  This includes covertly recorded tapes of conversations  suggesting US Customs undercover agents set up Daghir and  Speckman.    After obtaining the Iraqi report, an expert witness for the  defence sought more of the three-volume UN dossier to see if  there was more evidence in it to support the defence claim of  wrongful conviction. Dr. John Hassard, a nuclear expert at  London's Imperial College, was given more documents by the UN's  International Atomic Energy Agency and yet more by the DTI --  with no conditions attached. He and the defence team obtained  further sections from Customs.    While claiming that they were irrelevant to the case,  Customs  lawyers agreed to hand over to the defence team, on a  confidential basis, the sections from the UN dossier listing the  British manufacturers which allegedly sent exports for Iraq's  nuclear programme in breach of sanctions.    UN inspections of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme found  that  UK companies supplied computers and built a semiconductor  manufacturing plant. Inspectors also found machinery in Saddam  Hussain's bomb production line from nine British machine tool  companies.    It is understood that the suppressed papers are viewed by  the  defence lawyers as another crucial part of the new evidence on  which they will seek to rely at their appeal because the lists  do not include their export company, Euromac. In view of the  basis on which the gagging order was obtained, and the fact that  their appeal will be heard in public, they are likely to meet  stiff opposition from Customs.    The Customs' position is that no comment can be made on any  matter related to the Daghir and Speckman case while their  appeal is pending and the Scott inquiry is still running.</p>

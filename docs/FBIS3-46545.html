			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam has  picked internationalization, revitalization of the economy and  reform as the three biggest tasks for the nation in 1994. He  will carry out his policies, focused on globalization and  openness, by strengthening the competitive power of the country.    His government will push efforts to ease economic and  administrative regulations and restrictions to make a second  economic leap in the new economic order brought on by successful  conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.    The government will try to concentrate the national strength  for economic revitalization and increased exports through  stepped-up capital investment and stable industrial relations.    To achieve these goals, President Kim believes, the  political  foundation has to be stable first. He will, therefore, continue  to remove factors that breed irregularities and corruption while  adopting legislation on unified elections, political  fundraising, and political parties at an early date.    At the same time, the administration plans to redraw  election  districts in preparations for next year's local elections and  undertake local administrative reform.    An official at Chongwadae [presidential office] said Monday  that Kim contemplated the three basic policy directions of  internationalization, economic revitalization, and reform during  his two-day new year's holiday.    Kim's ideas include strategies for internationalization and  openness in the wake of the Uruguay Round, local elections in  1995, parliamentary elections in 1996 and the presidential  election in 1997, the official said. He regards the North  Korean nuclear issue as the key to inter-Korean relations. He  plans to map out multilateral strategies for the resolution of  the issue. His government will work out measures for economic  cooperation with North Korea and establishment of diplomatic  relations between Pyongyang and Washington and Pyongyang and  Tokyo if, or when, the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved,  the official said.    President Kim will actively pursue summit diplomacy for  closer coordination with the United States, Japan, China, Russia  and others to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula.    He is scheduled to visit Japan in the first half of the year  to be followed by a visit to Jakarta for the second Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the second half.    The president is expected to spell out his policies in  detail  at his first press conference of the year and on other  occasions, the official said.</p>

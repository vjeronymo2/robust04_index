			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Clinton silent on running-mate FIVE days before the start of the Democratic party convention in New York, one name is still missing from the programme: that of Governor Bill Clinton's vice-presidential running-mate. Mr Clinton yesterday met Mr Warren Christopher, the Washington lawyer who is leading his search committee, but the Arkansas governor has succeeded in preserving a veil of mystery over his choice. Several names are widely circulated, but most tipsters are cautious enough to include the possibility of a surprise on their short-lists. Even the timing of Mr Clinton's announcement remains in doubt, with some pundits suggesting he might wait until the middle of next week's All Star baseball game to ensure a big television audience. Three men are most widely mentioned as possible running-mates: Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee. Senator Wofford leapt to the top of the list yesterday when he met Mr Clinton in Washington. A surprise victor in last year's Pennsylvania senate by-election, he would confirm an emphasis on domestic issues, especially health care reform. Mr Hamilton, on the other hand, would bring some of the gravitas and foreign affairs experience that the presumptive Democratic nominee is thought to lack. His odds lengthened this weekend when he distanced himself from Mr Clinton and the centre of the Democratic party on the issues of abortion and parental leave - although his reservations about abortion rights are similar to Mr Wofford's. Mr Gore would bring good credentials on environmental issues, but an all-southern ticket could be risky: Yankee prejudice is alive and well, as Mr Clinton himself discovered during the New York Democratic primary campaign. Also viewed as potential choices are three other senators: Mr Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Mr Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Mr Bob Graham of Florida. Of these six, only Mr Wofford and perhaps Mr Graham have the capacity to bring Mr Clinton a big state he might otherwise lose. The man Democratic delegates would most like to see alongside Governor Clinton, according to a recent Associated Press poll, is Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. The former basketball star has, however, repeatedly ruled himself out. In the end, the choice of vice-presidential running-mate may not mean all that much. Some analysts say it is the candidate's first chance to show himself as a decision-maker; others that voters elect a president, not a vice-president. While Mr Lyndon Johnson won his home state of Texas for President John Kennedy in 1960, and Mr Walter Mondale of Minnesota may have helped President Jimmy Carter in 1976, most vice-presidential candidates have no effect on the outcome of the election. Perhaps the clearest evidence of this came in 1988, when Mr Lloyd Bentsen comprehensively outscored Mr Dan Quayle, but could do nothing to rescue the losing candidacy of Mr Michael Dukakis.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Sizewell B faces consultation delay A further round of public consultation on Sizewell B, the Suffolk nuclear power station, could cost about Pounds 30m, Nuclear Electric, the plant's owners, said last night. The pollution inspectorate yesterday announced that it was asking Nuclear Electric to supply more information about the Pounds 2bn pressurised water reactor. The decision follows the High Court's ruling earlier this year that the economic and environmental costs and benefits of nuclear plants must be fully evaluated before they are allowed to operate.</p>

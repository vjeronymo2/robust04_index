			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS ASSEMBLY;  </P> <P> DISTRICT 45  </P> <P> Overview  </P> <P> Incumbent Assemblyman Burt Margolin, a Democrat, is strongly favored in the  general election. His opponents have targeted his close ties to the  Berman/Waxman organization, a powerful Westside-area political group headed by  Reps. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles).  The Republican primary has focused on the candidates' opposing views on  abortion.  </P> <P> Contenders  </P> <P> Robert K. Davis, 45, a West Hollywood Republican, is a swimming pool contractor  and former teacher who ran for the West Hollywood City Council in April. He is  endorsed by the California Republican League and the Republicans' Gay and  Lesbian Task Force. Davis' campaign has stressed getting out the vote, abortion  rights and expanding the Republican Party to include more minorities. He holds  a BA degree in social science from the State College of Iowa, and an MA in  history from the University of Iowa. He is single.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Michael, 33, a Los Angeles Republican, is an accounting and marketing  consultant for small businesses. She ran unsuccessfully in the Republican  primary for Sen. David Roberti's seat in the 23rd District two years ago. She  is endorsed by the California Republican Assembly, and her campaign has focused  on her opposition to gun control, abortion and malathion spraying. She received  a BS degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of  Pennsylvania. She is single.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Burt Margolin, a Los Angeles Democrat, and Owen Staley, a Peace and  Freedom candidate, are unopposed in their primaries.  </P> <P> Questionnaire  </P> <P> Questionnaires were distributed to candidates and were returned this month.  Answers have been edited to fit the available space.  </P> <P> Q. Under recently introduced legislation, state sales taxes would be raised  0.25% for 10 years to help finance school construction. Do you favor an  increase in sales taxes to underwrite new school construction?  </P> <P> Davis: No.  </P> <P> Michael: No.  </P> <P> Q. An initiative measure on the June ballot would raise taxes on gasoline sales  by 9 cents a gallon to finance highway projects. Do you support the concept of  higher gas taxes to underwrite road construction?  </P> <P> Davis: No, not supporting Prop. 111. Supports concept of gas tax for road  repair.  </P> <P> Michael: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first  three months of pregnancy?  </P> <P> Davis: Yes.  </P> <P> Michael: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support capital punishment?  </P> <P> Davis: Yes.  </P> <P> Michael: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support the idea of breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School  District into smaller districts?  </P> <P> Davis: Yes.  </P> <P> Michael: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Under current law, the state Legislature is responsible for redrawing state  legislative and congressional district boundaries. Do you believe this system  should be changed?  </P> <P> Davis: Yes. Present ills are due to a stalemated political system;  reapportionment is a key to ending this.  </P> <P> Michael: Yes. I support Prop. 119, which puts redistricting in the hands of a  citizens committee . . . instead of a corrupt legislature.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support the so-called "Big Green" ballot initiative, which would  eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase out pesticides  known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all new  developments?  </P> <P> Davis: No.  </P> <P> Michael: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Do you think the state should require private employers to subsidize  day-care services for employees who request them?  </P> <P> Davis: No. This is being worked out by employers. Would discourage employment.  </P> <P> Michael: No. Good business, but should not be forced. Supports tax credit  incentives.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support the state's efforts to build prisons in Lancaster and East  Los Angeles?  </P> <P> Davis: Yes.  </P> <P> Michael: No.  </P> <P> Q. Proposition 112 on the June ballot would ban speaking fees and limit gifts  to state legislators while creating a commission that could pave the way for  higher legislative salaries. Do you support this ballot initiative?  </P> <P> Davis: No. Prefers speaker fees to a pay raise. No pay raise for a job poorly  done.  </P> <P> Michael: Undecided.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support Gov. Deukmejian's proposed constitutional changes that would  require state prison inmates to work in privately sponsored industries to pay  for their incarceration?  </P> <P> Davis: Yes, but I'm not sure it will work.  </P> <P> Michael: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of  supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce  the level of drug use in the United States?  </P> <P> If no, what should be done?  </P> <P> Davis: No. Only diminished demand will work. Best action is publicizing results  of drug use.  </P> <P> Michael: No. Education is key, and without God we will never solve society's  drug problem.  </P> <P> Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing the use of drugs?  </P> <P> Davis: No answer given.  </P> <P> Michael: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support raising sales or other taxes to finance anti-drug law  enforcement efforts and/or anti-drug education programs?  </P> <P> If yes, by how much?  </P> <P> Davis: No.  </P> <P> Michael: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns?  </P> <P> Davis: No. Never read a proposal that seems workable. Also, we don't have the  money.  </P> <P> Michael: No. The public should not be forced to finance campaigns they disagree  with.  </P> <P> Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit foreign individuals  and corporations from owning land in California. Do you support this?  </P> <P> Davis: No.  </P> <P> Michael: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more  difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land  prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers  to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property  prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and  Ventura counties refuse such so-called "upzoning?"  </P> <P> Davis: No. An inherent conflict of interest.  </P> <P> Michael: No.  </P> <P> Q. Are you willing to publicly release your tax returns and those of your  spouse before the election?  </P> <P> Davis: No. It's an invasion of privacy.  </P> <P> Michael: No.  </P> <P> Q. A development project called Porter Ranch would create 3,395 residential  units and nearly 6 million square feet of commercial office space in the  Chatsworth hills. Opponents say it is too big. Proponents say it represents  orderly growth. Do you support the project at this size?  </P> <P> Davis: Undecided. Based on newspaper reports, I would probably support it.  </P> <P> Michael: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support limits on the number of terms state legislators can serve?  </P> <P> If yes, how long should they be?  </P> <P> Davis: Yes. Assembly, three terms; Senate, two terms.  </P> <P> Michael: Yes. Assembly, four terms; Senate, two terms.  </P> <P> Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit the spraying of  pesticides on private property without the written consent of the owner. Do you  support this measure?  </P> <P> Davis: Yes, a welcome reassertion of property rights.  </P> <P> Michael: Yes. I oppose malathion spraying.  </P></p>

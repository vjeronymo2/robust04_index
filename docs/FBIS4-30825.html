			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michael Zantovsky, Czech ambassador to the </F> United States, by Kveta Subrtova; place and date not given: "The  Czech Republic's Presence in the American Market Should Be  Stronger"]    [Text] [Subrtova] The post-November Czechoslovakia, and  then also the Czech Republic, enjoyed relatively high political  and economic respect in the United States. How successful has  the Czech Republic been in preserving its good reputation now,  when the attention of the United States in Europe is focused  more on the southeast and east?    [Zantovsky] Political and economic respect cannot be  measured by the number of newspaper headlines or public  statements. Serious international problems and crises attract  most of the attention, but our country has been spared them,  fortunately. The continuing political respect -- which was best  expressed by President Clinton's visit to Prague in January this  year -- as well as the continuing economic interest --  documented by that fact that more than half of all foreign  investments in the Czech economy in 1993 came precisely from the  United States -- show that our mutual relations have maintained  a constantly high level, which is without precedent in our  modern history. The Czech Republic has the reputation of being  a stable, reliable, and economically very promising partner.    The United States is still interested in our market, access  to our market, and investments. A mission from the government  agency for foreign private investments, OPIC, will arrive in  Prague in June, bringing with it several dozen interested  American entrepreneurs. We only have to look at the activity of  the U.S. Embassy commercial section, foreign services of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  in the Czech Republic, to see that the United States does not  underestimate its access to our market.    [Subrtova] There is no doubt about the fact that President  Bill Clinton's visit to Prague in January was important for  American-Czech relations. Is there any specific evidence yet  that the impetus that this visit could, and should have brought  for the development of relations between our two countries in  the political, cultural, and, particularly, the economic sphere  is being implemented?    [Zantovsky] The start of the Partnership For Peace project  -- which all the participating countries in the Prague summit  and a number of other countries have joined -- was the main  result of President Clinton's visit to Prague. Now, the program  is in the stage of preparation, while presentation documents are  being handed over. These documents will determine the specific  modalities of the participation of individual countries. It is  important that we have succeeded, for the time being, in  preserving the principle of the equality of all countries  participating in the program. By granting special status to any  country, the program would be downgraded.    The conference in the fall on free trade between the United  States and the countries of central and Eastern Europe will be  the result of the impetus in the economic sphere. In this  connection, we can observe a revival of American interest in the  idea of a free trade zone between the United States and the  CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Association] countries. I  believe our American partners will be able to prepare a program  for the conference that could result in a larger opening of the  market to our products and build on the steps that the U.S.  Government took at the beginning of the nineties. The Czech  Republic may have acquired a permanent most-favored-nation  clause, but there are still quantity restrictions on some of our  commodities, for instance, in the form of quotas on the import  of our cheese or textiles. One of the positive steps could be  the preservation, or even a further extension of the system of  customs preferences for our products.    [Subrtova] Today, Czech diplomatic missions in the world  largely supplant the role of commercial and economic  "reconnaissance" [vysadek]. What is the activity of the embassy  whose head you are?    [Zantovsky] Along with the center of the Czech Republic's  economic activity being transferred to the sphere of private  enterprise, the role of embassies in this sphere is also being  changed. We see our role particularly in transmitting high  quality economic and commercial information in both directions,  and in promoting the potential of our economy and our economic  results, not only in Washington, but all over the United States'  territory.    [Subrtova] What problems are you encountering in this  activity, and what success, if any, have you achieved? How  could our domestic (Czech) economic sphere help you in this  respect? Moreover, what can you offer, or what advice can you  give to our businessmen, bankers, and entrepreneurs?    [Zantovsky] I dare hope that we, too, deserve some credit  for the continuing interest of American businesses in investing  in the Czech Republic, and for the successful course of  negotiations on certain larger-scale economic projects. We are  paying primary attention to the economic sphere. Our monthly  bulletin, CZECH THE NEWS, which is now in the second year of  publication, also plays a positive role in that respect. Since  January 1994, our bulletin has been available also in electronic  form on the Internet network. We organize a number of events,  lectures, and seminars regarding these problems. At present, we  are preparing a lecture on privatization to be delivered by R.  Sabela, deputy minister of industry and trade, a seminar with  our representatives in the International Monetary Fund and the  World Bank, and we are cooperating in the preparation of a  seminar on the development of tourism in the Czech Republic, in  which Economy Minister K. Dyba should participate.    We would also welcome it if we managed to organize this  year a publicity trip for Minister of Industry and Trade Dlouhy  to several places in the United States, a trip that would focus  on business and investments, like the one to Canada recently.  America is not just Washington and New York; it is also the  midwest, Texas, California, and other states. In all those  places there are potential opportunities for expanding our  economic relations. Whenever possible, I try to help develop  these relations when personally visiting various regions in the  United States.    In comparison with some comparable European countries, we  feel that the presence of the Czech Republic should be stronger  on such a large market as the American one. It would help us  very much if the concept for the pro-export policy were  completed and included provisions for providing company service,  searching for partners, and furnishing information on their  credibility, etc. Our representative office should not engage  in this activity, but other entities should, such as the  Economic Chamber or the Association of Industry. The  Association of Industry should set up UNIDO offices, where Czech  investment specialists are active, also in Washington, apart  from Europe and Tokyo. A possibility has arisen to open a  CZECHINVEST branch in California. It would be very beneficial  if a Czech tourist center could be independently active here. I  believe it is important for the further development of economic  activity also to expand -- following the example of other  countries -- our diplomatic presence on the territory of such a  vast country as the United States. The opening of the Consulate  General in Los Angeles, which is being prepared, and our efforts  to establish honorary consulates in a number of the states are  related to this. The forthcoming opening of the Czech Center in  New York plays an important role here.    Our national agencies and businesses help us most by  providing us with high quality information on the macroeconomic  situation, and also on entrepreneurial and business  opportunities on the microeconomic level. We would like to  receive more information and more often.    Regarding providing advice, I will be more cautious. It is  easy to give advice where other peoples' money is involved. If  I may give advice, then I would say that it is very important to  adopt in business and other negotiations something that they  call here "follow through" [previous two words published in  English], which means, approximately, "carry matters to  completion." This is commonplace here. Any letter or fax, or  telephone call that is not answered for a long time, reduces the  probability of a successful result. It is equally important to  remember that in American business ethics an oral agreement has  practically the same weight as a written one, and is considered  binding by both parties. I dare say that, if local demands on  speed, promptness, and meeting obligations are met, Americans  are the most reliable partners in the world.    Independence and initiative are additional prerequisites for  a business success in the United States. Sometimes, I have the  feeling that it is the absence of these qualities that prevents  us from making better use of the great prospects in the sphere  of small and medium-size enterprises. A number of U.S.  manufacturers would be interested in manufacturing their  products, or parts of them, with incomparably lower costs in our  country and would welcome offers from our side. Within our  possibilities, we try to transmit even this information.  However, this is a task, above all, for non- government  economic and commercial representative offices.    [Subrtova] What is your personal experience regarding the  possibility of equitable cooperation between a small Central  European country and the only world superpower today?    [Zantovsky] I, myself, am of small stature, but I have never  had difficulty in cooperating with people who are 15 inches  taller. In cooperation between two countries, size is not of  primary importance, either. The important thing is whether one  country has something to offer the other. We have so much to  offer that, despite all the work I have to do, I can still find  moments in which I can be proud of being a Czech.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Stores planned for radioactive waste worldwide Worldwide plans for the underground storage of intermediate and high-level radioactive waste are: UK Some 27 per cent of the UK's electricity was produced by 35 reactors last year. A site in Cumbria close to Sellafield has been identified for an underground repository for mostly intermediate-level waste over 50 years. The repository is expected to be ready in 2010. FRANCE Some 78 per cent of electricity was produced by 58 reactors last year. Two sites are expected to be short-listed next year for an underground repository for long-lived waste. GERMANY Some 34 per cent of electricity is produced by 19 nuclear plants. Two sites are being considered for repositories - a former iron ore mine at Konrad and a site at Gorleben, both in Lower Saxony. An abandoned salt mine at Bartensleben in the former east German republic has been used since 1981 for low and intermediate-level waste. SWEDEN In 1980 it was decided all nuclear power stations - which currently produce about half of the country's electricity - would be to phased out by 2010. The exact timetable is still to be established. Low and intermediate-level waste is stored underground near the Forsmark nuclear plant, 50 metres below the bed of the Baltic Sea. Investigations are continuing to identify a site for high-level waste. BELGIUM Nuclear power produces 59 per cent of electricity. A potential site for the disposal of high-level and long-lived radioactive waste was identified in 1974 at Mol-Dessel in northern Belgium, where an underground laboratory has been working on feasibility studies since 1983. FINLAND Nuclear power stations produce 29 per cent of electricity. The country already has a repository for low and intermediate level waste at Olkiluoto. The search continues for a site for high-level waste. US Some 20 per cent of power is produced by 110 reactors. A site has been identified under Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for a deep-level repository. An underground laboratory is being constructed. JAPAN Some 31 per cent of electricity was produced by 48 nuclear plants last year. The Power Reactor Fuel Development Corporation plans an underground laboratory at Honrobe, on the island of Hokkaido, to study disposal of high-level waste in sedimentary rock.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Loshchilin] </F>   [Text] Washington, 9 Mar -- "I thank U.S. President Bill  Clinton and everyone with whom I had contacts here for their  kind feelings toward our snall country and their understanding  of its problems. We have received promises of as much support  as possible," Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the Georgian  state, said on Tuesday, summing up the results of his official  visit to the U.S. capital at a news conference at the National  Press Club in Washington.    "It is quite natural that the attention of the world has  been  focused on the political processes in Russia and on whether it  will succeed in building a new, truly democratic state," E.  Shevardnadze noted. "The West can and should assist in this  process, but if it views events in Russia in isolation from what  is happening in other former Soviet republics it will have to  pay a very high price. I tried to explain in my conversations  that despite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  territory which it occupied remains a single socio-economic  space where there is still a close interconnection between  cultures and social thought. That is why I am convinced that  all the new independent states should be viewed as a whole.  Otherwise, the stability of even the largest and most  influential of them may be undermined by instability on its  borders".    Earlier on Tuesday E. Shevardnadze had meetings in  Washington  with World Bank president Lewis Preston and International  Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus. The expansion  of cooperation with the world's largest multinational  credit-lending and financial organisations in advancing the  republic's economy was discussed, Georgian Deputy Prime Minister  Irakli Menagarishvili, who took part in the talks, told  ITAR-TASS. "The meetings were held in a constructive and warm  atmosphere. E. Shevardnadze assured his interlocutors that,  notwithstanding all the difficulties connected with military  operations and their consequences, Georgia firmly intends to go  ahead with the market reform policy. He outlined our  government's plans in this respect and urged the World Bank and  IMF leaders to help the republic resolve the complex economic  problems facing it. Support for the Georgian national monetary  units was discussed at the talks," I. Menagarishvili said. The  same day the head of the Georgian state visited the Capitol  where he had a series of meetings with the heads of committees  of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the U.S.  Congress. The main subject there was the problem of  humanitarian, technical and financial aid to the forer Soviet  republic. "I hope that I succeeded in convincing the legislators  to allocate additional funds to Georgia," in addition to the $70  million which President Bill Clinton promised to grant this  year, E. Shevardnadze said in reply to a question by an  ITAR-TASS correspondent.    E. Shevardnadze began the third day of his visit to  Washington with a short working lunch with James Wolsey,  director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The Georgian  delegation was unable to tell the ITAR-TASS correspondent  anything about the nature of the issues discussed, because the  conversation in the guest residence of the republican leader was  one-on-one. It is no secret, however, that the CIA is assisting  Tbilisi in training its national security forces and the  personal guard of the head of state.    After concluding the Washington part of his visit to the  United States, E. Shevardnadze flew to New York. Today he is  due to speak at the UN Security Council and to set out the  Georgian Government's position on questions of the prospects for  a settlement in Abkhazia and for sending international  peace-keeping forces to the conflict zone.</p>

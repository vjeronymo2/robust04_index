			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Jeepers - how about those creepers?: Stuart Marshall gets dirty, just like the settlers of old, taking the Rubicon Trail THE WOMAN in red perched on the rocky outcrop like an overweight Lorelei. Before her, a seemingly endless line of four-wheel drive vehicles taking part in the Jeepers' Jamboree inched their way laboriously up a smooth granite slope as steep as the roof of a house. 'Jeeping,' she remarked, in one of those turbocharged American voices that can be heard in the next county, 'is creeping, and walking is quicker.' She was absolutely right. The fastest way of covering the worst 15 miles of the Rubicon Trail would certainly be on foot. 'Jeepers' is the generic term for people who rough-ride for pleasure in four-wheel drive vehicles that are mostly, but not exclusively, Jeeps. The Rubicon Trail is to Jeepers what Cowes is to yachtsmen or Wimbledon to tennis players. It starts at Georgetown, California, and goes east to the shore of Lake Tahoe, rising to just over 7,100 ft (2,185 m) at its highest point. It begins innocuously because much of the 71 miles (114 kms) is on paved country roads. The going gets difficult enough for four-wheel drive to be desirable at Loon Lake, which is only eight miles - but four hours driving - from Rubicon Springs. A few hundred yards further on and four-wheel drive is essential. The Oxford Dictionary defines a trail as 'a path or track worn by the passage of persons travelling in a wild or uninhabited region'. That sums it up perfectly. The region through which the Rubicon Trail passes is wild. You may spot brown bears if you are lucky, though all I saw were dozens of paw marks in the mud. It is also uninhabited and consequently quite unspoiled. Commercial logging is out of the question. The tall pines that find living space between the granite masses grow, die and and rot where they have fallen. It was Indian country before white men first went in with packhorses in 1844. Later, engineers dreamed of a wooden tunnel to pipe water from Lake Tahoe (altitude 6,229 ft, or 1,917 metres) to San Francisco, 200 miles (334 kms) away. It came to nothing. When mineral water was found at Rubicon Springs in the 1880s, health freaks beat a path there. Wagon loads of timber were eventually hauled in to build a hotel which operated until the 1920s. Guests arrived first by coach-and-four and later by 10-passenger Pierce Arrow motor car. Even though the trail was then regularly maintained, it must have been an appalling journey. Perhaps that was why the hotel failed in the 1920s. Years later, the building collapsed under heavy snows. There is now no sign it was ever there. The Rubicon Trail reverted to the wild. Snow shuts it from November to June and the thaw brings floods which wash down new rock piles and create fresh mudholes. Every year, the lie of the land as seen by a Jeeper changes. When I joined the Jeepers' Jamboree and drove the Rubicon in an open Jeep Wrangler, windscreen folded on the bonnet, much of the trail was like the bed of a mountain torrent. Which, of course, in winter is what it is. It was the 40th Anniversary Jamboree last year. More than 1,500 people from across the US had converged there, driving and riding in 500 vehicles. It is rated the most difficult American off-road event open to all comers. There are no prizes. Simply to get into Rubicon Springs, camp overnight, enjoy a noisy and uninhibited party and get out again with the vehicle in one piece is reckoned to be reward enough. Half a ton of New York steaks, sufficient beer to stock a large pub, a generator-powered sound system and, because this is the US, a grand piano had been airlifted in, slung in nets under a helicopter. Every piece of litter that could not be burned on a huge bonfire was picked up and carted out again. Part of the Jeepers' code is to leave the wilderness as they find it. That night, as I crawled filthy and unwashed into a pup tent, I had a thought. If the hotel had still been there, it could have made a fortune selling hot showers at whatever price it cared to name. As it was, staying dirty seemed the lesser of two evils. The only way to clean up was to clamber down to a cold, snake-infested river. Recreational off-road driving is really the mechanised equivalent of trail riding on horseback. The Rubicon Trail is its pinnacle but at four-wheel driving's broad base, thousands of American families climb aboard their vehicles every year and head for the wilder areas of their vast country. Some go on their own, others in convoy with a few other vehicles. They take tents, sleeping bags, plenty of food and water, petrol and oil. Plus, if they are wise, essential spare parts, some tools, a jack, an axe, shovel, towrope and CB radio. But is going cross country on four wheels the soft option? Compared with hiking or mountain biking - and I saw people doing both - I suppose it is. As for riding the Rubicon, I would not have risked a half-decent horse on the harsh, boulder-strewn terrain. I could see no signs of anyone having done so. Driving a Jeep has to be less physically taxing than using muscle power but it certainly is not easy. A week afterwards bruises traced the seatbelt's line across my body. The technique of driving across country as rough as the worst parts of the Rubicon Trail is to do everything very slowly indeed. If you tried to go quickly, you would smash the vehicle, an ugly prospect in a remote area. In four-wheel drive with the transmission in low range, a Jeep Wrangler's 4-litre engine has power enough at tickover to let it clamber over rocks the size of cabin trunks. If a boulder looks surmountable, you drive the Jeep's wheels over it. Never let the rock get under the vehicle. If you do, the axles ride up and you are stranded, wheels spinning in the air. Defiles of V-shape with a floor narrower than the Jeep's track are driven through with the sidewalls of the tyres wedged against the rock. It is cruel treatment for a tyre but the oversized Goodyear radials took it in their stride, as they did everything else. The Jeep Wrangler I used had automatic transmission which meant ignoring a cardinal rule of off-roading. This is to keep your foot off the brake pedal when going downhill and let the drag of the engine, equally distributed to all four wheels by the transmission, control your speed. But automatics, unlike 4x4s with manual gearboxes, tend to run away even when locked in low-range first gear so now and again slight braking was essential. It worked on the ultra-rough but basically grippy rock but would have been a recipe for disaster on the muddy hillsides European four-wheel drivers are used to. The Jeep, I am glad to say, is well protected underneath. However carefully I drove there was the odd crash and bang as the steel plates armouring the engine and transmission came into contact with boulders. But nothing broke. None of the 20-strong British team had any mechanical mishaps or, even more remarkably, any tyre trouble. Four-wheel driving in wild areas is a potentially controversial activity. In the Lake Tahoe area, the authorities and local people take a generally tolerant view. But not all approve. One of the toughest and roughest sections of the traditional Rubicon route was out of action last year. Militant objectors had used explosives to bring down tons of rocks and block the trail. The alternative route, though, could not have been much less testing than the original. The Forest Service of the US Department of Agriculture insists on managing off-road driving and has authorised the use of off-highway vehicles (OHVs) only on certain listed trails, the Rubicon included. It lays down a number of conditions which it says must be observed if the sport-cum-recreation is to have a future. This says: Tread only where motorised vehicles are permitted; Respect the rights of others to enjoy their activities undisturbed; Educate yourself on OHV rules and regulations; Avoid meadows, wildlife, livestock and private property; Drive responsibly to protect the environment and preserve opportunities to drive on public land. It was all very different 40 years ago when Mark A Smith organised the first Jeepers' Jamboree. Then, more or less anything went. But, as the sport became more popular and numbers of vehicles increased, so did an awareness that the environment was fragile and had to be protected. Smith stepped down as 'Jeepmaster' after last year's Jamboree but says he will retire from four-wheel driving 'probably when I die.' Now into his late sixties, he looks as rugged as the Jeeps he loves, and good for many years of off-road driving to come. If the participants in the 1992 Rubicon Trail Jamboree were anything to go by, Jeeping is a sport that mainly attracts the middle aged and over. Most couples in their 20s and 30s are probably too busy bringing up families to go four-wheel driving into the wild blue yonder. In any case, a wilderness is hardly the place to take young children. But when the call to that great off-road driving course in the sky finally comes, several Jeepers have chosen to be laid to rest in the land they loved to bang and crash about over. What look like their graves (actually, it is where their ashes were scattered) can be seen at one side of the Rubicon Trail. Headgear ranging from baseball hats to Stetsons was doffed by last year's participants as they lurched by, already dreaming of this year's event.</p>

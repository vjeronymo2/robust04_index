			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muzhir 'Arif: "The Model Official"] </F>   [Text] A model is a human and social case that begins from  the home and expands and grows up outside it. A good model leads  to the welfare of individuals and society in a particular  environment in a process of interaction between the model and  those who deal with it and are close to it. The opposite also  exists.    The model in general is between fathers and mothers, between  the administrative official with his employees and others, and  between the employee and the citizen. It is between the party  comrade and his comrades and the people who surround him in the  home, the town, and the party organization.    The son looks to his father and mother and to his older  brother, how they behave in life; he is affected by them and  learns from them. The student looks to his teacher and learns  much from him, taking on his character, though incompletely. The  employee learns from his superior, and the citizen first trusts  a particular employee and a particular department on the basis  of recourse to this employee and this department. I am not  calling for an ideal society in a material world. I cannot  dream, even for the sake of dreaming, of a nation of angels; for  that contradicts the nature of life, which is motivated by the  laws of good and evil, angel and devil. I am not looking for  miracles, whose age ended with the death of the Seal of  messengers and prophets, Muhammad (may God bless him and grant  him peace). I am seeking something else that unites idealism in  action and behavior with a lawful human livelihood through  legitimate gain and effort to realize a certain economic profit  in the spirit of fair and legitimate competition and no other  spirit. I am looking for teachers of the sort who taught us to  read and thereby acquired us as their servants--with a debt of  conviction and gratitude, not in the sense of the servile  slavery--after everyone has spoken and still speaks critically,  talking about teachers who have bestowed of their knowledge in  costly private lessons and have been as stingy as possible to  their students in the schools, colleges, and institutes. Some  have dispensed with formality between themselves and their  students not out of humility and to create bridges of trust  between the professor and the student and pupil, but for other  reasons basically material. I am looking for doctors who do not  give a patient in their private clinics more than they give to  one in the government hospital and the people's clinic--doctors  who do not force the patient to return three times to the  private clinic for diagnosis and go to a particular laboratory  and particular pharmacy on the pretext of the professional  knowledge of the laboratory doctor and the pharmacist. Of  course, I am sure that physicians need greater care by the  government in salary, provision of scientific resources, and  making a qualitative shift in the life of the physician and  pharmacist in various areas of scientific and social life. I am  looking for lawyers and judges who are great in all things, now  that time has buried the names of lawyers and judges who were  renowned for learning, knowledge, justice, and honesty in Iraq's  political and legal history. I am looking for sons who do not  call their fathers by their names or by nicknames such as "Abu  So-and-so," and for fathers who do not encourage their children  to smoke, drink, and do other things in the name of changing  times and overlook their truancy from school or lack of  diligence.    Party work had a sanctity, and the party official was an  object of respect: such was secret party life in Iraq. Thus it  was and thus it ought to be in public life, but society's  shortcomings have left their mark on the life of many party  figures from the point of view of the people. The meeting no  longer retains its old spirit, as I, who am not enrolled in any  party, hear. The meeting has come to be regarded as one regards  a job that permits vacations, laxity, and absence for various  excuses and pretexts.    What will others do when the traffic policeman neglects to  fasten the seat belt in his car, goes through the light, and  crosses the street not at the crosswalk? How can someone sick  because of smoking heed the advice of his attendant physician  who smokes?    How will an employee deal with a citizen when his superior  deals bureaucratically with him? What position will the citizen  take toward an official who gives him such and such advice,  while not carrying out anything he has promised to do?    Aristotle says that anyone who would do good should avoid  its  opposite, or else he will be called evil. In political science  it is an error to retreat from a gain that a group of people has  realized for the entire nation. In government departments and  institutions the anger of an official often leads to  unacceptable measures against a particular employee or group of  employees for various reasons. As everyone knows, any number of  thank-you letters cannot prevail against a letter of sanction  against a certain employee. We thank God that our nation has  preserved its historic characteristics of courage, generosity,  and patriotism. Yet certain individuals from this great nation  have deserted "village ethics" in the name of progress. Using  the blockade as a crutch, they justify theft itself. They  justify bribery by the persistence of the blockade and the  complexity of economic life. They regard crime as something  normal under such circumstances, as something similar to what  goes on throughout the world, though in mitigated form. Among  these people are some who have good social and professional  positions. Where is the model in this type of person in the  positive sense?    The inferior will continue to regard the superior with an  eye  of wonder, admiration, and the force of the ideal and the  principle, or with an eye of disapproval. My following proposal  may seem difficult to realize, but it is not impossible to  implement. Simply stated, it calls for electing the model  official at the level of ministers, governors, district  administrators, and institution heads--with this or another  title--in accordance with the standards and principles contained  in the revolution and the thoughts and views of the leader  Saddam Husayn for behavior that will not be so negative and that  will not occasion disapproval and pain on the part of the  majority. There are those who commit excesses because their  director or section chief, if it is a government department or  institution, scorns creditable behavior and dealing despite the  slogans he has raised among his employees and others concerning  work, serving the people, developing the country, and following  the principle of criticism and self-criticism by officials.  Being essentially members and supporters of the Ba'th Party, the  latter must, as the leader Saddam Husayn has recommended, carry  the party's traditions into their departments, not the reverse.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Omo detergent sales plunge Sales of Unilever's new Omo washing detergent have fallen by about half during the past week after a negative consumer report on the product, according to a survey by the Dutch national news agency, ANP. Last week the Dutch Consumers' Association said Omo - sold as Persil Power in the UK - did 'too great' damage to some clothes. Unilever rejected the report but has confirmed that sales have fallen, though by not as much as in June when the first negative reports appeared. Rival detergent maker Procter &amp; Gamble of the US has mounted a highly critical public campaign against the Anglo-Dutch group's new product.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Treasurers tune in to medium-term note programmes THE line between a corporate treasurer hitting a borrowing target or missing it can be very fine indeed. Five basis points (0.05 of a percentage point) may sound a small, almost insignificant fraction, but to an aggressive corporate borrower it makes all the difference. One result of this relentless pursuit of finer terms is the rapid growth of a medium-term note market in Europe, in some places in direct competition to the public Eurobond market. Medium-term notes have traditionally existed between the short-term commercial paper markets and bond markets. As with commercial paper, an MTN programme acts as a shelf registration, providing a platform of documentation for a borrower to issue debt instruments whenever needed. The terms of each issue of notes (currency, maturity or perhaps an extra twist, for instance linking the notes to an equity index) are picked to match what investors want at any particular moment. In return for providing tailor-made debt instruments, borrowers demand - and usually get - keener borrowing terms. Some treasurers are now learning that, rather than just dribbling out notes, they can use the same documentation to launch large-scale, fully underwritten issues that look and taste just like Eurobonds. That is unlikely to spell the death of the public Eurobond market, though it is already creating an alternative. Using MTNs 'saves cost and time,' said Mr Peter Yngwe, treasurer of Swedish Export Credit (SEK), a frequent user of the Eurobond markets. 'It could make the difference between doing a transaction and not doing it, that is the significant thing.' SEK set up an MTN programme in the Euromarkets a year ago and issued Ecu100m of one-year notes in a quasi-Eurobond offering. 'If it's a short maturity, the costs can be a significant point,' said Mr Yngwe. He estimated using the MTN route, rather than a Eurobond, saved between five and ten basis points. The savings come from the fact that an MTN programme can be re-used constantly, spreading the costs of setting it up, while a Eurobond offering is a one-off event. 'You spread your cost across a larger number of bonds,' said Enterprise Oil, which created an MTN programme in the US a year ago (the Euro-MTN market is not yet liquid for maturities of more than five years, Enterprise said). The oil company has used its programme both in the traditional way, feeding Dollars 150m of notes to investors in digestible pieces over a number of months and by launching a fully-underwritten Dollars 100m issue of 10-year notes. Other borrowers which have recently set up Euro-MTN programmes also expect to use them as an alternative to public bond markets. Two building societies, Halifax and Leeds, said they expect the programmes to be useful in a broad range of ways. One use could be to refinance existing Eurobond issues: Halifax's Eurobonds date back as much as five years, soon after the mutually owned societies were first permitted to borrow in the capital markets, and refinancing could be done through MTNs. How far will this market grow? As the chart shows, a growing proportion of borrowing in the domestic US debt markets is being done through MTNs. The Euro-version of this market, though immature by comparison, saw new programmes set up with a total theoretical limit of Dollars 42bn, compared with Dollars 31bn the year before. One thing above all is likely to hold the market back: a perception by investors that MTN issues are illiquid, compared with Eurobonds. The perception stems largely from the fact that new note issues are generally small and are not made fungible (interchangeable) with earlier issues under the same programme. That raises fears among investors that there is no depth to the market and that it would be difficult to sell a large holding with ease. Mr Ingwe said that in theory, liquidity for large issues should be the same, whether a company issued paper under a Eurobond offering or through a note programme. But he added: 'Theory is one thing, reality another.' Many investors will only buy Eurobonds. 'We have to go to the investor,' he said. Some bankers go further and claim that liquidity is actually better in the note market than the bond market. The argument runs like this: prices in the secondary Eurobond market are determined by market-makers, many of whom set their prices according to what they believe they could get for the bonds by selling to another market-maker. Aside from the original lead manager to an issue, they have little commitment to market making and no continuing responsibility for the issue. When bonds come on to the market they can ricochet between market-makers, driving down the price. MTN dealers, on the other hand, say they have a continuing relationship with the issuer and are therefore committed to the programme. So if they are offered bonds in the secondary market, they will make more effort to place the paper with investors, helping to keep the price closer to true value. Being a dealer is 'a public commitment,' said Mr Keith Phair, associate director of NatWest Capital Markets. This argument over market structure ignores one important point: that ultimately, prices are determined by what end-investors will pay for them, and that banks only prosper by selling paper through their distribution arms, whether bonds or notes. If investors, whether rightly or not, believe that notes are less liquid than bonds, then fewer will buy them. This in turn helps to keep notes less liquid. This circle will only be broken when enough investors have dipped their toes in the water and concluded that notes are not so bad after all. With the growing number of treasurers who want to use such funding structures, that day is getting nearer all the time.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cambodian People's Party [CPP] will soon operate  its own television and FM radio stations. According to a  high-ranking party official, the Information Ministry granted  permission last week for the television and FM radio stations to  be set up and air their programs to the public.    Mr. It Samheng, deputy cabinet director of the CPP,  stressed:  Technicians have made all the necessary arrangements to proceed  with the construction as soon as possible. They are awaiting  the final decision on the selection of a site. The technicians  have to choose between two locations for the station. The first  is the present party office compound and the second is the  former party office, located behind the Botumvaddei Monastery.  It is likely they will pick the current party office as the  site for the television and FM radio stations.    The official went on to reveal that the television and FM  radio stations will not be the CPP's exclusive property. They  belong to a private company operating under the name ABK, which  is completely locally owned. No details have been made  available, however, on the shares the CPP holds in ABK or the  duration of the venture. The party official affirmed that the  television and radio transmissions will not be used as a tool  against television and radio stations belonging to any other  party. They will contribute toward serving Royal Government  policy and the king's national reconciliation policy and will  propagate news of all kinds to serve socioeconomic development  in the interest of the general public.    Although he did not mention any economic considerations,  some  economists have observed that television and radio stations are  prime sources of considerable income from commercial  advertisements.    Some circles have expressed concern that these particular  television and radio stations might become rivals to Radio FM 90  megahertz and Television Cambodia, widely known to be run by the  FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party. Others have said it  is merely a CPP attempt to get even with FUNCINPEC, especially  in preparation for the elections in the next 4 or 5 years.    It is understood that the television and radio stations of  the State of Cambodia, formerly under CPP control, were returned  to government hands the day the election results were announced  last June.    This CPP television will be called "Television Angkor,  Cambodia." No one knows yet how powerful this television and FM  radio station's transmitter will be. According to Mr. It  Samheng, it has been projected that in the initial stage the  station will have the same power as TVK, the present  government's national television network. In the future, its  transmitting power will be enhanced to equal that of IBC  [International Broadcasting Corporation].    It should be noted that the power of the present  government-run television station is about 1 kilowatt, while  IBC's is about 10 kw.    When the CPP's television and FM radio stations become  operational, there will be four television stations and five [as  published] radio stations in Cambodia: the government's  television and radio, IBC television, FUNCINPEC television and  FM radio, CPP television and FM radio, and Phnom Penh's radio.  Not long ago, it was rumored that Kandal Province was planning  to run its own radio station. This project has since been  aborted.</p>

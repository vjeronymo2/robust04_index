			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Endre Csurka, chairman of the Pest county </F> organization of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party: "The  Fruits of the Pact Have Matured"]    [Text] The first round of the elections made it clear that  the pact between the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] broke the national forces.  It also became clear why it was so important for the late  Jozsef Antall to destroy the Smallholders Party and to separate  the national wing from the core of the MDF. National radicalism  and national thought suffered a serious defeat because the broad  strata of the society voted in favor of the "gulyas communism."  Istvan Csurka already saw it in 1992, something that the MDF  was still unable to see, namely that Antall's policy aims at  breaking the national right wing.    The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is expected to have  such  a big number of mandates in the new parliament that it will also  be able to legislate the two-thirds majority laws alone and it  will not need the SZDSZ as the advanced bastion. If they accept  the SZDSZ in the government, they will only do so in order to  maintain the appearance of a coalition. They will allow a few  liberal victories in some places in individual election  districts, but a national party will only be able to make it  into Parliament from list elections. The national parties  together will not reach the number of votes given to the MSZP.    The law on former policemen [active during the repression  following the uprising of 1956] came too late, and so did the  uncovering of some irregularities by the television; these  things could no longer influence the public mood. Power over  the press should have been instituted long before the elections,  in 1990, and the press has now proved what kind of destruction  it is capable of carrying out. With constant pessimistic  anti-national manifestations and in the spirit of Aczel's  continuity, the press succeeded in contaminating the people's  mood with the idea that today it is much worse than it used to  be in the old regime, and there is a lot of truth in this.  However, in this country, people who are living better are also  complaining.    The MSZP-government will try to avoid street demonstrations  and, therefore, it will consume and distribute the hard currency  reserves and will temporarily restore the sham-prosperity of the  "gulyas- communism" by carrying out a pseudo improvement in the  standard of living, and when it finally destroyed the Hungarian  national wing and consolidated its power, the MSZP could also  give the impression of democratic elections.    Hungary is becoming similar to the South-American countries,  and the nomenclature-careerists have taken over the entire  economy, they are the big capitalists, they control the press,  and now they have also obtained political power. It will be  easy for them to put up a show of democratic elections every  four years, because they control everything, including the  banks, the army, and the police. A few economic trials  disguised as criminal trials will come now, with the toughest  and most radical opposition members as victims. We can expect  the leadership of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] to  be among the first victims, but many more people will celebrate  the MSZP power in prison.    Aware of the results, it is clear that the government has  three weeks more to turn something in its favor, and if they  fail to do this, the national forces will be left with a single  choice in this country, namely the street. Aware of the events,  there is only one way of halting the victory of the MSZP, namely  if the second round of elections is unsuccessful for them  everywhere. Therefore, I call upon the national forces and  parties, including the MDF, the Christian Democratic People's  Party [KDNP], and the Smallholders Party, to boycott the votes  and make a second round impossible. Only people who want the  return of the old regime should go to vote in the second round.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS COMPLEX, POLLS SHOW;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY -- HOME OF THE HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC  </P> <P> Orange County is a state of mind.  </P> <P> Over its 100-year history, dreams, big plans and fantasy have played a vital  role in turning this seaside desert by stages into bean fields, citrus groves,  thriving communities, theme parks, marinas, airports, shopping malls, and  booming centers of technology.  </P> <P> New arrivals continue to drive median home values to levels that are among the  highest in the nation. In each of the last three decades, 500,000 new shoppers  have made the pilgrimage to this swap meet of the American dream.  </P> <P> And, Times Orange County Polls indicate, once they become residents, they  continue to believe in the dream.  </P> <P> An astonishing 96% of those polled say that they are happy, and one-third go so  far as to agree that "Living in Orange County is the closest thing to paradise  in America today."  </P> <P> A majority -- 51% -- say they prefer living in the county to anywhere else.  Only 3% would rather live in New York City, and a mere four respondents in a  polling sample of 600 prefer Los Angeles. What's more, the pollsters did not  find anyone over the age of 35 who wanted to move to Los Angeles County, even  though about one-half of the adults lived there at one time.  </P> <P> "You're talking about a major rejection of not only Los Angeles, but of a past  life," said Mark Baldassare, whose firm, Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates,  conducted the poll for The Times on Jan. 13-17.  </P> <P> The survey, together with others taken in previous years, offers a kind of  statistical portrait of Orange County residents, and the image that emerges on  Orange County's centennial is not of a conformist community but of one  attempting to balance competing goals: personal liberty against a safe,  crime-free environment, a strong national defense against low taxes, and  effective use of the national political system against a suspicion of  Washington.  </P> <P> The polls also indicate that social expectations and values are far more  complex than the county's reputation as a leading center of conservative  culture might suggest. What has been true through the county's 100-year history  still holds today: There is nothing simple or predictable about the response of  its residents to a host of social issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Abortion Issue  </P> <P> For example, despite their political conservatism and although about one-third  say they accept a literal interpretation of the Bible, a majority of Orange  County residents oppose a ban on abortions or on the rental of X-rated  videotapes. An earlier survey shows that they also tend to be more tolerant of  homosexual rights than the national average.  </P> <P> In present-day Orange County, shifting values and other signs of profound  social change do not seem to have produced the widespread sense of dismay or  disorientation they occasionally did in past generations.  </P> <P> Historians have attributed the appearance of a virulent Ku Klux Klan in the  1920s and the ultraconservative John Birch Society in the 1960s to the sense of  social disarray brought on by waves of newcomers and by economic development.  </P> <P> Today, changes in the economic environment are more profound than previously,  but the public appears to have taken it all in stride.  </P> <P> The most recent Times Orange County Poll, which has a margin of error of plus  or minus 4%, shows that while there is a keen awareness of persistent problems,  optimism is endemic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Are Happy  </P> <P> For many, the survey indicates, this may be that rare community where fantasy  and reality coincide -- 56% of the respondents called themselves "very happy,"  and 40% said they were "somewhat happy," while only 4% said they were "not too  happy."  </P> <P> When a nationwide survey asked the same questions a year earlier, it found that  only 34% described themselves as "very happy."  </P> <P> But if Orange County is pleased with itself, it also admits concerns. Asked  what is the biggest social problem facing youth in the county today, 45% of the  respondents named "drugs," 18% chose "no sense of values" and 13% said  "alcohol." No other choice got more than 8%. When the same question was asked  about social problems facing adults, alcohol moved to first place with 28%, a  lack of values remained second at 16%, lack of work ethic moved to third at 15%  and drugs was fourth at 14%.  </P> <P> The Times polls and other evidence do reveal one major area of discontent with  the county itself -- traffic and growth. The revolution of unbridled growth  that has marked the very essence of Orange County has been betrayed by traffic  gridlock and smog. Now the idea of curtailing growth -- and indeed government  planning of growth, once a dangerous heresy -- is a popular cause. Conservatism  in Orange County turns out to be highly pragmatic, that which does not work is  rejected and, as a result, planning is no longer a curse word.  </P> <P> "For the last three years, three out of four residents named traffic and growth  as the main issues facing the county," Baldassare said, referring to the annual  survey of the county conducted by UC Irvine. "Everybody agrees that something  should be done but there is no consensus on who should do it and how to pay for  it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Cost-Free Miracle  </P> <P> A number of surveys show that most people think car-pooling is a solution but  most don't want to car-pool. There is no agreement on how to pay for improving  the freeways. In concept, residents approve of mass transit, but in practice  use of mass transit has declined, and most respondents say it is not a method  of commuting that they would use. "What it comes down to is that people are  hoping for a miracle that won't cost them anything and that will allow them to  commute the way they always have, which is driving alone in to work,"  Baldassare said.  </P> <P> In the current survey, those who would prefer to live elsewhere object  primarily to growth and traffic, and the largest group among those who would  leave -- 17% -- said they would choose "rural America."  </P> <P> But if they reject the urban environment of major cities, Orange County  residents are not provincial. In two decades there has been a 600-fold increase  in companies doing business here, and increasingly workers are transferred  about by high-tech corporations so that many of those here are newcomers from  other parts of the world or nation. The county's residents also represent a  very large concentration of personal wealth, with 40% of families having  incomes of more than $50,000 a year.  </P> <P> The newly cosmopolitan nature of the county may account for the complexity and  contradictions of its political and social views.  </P> <P> The county remains highly conservative in voting patterns but somewhat less so  in self-identification. When polled, two out of three respondents identified  themselves as middle of the road (31%) or as somewhat conservative (35%). Only  10% called themselves very conservative, while 19% said they were somewhat  liberal and 5% called themselves very liberal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Predictable  </P> <P> And, as polling data indicate, there is nothing "monolithic" or in any other  way predictable about the views of county residents, including Republicans, on  the more controversial issues.  </P> <P> Not only are they more tolerant of homosexual rights and more inclined to  oppose banning abortion than respondents in national polls, but they also are  less inclined to cut social spending to balance the federal budget.  </P> <P> When asked in the 1986 UCI Orange County Annual Survey, "Do you think that  homosexual relations between consenting adults in the privacy of their home  should be legal or illegal?" 67% said such activity should be legal and 27%  said illegal. Nationally, in a Los Angeles Times Poll that same year 53% said  it should be legal and 35% said illegal.  </P> <P> And even with a conservative government in Washington, county residents appear  to feel alienated from national governmental power. Although the county voted  overwhelmingly for the winning candidate in the last three presidential  elections, those polled in The Times' most recent survey stated by a 5-1 margin  that the government in Washington responds to the large corporations rather  than people like themselves.  </P> <P> Even among Republicans, 46% said that the federal government responds most to  the needs of major corporations and only 15% said it responds to people like  themselves.  </P> <P> There seems to be no strong inclination to want government to set standards of  individual morality even on issues like pornography and sexual abstinence among  teenagers.  </P> <P> Asked whether the moral climate in their community was permissive or strict,  66% said permissive, and they apparently like it that way -- 69% of those  polled approved of the community's moral climate. This was a sentiment held  across the board, from those who classified themselves as liberal to those who  called themselves conservative.  </P> <P> The issue of abortion does offer a clearer example of a split between  liberal/moderate and conservative factions. Here, while 60% of all those polled  opposed a Supreme Court ruling that would ban abortions, 74% of those calling  themselves liberal opposed such a ban and 65% of the moderates opposed it. But  even among those calling themselves conservatives, 48% opposed a ban, while 47%  favored one.  </P> <P> On social spending issues, conservative opinion again does not conform to the  national stereotype. A solid majority across the ideological spectrum support  health care for the elderly, and fewer than 3% in any group say they are  unconcerned about this issue.  </P> <P> The poll also shows that a majority across the ideological spectrum are opposed  to cutting social and health programs "in an effort to reduce the federal  deficit." Even among those who call themselves conservatives, 52% oppose cuts  and only 35% favor them.  </P> <P> Being a conservative in Orange County has nothing to do with denominational  religious preference; 47% of Jews, 49% of Protestants and 48% of Catholics say  they are conservatives.  </P> <P> The breakdown only varies with those who say that they would call themselves  religious fundamentalists. One-third of those polled said they are  fundamentalists in the sense of "someone who takes the Bible literally on  issues such as the creation of life." In this group 56% say they are  conservatives, but even here more than 40% say they are liberal or moderate in  political orientation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diversity of Views  </P> <P> While references to fundamentalist Christians in the media have tended to imply  a uniformity of outlook on social issues, this Orange County survey indicates a  more complex set of views.  </P> <P> For example, a majority -- 52% -- of those who identify themselves as  fundamentalists do favor a ban on abortions, but a strong minority -- 41% --  are opposed to such a ban. And while 45% in this group favor a ban "on the  rental of adult X-rated movies in home video stores in your community," 47%  oppose such a ban.  </P> <P> The survey also suggests that political conservatives in the county are  rethinking their foreign policy views. It shows that only 23% of conservatives  and only 8% of liberals regard the Soviet Union as the "biggest threat to  America's future." At least 30% of conservatives, moderates and liberals alike  name the Third World as the main threat and at least 20% in each group name  Japan.  </P> <P> "We're witnessing the emergence of a new type of conservative in Orange  County," Baldassare said, "someone who is young and affluent, sophisticated on  social issues and traditional on economic ones."  </P> <P> Times researcher Nina Green also contributed to this report.  </P> <P> ATTITUDES IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> These are some of the results of a poll of 600 Orange County adults conducted  for The Times by Mark Baldassare and Associates. The poll has an error factor  of plus or minus 4%.  </P> <P> HAPPINESS  </P> <P> "Taken all together, how would you say things are going these days? Would you  say you are very happy, somewhat happy or not too happy?

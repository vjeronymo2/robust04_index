			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XXXV_Designation of Paying Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS section 242.205(1) is revised to allow a department or agency payment office to serve as paying office for a contract assigned to the Defense Contract Management Command if authorized by defense financial management regulations. The revision also deletes the Air Force payment office for missile propellants as these contracts are now paid by Defense Financial and Accounting Service (DFAS).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XXXVI_Reports of Government Property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS section 245.505&hyph;14 is revised to transfer requirements for contractor reporting on Government property to a new clause at section 252.245&hyph;7001, Reports of Government Property. In addition, the DD Form 1662, DoD Property in the Custody of Contractors, has been revised to delete the certification requirement and to clarify reporting instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XXXVII_Precious Metals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS section 245.607&hyph;2(b) is revised to reflect the procedure initiated to streamline the process associated with the recovery of precious metals. The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service is prepositioning annual disposition instructions for certain categories of precious metals with DoD contract administration offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XXXVIII_Notification of Proposed Program Termination or Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This interim rule replaces the interim rule which was issued as Departmental Letter 93&hyph;007 on August 9, 1993. It incorporates revisions necessitated by section 1372 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XXXIX_Title to Contractor Acquired Property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS section 251.106(b) is deleted because the inconsistency in FAR, that section 251.106(b) was designed to correct, has been remedied. FAR section 51.106(b) was amended by FAC 90&hyph;16 to raise the threshold under which title to contractor acquired property in contracts with educational institutions vests in the contractor. The $1,000 threshold in FAR section 51.106(b) was increased to $5,000 to be consistent with the $5,000 threshold in Alternate II of the clause at FAR section 52.245&hyph;2 and Alternate I of the clause at FAR section 52.245&hyph;5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XL_Carbonyl Iron Powders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS sections 225.7014 through 225.7014&hyph;3 and the clause at section 252.225&hyph;7023 were removed by departmental letter 94&hyph;001, effective February 14, 1994, to delete the restriction on acquisition of carbonyl iron powders. Language restricting acquisition to powders manufactured in the United States or Canada was in the FY 93 Defense Appropriations Act but was not in the FY 94 Defense Appropriations Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XLI_Coordinated Acquisition Assignments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS appendix B is amended to show that the Defense Logistics Agency has only a partial assignment for certain classes of items within Federal Supply Group 36.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XLII_Appendix G Update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS Appendix G is amended to update activity address codes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XLIII_Reflagging or Repair Work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS sections 247.571 and 247.573 were revised and section 252.247&hyph;7025 was added as an interim rule by departmental letter 94&hyph;002, effective February 25, 1994, to implement section 315 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160). Section 315 places restrictions on performance of reflagging or repair work on any vessel used under a time charter contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Item XLIV_Aircraft Fuel Cells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DFARS sections 225.7021, 225.7021&hyph;1, 225.7021&hyph;2, 225.7021&hyph;3, and 252.225&hyph;7038 were added as an interim rule by departmental letter 94&hyph;003, effective March 7, 1994, to implement section 8090 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act (Pub.

Section 8090 prohibits using fiscal year 1994 appropriated funds to procure aircraft fuel cells unless such cells are produced or manufactured in the United States by a domestic-operated entity. The clause in section 252.225&hyph;7038 is to be included in all solicitations and contracts involving fiscal year 1994 funds, unless a waiver has been granted in accordance with section 225.7021.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

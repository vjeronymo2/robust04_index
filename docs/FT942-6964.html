			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Observer: Appetite for war Good food and drink can help the delicate process of negotiation, in business as in diplomacy - but surely entertaining the warring Bosnian factions at the famous Pere Bise restaurant in Talloires is going a bit far? The three Bosnian delegations - Serbs, Croats and Moslems - together with the five-nation group from the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - have requisitioned four top hotels in the picturesque resort on Lake Annecy. None of this comes cheap. Dining out at Pere Bise can cost up to Pounds 100 a head - and that's without wine. Talloires was chosen ostensibly because the resort can effectively be sealed off from the disruptive attentions of journalists and camera crews. Even so, nothing much is expected to come out of the discussions. Perhaps that's not surprising. If aggression is rewarded so handsomely, why not go on fighting?</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Dresdner Bank chief warns EC PRO-EUROPEAN sentiment in Germany could be put at risk if the European Community persists in treating the integration of the former GDR as a purely German problem, according to Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Dresdner Bank. 'Unfortunately, it is virtually taken for granted in Europe that the federal republic must deal with the economic integration of eastern Germany alone,' Mr Sarrazin said in a rare meeting with the press. 'But there is an inconsistency here: why, for example, should southern Italy, parts of Greece and Portugal, and French agriculture be seen as European problems, while eastern Germany remains a purely German affair?' the bank chief asked. Such questions had to be taken into account in the move towards European economic and monetary union, Mr Sarrazin told a Frankfurt journalists' club. He was responding to past criticism that Germany maintained high interest rates to the detriment of its recession-hit partners. They had been unable to lower rates because of the constraints of the European exchange rate mechanism in which the D-Mark played the role of anchor. He acknowledged the link between unification and tensions in the European monetary system, which culminated in last month's widening of the fluctuation bands in the ERM. Redeveloping eastern Germany required additional capital which could only be attracted with high rates, Mr Sarrazin said. The ERM adjustments were a compromise between the 'impracticable' extremes of a French franc devaluation or German interest rate cut to relieve pressure on the French currency. In the end a solution was found 'at the cost of the EMS'. The new arrangements, and the 'disturbing' de facto revaluation of the D-Mark, reduced export opportunities for German goods and could also 'cause a dangerous uncoupling of the D-Mark', Mr Sarrazin claimed. Pro-European feelings among the German population and in all the relevant political parties should not be put lightly at risk in Brussels, for example, with proposals that the costs of unification should be wholly concentrated on Germany through a unilateral D-Mark float. This was one of the suggestions put forward at the ERM crisis meeting which led to the mechanism's effective suspension in early August. 'It is not feasible on the one hand to seek to bind Germany firmly within Europe, and then leave it alone with its eastern problem,' Mr Sarrazin maintained.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Spot lights way to futures: Deborah Hargreaves looks at prospects for the development of a gas contract on the London commodity exchanges The creation of a gas spot market in the UK could be the forerunner of a futures contract on one of the London commodity exchanges. It would be traded in the same way as natural gas futures in New York, where gas distribution was deregulated more than 10 years ago. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank which has proposed a structure for a wide-ranging daily spot market, set up Natural Gas Clearing House in the US 10 years ago. Natural Gas Clearing House, in which British Gas owns a 30 per cent stake, has evolved into the largest independent gas trader in the US. A spot market could be organised by Natural Gas Clearing House or another market operator such as London's International Petroleum Exchange. Once the market structure was agreed the industry would put out to tender a contract for running the market. The reason for setting up a daily market is the need to ensure that gas supplies in the national pipelines network are balanced each day when British Gas loses its monopoly over household supply in April 1996. Temporary imbalances in the pipeline system can arise suddenly when the weather turns colder and the pipelines operator needs to find supplies at several hours' notice. If no supply was found householders could see their gas cut off. Morgan Stanley envisages its market operating as a forum for shippers buying and selling gas to each other on a daily basis as they try to balance supply and demand. British Gas's pipelines division, TransCo, will be able to come to the market if it needs emergency supplies. At the end of the day, the market operator will calculate a weighted average price which can be used by the industry as a market reference price. TransCo would be able to use the pricing structure if it needed to buy gas on behalf of shippers that were temporarily short of supplies. If a shipper failed to provide enough gas to fill the needs of its customers, TransCo would need to buy gas to balance the system. The pipelines operator could then use the daily price set by a spot market to charge the shipper for the gas purchased. Mr Mark Higson, director of network operations at Ofgas, the industry regulator, said: 'The advantage of developing a liquid and transparent market is of key importance for attracting competition to the gas business. Without a market like this there is a danger that trading could be dominated by one or two large players.' A daily spot market could evolve into a market for next-day or month-ahead supplies as traders became accustomed to using it. Once its liquidity became established it would be likely to attract brokers not involved in the gas market.</p>

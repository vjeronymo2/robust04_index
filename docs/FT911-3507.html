			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Further increase in pupils attending independent schools THE NUMBER of pupils at independent schools has risen for the eighth successive year, according to this year's annual report from the Independent Schools Information Service (ISIS), Andrew Adonis writes. Some 476,448 pupils, 7.4 per cent of all school children, currently attend 1,372 independent schools. That is up from 6.3 per cent in 1983. The number of boarders has fallen sharply, however, down some 4 per cent on last year. The number of secondary-age pupils has fallen slightly since last year but there has been strong growth at the other end of the spectrum. The number of three-year-olds in private schools is up by 7.6 per cent on last year. Pupils aged four are up by 5.4 per cent and those aged five to 11 up by 1.8 per cent. The number of boarders fell sharply, down 4 per cent on last year. School fees have risen by an average of 12.5 per cent over the last year. They now average Pounds 3,594 for day pupils and Pounds 6,672 for boarders. One in four of all pupils receives financial help with fees, mostly from the schools themselves. The government is to spend Pounds 100,000 on a work experience scheme for students considering a teaching career. After a pilot project last year Mr Michael Fallon, the schools minister, announced that 400 places will be available for a similar scheme this autumn. Government proposals issued yesterday giving parents a say in the appraisal of teachers' performance were immediately attacked by the second largest teachers union as opening the system to influence from parental 'gossip and tittle-tattle'.</p>

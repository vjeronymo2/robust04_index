			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Japanese mortgage lender to file for bankruptcy In another blow to Japan's fragile banking sector, Nippon Mortgage, one of the country's largest property-backed lenders, is to file for bankruptcy, according to company sources. It will be the third largest corporate collapse in Japanese post-war history. The company, whose largest shareholder, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corporation, said yesterday it had endorsed the planned liquidation, has been in difficulties since October 1991. It has debts estimated at Y473bn (Dollars 4.78bn) in short and long-term borrowings. A formal announcement of the lender's decision is expected by the end of the week and the directors will file for voluntary liquidation by September. The company owes an estimated Y120.1bn to Sumitomo Trust, Y27.1bn to the Industrial Bank of Japan, and Y25.3bn to the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. At March 31 it had assets of Y454.7bn, and liabilities of Y518.4bn. Some estimates put its non-performing loans at 90 per cent of its total loan book. The bankruptcy is certain to send alarm bells ringing in the Japanese banking system, already struggling with mounting bad debts. Nippon Mortgage was set up by Sumitomo Trust and two property companies in 1982 to specialise in property-related lending, an activity from which banks were largely excluded by government regulations. Many banks established similar mortgage companies in the 1980s to take advantage of the surge in the country's property prices. Following the collapse of the so-called 'bubble economy' at the end of the decade, most of them have been left with enormous portfolios of non-performing loans. Banks have been criticised for failing to write off or make sufficient provisions for bad debts. In the year ended March, Sumitomo Trust made provisions for bad loans of just Y80bn. Industry sources put its likely write-off of loans to Nippon Mortgage at about Y90bn. The Ministry of Finance said the company's performance had been carefully monitored because of the high proportion of its loans that were known to be non-performing. But Mr Atsushi Nagano, deputy director-general of the ministry's banking bureau denied that the collapse would precipitate a financial crisis since there were no individuals among its creditors.</p>

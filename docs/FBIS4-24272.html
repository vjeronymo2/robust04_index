			<p>BFN     [Text] The Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda  Enclave-Armed Forces of Cabinda [FLEC-FAC] recently abducted  three traditional leaders in Belize District, Cabinda Province.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified official] In fact, three  traditional leaders were abducted by FLEC-FAC recently. I do  not know what the causes of the abduction are. I cannot say  anything else because I am still investigating the issue. It is  only known that they have been detained. Maybe it is because  they are traditional leaders linked to the government.    [Unidentified correspondent] According to reports you have,  are they in a good health?    [Official] Well, recently we received a message from the  Belize District administration saying that they are being  ill-treated and run the risk of being killed. Two days ago,  however, I received a report from the Belize administrator  saying that they are in good health and have a limited freedom,  but they are still in the hands of FLEC.

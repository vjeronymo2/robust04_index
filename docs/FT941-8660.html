			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Bonuses soar as Kleinwort doubles Kleinwort Benson yesterday confirmed high expectations for the results of UK investment banks by disclosing that its 1993 pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 111.7m, compared with Pounds 45.1m the previous year. Kleinwort's 2,770 employees also gained heavily from the strong trading conditions in financial markets, and a rise in underwriting and advisory work. It said that 'the bulk' of a Pounds 72m rise in expenses was due to increased bonuses. After excluding a Pounds 9.2m profit from selling Sharps Pixley, its bullion and metals business, earnings per share rose to 56.4p, compared with 26p, and the pre-tax return on equity rose to 26 per cent from 11 per cent. Although profits were higher than expected, shares closed 20p down at 632p, partly because of concerns about whether Kleinwort's earnings could be sustained this year. Some Pounds 121m of income came from dealing profits, against Pounds 61.9m. The final dividend was 12.5p, creating a 15.6 per cent rise in the total payout to 18.5p. Lord Rockley, chairman, said dividends had 'not progressed much in the past few years, but we are hoping to embark on a period of growth'. Lord Rockley said Kleinwort had strengthened its position in advisory work and equity underwriting. It had worked with governments on 45 privatisations in 16 countries. Fees and commissions rose by 67 per cent to Pounds 239m. Lord Rockley said this showed Kleinwort had stabilised earnings by diversifying away from volatile net interest income. Profits from investment banking, including treasury and capital markets operations, rose 290 per cent to Pounds 76.1m, while investment management profits rose only 3 per cent to Pounds 26.4m. Kleinwort said investments in new ventures in India, Japan and the US, had depressed investment management profits. Lord Rockley said the figures 'disguise a substantial change in the business' which would help earnings this year. It disclosed new details of its sources of income to comply with an EU directive. It gained from a net release of bad and doubtful debt provisions of Pounds 700,000, against provisions of Pounds 7.6m in 1992. Background, Page 21</p>

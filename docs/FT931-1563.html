			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Move to help disabled in work A PILOT scheme to keep disabled people in work was launched yesterday by Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary. The scheme, initiated by the Royal National Institute for the Blind, is being backed by Barclays Bank, McDonald's and Midland Bank, as well as organisations in the public sector. Newly disabled employees will be assessed to see whether they can continue to work after retraining or whether adaptations are needed to their work environment. The RNIB said people who become disabled often resign, take ill-health or early retirement before proper thought is given to how they could continue in their jobs or be redeployed.</p>

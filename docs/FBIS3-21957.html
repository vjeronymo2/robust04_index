He  was a textile trader and about 50 years old. He had sustained  knife wounds. This is what an AFP release has indicated pending  any further official police statements. We were told on 15  March that "investigations have only just begun."    The victim was kidnapped on 6 March by individuals who  claimed to be members of the Nigerian religious brotherhood,  "Manatari Save Yourself." The group had up until then been  unknown in Cote d'Ivoire. It is reportedly based in Kaduna, 700  km northeast of Lagos.    The kidnapping was reportedly a case of settling of scores  among drug traffickers. Five Lebanese nationals, the victim not  included, who are reportedly "top brass" living in our country,  reportedly failed to refund the 333-million-CFA-franc profit on  cocaine sales in 1992.    There is great anxiety within the Lebanese community pending  Criminal Investigations Department findings.</p>

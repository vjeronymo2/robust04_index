			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway forecast to move into second place in oil exports league A sharp rise in oil production and the commissioning of several new fields in 1995 is expected to make Norway, western Europe's biggest crude producer, the world's second largest oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia next year. According to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, Norway's oil liquids production will rise from 2.66m barrels a day this year to 2.97m in 1995, before peaking at 3.22m in 1996. Production is projected to dip to 3.11m b/d in 1997 when it begins a sharp downturn into the next century. Domestic oil consumption averages 170,000 b/d, leaving net exports of 2.5m b/d this year, compared with second-placed Iran's shipments abroad of between 2.4m and 2.7m b/d on wellhead output of 3.6m. So far this year, Norway's production is running 10 per cent ahead of last year's levels - even with large output losses due to annual field maintenance in August and September - but could end 12 per cent up on 1993. However, official production forecasts could be conservative, as new technology and enhanced oil recovery methods have allowed oil companies to avoid precipitous declines in output in recent years. Alongside continuing production growth from fields such as Brage and Draugen, which started up during the past 20 months, and the hook-up of smaller fields into existing production systems, the largest single increment next year is expected from the 220,000 b/d Heidrun field in the mid-Norwegian Haltenbank region. Troll West oil, at 160,000 b/d, is scheduled to come on stream late next year along with the 60,000 b/d Statfjord North satellite. Earlier this month, the 40,000 b/d Statfjord East field commenced production but PIW anticipates that, given capacity limitations at the central processing platform, output from the prolific Statfjord field may have to be curtailed to allow maximum production from new fields. The Norne field, due to start production July 1997, will add 160,000 b/d to output, but pending the outcome of negotiations between oil companies and the government on participation rates and royalties, the timing of other Haltenbanken developments remains uncertain, though Norway is keen to extend production at the highest levels possible over the longest period of time.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of State that took over the  administration of Kiribati after the fall of the government on  Tuesday [24 May] has called on all people to remain calm.  Chairman (?Tekaria Tamuera) says the council will honor all  agreements signed by the former government and will continue all  government programs until a new president is installed.    The Council of State consists of the speaker of the  parliament, the chairman of the Public Service Commission, and  the Chief Justice. Radio Kiribati says it's not known at this  stage when the general elections will be held, but the  constitution demands that they must take place within three  months of the dissolution of parliament.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking to Air Force officers who visited Tapos  Ranch in Ciawi today, President Suharto said that firm action  should be taken against protesters involved in destruction  because the acts of these irresponsible persons are detrimental  to society. He reminded that a permit is basically needed for  every demonstration. The government will tolerate such a  demonstration if it is within normal limits. If, however, the  demonstration is exploited by irresponsible persons and leads to  destruction, firm action will be taken against them.</p>

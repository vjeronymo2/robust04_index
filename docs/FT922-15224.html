			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Bonds: European Investment Bank issue causes controversy THE European Investment Bank yesterday provoked controversy in the international bond market, launching a new issue which was shunned by many leading underwriting firms and seen by many as a threat to market profitability. The Ecu400m 12-year deal was lead-managed and largely underwritten by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, which identified substantial demand for long-dated Ecu bonds. However, most recognised Ecu bond firms declined to take part, arguing the pricing and fee structure chosen by the issuer offered no return to underwriters. The bonds were issued at 100.66 per cent, with full fees of 2 1/8 per cent. Hence underwriters owned the issue at 98.535, where the bonds yield 4 basis points more than Ecu bonds issued by the French government, the sector's benchmark. Deutsche Bank supported the deal at this lower level. Intermediaries can only make a return by selling the bonds at a higher price than quoted by the lead manager. A group of nine mainly continental European banks opted to participate in the deal on this basis, hoping to sell the bonds to retail accounts. The EIB has caused controversy with earlier bond issues which have been handled as 'block trades', wholly underwritten by a single firm with only small fees. For a transaction of this maturity, underwriting fees are normally 30 to 35 basis points, or 0.3 to 0.35 per cent of the total amount raised. The EIB has shaved underwriting fees below 10 basis points in some recent transactions. However, these earlier deals were sold at a fixed price which guaranteed participants at least a slender return. The lead manager fixes the price at which bonds must be sold to investors, usually at a level which guarantees a minimum return to underwriters. The system was introduced to protect the profitability of intermediaries. Deutsche Bank said yesterday it had firm demand for the bonds at a yield spread of around 4 basis points. Its underwriting risk was, therefore, slight. However, many firms complained that abandoning the fixed price re-offer method of syndicating new issues would damage primary market transparency, since each participant in the deal could sell the bonds at a different price.</p>

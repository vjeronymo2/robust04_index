			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Assault on red tape is launched THE government will examine more than 6,000 pieces of legislation and 2,500 forms as part of its review of red tape affecting businesses, Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday, Charles Batchelor writes. At the same time, the Institute of Directors launched a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of over-regulation and to promote measures to reduce burdens on business. Mr Peter Morgan, institute director-general, said small companies in particular faced a 'systems overload' when dealing with regulations. Mr Hamilton told an IoD seminar that government departments were expected to complete their reviews of business legislation within a few weeks. They will then assess their impact on business and decide how they can reduce the burden. From April departments will carry out a rolling review of regulations to ensure that pressure is kept up to minimise their impact. Mr Hamilton will make monthly reports to the prime minister on the performance of ministries. Departments often under-estimated the impact of regulations, Mr Hamilton said. The Home Office had estimated the cost of new fire regulations at Pounds 1.7bn, but the Association of District Surveyors had calculated the cost at Pounds 8bn.</p>

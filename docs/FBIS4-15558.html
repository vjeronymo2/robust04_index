			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Anna Melnikova, ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 April -- "The technical error that  appeared in the Russian president's instruction of 5 April will  undoubtedly be subject to serious investigation within the  presidential structures responsible for preparation of this  document," Sergey Kravchenko, deputy head of the Russian  president's administration, stated today in the Kremlin in an  exclusive interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent.    He explained that instead of the words "military  installation," which can be understood as a technical facility,  a term "military base" has crept in, which radically changes the  meaning of the document.    Sergey Kravchenko said that "a special commission for  investigation into the circumstances surrounding this case will  be set up in the next few days." In his view, it can be set up  "by the president himself or the head of his administration."  The deputy head of the Russian president's administration did  not rule out the possibility of "this being not just a technical  mistake but a political action aimed at disrupting the meeting  between the Russian and Latvian heads of state."</p>

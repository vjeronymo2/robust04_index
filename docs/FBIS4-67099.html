			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Make The Facts Clear"] </F>   [Text] There is a rumor that a U.S. Government office has  seized assets in San Francisco worth some 30 million baht  belonging to Thanong Siriprichaphong, a member of parliament  from Nakhon Phanom. To date no one--including the Thai  Government and the Office of Narcotics Control Board--has been  able to confirm or deny the rumor.    We feel the Thai Government and the House of Representatives  have a duty to clear up the facts on this issue. This is  because regardless of whether the rumor is true, the MP's party  and the House will suffer damage, as will the country's  reputation. Even if the seizure of assets did take place, the  question of whether the MP's conduct conforms with the  accusation is another matter.    The concerned U.S. authorities may have seized the assets in  line with the relevant U.S. law, but it does not mean we have to  believe the U.S. accusation is true. On the contrary, the Thai  Government must carry out its own inquiry to provide justice to  a Thai citizen. In this context, the U.S. Administration's role  in dealing with the Singapore Government in the case of a caning  sentence against a U.S. citizen is no different.    It is strange that the Thai Government does not seem to be  paying much attention to this issue. This is evident in the  fact that it was the private news agency INN that broke the  news, and no Thai agency has been able to confirm or deny the  story. This is despite the fact that the Office of Narcotics  Control Board maintains regular contact with the DEA to exchange  information on the arrest of narcotics traffickers. We wonder  what the government has been doing, or whether it is considering  using this issue as a political weapon to cover up the bombing  reports or discourage the opposition's planned no-confidence  motion.    It is becoming a joke that instead of benefiting from this,  the government could be suspected of planting the rumor or using  it to subdue the opposition. We feel that if the government  promptly verifies the story and clears up the facts it will gain  credit. If the Nakhon Phanom MP is guilty as charged, no one  can help him.</p>

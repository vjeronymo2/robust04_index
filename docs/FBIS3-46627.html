			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Special Article by Michio Watanabe, Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] member of the House of Representatives, entitled:  "Ozawa-Style Reform Is Pursuing its Objectives Too Hastily."]    [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], after losing its  rein on government as the result of the general elections, seems  to have lost its self-confidence and to be on the verge of  flight. The coalition government asserts it will carry on the  LDP's policies, and for all that, the LDP cannot change its way  of thinking. However, it cannot be construed to be in a posture  determined to regain the reins of government when the party  president utters the same thing as what Prime Minister Hosokawa  says and party members appear in television programs only to  criticize their party's defects in expectation of popular  applause.    I am fully aware of the uneasy feeling of those who remain  in  the LDP amidst the spreading atmosphere that they have lost the  chance to climb aboard the bandwagon now that Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] has split off and the coalition regime enjoys  high popularity ratings. However, now is the time for the LDP  to make clear and have the people understand how it differs from  the coalition regime and be ready to launch the battle to win  back power in the near future. The LDP must apologize to the  people for what it must reflect upon and prepare for the battle.    The objective, however, is not to regain popular support and  win the elections. The objective is to have the people  understand what will be done with the power regained by the  victory and how what it will do differs from what the coalition  cabinet will do. I am telling young politicians frequently: "I  do not think you have become politicians to put a badge on your  lapels. Go ahead and do in a dignified manner the things that  you wanted to do in becoming politicians."    It is still fresh in everybody's memory, so I cannot say it  crisply, but let me say it. In the wake of post-general  election confusion, many of my colleagues held me back from  being a candidate in the election for the LDP presidency for  which people of other factions recommended me. I dared to run  because I wanted to make clear the difference between the LDP  from the coalition cabinet as well as my thoughts and ideas to  recapture power to, first of all, bring business out of  recession. Miscalculations led me to failure, but I feel a  responsibility at all times since I received forty percent  support.    After the coalition government came into being, business  conditions worsened. The people are bewildered by the statement  of Prime Minister Hosokawa who defined the pre-war Japanese  activities as the war of aggression, and they are wavering in  their trust in the state. Such difficult problems are left  untouched and unsolved as the state of the Self-Defense Forces,  introduction of the consumption tax, and cutting the income tax,  pension reforms, and liberalization of rice controls. The  coalition government is fond of using the term "sense of  versatile values," which means adjustment of versatile  interests. And progress is not made in these political  fundamentals due to the lack of seasoned political personalities  and the disunited response of the eight groups. Above all, the  underlying discordance among the coalition about the political  reform which is the sole adhesive that puts the coalition  together is widely known. Flowery catch phrases such as  decentralization of power and deregulation are spoken of, but  politics is not a forum.    I would say that now is about the time for the coalition to  emerge from the period of the "wakaba mark" [the symbol mark of  a novice driver, hence meaning political freshman]. In the face  of a violently changing time of internationalization, the people  are disturbed if the government deals with such a situation  leisurely. It is vital to possess a fresh sense, but the  management of state affairs requires appropriate experience.  Cars driven by inexperienced drivers are precarious, even if  seasoned instructors of driving schools help control the  accelerators.    Now is the time, I think, that Japanese politics should be  retaken into the hands of the professionals who have upheld its  traditional liberalism, by fighting out the struggle for power.  Our running about in confusion only serves our adversary's  advantage. We have to read again the LDP's platform, and only  those who resonantly agree with that spirit are urged to unite  to create a new future. It does no good to follow the examples  of the new political parties because they are popular. I think  it is important to clarify the difference in vision and the  different way of exercising power. As a result, if we come  together in our ambitions, it is more than natural for us to  sweat it out for the people, discarding all the past  complications.  <H5>  `Good Power' and `Bad Power' </H5>   I was one of the three candidates, including Messrs.  Miyazawa and Mitsuzuka, for the LDP presidency two years ago.  At that time, I put forward "Honne [real intention] and  Determined Leadership" as my slogan. To develop Japan as a new  world state, I offered the following as the essence of my  vision: One, changing Japan to an honorable nation among the  comity of nations; two, building up a social system in which a  free economy with a society guided by the greying generation  does not lose its vitality; three, bringing forth a society in  which an affluent heart is enjoyed in daily life. I appealed  that now is the time for Japan to challenge the taboo that it is  a historical inevitability that a prosperous nation will perish.    At that time, the Keiseikai was the largest faction and,  as a matter of reality, it was impossible to become the LDP  president without the faction's support. Press reports had it  that Mr. Ozawa, acting Keiseikai chairman, understood my  assertions. Indeed, Mr. Ozawa's "A Plan To Reform Japan" has  many points in common with my thoughts. The election ended with  the formation of the Miyazawa cabinet, at the nomination of Mr.  Kanemaru. Since then, I have found myself many times in  agreement with Mr. Ozawa in political ideal and policy matters.    The reports that Mr. Ozawa and I might take the same action  because of these factors are based only on an aspect of politics  at this time. Contrary to many things in common in policy  matters, I am saying this because our way of thinking is  drastically different as it stands now about how to use power to  realize these policies. However the mass media may agitate, I do  not think actual politics would work without ideals and policy  going hand-in-hand with the way of using power to materialize  them.    The realities of power that make the eight-group coalition  possible do not match with my ideals. I mean that I cannot  participate in power that is supported by the majority which  includes not only the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  which is out of the question, but also Soka Gakkai [a large  religious group which supports Komeito -- Clean Government  Party], the exclusive --going against the principles of  liberalism -- organization of the faithful of the Ikeda sect  that was excommunicated by Nichiren Shoshu [religious group].  The word "power" tends to be misunderstood, but I want to  distinguish it clearly between "good power" and "bad power." Out  of the question is worldly power in pursuit of status, honor,  and gains. What I mean by "good power" is a democratic process  with the aim of materializing policies. It requires me to win  the elections and control the majority--but in doing so, the  basic standards of following rules and sharing the same ideals  must be observed.    Politics without ideals nor policies would do no good, but  if  politics can be managed only with ideals and policies,  professors can make a prime minister. On the other hand, those  bent on getting ministerial posts in pursuit of worldly position  and gain are what they call politicians. What I call "good  power" is the power -- the technique that materializes political  ideals and policies step by step through compromise with reality.    Someone said to me: "Mr. Watanabe, Max Weber had said the  same thing as you say." According to them, Weber is quoted to  have said: "Politics means efforts to get a share of power and  exert influence over the distribution of power. It is a matter  of religion what the entities that exercise power should be."  Mr. Ozawa's "beliefs" -- as I interpret by reading his "A Plan  To Reform Japan" -- have many identical things with my  "beliefs." As the matter stands now, "the efforts to exert  influence over the distribution of power" are not the same.  However, it may be permissible to a certain degree as was seen  in the case of bartering policies with other parties when the  consumption tax was passed.  <H5>  Why Leadership Was Lost </H5>   The LDP's ideals, as can be defined from its platform, may  be  summarized as follows: Social order should be based on free  competition; importance should be attached to public interests  as well as human rights; the economy should be a market economy;  and in diplomacy, national interests should be considered within  world harmony. The actual LDP policies, however, were quite  different. And many of them succeeded. During the postwar  period when growth was considered a priority and when Japan  attempted to get rid of poverty, growth was encouraged by  providing subsidies and controlling free competition. And many  such handicaps still remain in today's Japan whcih has become an  economic power. In reality, it is a fact that the peculiar  situation that Japan is a defeated nation has saved her from  sharing the costs of international society, and that momentum  continues as short-sighted insistence on national interests.    It was always the LDP that has dealt with such reforms with  the ideal of a political party professing traditional liberalism  as its foundation. These are the Japan-U.S. declaration of  alliance during the Ohira cabinet, the civilian  vitality-introducing programs and administrative reforms during  the Nakasone cabinet, the introduction of the consumption tax  during the Takeshita cabinet, undertaking the peacekeeping  operations during the Miyazawa cabinet and so on. I am  astonished to find men of various political parties that  expressed opposition to these reforms at those times are sitting  in the cabinet ministers' seats of the coalition government,  ignoring past claims and tactfully using statements as a  minister on one occasion and beliefs as a politician on another.    Today when Japan has become a world economic power and the  world structure based on the Cold War between the U.S. and the  Soviet Union has collapsed, the LDP and few of the then  opposition parties had ideas to change diplomatic and economic  policies and social systems. The problem was that some members  of the LDP were dissatisfied with the speed with which reforms  were undertaken. One of the reasons behind the delay in the  reforms can be traced back to a lack of leadership.    I, myself, hate talking in a roundabout way as well as in  indecisive terms. There were times when realization of policies  was delayed and the nation despaired in the confusion due to a  lack of leadership.    In "A Plan To Reform Japan" are found the following  passages: "The power of the LDP regime is divided between the  LDP and the government;" and "it is the problem of how to free  the prime minister's power which has been contained by  convention and bad customs under the 1955 order." As Mr. Ozawa  acknowledges, in the LDP prior to the Tanaka cabinet there was  vitality originating from severe power struggles between the  mainstream and nonmainstream factions as well as the leadership  of the party president-prime minister.    Why did that leadership disappear? The primary reason was  the two-fold structure of power that Keiseikai of the Tanaka  faction, the most influential and largest intraparty faction,  gained giving it the key to decide who would head the regime  without producing prime ministers, except Mr. Takeshita, thus  actually controlling the party. The power structure of the  coalition government is quite similiar. Political parties are  the foundation of the parliamentary cabinet system, and they are  the eight groups that form the coalition. But their power and  the power of the Prime Minister's Office are apparently divided.  It is the same structure of the then LDP which was the target  of criticism. I wonder how Mr. Ozawa is assessing this point.    Keiseikai, however, was split by the unexpected resignation  of Mr. Kanemaru as the faction's chairman. The best way to  accelerate reform would have been for Keiseikai to keep a simple  majority within the party and to maintain its unity without Mr.  Kanemaru's resignation. I heard that Keiseikai was trying "to  win 200 Diet members over to its fold" and it might well have  been true. The second way to accelerate reform without causing  intraparty friction with other factions is to introduce  principles of competition in politics under the two-party system  with Keiseikai in the center. The prerequisite for this idea is  reform in the electoral system, and the two-party system -- or  the two great powers -- were to be born as the result of such  reforms.    "The process of political reform I had in mind was, first,  reforming the system, followed by political realignment," Mr.  Ozawa honestly confided. If the political world were  reorganized as the result of changes to the system, a cabinet  could have never been formed by the eight groups of different  basic ideas, causing anxiety over crisis management in both  diplomatic and domestic affairs.    Kanemaru's resignation came like a bolt out of the blue. The  ensuing struggles for leadership and dividing membership into  "reformists" and "old guards" are hard to understand for  outsiders. But it was true that they were divided over how to  proceed with political reform as well as reform in the electoral  system. Then came the split, the dissolution of the House of  Representatives, and the formation of the coalition. Mr. Ozawa  is a man indifferent to such worldly power as honor and status,  but it seems to me that he is too hastily pursuing "good power."    When the eight groups of different basic ideas employ the  same method to grasp power as intraparty factions do by  mustering enough supporting members, I wonder which group will  take the responsibility for the failure of "efforts to exert  influence over the distribution of power" in executing  diplomatic as well as domestic affairs, irrespective of the  righteousness of the "things" over which the power is exercised.  It is awful to think of it.    Mr. Kakuei Tanaka was a politician of foresight and with  power of execution. Because he was too hasty in seeking power,  "right things" seemed to have resulted in incompleteness. I am  the kind of man who has a hasty temper, and therefore I persuade  myself "less haste, less speed." As for Mr. Ozawa, who is  reported to be studying the Meiji restoration, I hope and expect  him to perform the role of Toshimichi Okubo whom he is said to  respect, not the roles of Shoin Yoshida or Ryoma Sakamoto who  were too hasty in pursuit of their objectives. Or he may be in  the state of Takamori Saigo's mind, since he has no big ambition  for worldly status.  <H5>  Coalition Cabinet Is `Provisional Being' </H5>   Assuming the coalition cabinet of eight groups of different  basic ideas to be an inevitable provisional shape for the  purpose of speeding up reforms, a question is posed: What  should the future shape of the Japanese political world be?  Before answering that question, let me introduce interesting  exchanges in the Diet.    Mr. Imazu [Rep. Hiroshi Imazu of Hokkaido's 2d Electoral  District] raised a question: "Is the present regime a  provisional being?" Deputy Prime Minister Hata answered: "It  could be defined as either a provisional or an unavoidable  measure." Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said: "We will hold  fast to the aspiration that we are not a provisional cabinet."  Mr. Ochi [Rep. Michio Ochi of Tokyo's 3d Electoral District]  asked, "What is the central uniting element of the two big  powers?" and Prime Minister Hosokawa answered: "That depends on  the kind of political cause put forward at a given moment."    I suppose Shinseito has feelings in the back of its mind  that  the coalition of the eight groups of different basic ideas is  not hitting it off together after all. The remarks of Prime  Minister Hosokawa were beyond political common sense, either due  to the fact that he unintentionally revealed the lack of basic  ideas or because he has always been riding on a winning horse.  As Mr. Ozawa pointed out, "Reform of the electoral system is  the means for reforming politics, and the objective itself." In  my opinion, a coalition can be successful when its component  members share common basic political ideas that direct both  diplomatic and domestic affairs.    Whether the next general election or the one following it  are held under the new election system depends on the future  political situation. But the elections under the single-seat  electoral district system are expected to succeed in fixing the  present framework of the LDP and non-LDP camps. It is all the  same, even if the current coalition were an "unavoidable  measure" or were formed "by a political cause at a given time,"  because the coalition is inevitably required to unite to defeat  LDP candidates. What is the motive of Shinseito, which  considers the present situation to be a provisional one and  which is proceeding with the objective of achieving a  "nonprovisional" political reorganization? The fact that the  coalition includes Komeito, which is bent on participating in a  regime without definite ideas, makes the matter complicated.  Memoranda of former Komeito Chairman Junya Yano in articles  published by the monthly magazine BUNGEI SHUNJU vividly expose  who is exerting influence over both foreign and domestic affairs  through Soka Gakkai and Komeito.    When viewed from the standpoint of the people, I would  rather  suggest seeking the possibility of a coalition among those  sharing common ideas (such as the LDP, Shinseito, Sakigake, and  the Japan New Party), by discarding personal feelings and  bygones prior to the elections held under the single-seat  electoral district system. These were the appeals I made when I  ran in the last election for the LDP presidency. We have to  immediately adjust the LDP platform and draw up a chart of  political reorganization in which the LDP is placed in the  center as a traditional political party of liberalism determined  to serve the nation under a vision appropriate to the times.    I am confident that the LDP can win back popular support if  it presents a new vision -- one different from the coalition --  with the aim of making Japan more peaceful and its people  happier than the coalition cabinet can, thus demonstrating the  LDP to be a traditional political party of liberalism with clear  responsibility and vitality. If the LDP takes an ambiguous  attitude devoid of the most important ideals because it is  distracted by the current situation, its efforts to return to  power cannot help being termed presumptuous.    Because the foreign and domestic policies of the Hosokawa  cabinet are inconsistent, the LDP is encouraged to be more  assured about its past achievements. An example is the  catchphrase of "deregulation." Abolishing and setting up  controls must be based on firm political ideas. Do the eight  groups of the coalition have these?    How many professional politicians who can carry through the  persuasion of those concerned (including those supporting the  coalition) do they have? As for the field of domestic affairs,  I think that the LDP should have more confidence.    In foreign affairs, the concepts of the coalition are more  contradictory. While Mr. Ozawa insists on Japan's becoming an  "ordinary nation" with "strong national concepts," Prime  Minister Hosokawa repeated in his answers at the Diet that he  "would not take that course." With respect to this point, the  SDJP is out of the question, and Komeito is ominous because it  takes elastic stands. Therefore, I advise the LDP to be more  confident about this.    The eight groups of the coalition are in a state of chaos in  which "those who give priority to popular opinion" and "those  who give priority to the public interest" are mixed together in  terms of the basis of their political thinking. I predict that  they will come to a deadlock sooner or later. And that is a  problem for the Japanese people. To avoid that situation, the  LDP must do its utmost to let the people know the merits of the  LDP's policies. I plan to make appeals to the nation myself to  clarify our foreign and domestic visions and policies in  concrete terms. Those assembled under the banner of traditional  liberalism must be confident and must make efforts to win back  "good power."    To not be carried away by the atmosphere and to not forget  essential things, I want to mention several points proposed by  the Hosokawa cabinet. Because the coalition maintains that it  will continue the ideas and policies of the LDP regime, I agree  with its catchphrases -- all of them. But the problem is how to  carry them out, not the proposals. It is important to pay  attention to essential problems and not to pay too much  attention to winning popularity.  <H5>  Government Political Reform Plan Inclined To Control </H5>   There is no perfect election system. The current  medium-sized election district system has both merits and  shortcomings. To our regret, both voters and politicians became  used to the system because both of them have employed this  system for so long. Most scandals were the results of their  failures. The medium-sized election district system alone  cannot be blamed. Rather, all the political parties have become  accustomed to the situation in which there have been no changes  of government since 1955, and then the dregs of the 1955 order  overflowed.    The LDP's perennial hold on power is not the sole fault of  the LDP. I think that it was due to the good-for-nothing  political parties headed by the SDPJ which have been unable to  present better policies than the LDP to the people and to win  their support. Also, the government actually did change hands  under the medium-sized election district system. But it is an  extremely unstable regime composed of a coalition of eight  groups with different basic ideas. Currently, discord is evident  in the Diet debates, and I wonder how the Japanese Government  would respond to such hypothetical situations as military  tensions on the Korean peninsula or demands for peacekeeping  operations. On the assumption that the United States will throw  the SII [Japanese-U.S. structural impediments initiative]  fastball, I think that there should be a stable government  responsible for Japan's fate.    Since the LDP is reflecting upon the habitual practice and  inertia [idling away while having done nothing new] it enjoyed  during its long period of one-party rule, it is inevitable that  political reform will seek a situation under which two political  parties with stable foundations for establishing an  administration will work hard together to respond to the wishes  of the people. For that purpose, I personally consider the  single-seat election district system to be the best system. In  consideration of the small political parties, however, the LDP  proposes the heiritsu system [which adds the element of  proportional representation], and I think that this is the  second-best plan.    Under the medium-sized election district system, a plural  number of candidates from the same party compete in the same  electoral district to make it an election of individuals.  Contrarily, under the single-seat election district system,  political parties are in charge of the election campaign.  Voters can vote only for candidates who political parties have  nominated for their districts, and party organizations rather  than individuals become the center of activity. Therefore,  political parties have to decide such matters as the selection  of candidates, the method of the election campaign, and the  distribution of election funds and personnel in accordance with  open and fair rules.    Under the medium-sized election district system, candidates  and voters both have freedom of activity and room to act as  freely as they like. Therefore, in some cases, voters and  candidates abuse their freedom under the medium-sized election  system, and this excessive freedom has come under criticism. In  a free economy, speculations and corners are permitted. But,  for that matter, those who go to extremes will be criticized as  "wicked merchants." It is a matter of business morals and the  human nature of individuals.    Under a rationing system, "wicked merchants" may be  eradicated, but the situation without them may be no better than  the situation with them, for the benefits of a free economy will  be lost while black marketeering and the corruption of the  bureaucracy begin. Now that a reform of the system has begun,  close attention must be paid so as to not lose sight of the  important and essential things.    There are two things that I worry about. One is that the  council under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office  controlled by ruling parties is commissioned to zone single-seat  election districts. The other concerns subsidizing political  parties and especially the use of such funds, the auditing of  which the Audit Board plans to carry out. It is feared that  both of these contain a lot of systematic possibilities under  which the activities of opposition parties and politicians might  be interfered with by public authorities, especially the ruling  parties. The coalition's political reform plan gives off a hint  that it would be a controlling one. On the other hand, it must  be pointed out that political parties have no legal  personalities; they are not juridical persons under civil law.  The land and head office buildings occupied by the LDP, SDPJ,  Komeito, and so on are owned by third persons, and legal  violations are committed by renting them for unreasonably low  rents. As an old Chinese fable says, he who suggests it should  be the first to do it -- and political parties should be given  legal personalities to make their responsibilities clear before  subsidizing them. I think that something like a "political  party law" is necessary to make the rights and responsibilities  of political parties clear and at the same time to protect them  from public authorities.    Now I will repeat what I have been saying for years.  However good are the reforms of the system, they will be  rendered useless unless the voters and politicians who utilize  them are awakened to what they can and should do. Politicians  are said to reflect the voters who choose them. Politicians  worthy of the voters will be elected for the districts where  voters cast their votes only on the basis of the legislators'  own activities. In parallel with efforts to let people know the  role played by politics, nationwide campaigns to clean up  elections and the political world should be carried out, just  like the traffic safety campaigns conducted from elementary  schools to regional communities. However heavy are the  penalties that are applied, traffic accidents will continue to  increase if traffic safety campaigns and education are stopped.  I earnestly propose that national campaigns be launched to  clean up the activities concerning elections.  <H5>  "Lessening Public Intervention" Rather Than "Deregulation" </H5>   Japan's autonomy system is called "sanwari jichi"  [literally,  30-percent autonomy, referring to the situation of local  governments losing independence and power]. It is said that you  do not have to be a governor to know that the central government  intrudes too much. Authorities for granting permits and licenses  and the source of funding are concentrated at the  central-government level. Therefore, it is hard for local  governments to proceed with administrations which match the  localities. The idea that projects and funds for projects  directly connected to people's daily lives are to be  decentralized to the local autonomous level is very welcome.    In this case, it has not been clearly visualized, for words  proceed ahead of concrete plans concerning what level of local  autonomy is being considered for decentralization. In "A Plan  To Reform Japan," a concrete concept was made public under which  the country would be divided into 300 "cities" -- in other  words, into living administration areas. Although it is not  discussed, it is thought that prefectures will remain as they  are today, but it is not clear which will receive the  decentralized authority and funds -- "cities" or prefectures.  It is not clear either what will become of chartered cities  [cities with a population of over 500,000 designated by the  Local Government Act to have a status similar to that of  prefectural governments] that are bigger than the new "cities."    Relations between governors and newly established "cities"  pose a big problem. If governors are to be entrusted with  decentralized authority, "cities" which are really in charge of  local autonomy will be deprived of the authority to grant  permits and licenses and the source of funding to new local  governors, although they will be freed from the supervision of  the central government.    I think it is rather important to drastically transfer the  authority of prefectures to cities, towns, and villages.  National government officials cite adjustments among prefectures  and unified standards applicable nationwide as reasons for  opposing decentralization. Similarly, opposition may be raised  by prefectural governors because adjustments are necessary among  "cities" and for administrations covering areas larger than  "cities." Meanwhile, a province-state system is proposed in  view of the need for adjustments among prefectures and  administrations for areas bigger than prefectures. I am all for  decentralization, but for the benefit of the inhabitants I think  it necessary to review and adjust relations between cities,  towns, and villages, and between prefectures, provinces, and  states.    Everybody says that the natural course to follow is to  "transfer sources of revenue to local governments, in proportion  to the amount of responsibilities to be transferred to  localities from the central government." But the matter is not  so simple. Imagine that certain tax sources are transferred to  prefectures or cities, towns, and villages. They may be good as  sources of revenue in such rich metropolises and prefectures as  Tokyo, Osaka, and other rich cities, towns, and villages, but  this might not be true in the case of Shimane Prefecture, where  the authorities to be transferred would not bring in adequate  sources of revenue. To solve the problem, functions must be  sought to adjust sources of revenue in localities. At present,  such roles are handled by the Ministries of Home Affairs and  Finance. Decentralization contributes to strengthening the  authority of the Ministries of Finance and Home Affairs in  relations between the central and local governments and in  boosting the powers of finance bureaus of prefectural  governments in relations between prefectural governments and the  administrations of cities, towns, and villages.    Contrary to the fact that central government agencies have  exerted influence over local autonomy through subsidies with  strings attached, now, for example, the status of such  ministries as agriculture, forestry and fisheries, construction,  transportation, and health and welfare, and so on, will be  downgraded while the power of the Ministries of Finance and Home  Affairs, which will handle sources of funds in the form of  outright grants without strings attached, will be increased.  Images and words seem to be exceeding the importance and  desirability of decentralization. It is hoped that concrete  proposals will be made. In my opinion, the realistic thing to  do first is to transfer as much authority of the central  government as possible to prefectures, and as much prefectural  authority as possible to cities, towns, and villages.    Young children are taken care of by their parents. They are  taught at schools. But they may be interfered with at times and  regulated by guidance and rules. When they are grown up, nobody  will help them, although they will be free to do as they wish.  The selfishness of wanting to be free to do what one wishes and  at the same time to be helped will not be allowed. During its  poverty-stricken postwar period, Japan persisted in its priority  production efforts to catch up with and surpass the United  States. Both enterprises and individuals grew up under the  government's protection, assistance, and regulation. Because it  has become the world's top economic power, Japan wants to "act  like and be treated" as an adult, and that is what deregulation  is, in my opinion.    There are plenty of annoyingly persistent and  good-for-nothing systems, as well as complicated procedures to  receive permits and licenses. It is natural to wish for  efficient systems after getting rid of the aforementioned bad  systems or deregulating them. I support wholeheartedly the  revision or abolition of systems unsuited to the times, because  these are the fundamentals of administrative reform. The  fundamental principles for carrying out reforms are free choice  and personal responsibility. One cannot hope for both a  relaxing of regulations and at the same time continued  protection and subsidies. The catchphrase "deregulation" may  receive a favorable popular response, but we have to clarify the  principle of self-responsibility. Otherwise, we will end up  with a whitewashing and say that we are generally in favor of  deregulation but that we oppose its details. The most important  thing is an ability to adjust conflicting interests and to  demonstrate leadership in decision-making and its execution. I  doubt whether the eight-group coalition can do this.    In my opinion, the correct expression is "relaxing state  intervention" rather than "deregulation." State intervention in  a market economy means such things as getting taxes cut by  special measures, receiving subsidies, getting interest rates  reduced, having competition controlled, and asking the  government to revise the system. Realistically speaking, it is  not so easy to abolish all state intervention and to allow  everything to be ruled by the market mechanism. On the  contrary, there are regulations and intervention which are  required to meet the demands of times. These are such things as  welfare in a society whose members are aging, meaning pensions  and medical care and so on; environmental problems; controls  over private rights to land, meaning housing problems; city  planning, and so on. Whether these are needed or not is a  political decision, but the consensus of opinion is that a  number of outdated regulations and instances of intervention  continue.    When everything is left to the tender mercies of the market  mechanism and free competition, the strong will survive while  the weak are sacrificed, and colossal monopolies will appear.  It is a problem to discern the "truly weak" from the  "self-styled weak." The United States has difficulty as a  multiracial country, and one of the reasons behind its social  unrest is said to be the lack of state intervention in the form  of pensions and insurance which apply comprehensively to the  whole people. It is well known that the Clinton administration  has launched a review of the social security system. It is  natural that assistance and regulations will be introduced.  Japan, however, cannot compare to the United States in terms of  strict government monitoring and regulations against giant  monopolies.    Finally, to recognize public intervention, it is better  to do it in a way that the nation chooses and is thereby held  responsible for the choice. Compared to granting subsidies,  providing favorable treatment in taxation and interest rates is  easier to make self-responsibility apparent. Money borrowed  even at low interest rates must be paid back, while grants do  not. Therefore, high-rate subsidies tend to create excessive  investments. There is nothing more costly than attaining  something for nothing. Instead of widening the beneficiary range  for medical insurance, it is better to consider making private  medical insurance replete through favorable treatment in  taxation. I would rather place emphasis on indirect  intervention through market economics than through direct  intervention.  <H5>  Do Not Make Trade Surplus a Scape Goat </H5>   Japan's postwar diplomacy has consistently made note of its  peculiar situation that it is a defeated nation, and has  demanded exceptional treatment from international rule on the  grounds that its economy has not yet been rehabilitated. Thus,  Japan has succeeded in its maneuver to become the world's second  largest economic power. Now her movements and actions tend to  exert influence upon international society. Accordingly, Japan  is meeting a time when it has to make its mission and roles in  international society clear and fulfill its contribution in  accordance with the benefits gained from international society.  That is the condition for Japan to enjoy peace and guarantee  prosperity to its people. In the economic field, it has already  achieved plenty of records, but the problem is contribution in  noneconomic fields. It was the reason why I, during the LDP  presidential election campaign, stated: "Steer away from  economic power without ideals."    The collapse of the Soviet Union and disappearance of the  U.S.- USSR Cold War structure brought about the downfall of  peace through power tension. At present, a new world order  centered around the United Nations is being sought. While I was  foreign minister, Japan took a new step forward by participating  in UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and UN Peacekeeping Forces  (PKF). Under that decision, a number of Japanese shed sweat and  even lost precious lives in foreign lands. Because of these  efforts, Japan's international status in all diplomatic fields,  including economics, has improved greatly. It has become easier  to proceed with diplomatic negotiations. Dispatches of  Self-Defense Forces on PKO and PKF missions are not conducted by  the will of the Japanese Government only, but with the request  of the United Nations and the consent of the country concerned.  Therefore it does not violate Article Nine of the Constitution  at all. The legislation to make the dispatch possible was  drafted under such concepts and enacted through the Diet's  consent.    In addition to PKO and PKF, UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali  proposes the creation of the UN Alert Forces for the purpose of  maintaining order by preventing and terminating conflicts  through intervention. There remain many problems for Japan to  discuss with the United States such as transferring the command  of its troops to the United Nations to secure its influence in  maintaining world order. Sooner or later, Japan will be asked  to participate in accordance with Article 42 of the UN Charter.    I think Japan should naturally take part in them, rather  than  insisting on its peculiar situation. But as for its handling,  it annoys me that the eight groups that comprise the coalition  government are split in their opinion, despite the fact that the  matter is related to Japan's survival. Prime Minister Hosokawa  continues to make negative responses, and if he means it, the  coalition should be dissolved in view of a parliamentary cabinet  system.    In "A Plan to Reform Japan," an amendment to Article Nine of  the Constitution and another plan under new legislation have  been proposed from the legislative point of view, to open the  way to participate in the UN Alert Forces. From both a  realistic point of view and from the Constitution's  interpretation, I do not deem a constitutional amendment  necessary. The problem is that Mr. Ozawa, chief secretary of  the coalition's nucleus government party, and Prime Minister  Hosokawa, who is supported by the coalition parties, have  different opinions. Japan, as it is, can hardly break away from  "an economic power without ideals" to become "a country that  will work hard with the world."    As it stands now, the economic problems of the world cannot  be discussed without Japan, which has become an economic power.  Because of its economic power, Japan is considered as a possible  permanent member to the United Nations Security Council, an  international political organization. Japan could devote itself  to its policy of economic growth with light armament, because it  was protected under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the U.S.  nuclear umbrella during the U.S.-USSR Cold War. As a result, a  lightly-armed Japan with offensive economic power made its  appearance. As a consequence, Japan's trade surplus increased  year after year and as for now, the trade surplus problem has  become one of the biggest issues between Japan and the United  States.    The phenomenon, like the sole winner of a mahjong game,  brought Japan a series of difficult negotiations in maintaining  the free trade system. It is my opinion that the free trade  system is fundamental to Japanese prosperity and that all out  efforts must be made to protect the system to serve the national  interest.    To show that Japan is a country that competes on equal  terms, it has to respond as much as possible to the demands for  liberalizing and opening its markets. To transfer the huge  trade surplus earned by private enterprises to public assistance  programs, such as funds for foreign economic cooperation, people  must understanding democracy because they bear the burden. That  may be a difficult problem, but the government must persuade the  people to carry it out. And this can be effectively used as a  means to achieve new diplomatic objectives centering around  developing nations. Surplus reflux is an important point in  protecting the free trade system.    However, setting up import quotas of a controlled trade  nature and imposing compulsory export quotas to reduce surplus  will lead to denial of free trade itself. It is necessary to  see Japan's future in a broader perspective. One of the  important points in Japan's diplomacy is Japan-U.S. relations.  The United States is an indispensable country for Japan. With  the most friendly and most important nation, it is necessary to  negotiate through the most powerful negotiating means. Since  the biggest issue pending between the two nations is the trade  problem, Japan's negotiations with the United States will focus  on reducing Japan's colossal trade surplus. In relation to the  degree of Japanese cooperation in such international  contributions centering around the United Nations as PKO, PKF,  and so on and its participation in such international schemes as  providing assistance to Russia and so on, it is shuddering to  imagine what the Japanese position would be if it did not have a  trade surplus in view of its present light-armament status.    There are two directions to consider for the future. One is  to boost negotiating power in noneconomic fields and another is  to maintain negotiating power in economic fields. If unequal  treatment of foreign enterprises and foreigners exists at home  in the economic field, then they should be treated equally.  Further, the Japanese systems themselves should be changed one  by one to systems that can pass in the international community.  At the same time, research and development of new technology  should be expedited and the tax system should be revised so that  the desire to work is not hurt and productivity is improved.  Efforts to promote superiority at all times in international  competition must not be neglected. Blame must not be laid on  trade surplus, because surplus earned through fair competition  is the means of survival for lightly armed Japan.  <H5>  Measures Against Recession Transcend Political Reform </H5>   The biggest concern of the people for now is not transition  to the single-member election district system nor is it  providing public subsidies to political parties. Rather, it is  the emergence as quickly as possible, from what they call the  biggest and longest postwar recession.    I have continued to warn that the abrupt extermination of  the  bubble economy inevitably accompanies as many aftereffects. And  that is exactly what happened. Two years ago when those  aftereffects began to show, I made a series of proposals:  Interest rates must be lowered in the spring of 1992 and stocks  must be bought with public funds in the summer of 1992. While  my proposal with regard to stocks was partially implemented,  lowering interest rates was forestalled, thus making every  ensuing rate reduction less effective.    Government policy decisions tend to get delayed because  consultations must take place with those, most often  bureaucrats, who have a good grasp of statistics. To make  matters worse, there is the Diet, a time-consuming institution.  In the twinkling of an eye, three or four months are wasted.  Budgets for things like emergency measures should be quickly  dealt with, as long as their objectives are not mistaken.  Perfectionism is not required. Such efforts can be done in the  deliberation process. Specifically effective medicines do no  good if taken after the illness conditions have already  deteriorated.    Another reminder is that the order of priority should not be  mistakenly handled out of concern for saving face.    Political reform can be summarized as bringing about a  single  member election district with proportional representation  system, national treasury subsidies [to political parties], and  controls over enterprise contributions. They are not so  imperative that they have to be settled within two or three  months. The most imperative and important problem is how to  cope with the current recession. I am dubious about whether the  government really understands the problem's importance.    In relation to stock price policies, the government should  have publicly announced its intention to buy back NTT [Nippon  Telephone and Telegraph] stock at half-price, 2.55 million yen,  at which price the government had originally sold it, when the  price dropped to 600,000 or 700,000 yen. That would have become  the bottom price [for the stock]. In theory, it worked out for  those who continued to possess the stocks until the government  announcement, but what about those who had already sold them at  a loss. The same thing holds for the land tax system which was  enforced to prevent speculators from earning big money from  sky-rocketing land prices. But when the land prices continue to  drop and land transactions drastically decrease, antibubble  measures continue to remain in effect. The way things are,  business conditions will never be expected to improve.    Some people would make the immediate rebuttal: "But what  will  you do when land prices go up again?" Raising interest rates  and controls over loans can be done in a breath.    If it were found that antirecession budgets were  formulated in excess, they could be immediately controlled. It  takes several months to formulate budgets, but their execution  can be suspended in a day. The government cannot function  smoothly when it is split by those who assert priority in  fairness and those who advocate placing priority in recession  fighting measures. No leadership can be displayed in recovering  the economy unless political groups sharing the same views form  a ruling party and a government.    Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is urged to refrain from  permanently crying "hi-jimin [non-LDP]," for the benefit of the  nation as a whole. We will not spare cooperation from outside  the cabinet, if it really serves the national interest.    I am afraid that trade union confederation leaders are  deviating from their professed line. They attempt to take the  initiative in reorganizing political circles, but I do not think  lower-echelon union members would listen to what their top  people had to say. I do not think union members could be  subjugated to the orders from above, orders like recommending  Komeito [Clean Government Party] in the A District without  regard to who is on the ticket, a Shinseito candidate in the B  District, a Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] candidate in the C  District, a SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] candidate in  the D District, and so on. That sort of thinking contributed to  a reduction in the SDPJ's strength by half, which was to our  advantage. Strong opposition to such ideas is reported within  unions. It is all right for them to demand tax cuts but I would  rather propose union fee reductions before making such demands.    Prefectural employees told me that they pay 60,000 to 80,000  yen in union fees annually. Since they are banned from going on  strike, a two-thirds cut in union fees would provide them with  the same benefit as a tax reduction in the amount of 40,000 to  50,000 yen. The supreme leaders above the clouds are unaware  that a great number of union members did not want to become  members in the first place and that they want out. If the  leaders are planning to use them in elections as if they were  moving chessmen at will, more union members will desert the  organizations. The current union leaders are excessively  committed to political intervention. The cry of "hi-jimin"  alone does not bring about recovery in business conditions and  increases in basic wage rates. It is better to ask the opinions  of intelligent union members.  <H5>  Putting the Cart Before the Horse? </H5>   With market opening progressing, Japanese enterprises with  the same line of business are now engaged in life-or-death  battles. Enterprises are now becoming labor-management  communities.    The current difficulties can hardly be overcome unless labor  and management cooperate more closely. When competing firms are  bent on expanding sales, how can union leaders expect union  members of competing companies to make concerted efforts to back  the union-designated candidate. It may end up putting the cart  before the horse. I would advise Rengo [Confederation of Labor  Unions] to refrain from engaging in excessive election  campaigns. Union members say they are against Rengo's using  their high union fees to meddle in elections.    Finally, the fluke the Hosokawa cabinet brought about was  not  the expulsion of the LDP from the government, but letting the  SDPJ eat the forbidden fruit and emasculating it. This applies  at least to those holding cabinet portfolios and seniors on the  portfolio waiting list who are well-behaved because they thirst  after positions and greed. It may well be anticipated that all  such things as PKF, atomic power plant construction, the  Self-Defense Force's purchase of AWACS' [Advanced Warning  Airborne Control System], and partial liberalization of the rice  market will go well. I do not care whether the Hosokawa  cabinet's political reform bill comes through before the  year-end or not, if most of the pending difficult problems are  solved, for which I would not spare my cooperation from outside  the cabinet. I want to make this prediction: Emergence from  depression and prevention of huge unemployment by industrial  restructuring will never succeed through "schoolgirlish fancy  slogans like "hi-jimin," senility emerging from thirst after  power and greed, and flattery to win popularity alone." Mr.  Ozawa is an unparalleled person in thinking of Japan's future  and in courage, power of execution, and skills in bringing about  alliances. For him to achieve greater success, I wish for him  to make efforts to respect principles and rules and to be  tolerant, but not to take the course of excessive expansionism  like Mr. Kakuei Tanaka once did, and not to exude the impression  of a secretive and arbitrary person. A man's strong and weak  points coexist and they are like both sides.    It has been said that life is like walking with a heavy  burden upon one's back, one should not be hasty and excessive.    I dare wish him to be more prudent and pray for more great  activities of a good fellow.</p>

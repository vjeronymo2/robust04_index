			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> They further recommended, based on the recent developments in technology that the use of test chambers, and the requirement for use of aerosols be deleted. They also offered an additional definition: ``challenge agent'' means the air contaminant, or parameter, which is measured for comparison inside and outside of the respirator facepiece.'' These are reasonable suggestions, but as they have general application outside shipyards, OSHA indicated this in its notice of February 5, 1990 in its partial response to the Court. The Agency is ``still planning to revise and update its general respiratory standard, and believes that continuing to enforce the current asbestos respirator requirements during this interim period will not expose employees to unnecessary risk'' (55 FR 3728, February 5, 1990). Therefore, OSHA will not delete the qualitative fit test from the asbestos standard(s), but will consider the issue in the context of the general respiratory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SESAC objected to the requirement that a powered, air-purifying respirator be supplied in lieu of a negative-pressure respirator when the employee chooses it and when it will provide adequate protection. They felt that the employer should be allowed to provide an airline respirator or powered air-purifying respirator. They reasoned that most employers already will have airline respirators in stock and will not need to purchase or maintain any other type of respirator. In evaluating similar comments in the rulemaking for the 1986 revised asbestos rule, OSHA stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA agrees that positive-pressure supplied-air respirators provide a greater level of protection than do half-mask negative-pressure respirators. OSHA believes that employers should have the flexibility to use any of the available respirators that provide sufficient protection to reduce the exposures to levels below the PEL. Furthermore, the safety problems associated with the use of supplied-air respirators cannot be ignored. OSHA believes that respirators should be selected that both provide adequate protection from exposure to airborne asbestos fibers and minimize the risk of accident and injury potentially caused by the use of cumbersome supplied-air respirators (51 FR p. 22719, June 20, 1986, p. 22719). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After that rulemaking, BCTD challenged OSHA's refusal to make air supplied respirators mandatory. The Court accepted OSHA's explanation_that supplied-air respirators had hazards of its own, and stated ``this sort of judgment *&blank;*&blank;* (is) within OSHA's discretion in the absence of evidence supporting the view that the incremental asbestos safety gains plainly exceed the incremental non-asbestos hazards'' (838 F.2d at 1274). OSHA reiterated these reasons in its January 28, 1990 response to the Court's remand. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, OSHA has determined on this record that supplied air respirators are required for Class I work where a negative exposure assessment is not forthcoming, but not for other Class I work. Therefore, shipyard employees doing the most hazardous work must wear this most protective respirator as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (9) Protective Clothing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

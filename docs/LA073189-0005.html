			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPACE GOALS VS. EARTH GOALS  </P> <P> In response to The Times' editorial "Beyond the Moon" (July 21):  </P> <P> I share your sentiments. I would like to add a thought or two that seem  relevant.  </P> <P> The exploration (and exploitation) of the realm beyond our wafer-thin  atmosphere is the most stupendous challenge to Homo sapiens since we ventured  forth from Olduvai. It will, indeed must, happen. "Because it's there." Because  it's necessary. By way of a not-too-loose analogy, consider the existence of  the United States.  </P> <P> The second thought, directed at the Doubting Thomases out there who decry  "throwing money out to space":  </P> <P> Any manufacturing project involves miners, foundry workers, transport  personnel, engineers, machinists, assemblers, coordination personnel, just to  list the merely obvious. Not so obvious are banks, restaurants, farmers, and  half a hundred other "fringe elements."  </P> <P> Throwing money away? It sounds like a healthy economy to me. At least more  healthy than nukes that we dare not use.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER SCHILLING  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

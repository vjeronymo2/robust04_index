			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Less lucre from the law of libel Sir, As your Justinian column (August 10) observes, the cost of libel actions both in legal fees and damages is unsatisfactory. The cost of representation places the ordinary citizen at a disadvantage when faced with the resources of a newspaper or broadcaster, while damages often appear out of proportion to the hurt inflicted. The law of libel is basically concerned with balancing the private right to reputation and the private right to free speech. It fails to address the public right to receive timely and accurate information on matters of public interest. There is, thus, a considerable public interest in newspapers (and broadcasters) getting their facts right and, when wrong, correcting them at the earliest opportunity. Most libels result from errors, but the law of libel does not encourage publishers to correct them unless as part of a settlement with the person defamed. It is unsatisfactory both for a plaintiff to wait years for his good name to be vindicated and for the public to wait for the facts to be corrected. One possible change would be to provide that, where a publisher corrects and apologises for the libel promptly, the plaintiff would only be entitled to recover actual damages. An exception could be made in cases of proven malice. This would give publishers a very real incentive to correct mistakes quickly without fear that they are abandoning possible defences to a libel action. Where a person has suffered real financial loss that could be recovered, but actual financial loss in defamation is rare. This sort of proposal has met with criticism from the legal profession (who have a vested interest in defamation laws as they stand). Others may consider such a change too generous to sloppy publishers. But the loss of a right to general damages by the victims of sloppy journalists would be outweighed by the benefits of early correction. Malcom Turnbull, 1 Chifley Square Sydney Australia.</p>

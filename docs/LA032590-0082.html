			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPE COUNCIL FEARS FOR LITHUANIA;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: THE 23-NATION GROUP EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE MILITARY  INTERVENTION BY MOSCOW.  </P> <P> Foreign ministers of the 23-nation Council of Europe expressed deep concern  Saturday about the possibility of Soviet military intervention in Lithuania,  reacting to an appeal for world support by the Baltic republic.  </P> <P> But the ministers, concluding a two-day meeting here, did not pass any  resolutions on the sensitive subject.  </P> <P> Portuguese Foreign Minister Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the current council  president, said the Lithuanian issue did not come up for a vote. Deus Pinheiro  nevertheless appealed to Moscow not to act rashly in Lithuania, which has  declared its independence from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Deus Pinheiro added that he hopes the Lithuanian situation can be resolved  through negotiations.  </P> <P> The foreign ministers, holding a special meeting to discuss Eastern Europe,  also expressed concern over ethnic violence that has broken out elsewhere in  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "We launch an urgent appeal to all parties concerned to exercise restraints,  refrain from violence and seek peaceful solutions," Deus Pinheiro said at a  news conference.  </P> <P> Although no country was named specifically, the diplomat's remarks were  prompted by the situation in Romania, where ethnic violence has erupted against  the Hungarian minority in Transylvania, council sources said.  </P> <P> Fears about possible Soviet armed action in Lithuania were expressed by several  foreign ministers, sources said.  </P> <P> But the Council of Europe seemed leery of taking a stand on a matter not on the  agenda, according to those attending closed meetings, because the foreign  ministers were torn between supporting self-determination for Lithuania and the  desire not to embarrass Moscow.  </P> <P> The European Council also expressed "great support" for an Austrian proposal to  hold a special council ministerial meeting on the problems of migration in  Europe.  </P> <P> Austria, as well as other nations hard-pressed by migrants, would like a better  definition of political and economic refugees, diplomats said.  </P> <P> The discussions on minority problems in Eastern Europe, as part of talks about  the political future of Europe, overshadowed conversations about German  unification.  </P> <P> But West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was on hand to reassure  his fellow ministers that German unity poses no serious threat to the stability  of the Council of Europe or the European Community.  </P> <P> He repeated similar statements made by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to  the European Community representatives in Brussels on Friday.  </P> <P> Some European Community officials, including EC President Jacques Delors, have  expressed concern that West German preoccupation with unity would delay Bonn's  enthusiasm for a single-market Europe, set to be in place by the end of 1992.  But Deus Pinheiro told his news conference that the members fully support  German unification.  </P> <P> The Council of Europe is composed of all of the Western European nations and  has generally focused on human rights and political matters, while the  12-member European Community is mainly occupied with economic integration.  </P> <P> Although the European Community is a tightly restricted club, the Council of  Europe opens its doors to all European nations that institute democratic  regimes and observe human rights.  </P> <P> The council has been in the forefront of the search for ways to aid Eastern  European nations in their attempt to shuck off communism and install democratic  governments.  </P> <P> Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia currently have special guest  status on the council; Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia have applied for such  status, and Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia have formally asked for full  membership.  </P> <P> Their applications are undergoing scrutiny to make sure, as Deus Pinheiro put  it, that they meet the council's standards of democracy.  </P></p>

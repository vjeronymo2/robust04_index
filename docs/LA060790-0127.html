			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUDGET SUMMIT RESUMES, TARGETS PENTAGON  </P> <P> Congressional and Bush Administration negotiators Wednesday after a 10-day  break resumed their efforts to shrink the federal budget deficit, with their  five-hour meeting focusing on Pentagon spending.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters after attending the session that  he agreed to work with congressional specialists to estimate the budgetary  impact of cutting troops and weapons by 25% over the next five years.  </P> <P> "We'll be looking at various options," Cheney said, adding that no one would be  bound in advance to support any such reduction in the number of ships, planes  and Army divisions.  </P> <P> "Twenty-five per cent seems like a reasonable number to look at, given the  reduced threat," Cheney said. But lawmakers have warned that a 25% cut in  forces does not necessarily add up to a 25% cut in the Defense Department's  $300-billion budget -- the target set in a House-passed budget resolution.  </P></p>

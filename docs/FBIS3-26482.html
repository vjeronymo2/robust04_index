			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju from the "Monthly </F> Commentary" column: "Journalism Must Be in Touch With the Pulse  of the Times"]    [Text] China's reform, opening up, and modernization  endeavors entered a new stage of development after Comrade Deng  Xiaoping gave his important talk in southern China in early 1992  and after the holding of the 14th national party congress. With  the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping in November last year -- a book imbued with the  distinctive spirit of the times and glittering with shining  Marxist truth -- and the "Decision on Certain Issues Concerning  the Establishment of a Socialist Economic System" made by the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, China's  socialist construction during the new period began to have a  powerful ideological weapon and a great program for action.  Seizing the opportunity to accelerate reform, opening up, and  development as well as finish building a socialist market  economic system by the end of this century is both a great  historical mission for people throughout the country and a  distinctive feature of the new period.    Journalism is the voice of the party and the people, and the  vanguard of the times. At a time when China's socialist  construction is undergoing historic and profound changes and the  Chinese are confidently heading toward a new century, journalism  must be in close touch with the pulse of the times,  energetically promote the spirit of the times, fully reflect the  development of the times, clear the way for reform and opening  up, serve the socialist market economy, and praise the great  achievements of the socialist modernization drive.    To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalists must  persist in emancipating their minds and seek truth from facts.  The drive for socialist modernization and developing a  socialist market economy is an unprecedented great cause, and we  cannot possibly succeed in this cause and build a new world  unless we dare to probe and explore. To keep pace with this  situation, journalists must emancipate their minds even further,  change their mindsets, break with outmoded ways of thinking,  explore ideas, broaden the vision, and come up with new ideas.  Anything conducive to developing socialist productive forces,  to increasing our socialist country's overall strength, and to  improving the people's living standards should be publicized in  a big way and reported promptly. Under the premise that  journalism must uphold the party's basic line, display party  spirit, and safeguard stable social development, the intensity  of journalistic reform must be greater. Through reform, there  should be more subject matters to report, news reporting must be  more flexible and diverse, and the capacity for information must  be greater so that journalism can truly guide ideological  emancipation and truly become the propagator of the main theme  of the times. To seek truth from facts, journalists must report  fully and truthfully, and must uphold dialectics and the theory  of one divides into two. While they should depict beautiful  prospects in order to boost people's morale, they should also  describe the formidability of reform and opening up as well as  the problems of speeding up reform. While they must make great  efforts to publicize the significance of building a socialist  market economy, they must also remind the people that the market  needs the government's scientific and rational regulation and  control. Journalism will play a more significant role during  the new period when journalists report comprehensively and  truthfully.    To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalists must  go deep into the realities of life to understand the new  situation, study new issues, and report new things. The great  cause of reform and opening up is an inexhaustible source for  journalism, and it is journalists' noble responsibility to  capture social hot points; study the new issues appearing during  economic development, reform, and opening up; and promptly  report the masses' great accomplishments. This being the case,  journalists must be more aware of their historical missions and  must be determined to work on the front of socialist  construction to produce honey from the prettiest flowers  [sentence as published]. Journalists must keep in mind the  overall interests, make use of the typical cases and first-hand  material in their hands, be good at speaking with facts, and  describe things with the language of the masses. In order to go  deep into the realities of life, journalists must selflessly  dedicate themselves to their profession, disregard personal gain  and loss, and defy hardships so their diligence will yield  fruitful results and their fortitude will turn out brilliant  reports.    To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalists  must maintain close ties with the masses and respect their  initiatives. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is  a cause which has to be accomplished together by millions of  people; the interest of the masses is the basic objective of  this cause, and the masses are also the source of its strength  and creativity. Comrade Xiaoping stated that our starting point  and the objective of all our work should be measured by "whether  the people embrace and endorse it, whether the people are happy  with it, and whether the people approve it." During the new  period characterized by reform and opening up, journalists  should do an even better job in building a bridge between the  party and the government on the one hand, and the people on the  other, so that the vast number of people will be informed of all  ongoing construction and reform projects; so that the people  will understand them, take part in them, and support them; and  so that the party and government can understand the masses'  aspirations even better and hear their voice more clearly.  During the new year, when many new reform measures will be  introduced and new construction projects will be launched, the  masses need time to understand these measures and projects, and  the interests of some people will be affected. This requires  the press to give the masses proper guidance, promptly reflect  their problems, and do a good job in protecting the masses'  initiatives and bringing them into play so as to boost their  morale, arouse their vitality, stabilize social order, and speed  up modernization as well as the building of a socialist market  economic system.    To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalism needs  a contingent of highly proficient and capable journalists. The  most important requirement now is to organize journalists to  study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  and arm journalists' minds with Comrade Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics so they will be  able to handle the assignments presented to them by the new  historical period and the new situation. Meanwhile, during the  course of developing the socialist market economy, journalists  must set even higher requirements for themselves and firmly  resist the inroads of money worship, nihilism, and  ultraindividualism; must reject compensatory journalism; and  must seek no personal interests. However, they will be  qualified journalists who will discharge their lofty  responsibilities and accomplish their sacred missions.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Modest monumentalism - Colin Amery applauds the decision to restore Sir Edwin Cooper's building at No. 1, Princes Street / Architecture Sir Edwin Cooper (1873-1942) was a great Georgian architect. Georgian, that is, in the style of King George V. His public buildings are archetypical of Edwardian splendour and optimism which continued into the reign of King George V, almost undimmed by the First World War. He laid some heavy loads upon the earth. In his early career he won, with his partners, several competitions - The Guildhall and Law Courts in Hull; the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne; the Rochester Technical Institute; and the Middlesborough Public Library. He reached the final stage of the important national competition for the new London County Hall. Although he started his life in Scarborough, Edwin Cooper is today best remembered for his major public buildings in the capital. He was very much a product of those competitive days, which produced such an opulent harvest of municipal and government buildings. In the decade 1895-1905 an average of about 70 competitions were advertised in the building press each year. In the years 1900 - 1905 some 50 competitions were held for new public libraries. It seems almost unbelievable in these recessionary times, but it is worth remembering that this was the period that produced many of the public buildings now still very much in use. In 1911 (two years before Buckingham Palace was given its Edwardian Beaux Arts re-fronting by Sir Aston Webb), Cooper hit London with his first solo competition win - the new Town Hall for St. Marylebone on the Marylebone Road. Only Cooper would have thought of the Mausoleum of Hallicarnassus as adapted by Christopher Wren for the denizens of St. Marylebone. The great tower remains a landmark today with is almost cyclopian detail and emphasis on form as much as detail. Another part of London dominated by Cooper is in the City, Tower Hill in Trinity Square, where he built the Port of London Authority (PLA) from 1912-1922. This is a handsome, megalomaniac, vulgar and yet very splendid creation. You can never forget its massive tower angled above the Corinthian portico, the giant columns of which range with the side walls. He also clearly loved giant statues. Sadly the great circular domed hall of the PLA building was lost in the last war. I think Cooper's best building is the Star and Garter Home on the top of Richmond Hill in Surrey. He got the point of the site and somehow achieved the sort of domestic grandeur in brick and stone that suits the lives of the retired soldiers. In the City, Cooper's buildings have suffered. His home for Lloyds with its fine Oval Room and The Room for the underwriters has been demolished and replaced by Richard Rogers's high-tech building. The interior of the PLA might as well have been demolished because its adaptation was so unsympathetic. So it comes as a relief to see the recent announcement by the National Westminster Bank about their Sir Edwin Cooper building in the City, No. 1, Princes Street, at the heart of the Bank of England conservation area. The Chairman of the National Westminster bank is that civilised lawyer, Lord Alexander, and he says of the bank's decision to carry out a complete restoration and careful modernisation of the building that 'it demonstrates a commitment to high quality architecture.' Cooper's building was constructed between 1929 and 1932 for the National Provincial Bank. It occupies a very important site at the convergence of the ancient streets of Poultry, Cornhill, Lombard Street, Threadneedle Street and Princes Street. Its immediate neighbour is the Midland Bank on Poultry designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1924. In fact Cooper's corner building is practically embraced by Lutyens's Midland Bank. But Cooper got the better site where he designed an edifice of not inconsiderable presence. The building is listed Grade II (as are the buildings owned and possibly to be demolished by Lord Palumbo across the street) and the listing citation shorthand perhaps described Cooper's work better than I can: '1929 by Sir Edwin Cooper. Classical, stone, 5 storeys and 2 attics the upper one recessed. High channeled base with Doric frieze and cornice; large round headed vermiculated openings with big scrolled keystones, rectangular niches with statues. Mezzanine above cornice. Three storey channelled antae over, recessed five bay centres between with giant detached Corinthian columns, bracketed cornice over. Plain attic storey with simple parapet. High recessed upper attic with band of swag decoration and simple coping. Corner of Princes Street and Mansion House Street statuary group of five figures'. This does not quite convey the gravitas of this building nor the clever way that Cooper handled the awkward corner site. There are some who would say that the plainess of this elevation shows the collapse of real enthusiasm for the classical style. But I would say that Cooper understood that this sort of late 1920s classicism, clearly built on a steel frame, should be more cubic and simple. He kept much of the splendour for the interior, where Nat West and its architects the T P Bennett Partnership intend to restore the fine banking hall with its glass domed roof. Part of the extenremoving the insensitive additions made in the 1970s and the replacement of much of Cooper's original design. Walls of Subiaco marble and the two great bronze sculptures representing Prosperity and Integrity will be restored. Cooper's panelled rooms on the upper floors are to be carefully moved to form a suite on the first floor. Sir Edwin Cooper's architecture is well worth the effort of sensitive restoration. It plays an important part in the townscape of the City and is a good neighbour to the Bank of England, the Mansion House and the Royal Exchange. The decision to restore and rehabilitate is a wise one that respects the fabric of the City where modest monumentalism is completely appropriate.</p>

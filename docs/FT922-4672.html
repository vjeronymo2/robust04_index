			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Forecasts leave Tokyo short of commitment SHARE prices posted moderate gains on short-term trading of theme stocks, but overall activity remained subdued, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average advanced 68.13 to 18,188.68 after a high of 18,316.94 and a low of 18,118.43 reflecting short-term trading by dealers and individuals, and index-linked trading by arbitrageurs. Volume rose slightly from 230m shares to 250m. Declines led advances by 453 to 429 with 203 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged up 1.80 to 1,366.38 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei eased 2.03 to 1080.65. Domestic fund managers said that although the corporate results season was over, they were reluctant to commit funds due to the uncertainty surrounding the future course of the Japanese economy. Theme stock trading dominated activity. Nippon Mining, bought for its Aids research, was the most active issue of the day, gaining Y1 to Y485. Snow Brand Milk Products gained Y42 to Y782 on reports that it had started clinical testing of an Alzheimer cure in the US. Mazda Motor, which previously advanced on the environmental theme due to reports of its development of a recyclable plastic, lost Y26 to Y495 on profit-taking. However, Japan Storage Battery, the supplier for battery-run cars, gained strength with a rise of Y50 to Y1,100. Other speculative favourites were also active, with Isetan, the department store, up Y80 to Y2,260 and Nihon Nohyaku, the agrochemical maker, adding Y20 to Y1,240. Foreign investors sought Sony, which gained Y100 to Y4,390. Despite the strength of the yen against the dollar, high-technology issues with high export ratios were firmer on bargain-hunting. Toshiba advanced Y5 to Y645 and Fujitsu by Y14 to Y665. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 10.72 to 20,822.28 in volume of 17.9m shares. Ono Pharmaceutical rose Y180 to Y6,600 on the bio-technology theme. Roundup Many of the region's markets gained momentum following the decision by the US president to grant China Most Favoured Nation trade status for another year. HONG KONG fell back on profit-taking. The Hang Seng index closed 22.02 lower at 6,037.37 in turnover down to HKDollars 3.83bn from HKDollars 4.32bn. HSBC initially lost HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 47.50 following its upwardly revised offer for Midland. However, it closed down 75 cents at HKDollars 47.75. SEOUL gained slightly on support from the stabilisation fund. The composite stock index closed 1.64 higher at 568.98 in turnover of Won218.4bn. Oil stocks improved on expectations that the government will raise petrol prices. Yukong rose by Won500 to Won24,200. TAIWAN rose on a technical rebound. The weighted index advanced 115.03 to 4,583.97 in turnover of TDollars 28.2bn. The financial sector rose 4 per cent on rumours that the government would soon allow an expansion of banking ties with China. MANILA continued to be strong following the recent presidential elections. The composite index closed up 33.70 to 1,439.42 after an intraday high of 1,445.37. Combined turnover was 450m pesos. AUSTRALIA again focused on Foster's Brewing and the All Ordinaries index closed up 1.8 at 1,678.1 in turnover of ADollars 216m. Foster's reached an intraday high of ADollars 2.11 before declining slightly to close up 8 cents at ADollars 2.08, while SA Brewing, which has recently proposed a ADollars 6bn merger with Foster's, lost 5 cents to ADollars 3.08. BANGKOK was firmer although the market still awaited a clear political direction. The SET index gained 2.42 to 679.52 in low turnover of Bt2.09bn. SINGAPORE had largely discounted news that one of the major banks was to cut its prime rate. The Straits Times industrial index put on 0.45 to 1,513.72. JAKARTA had another good rise, the Jardine Fleming index rising 0.95 to 65.04 on renewed local buying after an interest rate cut this week.</p>

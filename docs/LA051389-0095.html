			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORT HIRES AN EXPERIENCED ASSISTANT;  </P> <P> DAN O'BRIEN HAS 35 YEARS OF ADMINISTRATIVE KNOW-HOW  </P> <P> Angel Vice President Mike Port hired an assistant Friday afternoon, but he  didn't hire anyone who had previously served as an Angel designated hitter,  homered in the World Series, won a league MVP award or written a book.  </P> <P> Dan O'Brien is no Don Baylor. Dan O'Brien is no Reggie Jackson. Dan O'Brien, in  fact, never played an inning in the major leagues, his career as a professional  baseball player beginning and ending with a tryout with the Brooklyn Dodgers.  </P> <P> But Dan O'Brien has 35 years' worth of administrative experience, which is the  main reason he today holds the title of senior vice president in charge of  baseball operations for the Angels.  </P> <P> Concluding a search that began last December when owner Gene Autry promoted  Port from general manager to chief operating officer with instructions to  expand the front office, O'Brien, 59, joins the Angels after serving as general  manager of the Texas Rangers, president of the Seattle Mariners and assistant  to the president of the Cleveland Indians.  </P> <P> "As you know, we have given a considerable amount of thought to expanding the  base of our baseball operations," Port said, "and it was certainly important to  all of us to locate and identify the proper and right individual.  </P> <P> "The position we were looking to fill calls for a well-experienced and senior  baseball executive. Dan certainly fits that description."  </P> <P> And that, apparently, ruled out Baylor and Jackson, the former Angel sluggers  whose names repeatedly cropped up while Port conducted his search. Neither  Baylor nor Jackson has any baseball administrative experience.  </P> <P> However, Baylor and Jackson remain candidates for another vacancy created by  the Angels' front-office expansion -- a sort of "junior executive" who would,  as Port put it, "go through things with Dan and learn through observation."  </P> <P> Port refers to such a position as "our social and affirmative-action  obligation."  </P> <P> "With Dan O'Brien and his experience," Port said, "we now have a situation  where I can say, 'Dan, I'll be back in three days. Take over.'  </P> <P> "(The other position) would entail more participatory legwork. . . . It would  involve player development and scouting and general major league operations."  </P> <P> O'Brien's assignment will be similar to the one Port held during Buzzie  Bavasi's tenure as Angel general manager, with Port overseeing the club's  scouting department and negotiating player contracts and Bavasi making trades  and personnel decisions.  </P> <P> "Structurally, what we're getting back to is how things were done when Buzzie  Bavasi was here," Port said. "That system paid off in a pair of division titles  (1979 and 1982).  </P> <P> "The best approximation (of the Port-O'Brien relationship) is that Dan will do  many of the same things that Mike Port did when Buzzie Bavasi was here."  </P> <P> And that is?  </P> <P> "I handled a lot of contract matters under Buzzie," Port said. "There was a lot  of paper work -- record-keeping, waivers, rules, assignments, spring training  planning, clubhouse matters.  </P> <P> "Those are all things Dan has done."  </P> <P> O'Brien began his career in management in 1955 when Branch Rickey hired him as  general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates' Burlington, N.C., farm team. He also  served in a similar capacity with three Milwaukee Braves minor league teams.  </P> <P> After that, O'Brien spent nine years as assistant to the president of the  National Assn. of Professional Baseball Leagues before serving as vice  president and general manager of the Texas Rangers from 1973 to '79.  </P> <P> Then came stints as president of the Seattle Mariners (1979-1984) and assistant  to the president of the Cleveland Indians (1984-1989).  </P> <P> O'Brien was hired in Cleveland by Peter Bavasi but had his responsibilities  reduced when Hank Peters replaced Bavasi as the Indians' president.  </P> <P> "My involvement in Cleveland was not as broad as it is here," O'Brien said.  "Hank brought in some of his own people, and that narrowed my involvement at  that time. (The last fews years) I mostly oversaw player development."  </P> <P> O'Brien considers his expertise to be the "the player evaluation side of it,  the contract negotiation area," and Port said O'Brien will assume a major  portion of that role during the off-season. Last winter, after catcher Bob  Boone's defection to Kansas City, there were charges of Port spreading himself  too thin in that department.  </P> <P> "(The hiring of O'Brien) goes along with the increasing responsibilities that  go with trying to run a winning ballclub," Port said. "As they say, two heads  are better than one."  </P></p>

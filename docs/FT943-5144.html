			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Bruntland cuts to heart of Cairo conference Mrs Gro Harlem Bruntland, Norway's prime minister, cut to the heart of the controversies surrounding the International Conference on Population and Development at its opening yesterday with a plain-speaking defence of its centrepiece text's position on abortion. Mrs Bruntland's speech, which accused some religious critics of hypocrisy, drew loud applause and a final standing ovation during an opening session marked otherwise by conciliatory and grandiose opening addresses. 'I have tried in vain to understand how the term 'reproductive healthcare' can possibly be read as promoting abortion as a means of family planning. Rarely if ever have so many misrepresentations been used to imply a meaning that was never there in the first place,' Mrs Bruntland declared. 'Morality becomes hypocrisy if it means mothers suffering or dying in connection with unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions and unwanted children,' she added. Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister (the opening's other star female speaker in a conference which has women's rights as a central theme) made a spirited defence of Islamic and family values. While claiming the conference's draft text contained 'serious flaws', she said the world must not see the event as 'a universal social charter seeking to impose adultery, abortion (and) sex education'. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, the conference host, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, and Mr Albert Gore, US vice-president, called the gathering 'one of the most important conferences ever held'. Most other speakers reiterated with little change of emphasis the central thrust of the gathering, which is to provide a consensual global programme to stabilise world population based on a 'holistic' developmental approach with the education and empowerment of women at its core. Speakers and delegates made energetic efforts to stress the high degree of agreement among the event's 170 participants on the conference document, detailed negotiations on which began yesterday and will continue until the conference closes on September 13. Mr Gore said what was 'truly remarkable' about the meeting was 'not only the unprecedented degree of consensus about the nature of the problem, but the degree of consensus about the nature of the solution'. By the end of yesterday, delegates were congratulating themselves on having made progress in trying to heal rifts over the document's language. EU states agreed internally to back a proposed amendment clarifying the document does not promote abortion as a means of family planning.</p>

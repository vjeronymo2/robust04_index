			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A top Japanese labor leader  urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday [31 May] to take  the initiative to get the second largest opposition Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] back into the fold of  his ruling coalition.    "It solely depends on Prime Minister Hata's decision," said  Akira Yamagishi, head of the Japanese Confederation of Labor  (Rengo), in referring to an SDP call for resignation of the Hata  cabinet or general elections if the prime minister refuses to  quit.    "There is no possibility of (the Hata government) resigning  voluntarily en masse if the decision is left to Sinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] leader (Ichiro) Ozawa," Yamagishi said in a  program on the private Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS)  television network.    Ozawa, chief strategist of the coalition, is regarded as the  behind-the-scenes leader of the shaky minority government that  toppled four decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party.    Rengo is a main backer of the SDP, which left the coalition  in April after former coalition head Morihiro Hosokawa the party  supported quit in a dispute over his shady personal financial  deals.</p>

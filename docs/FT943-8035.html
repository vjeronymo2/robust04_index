			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: BASF The recovery at BASF is even better than yesterday's 41 per cent increase in half year pre-tax profits suggests. The result includes DM1.4bn of rationalisation and other expenses, twice the amount charged in the first half of last year. Sales increases of 14 per cent in chemicals and 12 per cent in plastics give a better flavour of the extent of the upswing. While selling prices are little changed from this time last year, the group is rightly confident that increases can be made to stick before the year end. With profits rising and capital expenditure falling - as its DM4bn investment in the Russian-German gas pipeline comes to an end - BASF is starting to enjoy formidable cash flow. The balance sheet will also be strengthened if bondholders exercise their options to buy shares later this year. The question is how management intends to use this financial freedom. BASF's drugs business certainly looks too small to flourish alone. Vague talk yesterday of expanding pharmaceuticals in the US, UK and France is the sort of thing that fuels bid speculation in the sector. Yet it is not clear that BASF adds much value in pharmaceuticals. Its strengths lie in technology-based heavy industry such as bulk chemicals rather than pure science or marketing. Besides, BASF estimates that its weighted average cost of capital is around 10 per cent, perhaps three or four percentage points lower than ICI's. By concentrating its efforts on capital-intensive industries, BASF could make the most of this competitive advantage.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL EXHIBITION ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AS MCMAHON WATCHES, ROOKIE LEADS CHARGERS  </P> <P> Jim McMahon figures to be the quarterback of the San Diego Chargers, but it was  rookie Billy Joe Tolliver who did the Bears in Saturday night at Chicago.  </P> <P> McMahon made a surprise token appearance for four plays at the start of the  second half. Tolliver, meanwhile, threw two touchdown passes to lead the  Chargers to a 24-7 exhibition victory over the Bears.  </P> <P> "I didn't have much hand in it," McMahon said. "It might have been nicer if I'd  played the whole game."  </P> <P> Tolliver connected with Anthony Miller on a 39-yard touchdown pass play and  threw to Jamie Holland on a 70-yard touchdown pass play in a 21-point third  quarter.  </P> <P> The Chargers' other score in the quarter came on a 49-yard pass interception  return by Elliot Smith.  </P> <P> San Francisco 35, Denver 17 -- Backup fullback Harry Sydney ran for one  touchdown and caught a pass from Joe Montana for another as the 49ers  overpowered the Broncos without John Elway in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Elway was scheduled to start at quarterback for Denver but was held out by  Coach Dan Reeves because the brace that protects his left knee, which has  undergone surgery three times, was missing.  </P> <P> Montana, who completed 13 of 19 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown, led the  49ers to touchdowns on three consecutive drives to build a 21-3 lead in the  first half.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 35, Detroit 3 -- Barney Bussey scored on a 70-yard fumble return and  ran back one of eight Bengal interceptions for another touchdown as the Bengals  routed the Lions at Pontiac, Mich.  </P> <P> Rusty Hilger, Detroit's starting quarterback, completed four of 14 passes for  89 yards and three interceptions. Eric Hipple completed six of 19 passes for  102 yards and four interceptions. Chuck Long was four of eight for 43 yards and  one interception.  </P> <P> In the second half, the fans were chanting for rookie quarterback Rodney Peete,  who did not play.  </P> <P> New England 17, Seattle 12 -- Defensive back Jim Bowman returned a  third-quarter fumble 21 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a victory in  St. Louis' first NFL game since the Cardinals left for Phoenix after the 1987  season.  </P> <P> The Seahawks drove to the New England six-yard-line in the final minute, but  Jeff Kemp threw four incomplete passes.  </P> <P> Houston 26, Miami 10 -- Backup quarterback Cody Carlson threw two touchdown  passes, and the Oilers held the Dolphins to 200 yards of total offense at  Jacksonville, Fla.  </P> <P> Miami (0-2) managed only 29 yards rushing and 171 passing. The Dolphins had 68  yards total offense in the second half.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 24, Cleveland 21 -- Dwight Stone caught a 43-yard touchdown pass and  ran 42 yards on a reverse to set up the game-winning touchdown as the Steelers  edged the Browns at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Todd Blackledge threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Weegie Thompson with 1:29  left.  </P> <P> Indianapolis 24, Green Bay 23 -- George Wonsley ran three yards for a touchdown  with 26 seconds left to push the Colts past the Packers at Green Bay, Wis.  </P> <P> The Packers trailed, 17-6, at halftime but took a 23-17 lead when Don Majkowski  connected with Jeff Query on a 49-yard scoring pass play with 1:34 left.  </P> <P> Tampa Bay 27, Atlanta 0 -- Rookie Kermit Kendrick returned an interception 22  yards for a touchdown to spark the Buccaneers' defense, which gave up only 134  total yards at Tampa Bay.  </P> <P> Atlanta had only 62 yards rushing and 72 passing, made only one first down in  the first quarter and none in the third quarter, and had the ball for less than  20 minutes.  </P> <P> Buffalo 10, New Orleans 7 -- Charlie Baumann, replacing injured Pro Bowl kicker  Scott Norwood, kicked a 32-yard field goal late in the third quarter, and the  Bills downed the Saints at Buffalo.  </P> <P> The Bills also scored when Jim Kelly and Chris Burkett hooked up on a 37-yard  touchdown pass play.  </P></p>

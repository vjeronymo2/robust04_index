			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (11): Protecting the Games - Security MANCHESTER'S bid organisers have been tackling security head-on in their presentations to the IOC. They are planning for 10,000 police to be deployed for the Games but their greatest asset is that Britain is fundamentally a law-abiding country. Indeed, although Britain gets bad publicity from IRA terrorism, its problems are light compared with other countries. Inevitably, attention has focused on crime in Manchester's Moss Side because of the Olympic bid. However, Greater Manchester police say: 'It is a myth that Moss Side is more violent than other urban areas.' It had eight murders in l992, nine attempted ones and 157 woundings. 'Many of the murders were domestic ones. They were not all drug-related. There is simply no comparison with major US cities,' police say. Greater Manchester averages 42 murders a year. Mr Howard Bernstein, deputy chief executive of Manchester city council, says: 'Violence accounts for just 3 per cent of all crime in Greater Manchester. There is a 76 per cent detection rate. For murders it is 97 per cent. Crime in Britain increased by 10 per cent last year. For Manchester it grew by 5.8 per cent.' As for the IRA, Mr Berstein says: 'Terrorism is a world-wide phenomenon which any global event must deal with. Good security is the answer and our chief constable together with the Whitehall authorities are satisfied they can protect the Games if they are held in Manchester.'</p>

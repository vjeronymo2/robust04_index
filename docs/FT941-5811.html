			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Electricity watchdog sees scope for more competition by 1996 Tens of thousands more electricity users may be able to shop around for supplies in 1996 under potential changes which the industry regulator has asked the sector to consider. The earlier-than-expected introduction of competition in the power market for small and medium businesses would almost certainly lead to lower prices. Larger power customers have seen prices fall considerably after moves to allow them to choose from a variety of suppliers. In a private letter to regional electricity companies, Prof Stephen Littlechild, director general of electricity supply, says 'there would seem to be scope' for extending competition to some consumers in two years. Competition for all users is already planned for 1988. His consultations, prompted by liberalisation of the gas market, will cause concern at some electricity companies. They have bought power supplies from generators until 1998 in the belief that their markets were secure. There are also doubts on whether metering technology can meet a 1996 target. Under existing market liberalisation arrangements, only about 5,000 customers requiring peak demand of more than 1 megawatt, can choose their supplier. From next month, that will extend to another 45,000 whose peak demand exceeds 100kW. All other consumers are scheduled to remain in the 'franchise', or non-competitive, market until 1998. In a two-page letter to the 14 regional electricity distributors in England, Wales and Scotland, Prof Littlechild accepts that full competition is not possible by 1996 but suggests the study of an 'interim franchise reduction'. Prof Littlechild's office said yesterday that he had no conclusions on whether the introduction of competition should be speeded up, but he wanted to explore the possibilities. Prof Littlechild referred to the government's decision to introduce competition to 5 per cent of the domestic gas market in each of 1996 and 1997 before British Gas's monopoly on domestic sales is abolished fully in 1998. He noted that even after the electricity franchise threshold falls next month, it will be 10 times as high as the energy demand level at which gas users can shop around. Separately, a report today in Power UK, a Financial Times newsletter, says lower metering costs than expected will make the evolution of a competitive market after 1998 much more likely. That, it says, will challenge the security of the companies' investment in generation tied to long-term contracts. See Lex</p>

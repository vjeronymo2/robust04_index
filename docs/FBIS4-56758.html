			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 7 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President Fidel  Castro praised Cuba's contribution to the independence of  several African countries and said apartheid was bound to  disappear in South Africa sooner or later because it was  unsustainable in today's world.    In a statement to Barbados' CBU [as received] Television  that  was broadcast today by Cuban television, Castro said: "The  effort made (by the Cuban fighters) helped safeguard Angola's  independence and hastened the independence of Namibia and the  elimination of apartheid."    Castro also extolled the sacrifices made and the struggle  waged by the South Africans and the Namibians to reach their  objectives, saying: "Sooner or later, Namibia would have been  independent, and apartheid would have disappeared anyway."    Castro praised African National Congress leader Nelson  Mandela (who won the elections). He mentioned Mandela's  leadership capabilities and wisdom, which allowed him, the Cuban  leader said, to remain firm but at the same time flexible to  reach "this political miracle," which I view as a very great  victory for the people of South Africa, the world, and the  progressive forces.    The Cuban leader has been in Bridgetown, the capital of  Barbados, since 4 May. He went there to participate in the  high-level sessions of the first World Conference on the  Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which concluded  yesterday.    When asked about conditions for normalizing relations  between  Cuba and the United States, first, Castro cited the end of the  economic blockade Washington has imposed on Cuba for more than  30 years, a blockade he characterized as hard, unjust, and cruel.    Second, the Cuban leader also believes it is necessary for  the White House to understand Cuba is an independent and  sovereign country. Third, the Cuban people's right to have the  political, economic, and social system they consider best must  be respected.    Saying it is not Cuba who is besieging another country and  that Cuba does not want to change the social system or install  socialism in the neighboring nation to the north, Castro  affirmed: "We have nothing against the United States."    The Cuban president praised the recently concluded  conference  in Barbados. In his opinion, it made politicians and  industrialized countries aware of the need to prevent the  degradation of the environment.</p>

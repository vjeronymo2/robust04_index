			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL NOTES;  </P> <P> BIG EAST CONFERENCE USED TO BE TOP HEAVY, BUT NOT THIS SEASON  </P> <P> It took 10 years, but true parity seemingly has reached the Big East.  </P> <P> For most of its existence, this made-for-television league has thrived around  the success of four programs: Georgetown, St. John's, Villanova and Syracuse.  </P> <P> From 1982 through 1987, these schools have combined for two national  championships (Georgetown in 1984, Villanova in 1985) and seven Final Four  appearances.  </P> <P> But the rap against the Big East was the bottom of its league, the clear  separation between the haves and the have-nots. Judging from the first two  months of this season, those days are over.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P> Providence, expected to be a basement dweller this season, is off to a 3-0  start for the first time in the league's first decade. The Friars, unbeaten  going into Thursday night's game against Central Connecticut, also cracked the  top 20 this week.  </P> <P> Seton Hall, which often rented out basement space itself, made the top 10 after  beating Georgetown last week. Though the No. 13 Pirates were brought back to  earth with a 90-66 shellacking at Syracuse, they are headed for a long home  stand and a possible 18-2 start.  </P> <P> Also: Georgetown lost to Seton Hall but crushed Pitt, which beat Syracuse,  which lost to Villanova, which lost to Connecticut, which lost to Providence,  which beat St. John's. Get the picture?  </P> <P> "I think every time you step on a court in the Big East, you'd better be  prepared or you're going to lose," said Seton Hall senior guard John Morton. "I  think all the teams are competitive. The race is wide-open."  </P> <P> What is the toughest place to play in the country? A typical list might include  the Carrier Dome at Syracuse, N.Y., Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke in Durham,  N.C., Allen Fieldhouse at Kansas, The Pit at New Mexico.  </P> <P> But in terms of home-court winning streaks, the two places that hold the  longest streaks for their schools are both pretty obscure: the Clark Center at  Southern University and Kirby Fieldhouse at Lafayette in Easton, Pa. Lafayette  seats 3,500, according to the fire marshals, but sometimes squeezes another  1,000 into its own little pit. The Leopards have won 23 in a row, including an  upset of Notre Dame there last season. Southern also has won 23 in a row at  home.  </P> <P> Like many conferences, the Big Ten holds a weekly telephone hookup for the  media with its coaches. But for the three years the league has been doing this,  Indiana's Bob Knight never has partaken in the festivities.  </P> <P> Knight, who has his Hoosiers (12-4) on a nine-game winning streak, will go for  his 500th career victory Saturday against Northwestern. Was Knight asked how it  feels to go for 500? "Nobody asks Bobby Knight much of anything these days,"  said someone in the Big Ten office.  </P> <P> The same can't be said of Michigan's Bill Frieder, who is making a habit of  sticking his foot into his mouth. When told that Illinois Coach Lou Henson said  that the sixth-ranked Wolverines were more talented than his second-ranked  Illini, Frieder scoffed. "You tell Lou Henson that I'll bet him $500 that  Illinois beats us on Saturday," he said.  </P> <P> Asked about Monday's matchup between Ohio State and Michigan in Ann Arbor,  Mich., a game that will be shown on ESPN, Frieder said, "You tell Dick Vitale  to bring all his b.s. up here. We need it to patch up Crisler Arena."  </P> <P> Frieder is one of several coaches to have a book out on the market.  Appropriately, it's called "Basket Case."  </P> <P> When Temple's Duane Causwell had a wisdom tooth removed Sunday, a day after the  Owls lost to North Carolina State on national television, Coach John Chaney  took it as a good-luck charm for his team. Temple is 1-0 since, with a win over  Rutgers.  </P> <P> Another tooth tale comes from Missouri. Within a week recently, freshman guard  Anthony Peeler had a wisdom tooth pulled, and junior guard Lee Coward and  Tigers Coach Norm Stewart each had root canal work done.  </P> <P> "One more and I get one free," said Stewart.  </P> <P> Peter Golenbock, the author of the forthcoming kiss-and-tell book about the  North Carolina State basketball program, reportedly offered former Wolfpack  players between $500 and $1,500 a half-hour for juicy information about Coach  Jim Valvano.  </P> <P> Terry Gannon, a former North Carolina State player who now works for a  television station in Raleigh, N.C., said that he could see how the offer was  enticing to some of his former teammates. "I know one guy who's working at  McDonald's for $5.50 an hour," said Gannon. "For $500 a half-hour, he probably  could have come up with something."  </P> <P> Most junior college players love the attention they receive from big-time  recruiters. Not David Butler. Last year, while at San Jacinto Junior College in  Texas, he shaved the letters of the school name into his head (just San Jac,  his head wasn't that big). Why did he do it?  </P> <P> "To keep the recruiters away," said Butler.  </P> <P> It worked, except for UNLV's Jerry Tarkanian. Butler now is playing with the  Runnin' Rebels, and UNLV is shaved into his head.  </P> <P> The Brendan Byrne Arena at the Meadowlands in New Jersey is installing a  parquet floor, with Seton Hall and Connecticut to use it for the first time  Saturday night.  </P> <P> Wonder if the new floor has anything to do with the Meadowlands beginning a  full-scale assault to attract the 1994 NCAA Final Four?  </P> <P> When Boston College guard Dana Barros threw in nine three-point shots against  Pitt in an 95-83 upset of the Panthers, Pitt Coach Paul Evans was stunned by  the distance on some of them.  </P> <P> "Some of those were fours," said Evans. Barros finished with 38 points, tying  the Big East single-game scoring record set by Dan Callandrillo at Seton Hall  during the 1981-82 season and equaled by both Seton Hall's Mark Bryant and  Georgetown's Jaren Jackson last year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["New Talk" column: "United States Extends China's Most- </F> Favored-Nation Status for Another Year"]    [Text] After a protracted effort, U.S. President Bill  Clinton has finally "turned around." He announced yesterday  afternoon (0400 Asian time) the U.S. decision to extend China's  Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status for another year, going  against the statement he made the same time last year that he  might completely rescind China's MFN trading status next year.    In fact, Clinton almost made up his mind to "turn around"  last fall. He made the first step toward this end by going to  Seattle to preside over the Asian summit and by meeting with PRC  Chairman Jiang Zemin for the first time since assuming office.    By that time, the United States had developed a new outlook  on the international situation. After the dramatic changes in  eastern Europe, the relations between the United States and  Western Europe were not as close as they had been immediately  following World War II. This was most clearly seen in the fact  that several U.S. proposals for settling conflicts in former  Yugoslavia were rejected by western countries. After the  disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the United States  sought to improve its relations with Russia. However, Yeltsin's  position in Russia has been shaky, and he was not even able to  appoint his trusted follower Gaidar as prime minister.  Therefore, the importance of Russia for U.S. politics is  questionable in the future.    Apart from political problems, there are economic problems.  It is clear that Asia will grow further economically.  President Clinton, who did not attach importance to Asia in the  first part of his presidency, changed his outlook in the second  half of the year. He felt it necessary to increase U.S.  influence in Asia by establishing friendly ties with Asian  countries anew so that the U.S. economy could draw new life from  developing countries in this region, while China registered the  greatest economic growth among Asian countries.    Over the last six months, the United States has adopted a  carrot- and-stick policy toward China. While sending  secretaries of the treasury, commerce, and agriculture  departments to China to improve bilateral relations, Clinton  sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to China to apply  pressure. Christopher tried to accomplish his task by bringing  China to her knees.    The United States has actually been following the beaten  path. In order to return to Asia, it has applied heavy pressure  on Asian countries over the last six months. It has applied  pressure on Malaysia and Indonesia over the trade union problem  and on Singapore over the caning punishment inflicted on an  American youth. It has also threatened to impose trade  sanctions upon Japan under the Special 301 provision in  connection with Japan's market barriers to U.S. goods and has  threatened to use force against North Korea on the nuclear  issue. However, these countries all rejected the U.S. demands.    China's approach has been open and above-board. While  expressing its willingness to improve relations with the United  States and sending trade groups to the United States to place  orders, China has opposed the high U.S. pressure. In the end,  Clinton was forced to "turn around" on his own, correcting the  mistake he made a year ago. To soothe different political  factions at home, he played tricks in the wording of the  decision and the measures concerned to cover up his  embarrassment.    He announced that he would extend China's MFN trading status  for another year, rather than extending the status indefinitely,  as favored by the majority of American people. While indicating  that he will not link human rights with MFN trading status in  the future, he insisted on imposing certain sanctions. But he  will only impose sanctions on weapons valued at $200 million,  while the Sino-U.S. trade volume will amount to $40 billion in  the future.    The problem concerning trade between China and the United  States, about which the two sides have been haggling for a long  time, has finally been solved because the United States has  withdrawn from its original position, though not without  "embarrassment."</p>

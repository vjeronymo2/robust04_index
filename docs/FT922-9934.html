			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Funds to rebuild Los Angeles sought from private sector MR Peter Ueberroth, the businessman appointed to head the drive to sort out Los Angeles after the riots last week which killed 58, has put big private sector US corporations on notice that he expects them to provide funds to rebuild the inner city. Mr Ueberroth will head a non-profit organisation  - dubbed Rebuilding LA  - which will seek public and private sector funds, including appeals to foreign investors headed by Japanese and Korean companies. Los Angeles lurched towards a semblance of normality yesterday as businesses and schools reopened, the curfew was lifted last night, and the city confronted the task of rebuilding after last week's riots. Mr Ueberroth, a former baseball commissioner who also stage-managed the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, has taken the unpaid post at the invitation of Mayor Tom Bradley. His appointment drew a broadly positive reception, although some minority community leaders pointed to his lack of experience in race relations. Mr Ueberroth said he would proceed only if he won the support of the African-American, Latino and Asian communities. The federal government yesterday sent Mr David Kearns, deputy secretary of education and a former chairman of Xerox, the US reprographics group, to co-ordinate government efforts to rebuild the city. The White House said the federal government would be making some Dollars 300m (Pounds 170m) of disaster aid available, of which two thirds would be to rebuild damaged infrastructure. In addition, the Small Business Administration is expected to provide Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m of loans. Damage from rioting and looting was estimated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department yesterday at Dollars 717m, and more than 10,000 businesses have been destroyed. Officials said that by yesterday morning 2,383 people had been recorded as injured. The White House said snipers had fired at National Guardsmen and law enforcement officers, adding that the Californian authorities had asked for federal troops to stay on duty in Los Angeles 'for a while longer'. Patrols by heavily armed US marines and National Guards  - nearly 8,500 are there  - are expected to continue this week. Tension between blacks and Korean Americans remains high after the riots which saw dozens of Korean stores torched and looted during the worst ever urban violence in the US. More than 30,000 people, mostly Korean Americans, marched in the streets at the weekend in an appeal for peace. Hundreds of volunteers of all races joined in an effort to clean up the gutted stores in South Central, Los Angeles, the centre of the rioting. Hollywood stars helped with sweeping and food distribution. 'Magic' Johnson, the basketball star who recently announced his retirement because he has contracted the HIV virus, said he would use his personal fortune to buy property in the city's worst-hit areas. A round-the-clock grassroots relief effort sprang up at First African Methodist Episcopal Church on Adams Boulevard in South Central. The pastor, the Reverend Cecil Murray, likened last week's fires to Dante's Inferno: 'But people are now combining hope with hopelessness, tomorrow with yesterday. We feel that the movement for freedom in China, Berlin and South Africa and Russia is spreading around the world. The walls are tumbling down.' Residents in South Central Los Angeles remain sceptical of how much the city and federal government can do. One of them, Miss Pat Coleman, said she expected interest in the inner city would decline sharply once people forget the television images of violence, and she predicts more black-on-black crime. Miss Caroline Smith, a secretary on sick leave, agreed: 'Ain't nobody can help us but a Higher Being. I've given up on people, that's why I stick with my pet animals." Black resentment of the 300,000-strong member Korean American community is strong, particularly against the liquor stores which were victims of what even the blacks agree was selective violence. Blacks complain that the Koreans are abusive and eager to overcharge on essentials such as milk, and that they are unwilling to hire African Americans.

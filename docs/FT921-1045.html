			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Frogmore doubles to Pounds 4.4m FROGMORE ESTATES, the property company which last June defeated a hostile bid from Southend Property, doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.15m to Pounds 4.35m in the six months to December 31. Turnover rose 13 per cent to Pounds 17m. Mr Dennis Cope, chairman, said the profit was derived solely from trading activities, with a small loss of Pounds 149,000 (Pounds 4.02m profit) from the sale of investment properties. The decision to slim down, which the company took at the beginning of the recession, had a favourable impact on the result, he said. The result was struck after sharply reduced provisions of Pounds 727,000 (Pounds 6.74m) for property write-downs. The interim dividend is lifted to 3.4p (3.2p), payable from earnings per share on trading activities of 7.5p (2.9p losses). Frogmore's contracted rent roll at December 31 was Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 16.6m) and several rent reviews are outstanding. There were no significant bad debts, Mr Cope said. Sales of 111 housing units were made in the joint-venture low-cost housing developments, while reservations and completions continued 'at a satisfactory rate'. In the current half the company had already committed more than Pounds 11m for property acquisitions. At December 31 borrowings totalled Pounds 7m.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Danish PM appeals for Yes vote on Maastricht: No campaign lags well behind on eve of today's referendum MR POUL NYRUP Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, issued a last-minute appeal to Danes yesterday to vote for the Maastricht treaty in today's referendum, as opinion polls showed the Yes campaign holding a substantial lead. A final Gallup survey, to be published today, indicated 58 per cent support for the treaty and 42 per cent against. But the survey allowed participants only a Yes or No choice, disregarding the large numbers claiming to be undecided or planning to abstain. An earlier opinion poll showed the Yes camp with 50 per cent, against 32 per cent for No, as well as 14 per cent undecided and 4 per cent abstaining. Gallup incorrectly forecast the result of Denmark's previous referendum last June, which rejected Maastricht by 50.7 per cent to 49.3 per cent, throwing European Community strategy into confusion and forcing the EC to grant Denmark opt-outs from the treaty's provisions on closer political and economic union. But yesterday's polling showed 75 per cent of those questioned expected a Yes this time, including 63 per cent of No voters. In his appeal for a Yes vote, Mr Rasmussen was supported by Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, who regards the vote as a test for the EC's policy of enlargement to include Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway by the mid-1990s. 'A Danish Yes would be a green light for the conclusion of the enlargement negotiations,' Mr Bildt told the Financial Times. 'We have an obvious interest in a Danish Yes.' He said: 'The period of doubt and hesitation in Europe between the Danish No on June 2 last year and the expected Yes on May 18 is now coming to an end. Although the cost has been high - notably on the financial markets - I believe that Europe has benefited from the doubts and the debates of this year.' Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, also expressed confidence. Commenting on Denmark's success in winning 'opt-out' arrangements at the EC summit in December, Mr Kinkel said: 'In Edinburgh we took full consideration of Danish arguments and embedded these in the overall context of the treaty. I am confident that the Danish population, like their Scandinavian neighbours, will react positively to this process.' Brussels officials remained wary of predicting a favourable result. 'We're all on tenterhooks here,' a Commission official said. Mr Rasmussen said the EC, currently under the Danish presidency, must set aside its more visionary projects. 'A Yes vote . . .will be a Yes to a new period of pragmatic decisions positive for ordinary European citizens in their daily life,' he argued. The No lobby complained that the political establishment, overwhelmingly in favour of a Yes vote, was conducting a scare campaign. The Commission confirmed yesterday it had sharply reduced its forecast for economic growth in the EC this year. EC officials denied there was a decision to delay releasing the forecasts until after the referendum.

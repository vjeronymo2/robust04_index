			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Toward Economic Union"] </F>   [Text] A routine meeting has taken place in Kiev between  delegations from the Russian and Ukrainian Unions of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, led by the presidents of these  unions, Arkadiy Volskiy and Leonid Kuchma. Though directors of  industrial enterprises and production companies participated in  it, it definitely had a direct bearing on agriculture. After  all, the severance of economic ties between Russia and Ukraine  also hit rural areas hard.    As we know, when the USSR collapsed, production of row-crop  tractors remained in Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus] while  production of grain-harvesting combines remained in Russia.  What is more, the "Rostselmash" plant receives diesel engines  from Kharkov. As a result the slightest failure in the delivery  of parts from Russia to the Kharkov "Serp i Molot" plant may  lead to its shutdown, and this will disrupt the production of  grain-harvesting combines, which in turn may disrupt  agricultural work in Ukraine. Russia will also have a hard time.    The meeting's participants came to the unanimous decision  that the only way out of the present situation is to form an  effective economic union. They adopted an Appeal to the  Presidents, Parliaments, and Governments of Ukraine and Russia  containing a demand to do everything in their power to create  appropriate conditions of economic integration between the two  countries.    Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who received Arkadiy  Volskiy and Leonid Kuchma, was familiarized with the document.</p>

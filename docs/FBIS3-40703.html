UAE Economy and Trade  Minister Sa'id Ghabbash told AL-HAYAH that his ministry is  currently drafting a study on the GATT agreement for submission  to the Cabinet so that the later can decide whether the UAE will  join GATT.    He added that the study will elucidate how joining GATT  would  be to the UAE's advantage. He said that the UAE has observer  status in GATT and participates in all of its meetings.    Economic sources assert that joining GATT would provide many  benefits for the UAE, because taxes in the UAE on imports are  very low; they do not exceed 4 percent and are as low as 1  percent for many commodities and imports.    If it joins GATT, the UAE will be compensated by a drop in  taxes and customs duties levied on UAE exports to other  countries of the world.    Representatives of 117 countries approved the agreement on  15  December 1993. The OECD expects that international trade will  grow by 6.5 percent in 1995 as a result of the agreement reached  in the Uruguay Round.    Ghabbash said that the effect of the UAE's entry into GATT  on  UAE ready-made clothing exports to the United States would not  be quickly felt, because the transition to implementation of the  agreement regarding clothes and textiles will last 10 years. He  said that the export of ready-made, UAE-made clothes to the  United States will be governed by a bilateral agreement between  the two countries. He added that it was decided to extend this  agreement for two years as of 1 January 1994 following  negotiations between the Economy and Trade Ministry and the U.S.  trade office.    The UAE Cabinet has approved a memorandum of understanding  stipulating an extension of the agreement with the United  States. This approval was conveyed to the U.S. Ambassador in Abu  Dhabi early this week.    Ghabbash told AL-HAYAH that he expects a memorandum of  understanding exchange between the ministry and the U.S. Embassy  in Abu Dhabi next week.    He said that the agreement will regulate new quotas of  ready-made clothing exports to the United States, and that it  includes joint measures to stop producers outside of the UAE  from circumventing the provisions of the agreement.    Ghabbash stressed that the Economy and Trade Ministry will  cooperate with the Finance and Industry Ministry and pertinent  UAE customs authorities to establish regulations that provide  for effective supervision, ensure compliance by economic units  in the UAE with decrees concerning the export of ready-made  clothes, and eliminate the circumvention practiced by exporters  to the United States.    An U.S. delegation recently visited ready-made clothing  factories in the UAE with a view toward ascertaining their  capabilities and production capacities and stopping violations  regarding the export of their products to the United States.    Ghabbash said that the UAE will demonstrate greater concern  with stopping erroneous practices on the part of foreign  exporters of ready-made clothes through the UAE.    He added that the ministry held a course last October on  "Controlling Export Operations" for representatives of the  Economy and Trade Ministry, Finance and Industry Ministry, and  other pertinent agencies in the UAE.    Economic circles indicate that, as of June 1993, the spun  thread, textiles, and clothing sector had the fourth-largest  number of factories registered in the UAE (116 factories or 12.8  percent of the total number of factories in the UAE). In  addition, factories have been built in the Jabal 'Ali free zone  to enjoy the advantages which this zone offers to exporters.    The Finance and Industry Ministry recently decided to stop  issuing new licenses for ready-made clothing factories. It is  preparing a comprehensive study commissioned by the cabinet on  the position of this industry. The ministry stresses the  unfeasibility of establishing new factories in this sector at  present.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has  emphatically welcomed the agreement [between the Bosnians and  Bosnian Croats achieved in Washington]. By its dedicated  participation, the U.S. Administration has made an essential  contribution to it, Kinkel said in Bonn. Right down to the  final stage of the negotiations, there was close coordination  between Germany and its partners, in particular the United  States. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressly  thanked the Federal Government on the telephone.    Kinkel stated: "The momentum for a political and peaceful  solution to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina must now be used with  all one's strength. It cannot and must not be permitted that  barbarism returns to Europe." Bonn expects the parties to the  negotiations to settle the remaining open questions with good  will and with the goal of coming to a lasting agreement.</p>

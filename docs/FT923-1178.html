			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Observer: A trouble aired . . . Don't talk of the 'flight from the lira' to the Bank of Italy's 71-year-old governor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. On top of the thankless task of defending the national currency, he has been having ups and downs with airlines too. For instance, the aircraft taking him to last weekend's IMF meeting in Washington returned to Rome with a fault an hour after take-off - which may explain a certain change in his demeanour when he finally arrived. Normally extraordinarily reserved in public, he began airing his feelings about such things as the behaviour of Italy's European Community partners on the fateful weekend of September 12, which led to the lira devaluation and currency-market chaos. While admitting his country's failure to put its financial house in order, he plainly deplores other EC governments' unwillingness to devalue in concert, even though a number knew their currencies needed adjusting. If the principle of a general realignment had been followed there and then, he said, 'the Germans would have certainly lowered their interest rates further'. The British shouldn't need telling who were the main culprits he had in mind. Whether his communicative mode will continue can only remain to be seen. But the omens seem good. His flight home for urgent appointments yesterday was two hours late.</p>

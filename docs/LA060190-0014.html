			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TOTAL SCHWARZENEGGER;  </P> <P> FILM: PAUL VERHOEVEN'S FUTURISTIC ACTION-THRILLER 'TOTAL RECALL' PLUNGES THE  MUSCULAR HERO IN A DEADLY GAME OF MIND OVER MATTER.  </P> <P> For anyone who's ever suspected that psychotic fantasies lay behind many of the  big 1980s action movies, the spectacular futuristic thriller "Total Recall"  (citywide) offers tongue-in-cheek proof.  </P> <P> Here, possible psychosis is the movie's mainspring. Is the major character,  Arnold Schwarzenegger's Doug Quaid, really a malcontent construction worker  obsessed with dreams of Mars and sleazy brunettes? Or is he "Hauser," a  turncoat secret agent, his memory erased by the all-powerful intergalactic  "Agency"?  </P> <P> "Quaid," who supposedly lives in a dull, metallic Earth city linked by huge TV  screens and super-clean subways, is a nowhere man living a nowhere life.  "Hauser," missing link to a group of Martian revolutionaries, is the most  important man in the solar system, a man everyone wants to find or kill.  </P> <P> Action-movie cliche or paranoia? The movie tends to keep us on the edge,  trapped between these two possibilities. It's a bit schizoid itself. Part of  "Total Recall" is a typical Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle, with the massively  muscled hero racing through another hostile world, villains, explosions and  bloodshed around every corner. And part of it is an ingenious and ribald probe  into psychological terror, like director Paul Verhoeven's earlier "The Fourth  Man." One moment, Schwarzenegger is ordinary guy Quaid strapped to an operating  chair at Rekall Inc., where an imaginary Martian vacation is going to be  harmlessly injected into his brain. The next moment, hell breaks dementedly  loose.  </P> <P> Verhoeven, working from an often-rewritten screenplay distantly based on Philip  K. Dick's brilliant 1966 short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,"  keeps ringing these truth-or-illusion changes throughout the movie. And if they  don't always click, if the movie sometimes seems overwhelmed by its budget and  its legendary third-act problems, it's still entertainingly raw and brutal,  full of whiplash pace and juicy exaggeration.  </P> <P> Midway through, "Total Recall" achieves its maximum intensity. An infuriatingly  prissy psycho-babbler, Roy Brocksmith's Dr. Edgemar, shows up suddenly in a  Martian hotel, informs the beleaguered Quaid/Hauser that he's in the throes of  a "schizoid embolism" and asks him to pop a reality pill and wake up. This  little rationalist -- who looks a bit like a movie critic -- asks which reality  makes more sense: being a frustrated construction worker or an invincible  super-spy? It's a peak of crazy humor -- and it gains its punch from the whole  genre and its larger-than-life heroes: James Bond, Rambo, Schwarzenegger  himself.  </P> <P> "Total Recall" will strike some audiences as too brutal or coarse-tempered, too  obsessed with violence-for-violence's sake. But that's not its main problem.  Verhoeven never shows freakishness or bloodshed out of sadism or callousness.  Much of his talent lies in his willingness to go to extremes: to push the  youth-sex movie to new frankness in "Turkish Delight," scrape the urban  underbelly in "Spetters," make merry with mechanical mayhem in "RoboCop." And  when he goes too far, he knows it; coming from a Pentecostalist religious  background, he often gives an impression of consciously violating taboo.  </P> <P> When "Total Recall" is at its most savage or excessive -- as in the maniacal  chases and the wild apocalyptic paroxysm of the climax -- it's at its best.  It's weaker on structure, overall coherence, the humorous or romantic  interludes.  </P> <P> "RoboCop" was a wild nose-thumb, a definitive auto-critique of all the "new  brutalist" techno-pop action movies of the mid-'80s. But "Total Recall," though  it has the same kind of anti-fascist overview, is only satiric occasionally --  in its dumb-glossy newscasts, its absurdly gabby RoboCab driver, or in its  Venusville brothel scene, with a triple-breasted prostitute and an atmosphere  that suggests a kinked-up version of the "Star Wars" frontier bar.  </P> <P> The future-Earth urban environment doesn't have the hip density of Ridley  Scott's L.A. in "Blade Runner" or Terry Gilliam's London in "Brazil" -- and  Mars tends to be a red blur, full of lethal rabbit warrens. But the actors  sometimes suggest an emerging Verhoeven stock company. Ronny Cox turns up again  as a kind-eyed mogul with a heart of ice. Michael Ironside as Richter, the main  thug, looks and acts something like "RoboCop's" maniac, Kurtwood Smith. There  are heroines here too -- but Rachel Ticotin's brunette rebel registers less  strongly than Sharon Stone's ambiguous blonde slut-wife.  </P> <P> In "Total Recall," Schwarzenegger fills the role Rutger Hauer used to have in  Verhoeven's world; the movie exposes him more, makes him attractively  vulnerable. Schwarzenegger became a star after he turned himself into a blocky  muscle-mechanic in empty movies like "Predator" and "Commando." But what  attracted him to this movie may be its ultimate "loner" role. Quaid/Hauser is  not only alienated from his environment; he's never really sure if his  environment exists.  </P> <P> It's not an unmixed achievement. Occasionally we get the old brutal one-liners  that his audience expects. Here, they fit neither character nor situation. And  the script doesn't keep Schwarzenegger's identities straight. Characters who  knew him on Mars call him "Quaid" when they should be calling him "Hauser."  (That's not a minor quibble, since the story hinges crucially on the  psychological distinctions between the two.)  </P> <P> All this may simply illustrate the difference between enlivening a $15-million  movie and a $65-million one. Viewed as an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, "Total  Recall" is a step forward, his best vehicle since "The Terminator." Viewed as a  Verhoeven movie, it's a step back from "RoboCop." It has the same velocity and  ferocity, but not the same control, impudence or incandescence.  </P> <P> Split all the way through, "Total Recall" (rated R for nudity, sex, language  and extreme violence) soars when it sends up its conventions, crashes a little  when it accepts them. But Verhoeven devotees shouldn't be perturbed. After all,  look at "Dune." And look at the movies David Lynch made after it.  </P></p>

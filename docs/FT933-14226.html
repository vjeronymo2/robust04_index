			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Leading Article: German mould YESTERDAY'S announcement that the Bavarian state government is to sell off its 8 per cent stake in Deutsche Aerospace provides a further indication of the degree to which unification's turbulent aftermath is shaking the foundations of the German economic system. The united Germany which eventually emerges from the current recession will differ from the old west Germany in more profound respects than just population and geography. Necessity, rather than ideology, is the primary reason for the Bavarian Land's decision. No one can doubt the urgent need to raise revenue from any source possible, both centrally and regionally, in order to close Germany's gaping government budget deficit. But the sale - the first significant divestiture by a regional administration of a strategic industrial stake, originally taken to aid the postwar reconstruction - does mark a significant moment in Germany's economic evolution. Many other state habits, such as the vast panoply of subsidies and holdings, may not survive the budgetary squeeze. Nor is the state sector alone being shaken up. Three years of high interest rates and a strong D-Mark have forced German industry to think hard about ways to cut costs and become more competitive. Companies are, as a result, looking beyond Germany's borders: to New York for capital, and to east and south Europe for cheaper labour. Germany's social partners are, meanwhile, slowly modifying past practices which have sometimes stressed regulated uniformity over competition and flexibility. The strains in east Germany resulting from Germany's co-ordinated wage-bargaining system signal the need for change; the draft law on flexible working hours, approved by the cabinet this week, suggests it is beginning. This is not an obituary for an economic model which, in the main, has served postwar Germany well. The structure of German industry is, and will remain, very different from the Anglo-Saxon model: secrecy remains highly prized, public companies are much less common, ownership is more concentrated, industrial cross-holdings are normal and hostile takeovers rare. Yet change will continue at the margin. For even if the Bundesbank chooses to cut interest rates at today's council meeting - and the French authorities must surely hope it will - the pressure on industry to become more competitive can only intensify.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As has become known, in the draft budget which will  be submitted for examination by the Russian Government,  expenditures for the upkeep of state television and radio  companies are envisaged at only 25 percent of requirements.  These funds are not even enough to pay for the operation of  television and radio transmitters. Here is what was said in  this connection by Aleksandr Nekhoroshev, the director of  Russian Television's "Vesti" program.    [Begin Nekhoroshev recording] This means that the Ministry  of  Communications, which must receive 85 percent of this amount for  the upkeep of transmitters, will be forced to switch off the  transmitters because of non-payment. That is to say, from the  minute that the government approves this harmful budget for  television and radio, we could all expect at any minute the  switching off of state television and radio and, in this way,  perhaps the last instrument for unifying the inhabitants of our  country, Russians scattered accross our great power, could be  broken.    The idea has already been voiced that this government will  close state television and radio but that another structure of  the government will open it. These are questions for the  government and the people who are working in it.    We are also worried because, taking into account the  aggressiveness of all commercial structures, we are absolutely  convinced that both in Moscow and in the regions, from the  moment state television and radio are closed, great efforts will  be made to seize them. In this way we are now all on the  threshold of a danger which on the whole was deflected both in  August 1991 and October. Attempts to stifle in particular the  All-Russian TV and Radio Company failed then, and this was  splendid. Now, however, by the hands of bureaucrats, quietly,  by one stroke of the pen, something could be perpetrated which  even in my worst dreams I am unable to imagine.    On behalf of the journalists of the All-Russian TV and Radio  Company I can now request Premier Minister Chernomyrdin for an  immediate meeting in order to discuss the catastrophic situation  in which state television and radio finds itself. It seems to  me that for the time being there still is some sense in holding  this meeting. It could very well be the case that after Friday  there will no longer be any sense in holding such a meeting.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Arts: Katya Kabanova - Opera Glyndebourne Touring Opera launches its annual autumn tour in a new and rewarding way. The home theatre, normally the launch pad, has been rendered unusable by the current re-building programme, so the company set off instead with a month-long sojourn at Sadler's Wells Theatre - its first-ever in London. This is a splendid venture. Too little opera of a non-metropolitan origin has been reaching London recently; the programme of the tour - Katya Kabanova, Figaro and The Rake's Progress - represents some of Glyndebourne's most interesting work of the last decade-and-a-half; and Sadler's Wells, though not exactly a lovable home-away-from-home, does offer the productions a performing space generally in scale with their original dimensions. The first opera of the tour, Katya, provides an additional source of pleasure: historical appropriateness. In this same theatre 42 years ago, under Rafael Kubelik's baton, Sadler's Wells Opera mounted the first British production of the very same opera - the initial flourish of the enthusiasm for Janacek that was eventually to lead to the current national Janacek boom. That Katya was performed, of course, in English translation. The single cloud over Thursday's opening night came with GTO's dotty insistence on having an almost entirely British cast prattle away in carefully-learnt Czech while surtitles pour out overhead. In this of all theatres, and operas, the need for the closest possible communication between singer and audience should surely outweigh any ideological insistence on the purity of the original language. This factor has to be stressed, since it seemed the main cause of a lack of communicative passion in an otherwise thoroughly well-studied, seriously-addressed performance. Nikolaus Lehnhoff's 1988 production, in the beautifully stark, bright-coloured designs of Tobias Hoheisel, offers an unusually definite (if at times over-detailed) response to both the bourgeois Russian location and Janacek's electrically vital musical idiom. It creates a form of heightened operatic naturalism capable of charging the work with new intensity - a form which then requires to be seized and filled out by cast and conductor equally. On Thursday this task was tentatively approached. David Angus's conducting of the GTO Orchestra was musicianly (scoring carefully balanced, words impressively audible) but altogether too cautious, too lacking in firmness of attack. Most of the cast sing well - notably Timothy Robinson (a more-than-promisingly sweet-voiced Kudryash), Adele Paxton (Varvara) and Christopher Gillett (Tichon) - in a rather politely English way. The British debut of the handsome French tenor Christian Papis (Boris) introduces us to a fine, dramatically responsive singer who would be a godsend to our companies in the right repertory: Gounod and Massenet, I feel, rather than Janacek. Susan Bullock in the title role has much of the desired freedom and freshness of presence, and produces much tenderly floated soft singing; under pressure she can sound edgy, overstretched. So far only Eiddwen Harrhy, imaginatively cast as the most silkily venomous of Kabanichas, achieves any consistent stoking of the opera's fires. GTO at Sadler's Wells Theatre, September 24 - October 24, then in Plymouth, Sheffield, Southampton, Manchester and Oxford until November 28</p>

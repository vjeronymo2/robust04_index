			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Peace role in pieces: Peacekeeping and military intervention have become indistinguishable Not so long ago, we all thought we knew what 'peacekeeping' meant. If two warring parties agreed to a ceasefire, a peacekeeping force was sent in, usually by the UN, to help them observe it. This happened in the third world. Peacekeeping was not required in Europe unless you count Cyprus. Peace in Europe was kept by the mutual deterrence of two heavily armed alliances, each dominated by a nuclear superpower. Peacekeeping was an instrument the superpowers used to contain conflicts on the periphery of their spheres of influence, so as to lessen the risk that they themselves would become directly involved. Consequently they did not contribute troops of their own. All in all, peacekeeping was rather small beer. In 1987 the UN had only five peacekeeping missions on foot, deploying a total of 10,000 personnel at a cost of Dollars 233m. It was not something a serious military organisation such as Nato would bother with. How times have changed. Today peacekeeping is all the rage, especially in Europe. Both the US and Russia have contributed troops to UN peacekeeping forces. And Nato is very much interested, seeing peacekeeping as one activity which can occupy its formidable staff of military planners, and indeed justify its continued existence, now that its original raison d'etre has gone. But no one knows any longer what peacekeeping is. Most of the 13 current UN peacekeeping missions, on which 75,000 troops are now deployed at a cost of Dollars 3bn, involve tasks well beyond those of 'classic' peacekeeping, such as monitoring or organising elections, aid to refugees and disaster victims, demobilisation of forces, collection of weapons, and disarmament of paramilitary or irregular units. In an excellent survey of the subject published last month* Mats Berdal, a research associate at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, points out that peacekeeping forces now have to operate in much less 'permissive' environments than in the past. Instead of states with effective control of their territory and armed forces, peacekeeping forces find themselves confronting 'myriad paramilitary groups, militias and 'uncontrolled' elements', which frequently ignore ceasefires negotiated by their nominal superiors. Thus although in theory peacekeeping, as distinct from armed intervention, still requires the consent of the warring parties, in practice 'only partial or sporadic consent obtains'. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, was aware of this problem last year when he drafted his 'agenda for peace'. He described peacekeeping as a 'technique' which could contribute both to preventing conflict and to peacemaking, and defined it as 'the deployment of a UN presence in the field, hitherto with the consent of all the parties concerned'. Similarly, Nato has now produced a 'draft doctrine for peace support operations', of which peacekeeping 'narrowly defined' is only one member. And even in that narrow definition, 'consent of the parties' has disappeared. Peacekeeping, according to Nato, 'is the containment, moderation and/or termination of hostilities between or within states, through the medium of an impartial third party intervention, organised and directed internationally, using military forces, and civilians to complement the political process of conflict resolution and to restore and maintain peace'. Nato uses the phrase 'conflict prevention' for activities under Chapter VI of the UN Charter, which deals with 'pacific settlement of disputes'. It uses the word 'peacemaking' for diplomatic actions, up to and including sanctions, which are 'conducted after the commencement of conflict, with the aim of establishing a peaceful settlement'; whereas 'peace enforcement', in Nato's vocabulary, involves using military means to restore peace, as provided for in Article 43 of the UN Charter. This is confusing, because Mr Boutros-Ghali, who coined the phrase 'peace enforcement', had distinguished it from use of force under Article 43. His proposed 'peace enforcement units' would be sent, as a 'provisional measure' under Article 40, to 'restore and maintain' a ceasefire which had been 'agreed to but not complied with'. To make matters even more confusing, Mr Boutros-Ghali included both types of enforcement under the heading of 'peacemaking', even though he defined this as 'action to bring hostile parties to agreement, essentially through such peaceful means as those foreseen in Chapter VI'. Clearly the key difference between peacekeeping and enforcement is that the former is supposed to be impartial, whereas the latter involves taking sides. But the distinction is getting blurred. In Bosnia the UN 'protection force' is still trying to behave impartially, in spite of UN sanctions against Serbia, and has therefore failed to act on Security Council resolutions authorising it to use force to get supplies through to suffering civilians. In Somalia, by contrast, the mandate of the UN force referred specifically to Chapter VII of the charter, and the UN force found itself involved in clashes with one of the Somali factions. It is probably inaccurate to call it a peacekeeping force at all. The result of all this confusion is that UN soldiers anywhere are becoming less and less credible either as impartial peacekeepers or as enforcers of Security Council decisions. The matter should be clarified without delay. * Whither UN Peacekeeping? IISS/Brassey's Pounds 10/Dollars 17.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dalya Shehori] </F>   [Excerpts] Mystery surrounds the presence of a second  person who entered the Cave of the Patriarchs after Barukh  Goldstein and who, according to testimonies by soldiers who  guarded the eastern gate, was carrying a Galil rifle. When  Major Dov Stelman, the cave commander, arrived at the cave and  ordered all those present to remain on the premises, this person  had already left and was not questioned by the police. Colonel  Yo'av Galant, who testified before the Shamgar Commission on 31  March behind closed doors, said "some degree of cooperation may  be involved here."    Col. Galant believes Goldstein's operation was planned.  Galant outlined the conclusions and recommendations he drafted  in a report he prepared at the request of Major General Sha'ul  Mufaz, commander of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in  the West Bank. The report recommends that the prevailing status  quo at the cave be changed and that a full "territorial"  division be made between Jews and Muslims by banning the Jews  from praying at Isaac Hall; that new security arrangements be  prepared and that the cave be reopened to the public only after  they are completed, "even if it takes a very long time;" and  that the security arrangements include stationing a significant  police force, an antiterror team, and a permanent and  well-trained military unit. The report also recommends that,  after all of the steps are taken, worshipers not be allowed to  enter the cave armed. [passage omitted]    Answering a question by Commission Chairman Shamgar, Col.  Galant confirmed that "the other person was only seen coming in;  no one saw him leave." Shamgar speculated, therefore, that the  man could have left the cave along with the Arabs who were  fleeing after the shooting, and Galant agreed. [passage omitted]    Galant further said that it is assumed that Goldstein  entered  Isaac Hall from Abraham Hall and that the Jewish worshipers  there did not know what his purpose was -- that is, they were  not certain he was about to commit an act of violence. Perhaps  they thought that "in the framework of the constant provocations  that take place in the cave, they would let him in to tease the  Arabs a little; after all, it was Purim. No big deal. Then  Goldstein went in, and they closed the doors behind him."  Galant stressed, however, that he had no evidence to support  this assumption and that he only brought it up to illustrate the  dilemmas he encountered while preparing his report, but he  formed no opinion on this issue. [passage omitted]    Col. Galant believes "Goldstein's act was premeditated."  This assumption is based on the fact that he was carrying a  large number of magazines and that he left notes indicating that  he feared he might not return from his operation. "He went  there to shoot; otherwise, it is hard to explain why he took  earplugs with him. I believe everything he did was perfectly  timed to the moment the Muslims kneel to pray to attain the  maximum effect during his attack," he noted.    Galant added that Goldstein was killed by blows to the head  from heavy objects and did not shoot himself, as was initially  believed. [passage omitted]</p>

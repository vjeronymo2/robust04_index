			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Ringing the tills - Retailers should focus on the phone Electronic home shopping may be the coming thing, but many UK retailers do not yet seem to have got to grips with the plain old telephone. One in five customers phoning shops to find out about, for example, opening hours or availability of products fails to get through at the first attempt, and may decide to go elsewhere. The finding comes from research conducted by the Henley Centre, the forecasting group, for the British Retail Consortium and British Telecommunications.* Henley describes the telephone as a 'low-tech bridge to the high-tech future'. The most sophisticated consumers, who are also often those with the highest disposable incomes, show the most interest in phone-based buying. 'The first retailers to offer a credible telephone service could well gain real strategic advantage. Those retailers who cannot compete could soon lose position,' the group warns. Henley's findings on the state of retailers' telephone systems comes from a large 'mystery shopping' exercise, using researchers posing as consumers, conducted in September. More than 800 outlets, including clothes, DIY and grocery stores, as well as travel agents, cinemas and restaurants, were phoned for Henley by specialist group MSS. Of the unsuccessful calls, two-thirds were due to engaged lines, while the remaining third just carried on ringing. Of those that were successful, nearly 20 per cent took more than five rings to answer and a similar proportion were handed on to a second person to deal with. These transfers took an average of 30 seconds - a long time to be left in what was generally a silent limbo, says Henley. Two-thirds told callers why they were being transferred, but only half were given the name of the person to whom they were being connected. Once passed on to a second department, almost all callers were asked to repeat their previous questions. When the right person was found, staff had to leave the phone to track down information in a quarter of cases, with an average wait of 48 seconds, although almost a third had to wait up to three minutes. Shop staff seldom have all the information they need at their fingertips, despite the advanced technology being used for stock control, says Henley. The 'mystery' shoppers rated the manner of staff highly: 'In most cases, staff sounded friendly, professional and happy to answer the query.' Interestingly, the more complex the inquiries, the more motivated staff appeared to be to answer them. 'With difficult questions, staff sounded happier, more friendly and more knowledgeable,' observes Henley. Clearly, retailers need to balance the needs of customers visiting the store with the demands of consumers on the telephone. One recommendation from the study is that retailers should consider installing automatic call answering systems to handle routine questions, such as opening hours and locations, while diverting more complicated queries to specially-trained staff. Overall, Henley estimates that 78m calls a year are currently made to retailers in the UK - a figure which is forecast to grow to nearly 400m by the end of the decade as consumers increasingly expect to operate in a 'teleculture'. A separate consumer study conducted for the report showed that, in spite of patchy performance, shoppers are reasonably happy with the telephone service they currently receive. But this cannot continue, Henley concludes. 'Customers' expectations are rising. They are becoming more confident about complaining. And if they do not complain, they vote with their feet. Innovative operators in other sectors, such as First Direct, Next Directory and Direct Line all offer effective telephone services. Why not retailers?' * High Street Teleculture.

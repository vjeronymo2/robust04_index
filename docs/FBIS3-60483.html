			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Yet Another Calamity"] </F>   [Text] The number of diphtheria cases in Kiev continues to  grow. At present, 523 such cases have been recorded. This  fearsome infection has also struck 53 children. The number of  diphtheria cases is particularly high among workers in the trade  sphere, medical institutions, public catering, and transport.  Quite a number of other infectious diseases, among them many  exotic ones, brought from other countries, can also be observed.    As Lyubov Nekrasova, the city's chief sanitary-epidemiologic  doctor, stated at a news conference, this does not conclude the  list of misfortunes that have afflicted and continue to afflict  Kievans. From the middle of November, the number of acute  respiratory diseases has risen. In the doctor's opinion, this  is due to the unsatisfactory heating of offices, production  premises, and schools, and also to the fact that people have to  spend much time at stops of public transport due to the  deterioration in the public transportation sphere.    As predicted by the Ukrainian Influenza Center, in the first  quarter of the next year, an epidemic of flu is expected not  only in Kiev, but also throughout Ukraine. In the capital, the  epidemic will rage in January and February.    The city state administration is trying to influence such a  development of events and to take preventive measures.  Presidential representative in Kiev Leonid Kosakivskyy signed a  directive meant for improving the sanitary-epidemiologic  situation. However, the situation continues to be complex. The  shortage of medicines and vaccines makes itself felt. There is  not enough money to procure them. For example, there are not  enough antidiphtherial preparations for vaccinating teenagers,  conscripts, students, and persons from risk groups. A sum of  $12,500 is necessary for purchasing them.    It only remains to rely upon the enthusiasm and ingenuity of  those people who remain on the alert and are ready to protect  citizens' health.</p>

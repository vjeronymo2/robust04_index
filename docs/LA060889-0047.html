			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER SAYS LUCAS LUSTED FOR DEATH  </P> <P> A prosecutor described David Lucas as "a killing machine" with "a lust for  death" as final arguments in Lucas' murder trial began Wednesday.  </P> <P> Lucas, 33, is accused of killing six people, all of whom had their throats  slashed. He could face the death penalty if convicted.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Williams dramatically recounted the gruesome deaths of  the four adults and two children who were killed between 1979 and 1984, and he  repeatedly told jurors that it was no coincidence the victims were killed in  the same way.  </P> <P> Williams described how Gary Fisher took his 3-year-old daughter, Amber, to  baby-sitter Rhonda Strang, 24, on Oct. 23, 1984, at her Lakeside house. Both  Strang and the child were killed later that day.  </P> <P> "He never saw his little daughter again because Mr. Lucas killed her that  morning," Williams said.  </P> <P> He also said the defense had falsely tried to imply that Strang's husband,  Robert, had committed the murders.  </P> <P> "There (was) exactly one person committing these murders, and that is David  Lucas. These killings . . . are statements. . . .They are considered before  they are done. They are done . . . to gratify this lust for death," Williams  said.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said Lucas was "a hunter" when he encountered University of San  Diego student Anne Swanke, 22, on Nov. 20, 1984, when her car ran out of gas in  La Mesa. "He had swooped down on Anne Swanke's dilemma like a panther ready to  kill," he said.  </P> <P> Williams held up a dog chain recovered from Swanke's body, which was found in a  remote area four days later. He said the chain, which had been wrapped around  Swanke's neck, came from Lucas' dog.  </P> <P> "The ecstasy arrives for Mr. Lucas when the carving begins on Anne Swanke's  neck," Williams said.  </P> <P> Lucas is also charged with killing Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and her 3-year-old son,  Colin, on May 4, 1979, and real estate saleswoman Gayle Garcia, 29, on Dec. 8,  1981.  </P> <P> Lucas also faces attempted-murder and kidnaping charges for an alleged attack  on Jodie Santiago Robertson, 34, of Seattle, who survived the June 8, 1984,  incident in El Cajon.  </P> <P> Lucas' lawyer, Steve Feldman, began his closing argument late Wednesday, but  will present most of it today. The jury is expected to begin deliberating  Friday.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report of R. Muratov, deputy prime minister of the Republic </F> of Tatarstan, at 20th, Special, Session of the Republic of  Tatarstan Supreme Soviet on 6 June 1994: "Revisions to the  Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the  Republic of Tatarstan"]    [Text] We are discussing at this session an urgent  present-day problem--how to avert increasing crisis phenomena in  the republic's economy.    The most important question arises: What is the situation  with regard to people's daily urgent requirements, and what can  we guarantee them in the foreseeable future? Unless an answer to  this question is obtained, how can we win the trust and support  of our population in the business of the continued  implementation of reforms? We need to find within ourselves  courage and honesty and tell primarily ourselves and the people  what our lives will be like henceforward: What will the living  standard be, how can we pay worthy tribute to our veterans for  their labor invested in the name of our welfare, what will be  the fate of our children today, and what will they inherit from  us tomorrow.    We need to make our position clear--the economy for man or  man for the economy.    Our practical actions will be the answer to all these  difficult questions. It is from these positions that I would  like to discuss all problems connected with the government's  social policy for this period of time in respect primarily to  children and veterans, and in our republic they constitute more  than 2.3 million persons, or 55 percent of the total number of  inhabitants. We all need to recognize that, in any event,  regardless of the state of the economy, concern for their living  standard is on our conscience and will depend on the results of  the labor of those in work and the efficiency of the state  mechanism of income redistribution, that is, the budget.    Considering that the subsistence level, which, as we know,  prevents death by starvation, today constitutes approximately  R50,000 a month per person and that, in addition, subsidized  payments in the amount of approximately R30,000 are allocated  from the republic budget monthly for each inhabitant of the  republic, regardless of his income level, which constitutes R11  billion, the subsistence level for children and veterans  guaranteed by society will thus constitute approximately R80,000  a month on average. This is the line beyond which lies  starvation, the degradation of the personality, and social  upheaval, with all the ensuing consequences. This means that we  have as of the present to guarantee from various sources of  funding (the wages of those in work, the retirement fund, the  targeted social protection fund, the republic budget) the  appropriation of a minimum of R162 billion of [word illegible]  funds, R85 billion of this for children. For what proportion of  this expenditure can the state realistically provide, and for  what, the working section of the populace?    Let us try to comprehend how efficiently we are working,  what  the efficiency of our economy is, and what is dependent on all  of us for the creation of opportunities for an increase in the  growth [as published] of income of the approximately R1.5  million persons employed in the republic.    Inasmuch as foodstuffs account for the bulk of individual  spending, I shall permit myself to start with agriculture here.    It is hard to exaggerate the role of agricultural production  in the republic's economy. It is thanks largely to the  agricultural workers and the single-minded work of the president  of the republic, the administration chiefs, and the agricultural  activists that the stable provision of the republic's populace  with food has been established.    The living standard of those employed in agricultural  production, and this is 17 percent of the republic's able-bodied  population, is markedly higher than in the Russian Federation on  average. Thus, the average monthly wage in the month of April in  agriculture constituted R94,200, which is 25 percent higher than  analogous indicators for Russia, and this despite the fact that  the average monthly wage in Russia in the national economy as a  whole is 20 percent higher than in Tatarstan. This means that  the rural worker is not only worthily discharging his  obligations to the children and veterans, but has taken on some  of the obligations of the employees of industry on  administrative leave.    We see the development of the positive trends of a rise in  the living standard by way of an increase in the income of the  agricultural workers in the realization of the following  principles:    --the establishment of private ownership of the land,  starting with long-term land leasehold relationships and an  increase in the size of the subsidiary plots;    --state protectionism in the sales markets;    --a binding obligation on the part of the state in respect  to  timely payments for agricultural products that it has  commissioned;    --a voluntary approach in the choice of forms of management  and the sale of one's own products;    --a differentiated pricing policy.    During the consideration of the bills on social policy  submitted to the session today, the observations and  expectations expressed by the administration chiefs and kolkhoz  and sovkhoz leaders to the effect that we are not taking account  of the income obtained from the subsidiary plots when  determining the amount of the compensation payments from the  targeted social support fund proved very useful. The draft  revisions to the Targeted Social Protection Program contains,  considering your expressed wishes, a procedure of the  determination of aggregate per capita income with regard to the  income from the personal subsidiary plots.    The situation in industry is far more complicated. We are  talking about 526,000 employees, or 35 percent of persons  employed in the republic's economy.    It is here, unfortunately, that the most negative trends in  terms of the living standard are being observed. The average  monthly wage in the industry of Tatarstan, for example, is 26  percent lower than the analogous indicator for Russia. It may be  observed also that in the past nine months the ratio in industry  of the average wage per employee to the subsistence level has  declined by a factor of 1.5. It is not hard to imagine what will  have happened by the end of the present year if this trend  persists.    It would be unfair not to mention that, despite the entire  complexity of the situation, a number of major industrial  enterprises and associations such as the Tatneft Stock Company,  the Kama Truck Plant Stock Company, petrochemical plants, and  others are managing to maintain the living standard of the  employees and their families and, in a number of cases, to raise  it, even. Such enterprises should, understandably, be supported  by the state first and foremost, and they, in turn, should  guarantee those employed in production a minimum wage not less  than the cost of the minimum consumer budget.    Similar approaches should be employed in respect to all  other  enterprises also on the basis of a selective approach [as  published]. It is essential, when employing the selective  approach, aside from all else, to use a separate balance sheet  with the introduction of accounts for expenditure on the social  infrastructure. These accounts will afford an opportunity to see  the viability of basic production and make it possible to obtain  information on the cost of social functions, which should  subsequently be assumed by the state.    Unfortunately, we have to affirm that at a number of  enterprises the extent of sold output is insufficient for  allocations to the retirement fund and the payment of wages at  least up to the subsistence level. Availing themselves of the  absence of a mechanism of state control, these enterprises have  begun a process of self-corrosion: On the strength of  enterprises' public assets, created to a large extent by the  labor of previous generations, they are obtaining from the banks  financial resources at a high rate of interest and channeling  more than 75 percent of these resources into the wage fund. Each  ruble thus borrowed from the bank and channeled into this  corrosion requires society to pay back to the bank within a year  no fewer than R2.5. A process of the self-corrosion of the  resources of all of society and our national wealth thus arises.    In addition, such social dependence based on free resources  and an absence of responsibility has engendered and is  increasing rapidly various forms of concealed unemployment. The  motivation to labor is disappearing, wage-leveling is  flourishing. As of today, concealed unemployment numbers  approximately 200,000 persons. Would it not be more beneficial  to give society this ruble from the employment fund, thereby  saving R2.5? Would it not make more sense to channel these  resources into the return of the arrears to the countryside by  means of the building of facilities of a social infrastructure  and for the development of the health care, culture, education,  and intellectual potential of society, and also for an increase  in the financial support for veterans?    A specific mechanism of realization of the program for the  support of veterans could be the government's transfer of part  of the state's share of the stock in privatized enterprises for  management by specialized trust companies and those same banks,  but on an entirely different, commercial, basis. The resources  obtained from this should be channeled into an enhancement of  veterans' living standard. We would thereby be ensuring fairness  in the privatization of public property created to a large  extent by the labor of preceding generations.    Merely in respect to 27 industrial enterprises that were  surveyed, the sum total of arrears to the banks amounts to R39  billion, which constitutes the lion's share of the value of  these enterprises' assets. There is something here for us all to  think about and to decide what we will, in fact, leave our  children.    The question arises: Who allowed the banks to dispose of  public assets, and what has happened to the control of the  National Bank, if it is in fact defending the interests of the  economy of Tatarstan? If the banks are permitted to continue  this practice, we will be throwing out the baby with the  bathwater. The conclusion that suggests itself is that credit  must not be granted against the surety of public assets without  government permission.    It is also obvious today that the government cannot remain  aloof from financial support for the enterprises of the aviation  complex and certain others that as of this time have specific  promising developments and a big future. The government must  help them overcome the arrears problem, fund the social  infrastructure, and allocate investment resources for structural  reorganization and, in particular cases, according to harmonized  lists, resources from the employment fund for compensation  payments up to the subsistence level for highly skilled  specialists who are on administrative leave.    There is no doubt that these methods, provided they are  fulfilled, will make it possible to maintain and enhance  individuals' living standard.    The bill "The Minimum Wage," which provides for employers'  liability for a failure to comply with the laws of Tatarstan in  this respect, has been prepared for your attention.    The center of gravity of the resolution of social problems  of  the transitional period will increasingly shift in the direction  of the budget and will thereby engender the preconditions for a  decline in the living standard of the population of the  republic. The arising vacuum of society's sources of income may  be filled only by the elaboration of adequate measures of state  regulation under the conditions of a market economy and state  support for enterprise.    The support of enterprise demands that the state and its  official representatives gradually withdraw from the spheres of  economic activity in which the development of the private sector  is required. In market economics, disagreements on economic  matters in the fields to which the writ of the state does not  run should be resolved in legal form. We must have the  opportunity to rely on the judicial system in the defense of the  rights of private individuals against encroachments on the part  of the government.    It is essential also to raise the level of pay of employees  of the justice system, the militia, and the tax authorities,  such that it be appreciably higher than the wages in other  fields. Work in these authorities should be held in high regard.  But there should at the same time be an increase also in their  responsibility for timely and high-quality treasury receipts and  for the protection of the interests of society, including the  fledgling nonstate structures, in accordance with the rules of  international law. They are called on also to contribute  actively to the transition of entrepreneurs from the "shadow"  economy to the legal tax space, with regard to the specific  features of the transitional period expressed in the discrepancy  between the old operative laws and the basic principles of the  market economy.    As you know, the state itself is a major employer and  provides jobs for 286,000 persons, which constitutes 19 percent  of the total numbers of those in employment in the republic. An  analysis shows that the average wages in April of the employees  of health care and social security exceeded by more than R50,000  the average wage of persons employed in the field of culture,  art, and research. The living standard of those employed in the  sphere of culture, art, and research is below the republic  average. This state of affairs is impermissible. The government,  as an employer, should in the transitional period provide for an  average monthly wage not less than the cost of the minimum  consumer budget. We have simultaneously to devise a mechanism of  the adaptation of these spheres to market conditions.    Thus, the state is directly responsible in the transitional  period for the living standard of children, veterans, and  persons on the public payroll--2,316,000 persons altogether--and  this means 62 percent of the republic's population. This means  that all the conditions should be created for the remaining 38  percent of the population of the republic for the application of  their entrepreneurial activity. And whether they work for  society or go into the "shadow" economy will depend on the  rationality of the structure of our tax field.    There are two paths of the possible behavior of the state  aimed at maintaining the living standard of the  population--passive and active.    The first path--passive--is geared to the artificial  containment of prices and an increase in subsidies in all areas.  With this approach, the number of persons living below the  subsistence level will have grown by almost 1.5 million by  December of this year. This would be a progressive figure, which  our budget could not sustain.    The second path--active--is oriented toward high personal  income and presupposes the creation for the able-bodied  population of the conditions for a display of initiative and  enterprise and a stimulation of the role of the state in  maintaining an adequate living standard for veterans, children,  and persons on the public payroll. It is to this path that I  have, in fact, devoted my speech, for I consider it the sole  correct one.    Thanks to the persevering, dogged labor of the president,  the  Supreme Soviet, and the government headed by the prime minister,  sufficient political potential has been created for the start of  immediate, dynamic, and fundamental transformations in the  economy of the republic, and I hope that we will be up to this  task.    Thank you for your attention!</p>

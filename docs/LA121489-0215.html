Several  years ago, Robertson and TBN founder Paul Crouch made a straight swap, with TBN  carrying Robertson's "700 Club" and CBN carrying Crouch's "Praise the Lord"  talk show. . . . The "700 Club" still runs at noon five days a week on Trinity,  while Crouch airs on the Family Channel Saturdays and Sundays at 3:30 a.m.  </P></p>

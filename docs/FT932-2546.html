			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Record number apply to UCCA APPLICATIONS to the Universities Central Council on Admissions are a record this year. Total applications by the end of May were 9.1 per cent higher than at the same point last year. Vocational courses saw the greatest leap with applications for teacher training up 32.8 per cent and for medicine up 13.7 per cent. Academic courses were less popular, with a fall of 4.3 per cent in applications for history degrees. The council, which does not handle applications for the 'new' universities - those which converted from polytechnics last year - predicts that all offers will be honoured but that students who narrowly miss their conditional offers will find it much harder than usual to find a place at another university.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CAA section 242(b) states that CFVs up to 8,500 lbs. GVWR ``shall comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all motor vehicle requirements of this title (i.e., on-board diagnostics, evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, etc.) which are applicable to conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same category and model year, except as provided in section 244 with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration and enforcement, and except to the extent that any such requirement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in conflict with the provisions of'' part C. These include, but are not limited to,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for cold temperature CO exhaust emissions (cold CO), on-board diagnostics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (OBD), evaporative emission controls (evap), and onboard refueling vapor recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ORVR). Previous requirements such as crankcase controls and vehicle labeling also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA section 243(e) directs EPA to apply the standards of the California Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Board (CARB) LEV program in lieu of the standards otherwise applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to CFVs under sections 242 and 243 if the CARB standards are, in the aggregate, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least as protective of public health and welfare as the federal standards that apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFVs. Section 243(e)(1) addresses the replacement of CAA standards if CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgates a single set of standards while section 243(e)(2) addresses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement if CARB promulgates multiple sets of standards. CARB's LEV program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains multiple sets of standards to which vehicles can certify (i.e., LEV, ULEV, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ZEV); therefore, section 243(e)(2) is the appropriate language for consideration and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 243(e)(2): If the State of California promulgates regulations establishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and implementing several different sets of standards applicable in California pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a waiver approved under section 209 to any category of vehicles referred to in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section and each of such sets of California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards is, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the otherwise applicable standards set forth in section 242 and subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section, such standards shall be treated as `qualifying California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards' for purposes of this paragraph. Where more than one set of qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are established and administered by the State of California, the least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent set of qualifying California standards shall apply to the clean-fuel vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned in lieu of the standards otherwise applicable to such vehicles under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 242 and this section.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that the required comparison between the federal and CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards is not limited to the CFV exhaust emission standards of sections 242 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 243 but must also include the other Title II standards referred to in CAA section 242  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., OBD, evap, etc.) and any California counterparts. Thus, EPA is required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compare the standards in CAA sections 242(b) and 243 with the CARB standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether the CARB standards should replace the federal standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Clinton seeks to clarify record on military service MR Bill Clinton, the Democratic party's presidential candidate, yesterday sought 'to set the record straight' on one of the more profound question marks over his character, his avoidance of military service during the Vietnam war. Addressing an ex-servicemen's convention in Chicago only hours after President George Bush had given a speech from the same podium, Mr Clinton said he was relieved he did not have to join the military 'not because I didn't want to serve my country, but because I believed so strongly that our policy in Vietnam was wrong'. He repeated the circumstances in 1969 which drew him away from the military; that, while studying at Oxford, he had contemplated joining the reserves, changed his mind, entered the draft lottery and drew a number low enough to ensure he would never be called up. He then said, to applause, that he respected the right of his audience not to vote for him as he had not served, but hoped 'you will cast your vote looking towards the future rather than remaining fixed to the problems of the past'. In his speech, devoted mostly to his foreign policy record and his commitment to a strong national defence, Mr Bush had only said of his military service in the second world war that 'I was scared, but I was willing'. This followed an earlier statement released by his campaign accusing Mr Clinton of 'inconsistencies' in his presentation of how he had avoided military service. Both candidates were warmly received, which must have gratified Mr Clinton in particular given the conservative nature of the American Legion. He said he would have gone to Vietnam if ordered and that he honoured, then and now, those who went. Staking out the generational divide between himself and Mr Bush, he said it was 'perhaps inevitable' this year and in elections to come that people should ask if someone who had never served in the military was fit to act as the nation's commander-in-chief. He cited Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan as great commanders without personal experience of military service. Mr Clinton promised he would not shrink from using force to defend the national interest. His proposed five-year defence budget was only 5 per cent less than the president's but, he insisted, US forces needed to be restructured to meet 'less predictable' post-cold war demands. American consumer confidence this month fell to its lowest level since March, according to the latest survey by the Conference Board, the business research organisation. Its widely watched index stood at 58.0 in August, down from a revised 61.2 in July. The base of 100 reflects 1985 levels of consumer confidence. The director of research said the drop was moderate, but the continued sag in consumer spirits was 'disconcerting'.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Hammerson declines 44 per cent to Pounds 31.1m: Sydney Mason to be replaced as chairman in June by Geoffrey Maitland Smith from Sears HAMMERSON yesterday underlined the breadth and severity of the international property downturn when it announced a 30 per cent decline in its net asset value per share to Pounds 4.45 for 1992 and a 44 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 31.1m. The company also announced that Mr Sydney Mason, its 72-year old chairman, would be replaced by Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, the chairman of Sears, when he retires in June. Mr John Parry, managing director, who is also retiring in June, will be replaced by Mr Ronald Spinney, a former deputy chairman of Greycoat, the developer. The shares fell by 23p to 331p after the worse-than-expected results, although there was some relief that the uncertainty about the group's management succession had been resolved. Mr Mason said that the property downturn was the most severe, lengthy and widespread he had known. He said that continuing lack of tenant demand and the over-supply of accommodation was compounded by the failure of several large property companies in the UK and Canada, the group's most important markets, which had further damaged confidence. However, there were faint signs of an improvement, albeit modest, in some markets, he said. Property values were worst hit in Canada and France, where they fell by 27 per cent and 22 per cent respectively. Overall, the portfolio's value fell by 19 per cent, which contributed to a decline in shareholders' funds from Pounds 1.06bn to Pounds 742.3m. Gearing increased from 78 per cent to 114 per cent, while net borrowings increased by Pounds 21m to Pounds 845m, partly as a result of the weakness of sterling which increased the translation of foreign currency debt by over Pounds 90m at the year end. Property disposals realised Pounds 188m. Net rental income rose by 11 per cent from Pounds 114.2m to Pounds 126.2m. Operating profit fell 20 per cent to Pounds 44.3m. Hammerson said its development programme was virtually complete; its capital commitments were just Pounds 24m at the year end. Earnings per share fell by 51 per cent to 11p (from 22.5p). As signalled at the interim statement in October, a final dividend of 6.5p was recommended, compared with 17p a year ago. That made a total dividend of 10p for the year, down from 20.5p a year earlier. Lex, Page 26; People, Page 22</p>

He expressed satisfaction with the development of relations  between the two nations since their diplomatic ties were  established last year.    Kim told Chinese reporters that China and South Korea have  overcome the 40-year-old difference between them and greatly  increased political, trade and economic contacts.    He said he believed that their cooperation in politics,  economy and trade would be further expanded.    He expected the cooperation would make a contribution to  peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the "Asian-Pacific  Era" in the next century.

So far, China is South Korea's third biggest trade partner  and South Korea the sixth biggest trade partner of China.

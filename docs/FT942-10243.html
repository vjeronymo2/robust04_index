			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Equity Issues: Austria launches road-show to promote sell-offs Austria is launching an international campaign to promote forthcoming privatisation issues and broaden the appeal of the Vienna stock exchange. The government hopes to raise around Dollars 500m from the sale of its 51 per cent stake in VA-Tech, the engineering, power and construction group, shortly. Altogether, 7.65m shares are being offered (at an indicated price range of Sch820 - Sch920 per share), with 4.59m of those available to international investors. The deal is being priced on Friday and Mr Viktor Klima, minister for the nationalised industries and transport, will be in London tomorrow to publicise the event. In all, it is hoped privatisation will raise around Sch20bn over the next 18 months. Sales will include Sch4bn for Boehler-Udderholm, the steel maker, and Sch10bn for OMV, the oil, gas and chemicals group. Mr Klima said there had been strong interest in VA-Tech from international institutional investors. A private partner for a stake of around 20 per cent in OMV - 28 per cent is already held by private shareholders - is expected to be chosen within a month. A group of investors from Abu Dhabi, and separately Bayernwerke of Germany, have shown interest in buying the stake. OMV also plans a one-for-eight rights issue to raise around Sch3bn, at current prices. Boehler-Udderholm was given a Sch2.5bn capital injection this year to prepare for privatisation in 1995. The government also plans to sell part of its holdings in Bank Austria and Creditanstalt, the country's two largest banks, and at least half its 36.5 per cent stake in Vienna International Airport. It is also looking for a strategic partner for Austrian Airlines, the state carrier. Later, it wants to privatise the state railways, and the country's post and telecommunications company. The privatisation programme is the most ambitious yet by an Austrian government. Mr Klima says it will improve the companies' competitiveness and give a boost to the domestic capital market by attracting more foreign investors. 'In the past, we failed to promote the Vienna stock exchange to the international community,' he said. As a result the market remained weak, because there are no major institutional investors such as large pension funds in Austria, and individual investors prefer to place their money into savings accounts. Austrians are among the world's leading savers, with more than Sch2,000bn in various forms of savings. Only 4 per cent own shares. The preference for individuals to place their money in savings books, and for companies to borrow money rather than go to the stock exchange, has been good for the banks but has restricted the growth of the local capital market. The government has improved the legal environment, abolished its tax on assets, and reduced taxation to make issuing and buying shares more attractive, and several private companies are planning issues.</p>

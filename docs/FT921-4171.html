			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Plaxton reverses into a Pounds 6.8m loss THE SEVERE downturn in the vehicles market pushed Plaxton Group, the coach manufacturer and motor distributor, into a Pounds 6.8m pre-tax loss for the year to December 31. That was a swing of Pounds 11m compared with the profit of Pounds 4.2m returned for the preceding 12 months. Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said demand for coaches and buses had fallen by about 40 per cent last year, while the new car market had declined by 21 per cent. Turnover fell from Pounds 385.1m to Pounds 334.4m. As a result, the group had closed three of its four coach and bus plants and cut 600 jobs over the last 18 months. Annual overheads in the bus and coach division had been cut by Pounds 4m and the operation incurred a loss of Pounds 2.96m. The restructuring and introduction of new coach ranges resulted in exceptional charges of Pounds 2.86m. A further Pounds 2.1m in extraordinary charges arose from the closure of a coach factory in France. Coach and bus stocks had been reduced by about Pounds 7m. Mr Wood said the group aimed to cut stocks by a further Pounds 6m to Pounds 8m. He said he did not expect a significant recovery in the coach division until 1993. Operating profits in the motor division tumbled by 47 per cent to Pounds 3.5m. Mr Wood said virtually all of the decline was due to falling demand for new cars. To highlight the importance of the motor division, which represents 70 per cent of turnover, Plaxton plans to change its name to Henlys, the title of the distributor purchased in 1989. Interest charges were unchanged at Pounds 4.7m, although Plaxton said the year-end debt of Pounds 31m now included Pounds 7m previously held off balance sheet. A proposed final dividend of 2p (1.5p) makes a 3p (4.5p) total. Losses per share of 16.7p compared with earnings of 9.1p. The group announced yesterday that Mr Derek Edwards, a former director of RTZ, would become the board's second non-executive director. Mr Michael Doherty was appointed non-executive chairman in November. COMMENT The increased final dividend indicates that Plaxton is confident of more than just survival. The high stock levels of a year ago have been reduced to sustainable levels - and still there is more to come; the motor division is returning a profit, unlike many competitors; and new management appears determined to quash criticisms by bringing all debt on balance sheet. Assuming the economy does not get worse, it could well be that Plaxton has defied the sceptics. Forecasts are pitched at breakeven to Pounds 1m profits, although the coach business will continue to incur losses. Risk-takers may find the stock attractive, while the more cautious are likely to wait for definitive proof in the next set of results.</p>

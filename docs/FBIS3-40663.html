Narasimha has  summoned a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party on Friday  as part of efforts to contain the Dunkel fall-out within the  ruling party.    The CPP [Congress(I) Parliamentary Party] general body  called  at short notice will be addressed both by the Prime Minister and  the Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee on the implications of  the Dunkel agreement. The move to call the CPP is aimed at  pre-empting criticism from within.    Rumblings within the party on the sensitive issue were,  however, evident when several members demanded that they be  allowed to speak at Friday's general body meeting. Among those  who claimed to have sent notice for speaking to the CPP  secretariat are Jagmeet Singh Brar and S.S. Surjewala.    CPP secretary Vilas Muthemwar said that members who wished  to  speak would be allowed, time permitting. The meeting is  scheduled to last 90 minutes.    As per the game-plan prepared by Rao managers, the Prime  Minister after taking party MPs [Member of Parliament] into  confidence would intervene in the on-going discussion in  Parliament. On Thursday the Prime Minister avoided Parliament  ostensibly because he was busy with the education summit.    AICC [All India Congress Committee-I] spokesman Vithal N.  Gadgil when grilled by reporters for the party's stand on the  GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] agreement said  that the party supported the Government's decision taking the  "realities" into account. "Certain realities have to be taken  into account," he said.    The spokesman rejected the possibility of the President  Shankar Dayal Sharma being kept in the dark, and pointed out  that every Cabinet paper was routinely sent to him.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Japan minister gives assurance on N-arms: Document revealed nuclear option was studied Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister, was yesterday forced to confirm that the country had not pursued a nuclear weapons development policy, after the leaking of a 25-year-old ministry document that argued the case for a potential atomic capability. He acknowledged that in the late 1960s the ministry had not allowed Japan's pacifist post-war constitution to inhibit an examination of all options for future national defence policy. The Mainichi Shimbun, a mass-circulation daily, this week revealed the existence of a 100-page classified document drawn up by foreign ministry officials in 1969. The newspaper quotes the report as saying: 'Japan will assume a policy of not having nuclear weapons for the time being. But it should always maintain the economic and technical potential to produce them.' Mr Kono refused to discuss what he described as an internal working paper, but said: 'It is a fact that before the signing of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) consideration was given at internal meetings on all policy possibilities and to their advantages and disadvantages.' Japan acceded to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon state after adopting the treaty the following year, and has maintained a policy of not possessing such weapons, not producing them, and not permitting them to be brought into Japan. The affair will add another layer to the myriad sensitivities within the country and the rest of Asia which surround Japan's militaristic past, a wider world role for its post-war self-defence forces, and its nuclear power programme. Mainichi's disclosures included an interview with a former head of the Maritime SDF, Japan's navy, who admitted that in the cold war era of the late 1960s he conducted two years' research into battle scenarios involving a nuclear-armed Japan. Mr Kazuomi Uchida said neither the government nor the military acted on his findings. Mr Kono said yesterday the nuclear option 'would only go against the national interests of Japan' and was 'totally unrealistic also from our special national sentiment as the only country which has suffered from such devastation.' Hiroshima on Saturday and Nagasaki next Tuesday commemorate the anniversaries of their virtual annihilation by US atomic bombs. Anti-nuclear activists at a conference in Hiroshima yesterday attacked Japanese plans to employ potentially dual-use plutonium in future nuclear power reactors and said a government which disavows nuclear weapons should make public all relevant records. The August anniversaries annually generate a spate of media disclosures on nuclear-related issues, but controversy is seldom absent. In May, two cabinet ministers had to deny a claim by a former Japanese envoy that Washington had, in agreeing reversion of the US-occupied southern islands of Okinawa to Japan in 1972, struck a secret deal which would allow the US to station nuclear weapons on Japanese territory.</p>

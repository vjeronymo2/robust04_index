			<p>BFN     [Text] Shortly before noon Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard  Kukan and Russian Ambassador Sergey Yastrzhembskiy signed an  agreement between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the  Government of the Russian Federation on conditions for visa-free  travel by citizens of the two states. Maria Mikusova has just  returned from the Hotel Borik where the signing took place.    [Mikusova] This is the 27th agreement signed by Slovakia and  Russia since the formation of an independent Slovakia and the  first of its kind between Russia and one of the Visegrad Four  countries. The existing arrangement of mutual relations in the  sphere of travel created extensive possibilities for differences  of interpretation and various bureaucratic measures. The  signing of this agreement provides for the introduction of very  precise and clear rules. In the words of Ambassador  Yastrzhembskiy, it is a special agreement because it concerns  people who are interested in visiting our country.    As for what the significance of this agreement was for  Slovakia, I asked Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan:    [Begin recording] [Kukan] The agreement on visa-free travel  which we signed with Ambassador Yastrzhembskiy has the principal  significance of regulating travel and visits by Russian citizens  here and our citizens to the Russian Federation. In terms of  objective conditions it is not a classic agreement on visa-free  travel such as we have with certain other European countries,  but I think it will play a positive role in the current  situation in our mutual relations and that it will have a  positive effect on the future. It also documents our interest  in expanding relations with the Russian Federation in such a way  that would be beneficial to both sides.    [Mikusova] Minister, will this agreement guarantee that such  elements as we would not wish to see here will not get onto our  territory?    [Kukan] Yes. I answer yes unequivocally and without  hesitation. That is why we signed it. [end recording]    Let me only add that the agreement will come into effect  following joint ratification.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Greencore advances 14% but warns on present year Greencore, the Irish sugar and agribusiness group, yesterday reported a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds 29.6m to IPounds 33.7m (Pounds 32m) in the year to September 24. The 1992 pre-tax figure was restated from IPounds 31.5m under FRS 3 to take account of extraordinary items of IPounds 1.85m and profits from related companies. Group turnover improved marginally to IPounds 394m (IPounds 388m), although a successful 'campaign' - the three month processing period - led to a IPounds 9.7m increase in sales from continuing operations to IPounds 392m. Growth in the current year, however, is likely to be undermined by a sharp decline in crop yields following bad summer weather. Mr Bernie Cahill, chairman, warned that sugar beet yields alone could fall by up to 30 per cent. Reduced crop yields would have a damaging impact on the group's three divisions - sugar, agribusiness and other food - which last year contributed to increased operating profits of IPounds 40m, against a restated IPounds 36.7m. Of the three divisions, operating profits in sugar showed the biggest improvement with a 12.5 per cent rise to IPounds 22.3m on sales of IPounds 127.2m (IPounds 123.1m). Turnover in agribusiness rose 4.4 per cent to IPounds 141m with profits up to IPounds 9.5m (IPounds 9m). Other food contributed profits of IPounds 9.2m (IPounds 8.4m) on static sales of IPounds 124.3m (IPounds 124.6m). Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, said operating profits were hampered by a IPounds 964,000 loss on the disposal in October of Chambers, its Northern Ireland distribution company, and a small potato subsidiary. The balance sheet, meanwhile, was strengthened by falling interest rates, which declined from more than 40 per cent in the first half to about 7 per cent at the year end. In a bid to avoid crippling interest charges, the group had cut stocks, placed increased emphasis on operating efficiency and used profits to increase cash balances from IPounds 5.3m to IPounds 18.7m. Gearing fell from 61 per cent to 24 per cent. Earnings per share came in at 33.9p, against a restated 28.8p. A final dividend of 5.5p (5p) makes an 8.8p (8p) total.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market takes stock after sharp fall Oil prices steadied yesterday as traders pondered whether the latest sharp falls signalled a breakdown in prices or merely a deep correction. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend was about Dollars 15.90 a barrel in late London trading yesterday, 20 cents up from the close of Dollars 15.70 on Monday, when a 60 cent fall pushed the Brent price below Dollars 16 for the first time since June. Some analysts yesterday said heavy selling by commodity and derivative funds were a big factor in pushing prices down. But one London trader noted that it was the 'oil community' that started the selling spree. The latest falls in large part reflected a growing conviction in the markets that the political crisis and strike by oil workers in Nigeria would not lead to further big supply disruptions. 'The markets have discarded Nigeria as a factor,' according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at the London office of US brokers Smith Barney. Other analysts noted that concern over a cut-off in Nigerian supplies coincided with prices approaching the top end of the Dollars 15-Dollars 19 range which many have predicted for the year. 'The Nigerian crisis hit at a time of upside fatigue,' said Mr Vahan Zanoyan, an analyst with the Washington DC-based Petroleum Finance Company. He believed prices went up too fast in response to the threat of major supply disruptions, which never materialised. Prices at the higher end of the range needed continuous support from events and were 'more sensitive to bearish news,' he added. Another factor contributing to the oil price fall was the imminent shut down for maintenance of a large number of US refineries. In addition there are plentiful supplies, especially from the North Sea, of the light crude oil which Nigeria mainly produces. Most analysts, however, are predicting that supply pressures are likely to emerge towards the end of the year. This is because of rising world demand and the fact that other members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries are so far showing no signs of cheating on their production quotas.</p>

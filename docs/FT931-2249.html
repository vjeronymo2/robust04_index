			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: On course for the greening of the world - A look at exotic sites for serious golfing holidays WHEN Robert Louis Stevenson wrote that 'to travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive and the true success is to labour,' he might not have had in mind those caddies who recently made a circuitous and eventful journey to a professional golf tournament in north Africa. Their journey started in Scotland on the Saturday before the Thursday on which the tournament started. They drove south to Dover to pick up the cross-Channel ferry before heading to Gibraltar and crossing by ferry to north Africa. So far, so good. Then their troubles began. Alleged visa problems meant they had to bribe Moroccan Customs officials on arrival and pay out more bribes - ranging from money to cigarettes and candy bars - at every police stop between Rabat and Casablanca. They arrived in Agadir weary, wiser and poorer. Caddies are reputed to like such experiences. For the rest of us, though - those who travel the world in search of a decent golfing break, be it 48 hours or 14 days - life is usually easier. Book your holiday, allow two hours to clear Customs, have a few drinks and buy an armful of golf mags. In due course you are, with luck, re-united with your clubs in a sunny place. The expansion in air travel and the growing popularity of the game have combined to make it possible to go almost anywhere, anytime, to play. According to Tony Philo, general manager of Longshot Golf Holidays*, more and more people are doing just that - 60 per cent more than five years ago. In three months, some enthusiasts will fly to Reykjavik to play in the Iceland Open on the year's longest day, when darkness falls for all of half an hour. But if that seems extreme, where else might you go? Remember, first, that golfing holidays are not holidays with golf: they are holidays for golf - serious affairs in which two rounds a day are the norm. As for places, you could take a couple of nights at Queenwood in the grounds of Bowood House, the Earl of Shelburne's home in Wiltshire. You would be looked after by a butler and fed by your own cook. Cheaper would be a stay at Andrew and Mary Flint's Boscundle Manor hotel near St Austell, Cornwall, where guests have a practice area with two greens, several teeing positions, a lake over which to hit and a golf net. If you travel by helicopter, there is a landing site. A step or two up come hotels like the Agadoe Heights in Killarney, Ireland, or the Butler Arms in Waterville where, within 20 miles, you will find some of the best courses in Co Kerry - which means some of the best in the world. But the traditional destinations are still those outside Britain: Portugal's Algarve coast plus Spain, France and Florida. The good news from Spain is that green fees have tumbled in recent years. And, these days, the well-informed visitor taking a golf holiday on the Iberian peninsula books in at a hotel that offers the game as an inclusive facility and not an available extra. Stay at the Quinta do Lago hotel on the Algarve, for instance, and you can play at Quinta do Lago, Val de Lobo, Vilasol, Vilamoura and - the newest of all - Pinheiros Altos. At the Dona Filipa and the Penina, two old favourites, green fees are included in the price. This not only saves money; it saves organisation, as well. Madeira, which has been popular with discerning Britons since the days when access was only by cruise ship, is making a comeback. The first 18 holes of the Campo de Golfe were opened recently and the Madeira Open was played over them in January. Another nine are nearly complete and a further 18 holes will open by September. And Madeira is worth considering for a golf holiday because of the advantages of its climate, which is rarely colder than 63`F or hotter than 75`F - plus the sybaritic comforts of Reid's Hotel. The new golfing destinations are places like the Far East, east Africa - where the Windsor Golf and Country Club in Nairobi is making a name for itself - Zambia, South Africa and, increasingly, exotic places like Dubai and the West Indies, one of the few destinations where sunshine is practically guaranteed. 'Golf,' said author AA Milne (of Winnie the Pooh fame), 'is the best game in the world at which to be bad.' A fat lot he knew. It is the one game in the world at which no one wants to be bad. Everyone wants to be able to hit the ball 300 yards off the tee. As a result, hotels are starting to realise that if they organise clinics, then guests can play and improve their game as well. At Sandy Lane in Barbados next week, for example, an American professional will conduct a clinic. If the venture is a success, there will be another in the autumn. 'One trend among people taking golf holidays that has become apparent recently is that clients expect more quality and better service from us,' says Philo. 'They want more flexibility in departure and return dates, and in tee-off times. 'They want to leave on any day of the week and stay for any length of time. The days when you could travel to Portugal only on a Thursday and return only on a Thursday are gone. These days, everything must go without a hitch  -otherwise, they want to know why.' And so they do. Golfers spending anything up to Pounds 3,000 a person per week have a right to expect to be looked after. They are, after all, searching for a new golfing destination that offers a better course than any other, or a less stressful means of getting there, or a more soothing atmosphere once they have arrived. It is a never-ending quest. *Longshot Golf, Meon House, College Street, Petersfield, Hampshire GU32 3JN. Tel. 0730-268 621.</p>

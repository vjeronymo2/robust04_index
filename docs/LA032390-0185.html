			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'SCISSORHANDS' SHEAR FANTASY  </P> <P> "Batman" and "Beetlejuice" director Tim Burton is being deliberately vague  about his latest project -- "Edward Scissorhands," a suburban fantasy film  about a man created with shears of metal for fingers.  </P> <P> "It's very different," Burton said.  </P> <P> "We're going to sort of make it up as we go along."  </P> <P> Burton and stars Johnny Depp, Dianne Wiest and Winona Ryder arrived here  Thursday to start three months of production on the film, scheduled for  Christmas release.  </P> <P> According to 20th Century Fox, "Scissorhands" is about a man who was created,  not born. He was given everything he needed to lead a full life, except one  thing: His inventor's untimely death left Edward with sharp shears of metal  where his fingers should have been.  </P> <P> He lives in seclusion until he is discovered by an earnest Avon lady and his  life changes forever.  </P> <P> Preparations for filming have been made in a Tampa neighborhood, where several  homes have been painted garish colors to create a surreal suburban atmosphere.  </P></p>

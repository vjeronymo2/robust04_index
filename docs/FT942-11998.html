			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Brave new world South Africa's capital markets are driven by politics and international investors are busy applauding the country's momentous changes. The stock market has surged in recent weeks and the currency has appreciated strongly against the US dollar. Further waves of euphoria seem likely to push both markets to new heights. But when politics is the dominant investment consideration, unpredictability is certain. Several factors are now critical for the future outlook. If the ANC ends up with more than 66 per cent of the votes, then many will fear they will override the checks and balances of the constitution. If Inkatha were to criticise the elections for not being free and fair, that too would unsettle sentiment. The financial rand's discount to the commercial rand, which provides a yardstick of international investors' confidence, widened to 38 per cent earlier this month when Inkatha threatened not to take part in the elections. It has since narrowed to 23 per cent but similar instability might ensue if any of the leading economic figures were moved aside. When misty eyes clear, South African markets will at least be partly underpinned by economic fundamentals. The economy seems poised to enjoy a virtuous circle of increased domestic and international investment combined with an upswing in the commodity cycle. Economic growth may reach 3 per cent this year, doubling in the following year. But the chief worry concerns capacity constraints. South Africa's productive asset base has been worn down by years of autarky. That could produce an upsurge in inflation if demand proves too strong.</p>

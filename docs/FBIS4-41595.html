Two ammunition storages have been  revealed on the Gali-Zugdidi line during works in the  rain-washed ground. One of the storages contained 40 boxes with  shells, the other -- 600 mines. They are being rendered  harmless.    According to Gerasimov, the troops were located in the area  without any incidents. The Russian servicemen are staying at  two check points protecting the bridge to the north of Inguri  and at 18 control-observer posts. There are five check points  and ten posts in the south.

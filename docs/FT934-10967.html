			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Evidence of consumer-led upturn grows MONEY SUPPLY figures from the Bank of England yesterday added to evidence that consumer spending is the driving force behind the recovery. Cash in circulation, or M0, rose a provisional, seasonally adjusted 5.4 per cent in the year to October, compared with 5.3 per cent in the year to September. This was the sixth consecutive monthly rise in the annual rate and the highest for three years. The Bank said in its quarterly inflation report yesterday that a large part of the strength of M0 was attributable to the cut in interest rates over the past year, although it remains uncertain about the effect of this in the short term. M0 growth has been above the upper limit of the government's zero to 4 per cent monitoring range since June, but the Bank said the range remained 'broadly consistent' with the inflation target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. Growth in narrow money tends to reflect a pick-up in retail sales. The rise in M0 in every month since May - when it was 3.5 per cent - has coincided with buoyant retail activity and the Bank yesterday described narrow money as a 'good and timely guide for nominal demand growth'. Other indicators, including a steady increase in consumer borrowing, point to a consumer-led recovery. Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese bank, said: 'What has been established very well as the year has progressed is that the recovery is largely one led by the consumer and these figures support it.' For this reason, some economists are arguing that the government should be cautious about cutting interest rates. M0 is one of a number of variables tracked by the Treasury to monitor inflationary pressures. Other monitored indicators have also picked up recently. Yesterday's figures from the Bank confirmed that M4 - which consists of M0 plus bank and building society deposits - has lifted above the floor of its 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range. The 12-month growth rate in September was 3.3 per cent. The UK's official gold and foreign currency reserves rose by Dollars 507m last month, taking reserves at the end of October to Dollars 43,551m, compared with Dollars 43,044m at the end of September. The underlying increase in reserves was Dollars 32m. The underlying change excludes a number of factors included in the total change, including the proceeds from the quarterly tender of three-year Ecu Treasury notes, proceeds from this month's tender of UK Ecu Treasury bills and maturing UK Ecu Treasury bills.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUBARAK URGES IRAQ TO PULL OUT OF KUWAIT;  </P> <P> EGYPT: CAIRO SENDS FIRST ELEMENTS OF MECHANIZED INFANTRY DIVISION, TANKS AND  ARTILLERY TO SAUDI ARABIA.  </P> <P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday appealed to Iraq to withdraw its  forces from Kuwait, while at the same time Egypt reportedly sent the first  elements of a mechanized infantry division to Saudi Arabia, along with light  tanks and artillery.  </P> <P> The government interrupted radio and television programming to broadcast  Mubarak's appeal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> Mubarak asked Hussein, "in the name of everything sacred on our Arab soil . . .  in the name of Islam," to prevent "a destructive war that will devour  everything."  </P> <P> Mubarak said Egypt -- and no other government -- has a serious proposal that  might lead to a negotiated settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis. A Western  diplomat said Mubarak's statement was propaganda aimed at polishing his image  as a peacemaker.  </P> <P> Mubarak not only demanded that Iraq pull its troops out of Kuwait, but he also  called on Iraq to compensate Egyptian workers who lost their jobs in Kuwait and  Egyptians whose accounts in Kuwaiti banks have been frozen by Iraqi occupation  forces.  </P> <P> For domestic purposes, diplomatic sources said, making these demands gives  Mubarak a basis for sending troops to the gulf region.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on the last stop of a four-day tour  of Arab capitals, met for an hour with Egyptian Defense Minister Youssef abu  Taleb to compare notes on the military situation.  </P> <P> Earlier, Cheney had met with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and told reporters  afterward that the United States is considering selling additional jet  fighters, tanks, missiles and chemical warfare protection gear to the Saudis.  He said Washington will speed delivery of military equipment already in the  pipeline, including F-15 fighter planes and tanks.  </P> <P> "We obviously are looking at aircraft," he said. "We are looking at munitions  that go on the aircraft. We are looking at chemical protection gear which the  Saudis want. We are looking at the problem near-term and long-term, and we will  do whatever is needed to defend the kingdom."  </P> <P> Cheney said Saudi Arabia is very worried that Iraq will use chemical weapons,  as it has in the past against Iran and its own Kursih minority.  </P> <P> At a summit meeting of the Arab League nations on Aug. 10, Egypt led the move  to create a pan-Arab military force in the gulf region. Since then, diplomats  say, Egypt has sent 4,000 to 5,000 commandos and paratroopers, and Morocco has  sent 600 to 1,000 troops. Syria announced Tuesday that it has sent more than  1,000 troops.  </P> <P> In the last two days, diplomatic sources said, Egypt has begun moving out a  mechanized infantry division of 12,000 troops headed for Saudi Arabia. This  force, along with light tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery, is  traveling by air and sea.  </P> <P> "They already had 4,000 troops there, and two days ago they started to send the  mechanized division -- at what rate, I don't know," one diplomat said. "I  understand they plan to send the entire division of 12,000 men."  </P> <P> The news agency Reuters quoted a Western observer as saying the Egyptians had  asked "friendly countries to help them move artillery and armor to the gulf."  </P> <P> A military analyst said the Egyptians are taking their own tanks and artillery  because "there's no way they are going to be integrated" with other units.  </P> <P> At the time of the invasion, about 1 million Egyptians were in Kuwait and Iraq,  most of them working at menial jobs. They sent home about $1.2 billion a year.  </P> <P> The Egyptian government is clearly concerned about the loss of the money and  the workers' safety.  </P></p>

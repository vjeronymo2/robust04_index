			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Peter </F> Fridner in Warsaw on 23 January: "Instead of Fruitless  Discussions, Let Us Deal With Concrete Issues"]    [Text] Warsaw -- On the occasion of the visit to  Poland by the president of the Slovak Republic [Michal Kovac],  Polish President granted an interview to NARODNA OBRODA in his  residence at the Warsaw Belveder.    [Fridner] Your most recent guest comes from a country that  became independent only recently. How has the emergence and  existence of this state, the Slovak Republic, been received in  Poland?    [Walesa] I do not really know how it has been received in  Poland. We know that we have to be neighbors, that our  relations must be good, and they have the chance to be so. We  are only in the process of forming them. How they will look  depends on how successful we are going to be in forming them. I  am convinced that we are going to be good neighbors, and we will  do everything in our power so that our respective countries  benefit from the neighborhood.    [Fridner] Are you aware of any political problems between  our two countries?    [Walesa] No, I am not aware of any problems. We can be  satisfied with our talks and experience to date. That is,  however, just a matter of political experience and declarations.  So far, we have not been able to project the good into deeds.  Of course, we must understand that one cannot ask much from a  state that has been organizing for only one year. I am  convinced that as the two countries will be able to put their  domestic affairs in order, our cooperation will develop and we  will reap more benefit therefrom. There are no limits. We have  the desire and great hope, but something must be done about  their realization. We, politicians, can create the conditions,  but we cannot substitute for the directors, managers, or bank  owners, who must convert our fine resolutions to practical  measures.    [Fridner] That will apparently be the issue in question.  Despite the good political relations between our countries, the  economic relations have not been developing very favorably. The  mutual trade indicators have been declining over the past few  years. Are you aware of something that could change this trend?    [Walesa] I would really like to do everything I can to  reverse these adverse tendencies. If we had a centrally  controlled command system, we might have compelled something.  In the system based on economic freedom, however, it is  difficult to force the bankers or private businessmen to  cooperate. I am convinced that we will show each other what is  attractive in our respective countries, and this will be a  stimulus for the people who intend to realize our hopes.    [Fridner] Do you think that these questions will play a  significant role in your upcoming talks with President Kovac?    [Walesa] I know from our previous meetings with President  Kovac that we think alike. I hope that he will bring along  people who deal with specific problems, people from enterprises,  financiers, and managers. We will get them together with such  people from our side, and instruct them to scrutinize our  economic possibilities in an expert, technical manner.    [Fridner] Both our countries belong to the Central European  region. The guarantee of the security of this region is among  its main problems, and that particularly after the reinforcement  of the nationalist tendencies in Russia. How do you feel about  the situation after the Brussels NATO Summit and the trip of the  U.S. President to Europe? My premise is that, in Prague, you  had a chance to meet with President Clinton and the presidents  of the countries of the Visegrad Group.    [Walesa] We have attained that for which we hoped.  Unfortunately, the dearth of solidarity and teamwork on our part  has become obvious. Therefore, certain problems have been  solved for us by others. I am not denigrating the significance  of the Partnership for Peace idea. If we deal jointly with some  problems, we can benefit from this initiative in the future. As  I say, however, there must be solidarity among us. There must  be solidarity in dealing with our common problems. The question  of security is one of them. I can tell you that, with President  Kovac, we understand each other very well regarding this issue.  There is a certain difference of opinion between us and the  Czechs, but if we act together, the Czechs will also support us.  The U.S. Partnership proposal may be a good idea.  Nevertheless, its effect on us will depend on our application.    [Fridner] After the Prague meeting, several commentaries  proclaimed that the Visegrad Group was buried there, that it is  dead. Do you share this view?    [Walesa] If that were true, it would be against the logic of  the present world. After all, if the borders are to be  overcome, a regional cooperation is simply a fact, and you  cannot do anything about it. One can form various  configurations but they must be all based on what the life  brings. We are here, in this region, and we are closer to one  another than we are to America or elsewhere. The Hungarians,  you, and Poland agree on this. Even the Czechs agree, if not on  all issues. So far, it has not been politically necessary for  us to speak in a single voice. Such a unity was only necessary  on issues like the abrogation of the Warsaw Pact or CEMA  [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]. The Czechs are right  that we are not facing similar problems right now. Regional  cooperation is unavoidable. I am in favor of those of us who  agree with it taking certain organizational steps now. It can  be a cooperation between the Defense or Foreign Ministries,  oriented at solving various problems. In some questions we can  proceed jointly, in others individually.    [Fridner] You were one of the main protagonists of the  struggle against the communist totalitarianism. How do you feel  about the presence of the left-wing forces in the Polish  Government, moreover, forces that are to a great degree rooted  in the communist camp?    [Walesa] I have spoken about it a lot, and I have not  changed my opinion. After 50 years of the one-party system,  people are divided into the active and the passive. The active  people are further divided into those prepared and those  unprepared. The best prepared people come from the power  circles. The less prepared are the ones who did not have the  power, for instance the members of the Solidarity movement in  Poland. Now, as the better prepared rejected all the elements  that used to instill society with anxiety, as they promise to  build a free social order, a market economy, their superior  preparation gives them a better chance of success. Peoples do  not wish to fight all the time. They fight when they do not  like something, and then they return to work. Those, who offer  better solutions, win elections. After some time, five-ten  years, when we look at the programs again, we will redistribute  ourselves politically. There will be an opportunity to prepare  oneself for the government and fulfillment of the program.  Actually, nothing happened in Poland, it is a certain law of  nature, and similar occurrences can be expected in all other  countries.    [Fridner] Do you believe that the left wing will continue  with the reform process initiated by the Solidarity governments?    [Walesa] I, as president, and all the other active people,  even if less prepared for government, will be on guard regarding  our orientation. We will not allow a change of what we have  achieved. We will intervene at the slightest deviation. The  system, which has been established now, is a good one. The  parliament is not as divided as it used to be. We "won in  quarrels" various things, but the issues in question were in  fact legal solutions. The current parliament is almost unanimous  and has a good chance of collecting everything that the previous  period indicated and turn it into laws very rapidly. It is a  very interesting situation from the vantage point of Polish  history.    [Fridner] The Slovak public is quite interested in the fate  of their countrymen, the Slovaks living in the most southern  part of Poland. To what degree does the Polish state help to  implement the rights of this minority, particularly in the  spheres of education, culture, and religious services?    [Walesa] These are specific affairs, and they should be  dealt with by the governments. Since you asked me, however, I  would like to say this: If we are going to be in an integral  Europe, these issues will look different. If we are going to be  divided, they will surface. Therefore, I would like all these  countries -- Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic  -- to get in the same orbit. This would eliminate all talk  about matters of this type. Everybody would have the freedom of  movement but, at the same time, however, he would keep in mind  that we live in the same house. Since this has not happened,  these problems prevail, and we differ in opinion on them, we can  be even dissatisfied. That is, because we are not a part of an  integral European organism, there are differences resulting in  further differences, and they give rise to problems that lead to  such a question as you asked me.</p>

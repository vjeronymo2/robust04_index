			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava June 15 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  "The frontier between decent and indecent manners, prosperity  and poverty, success and failure must not end at the River  Morava (bordering the Czech Republic and Slovakia)," honorary  chairman of the New Slovakia (NS) movement Rudolf Mosny tells  today's independent daily NARODNA OBRODA.    The NS, which presented itself for the first time on Tuesday  [14 June], adheres to the values of "modern liberalism" based on  the inviolability of democratic values and efficient market  economy vouching for social security, says Mosny, a businessman  who has returned after several years in exile in the USA to  Slovakia.    Many problems have been caused by privatisation which has  become a political tool, says Mosny, adding that the  Privatisation Ministry should be abolished because it can be  easily substituted by the National Property Fund and "world  professional organisations with perfect skill with respect to  privatisation. Everything must be subordinated to the aim which  is revitalisation of the company. Neither coupon privatisation  nor employees' shares are such technique. They can be applied  only if the company flourishes," Mosny states.    The time has come for the positive influences of the West to  arrive in Slovakia, he says. "There is economic instability,  poor taxation, political fragmentation, corruption -- all the  bad influences from the West here," Mosny stresses. It is  untenable that 63 "billionaires," but also 50 percent of people  living below the poverty line, are registered in Bratislava, he  adds.</p>

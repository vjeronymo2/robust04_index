			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Kazakh gas field deal in sight - Contracts and ventures An agreement between Kazakhstan, Russia and a western consortium to develop the giant Karachaganak natural gas field in Kazakhhstan could be signed as early as the middle of next month, according to officials close to the negotiations. Talks in Almaty between British Gas, its Italian partner Agip and the Kazakh government are reported to have made progress in recent weeks. But detailed negotiations due over the next few weeks between the western companies and Gazprom, the Russian state gas monopoly, must be concluded before a final agreement can be signed. Kazakh officials had hoped that the talks would have been concluded by last week, but a number of issues remain to be resolved. The next round of negotiations are likely to focus on the terms of Gazprom's participation in the project and arrangements for the transport of Kazakh gas and liquid condensate, a naturally occuring gasoline, across Russian territory. British Gas and Agip have had the exclusive right to negotiate a contract to develop Karachaganak since 1992. Original plans did not include direct Russian participation. But in recent months it has become apparent that Russia wants equity participation in all main energy projects planned in the former Soviet republics. Gazprom discovered and partially developed Karachaganak during the Soviet era. The field contains proven reserves of 1,300bn cubic metres of natural gas, 650m tonnes of condensate and 200m tonnes of oil.</p>

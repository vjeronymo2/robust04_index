			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yolanda Gonzalez, Emilio Lomas M., and Raul </F> Llanos]    [Text] Hermosillo, Sonora, 29 May -- President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari said that even though signs of growth for the  first quarter were modest, "there are enough elements for a  reactivation of the country's economy."    Salinas said that although inflation reached only 8 percent  last year, "this year we are working toward reducing it even  more." During the 26th Ordinary General Assembly of the  Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco), the  president called on the country's businessmen to look for new  markets to compensate for the government's liberalization  efforts.    "Our OECD membership can make us part of the most developed  countries. It is not a way of saying that there are no longer  shortages in our fatherland; on the contrary, it will help us  acquire the tools to face the inequities and insufficiencies  that our country still endures."    We have paved the way to compete at home and abroad, and you  have shown that together we will do it successfully. After a  two-day working tour, the president said that what has been  accomplished so far is the result of efforts by all Mexicans.    "We are going to take advantage of the conditions that all  Mexicans have created with so much hard work. We will keep  inflation low to increase the likelihood of development and  boost real salaries and the purchasing power of those who have  the least. We will continue deregulation as an incentive for  commercial and productive activities. We will curb  bureaucratization and excessive red tape."    He added: "We will seek an opening that provides cheaper and  more competitive raw materials and supplies for our production  plants; an increased domestic market that favors consumers;  diversified trade that, with effort, is converting Mexico into  an exporting and competitive country; and a pluralistic nation  that lives with tolerance, dialogue, and cooperation."    President Salinas de Gortari previously told the country's  organized businessmen that their participation in the Stability,  Competitiveness, and Employment Pact (PECE), together with the  remaining social sectors and the government, "allowed inflation  to reach only 8 percent last year. This year we will reduce it  even more. We are confronting the inflation phenomena, which  affected us the most and whose elimination was demanded the  most, after having endured it for so many years."    The president said before Concanaco leaders and Commerce  Secretary Jaime Serra Puche: "The essential element in  consolidating the fight against inflation has been cleaning up  public finances." He said this clean-up has allowed the country  to eliminate the fiscal deficit and to use the savings realized  from servicing a smaller debt to boost salaries and lower  "certain" taxes.    "Remember that a few years ago the main burden was the  country's excessive debt, and the only topic of discussion was  how to eliminate it and overcome excessive inflation. Today,  thanks to everyone's efforts, we have had truly encouraging  results with both."    Salinas pointed out that Mexico's internal debt is only 10  percent of GNP. "We have accomplished this with everyone's  work, and it has also helped to eliminate excessive inflation,  which so affected the workers' real wages."    President Salinas later said there are still problems, but  there has also been progress which enables us to face new  challenges and set higher goals. "This has been the result of  our work, everyone's work. It is important to remember this,  and it is also useful to take full advantage of it to benefit  future generations."    President Salines said Mexicans needed economic stability to  encourage investment and to reactivate the country's production.  He said: Without price stability, it will be impossible to  propose sustainable growth or to permanently direct our efforts  toward justice.    "That is why we have been making changes that have allowed  us  to make our economy more productive and have established the  conditions to create more jobs, which are the essential solution  to the poverty problem and the possibility of becoming more  competitive at the international level."    To conclude, he reasserted: "We confirmed the Mexican  people's democratic will this year under complex circumstances.  It is a determination to live in peace and create job  opportunities. It is the principle of harmonious coexistence  for everyone based on diversity and respect for all. It is a  Mexico organized according to a civic spirit and love for the  homeland."</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Russian peacekeepers killed Two officers from the Russian peacekeeping force in Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia were killed and a third was wounded when gunmen fired on their car on Monday night. The attackers fled. The officers were the first victims among the Russian peacekeepers since the 3,000-strong force was deployed in the region in July to monitor a fragile ceasefire and the return of about 250,000 Georgian refugees. Russia's defence minister Pavel Grachev said Moscow would apply 'the toughest sanctions' against the perpetrators. Mr Grachev said he had sent his deputy, Colonel-General Georgy Kondratyev, to Abkhazia to investigate. A press release issued by the Abkhazian representive in Moscow blamed 'a Georgian sabotage group'. Abkhazian rebels, supported unofficially by some Russian army officers and volunteers from the Caucasus, drove Georgian government forces from the Black Sea region in a bloody conflict last year. But no lasting settlement of the separatist dispute has yet been signed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jesus Garzon; from the "TV Today" newscast; </F> passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] Today, the liberal and conservative parties  reiterated their concern for the serious public order situation  in the country. The government promised to defeat terrorism and  propel the electoral process forward.    According to political leaders, there are serious public  order difficulties in 17 of the country's 32 departments.    [Liberal Party leader Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala] "Evidently,  peace has been broken and, thus, security has deteriorated."    The politicians also believe the recent intensification of  violent guerrilla activities, including abductions and attacks,  has restricted the candidates' freedom to move about in their  regions.    [National Conservative Council President Cornelio Reyes] "We  have received reports from several congressional candidates who  have to campaign in helicopters because they cannot use the  roads in their departments."    Confronted with such a situation, the government asserted it  is necessary to challenge the terrorist threats.    [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] "Our goal is to have  the  direct presence of our Public Force in 100 percent of the  municipal capital cities in the country during the electoral  process."    Furthermore, the political parties charged that the actions  carried out by the guerrillas have reached an intolerable level.    [Reyes] "There are areas, for example, the Aguachica  municipality, where the guerrillas have not allowed traditional  parties to open a political office."    [Turbay Ayala] "I don't deny there is violence. I, however,  assert there will be elections."    The government affirms the 13 March elections are guaranteed  by the presence of more than 100,000 Administrative Department  of Security, police, and Army members.</p>

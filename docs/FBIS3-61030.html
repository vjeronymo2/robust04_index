			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel Aleksandr Manushkin: "Will the Ruslan </F> Stay Up in the Sky? Russia Needs a Program To Develop Military  Air Transport"]    [Text] It was the third day of flying. The An-124 Ruslan  airship, which took off from Melbourne, Australia, crossed over  the South Pole, refueled in Brazil and Morocco; then crossed the  North Pole, refueled once again at one of Russia's Far Eastern  military airfields; and by the end of the third day closed the  ring around the globe. I was lucky to participate in this  flight. Piloted by two crews headed by test pilots Lieutenant  General of Aviation L. Kozlov and Colonel Yu. Resnitskiy, in 3  days of flying the Ruslan set seven world and 10 all-Russian  records. Three years have passed since then, but no one has yet  been able to either surpass or repeat these accomplishments by  Russian pilots. The fact that in three days of truly nonstop  flight the airship never underwent technical maintenance (brief  landings were made only for refueling) also says something about  the high operating reliability of the Ruslan. This is the sort  of aviation equipment Russian military air transport possesses.    Military air transport. VTA [military air  transport] is presently equipped with medium An-12 and Il-76  airplanes and heavy An-22 Antey and An-124 Ruslan airplanes. All  of them are outfitted with reliable sighting and navigation  systems and inter-aircraft navigation systems. This makes it  possible to airlift troops and equipment, and land airborne  forces day and night in adverse weather and navigating  conditions, and in the presence of air defense countermeasures.    The An-12 was the first specialized military  transport airplane built in the Soviet Union. It is capable of  parachute landing on two platforms weighing a total of 16 tonnes  or 90 paratroopers, and of taking off from ill-prepared landing  strips, including dirt strips of limited dimensions. It has  shown itself to be simple to operate, and to be highly reliable  in the most diverse geographic and climatic conditions.    The An-22 Antey was the world's first heavy  military air transport airplane. It was introduced two years  before the similar American C-5 (1969). The dimensions of its  cargo cabin (length without ramp 26.4 m, width and height 4.4 m  each) permitted airlifting of almost all combat equipment of the  ground forces and the equipment of other armed services, which  practically solved the problem of airlift capability of combat  equipment in those days. The demand for airplanes capable of  carrying oversized cargo remains very high even today.    The Il-76 (Il-76M, Il-76MD) has been the main  airplane in VTA since 1974. Its different modifications have a  maximum lifting capacity of from 28 to 43 tons. Airliner  turbojet engines allow a cruising speed that is 1.5 times  greater than that of the An-12. The dimensions of the cargo  cabin (length 20.0 m, width 3.45 m, height 3.4 m) permit  parachute landing of three or four platforms with a total weight  of 42 tons, and make up to 75 percent of the combat equipment of  the different armed services airliftable.    The Ruslan An-124 is the world's largest military  transport airplane. Its maximum operating take-off weight is 392  tonnes. The unique dimensions of the cargo cabin (36.5 x 6.4 x  4.4 m) permit transport of practically all combat equipment of  the armed services. Possessing a lifting capacity and range that  are two to three times greater than those of the An-22 and  Il-76, it consumes 1.5-2 times less fuel per ton of airlifted  cargo.    I have managed to fly aboard all types of VTA airplanes in  the line of duty. I know first-hand about the missions and  problems of these air garrisons. There is good reason why  aviators in miliary air transport are referred to as "laborers  of the sky." Practically all crews in military air transport  have experienced runs lasting many days to the most remote  corners of the country, and to neighboring and distant  countries. This, when due to the absence of travel money they  had to eat and sleep aboard the airplane, when a fuel truck or  an airfield engine starting unit had to be begged or  "commandeered" from "alien" airports, and other such "life's  tribulations." And despite the fact that these toilers get  little in return for their nomadic way of life, they  conscientiously fulfill their duty, sometimes at the limit of  human endurance. Together with paratroopers, VTA crews were the  first to arrive in Afghanistan and the last to leave. They were  also the first to reach Armenia after the earthquake. In 20 days  of December 1988 360 VTA airplanes flew over 1,200 sorties. They  carried 380 truck-mounted cranes, 180 tractors, bulldozers and  excavators, more than 10,000 tents and yurts, and over 37,000  tons of other equipment and cargo needed in the rescue efforts.    I have been to the air force TsKP (central command post).  Who  in the air force flies on days off and even on holidays? Only  VTA crews. They fly from 50 to 100 sorties daily. Despite the  shortage of aviation fuel, spare parts and other expendables  (this topic needs special discussion), the intensity of flying  in VTA is high. I selected 1 December of this year at random,  and asked: What routes were the crews flying that day? On this  day VTA carried out 49 special assignments. (On other days this  figure can double.) The planned assignments included:    a) in the Transcaucasus--10 An-22 and Il-76 airplanes.  Delivery of food, and transport of military dependents and  refugees on the return leg;    b) in the Western Group of Forces (Germany)--9 An-22 and  Il-76 airplanes. Planned troop withdrawal;    c) in Dushanbe--2 Il-76 airplanes. Delivery of food and  medicine, and transport of military dependents and soldiers  discharged into the reserves on the return leg.    Five runs to Tiksy, Anadyr, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy and  Vladivostok to carry food and goods to garrisons in the Far  North and Far East were planned in the interests of the Central  Trade Administration. In addition, five VTA regiments flew  planned training flights on this day.    In short, reports tossed out by some mass media suggesting  that air force airplanes are laid up, that VTA just about  disintegrated after the USSR collapsed, do not correspond to  reality, to put it mildly.

Over 200 VTA airplanes remained beyond  Russia's borders. Moreover, most of them were the latest  modifications of the Il-76MD, and their flying time was still  low. However, Russian VTA has basically been reorganized by now.  Relocated air units are adapting themselves to their new places  with difficulty, with considerable problems. And of course, VTA  never stopped combat training for a single day. The Russian  president, who recently visited Tula and saw the aviators at  work, had high praise for the skill of air force personnel in  general and VTA personnel in particular.    Of course, as is true with the entire Army, maintenance of  VTA is an expensive proposition for the state. Each airplane  costs billions of rubles (for example a new Il-76 costs R6  billion), and each tonne of aviation fuel costs around R170,000.  Given the present political and economic turmoil in the country,  it is difficult, and almost impossible, to preserve and multiply  the combat potential of VTA. But this is something that has to  be done. No matter what competent specialists I spoke with, they  were all unanimous in their opinion: In view of its economic and  geographic position and political importance in the world arena,  Russia needs military air transport like it needs air. Our  country is one of the few states in the world in which there are  large cities and there are places where entire peoples live and  which can be reached, as that song goes, only by airplane. Their  life support requires a huge air and ground transportation  fleet. Furthermore, Russian territory is significantly greater  in area for example than the United States. Given the reductions  in the Army, we can no longer maintain identically strong  groupings of ground and other forces in different regions.  Consequently, their mobility is now acquiring very great  significance. And only military air transport is able to support  this mobility, to transfer forces quickly as reinforcements into  a particular region.    For example, the USA is also reducing its Army. But it is  not  reducing its military air transport--on the contrary it is  increasing it.    The forces and resources of military air transport and  refueling aviation in the United States are under the Military  Airlift Command--MAC. (Our refueling airplanes belong to  strategic aviation.) The United States has one refueling air  army and two military airlift armies under MAC. Each army  consists of three strategic airlift wings (C-141 Starlifter,  C-5A and C-5B Galaxy airplanes) and two tactical airlift wings  (C-130 Hercules airplanes). According to data available to me  there are 390 strategic and 640 tactical military transport  airplanes in MAC today. In a time of full mobilization, the  United States can bring in over 700 airplanes for strategic  forces and cargo (this is not counting tactical military air  transport). This is achieved by using reserves and dual-purpose  civilian airliners. We, however, cannot use civilian airplanes  when the need arises.    The following examples say something about the high mobility  of American forces. During the operations of United Nations  multinational forces in Somalia (Operation Restore Hope),  transport airplanes of the U.S. Air Force and civilian airplanes  recruited for these purposes flew over 700 trips and transferred  over 27,000 personnel and over 15,000 tonnes of cargo. During  Operation Desert Storm 10,000 sorties were flown, and around  3,000 persons and over 270,000 tonnes of cargo were carried into  the Persian Gulf zone from August 1990 to March 1991.    In short, mobility of any forces would be unimaginable  without military air transport. And the Americans, who know how  to make every dollar count, invest sizable resources into it.  For example, the forces will soon be receiving the new C-17  military transporter. Its experimental models have already been  flying since 1987. Possessing economical engines and equipped  with an air-to-air refueling system (by the way, all strategic  military transporters of the USA have such a system), the C-17  can transport and land all types of organic weapons, forces and  combat equipment. It is capable of operating from poorly  prepared and dirt airfields with a short landing strip.    So what about us? I am far from the notion that today's  Russia should compete with the Americans in development of  military air transport. It would be sufficient to say that the  fleet of these aircraft is significantly smaller in our country  than in the USA. Moreover, the missions of Russian VTA differ in  many ways from the American organization. But as long as we have  sufficiently powerful air transport (which is also useful to the  national economy), and if we are thinking about not only  preserving but also reinforcing VTA for the sake of the entire  Army's mobility, then we need to consider the future.    In my opinion, the future of VTA is uncertain today. All of  the problems stem from insufficient financing. Had the Soviet  Union not collapsed, and had the Russian treasury not been  depleted, VTA would have begun receiving a new military  transport airplane produced by S. Ilyushin's firm, which is not  inferior to the American C-17, by as early as the current  decade. But because of the absence of money, work on this  aircraft is barely alive, and none of the plans for its  commissioning are being met. The huge output capacities of  aviation plants producing the Il-76MD and the An-124 Ruslan are  currently standing idle, while the air force is unable to place  orders for them because it has nothing with which to pay for  them. It would be sufficient to say that in the last 3 years not  a single airliner has been added to VTA. And in the meantime the  existing fleet of airplanes is aging, their life is being used  up. Two Antey aircraft have already served their full useful  life, and have been written off and dismantled for spare parts.  Airplanes are standing idle because of a shortage of storage  batteries and tires (wheels), and because the engines have  served their useful life. The engines are being repaired at  plants, but there's no money with which to get them out of hock.  If money isn't found by 1 January 1994, a third of the Ruslans  and 12 percent of the Il-76 fleet will have to be laid up.    But the airplanes aren't the worst of the problem. People  have nowhere to live! As of today 5,240 families of servicemen  just in VTA do not have living quarters. This includes around  2,000 pilots. This year 564 families received apartments. But  this is just a drop in the bucket. At this rate, the earliest  many of the people on today's waiting lists will acquire their  own roof over their heads will be 9 years from now. The VTA  commander is keeping a constant finger on the apartment problem.  He has toured all of "his" garrisons with this problem in mind.  For example, he reached an agreement with the local  administration in Taganrog to immediately allocate 20 apartments  ready for occupancy. A contract was drawn up, but there is money  to pay for it. The amount--R470 million. Where is this money to  be had? And in Orenburg, for example, he was able to reach  agreement with the administration, and people (officers and  their families) began moving in without making the prepayments.  But such obliging people are rare today. As a rule they are  operating according to the principle of the heroes Ilf and  Petrov: Money in the morning, chairs in the evening. You can't  sign for anything--such are market relations.    Many new VTA garrisons do not even offer conditions for  normal operation of airplanes. Assume for example that a  regiment has been relocated to an airfield used previously by  fighters, which are significantly smaller in size than VTA  airplanes. The appropriate parking pads are needed, but there  aren't any. Significantly larger containers for fuel, space for  technical maintenance units and many, many other things are  needed. But in the meantime maintenance must be carried on in  bitter cold, at an airfield exposed to all four winds. People  sometimes work in inhuman conditions, while receiving their pay  2-3 months late. Some are unable to endure, the fill out  discharge applications, and sometimes you can't blame them. But  the bulk, the core of the military collectives are staying  together, and continuing to toil. Moreover they are working  conscientiously. What is keeping them going? It's no longer  fashionable today to speak in flowery phrases, but I can't find  any epithets for these people other than "duty," "honor" and  "conscience." In short, VTA lived in the past, is living now,  and I think it will go on living in the future. Were the  country's leadership to find the resources to support it, people  capable of improving and strengthening military air transport  are already in place.</p>

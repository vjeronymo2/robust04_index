			<p>BFN     [Text] The number of extremists who have recently repented  in Asyut Governorate is 170 members.    This statement was made by Asyut Governor Major General  Samih  al-Sa'id yesterday. He said that these repentant extremists  turned themselves in to the security organs with the help of the  popular leaderships in the Governorate of Asyut.    The Asyut governor added that the repentance of these  extremists comes within the framework of returning to the path  of righteousness and understanding of the true religious  teachings after it became clear to them that what they had  previously thought were religious ideas were actually corrupt  and wrong.</p>

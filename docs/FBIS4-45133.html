			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Part one of two-part article by Vasiliy Krivokhizha, deputy </F> director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Research:  "Future of Russian Nuclear Potential"]    [Text] The Soviet leadership's political thinking,  particularly as regards military-political strategy, used to be  compared in the old days to studied chess gambits. The  circumstances of the USSR's collapse and the rapid degradation  of society call into question the correctness of this  complimentary comparison -- at any rate as regards the skills of  many of the "chess players" of the perestroyka period. The  historians of the future, however, will as usual voice varying  opinions about 20th century Russian history and about whether  the last Soviet leadership had an inferiority complex or whether  they were pioneering a new era, and so forth. What will be seen  as history by the researchers of the future, for us increasingly  boils down to the problem of survival. Consequently, as we  encounter very urgent matters every day it does not seem out of  place to attempt to sort out at least certain rules and the  sense of the game in which Russia is a player in the nuclear  arms sphere.    The current era of total change is, apart from anything  else,  also a time of radical change in geostrategic realities and ways  of thinking. The speed and spontaneity of these changes are  probably the reason why our so-called post-Soviet society is  parting willingly (and even with unmitigated enthusiasm) from  the state appurtenances that largely determined the USSR's  status as a military "superpower." There is something  irrational -- though easily explained in terms of the systemic  crisis in society and its revolutionary nihilism -- in the fact  that we are putting paid with equal measures of indifference  ("we don't need that any more!") to the, in many respects  controversial but nonetheless technically sophisticated, "Buran"  (and thus, in practice, to our entire "state-funded space  effort"); to aircraft-carrying cruisers -- and next it will be  the turn of the entire oceangoing fleet; and to ABM defense and  air-defense installations and strategic ground force groupings  west of Smolensk and south of Sochi.    There is, however, a sphere of social and professional  interests where the consequences of the possible changes should  be analyzed with particular care and where discussions should be  conducted by specialists in a constructive spirit without any  interference from emotions and not necessarily in conjunction  with other information such as, say, the examination of the  START II Treaty by the new parliament or the adoption of a  long-term program for military organizational development. It  will be a question of the prospects for developing our strategic  nuclear forces, which can quite justifiably be called the  scepter in the double-headed eagle's claw.    It is time to recognize that behind the numerous discussions  about the expediency of retaining, removing, or adopting certain  weapons systems and their quantitative and qualitative  parameters lies a principled and so fundamental question that  people prefer not to consider it -- will Russia be able under  these conditions that are new to it to preserve its nuclear  potential and in what form? It is no secret that a number of  important components in the nuclear system that used to exist  have been lost, and traditional problems such as, for instance,  the no-first-use of nuclear weapons and the relationship between  a retaliatory strike and a counterstrike are being reconsidered  and reinterpreted. Thus, the question of the future of Russia's  nuclear potential is becoming not so much theoretical as  practical -- particularly now that the lack of funds and the  absence of constant and focused attention from top organs of  power to the problems of the strategic nuclear forces could lead  to their irreversible degradation. In tandem with this, the  protracted uncertainty about ratification of the Strategic  Offensive Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) threatens to  seriously delay the entire future disarmament process and  introduces additional problems to the choice of the ideal  solutions for modernizing the Russian Armed Forces' strategic  nuclear component.    Statesmen who should already be taking responsible steps to  choose long-term avenues for the organizational development of  nuclear strategic forces are feeling an urgent need for a more  accurate system of references in the emerging geopolitical  situation, a need to understand what global military-political  situation they will have to face in the future. And it is very  important for them that some fragments of the picture of the  future -- despite the turbulent processes of change in the world  order -- are in a number of aspects acquiring new outlines.    A typical feature of the emergent era will be a change in  the  overall structure of influence in the world. Many specialists  are noting that the bipolar structure with two opposed  superpowers -- the United States and the USSR -- is being  replaced by a more traditional multipolar structure which, by  reducing the opportunities for the superpowers to determine the  course of world development, will enhance the role of other  countries (such as the countries of Europe and the Pacific  region), diversifying the arsenal of their ways and means of  influencing world politics. According to a number of forecasts,  the weakening of U.S. economic positions in favor of West Europe  and Japan will make the United States' bonds of alliance with  its partners in Europe and Asia more short-term and unstable,  and international relations more complex, unstable, and less  predictable as a result. Hence, the overall political situation  in the world may be less predictable, hard to control even at  regional, not to mention global, level, and likely to result in  the emergence of acute crises and the appearance of additional  spurs to confrontation. The distant rumbles of thunder can  already be heard.    In the context of a multipolar world with criteria of  influence and stability that are somewhat different and by no  means always advantageous for Russia, when additional room is  created for multilateral political maneuver, allies can very  quickly become enemies, and the principle of "every man for  himself" (remembering G. Washington's behest) prevails  increasingly clearly in politics -- under these circumstances it  is hardly sensible to rush into all-out disarmament, giving up  our national nuclear forces or even discussing handing them over  to some kind of collective control. It would be an unforgivable  mistake, giving in to complacent ideas about the end of the era  of confrontation, to "tear the tails off" all Russia's strategic  missiles, although this does not at all mean that we should not  use the entire panoply of peaceful means of safeguarding  Russia's national security or that we should end the disarmament  negotiations.    The range of opinions on this issue, particularly now that  politics has become part and parcel of our public awareness, is  quite broad. Thus, there is a view (voiced in particular by  ISKRAN [expansion unknown] staffers S.K. Oznobishchev and A.V.  Surikov) that at a time of the transition to the building of  strategic partnership relations between Russia and the United  States, the use of the strategic stability criteria which were  successfully used in the postwar decades is becoming senseless.  Since this is the case, despite all the reservations befitting  the current situation, nuclear weapons are allegedly becoming a  kind of burden for Russia and should be gradually turned into  the "last guarantee" of the security system "not only for Russia  and the United States in isolation, but perhaps for a whole  group of states united behind the principles of a collective  security system within the UN framework."    Admittedly, it seems as though the United States is not yet  ready to share with Russia its experience of these innovations,  even though their general human and humanitarian thrust is  evident. The nuclear powers' lack of enthusiasm on this subject  is possibly explained by the fact that achieving an ideal  combination of individual and collective means of defense is a  complicated task with no single solution. But that is a  separate discussion. The actual agenda is different, and one  specific problem is that Russia should maintain effective  national strategic nuclear forces. At the same time, it somehow  seems as though our enemy now is not any specific country or  group of countries, but uncertainty (incidentally, the  transition to planning for uncertainty has already been  reflected in some official U.S. documents on military-strategic  issues).    If we set out the development of military thinking in the  nuclear planning sphere extremely simply and without any serious  distortions, it can be said that the development of nuclear  weapons arsenals has made certain changes to the targeted role  of military strategy, which has become more broadly interpreted  and is seen as a military-political strategy. In reality this  has meant a change of emphasis in nuclear planning from the  possibility of directly winning a nuclear war to the sphere of  implementing political goals by means of the threat of war. The  concept of political deterrence has supplemented the concept of  nuclear deterrence -- literally "containment by means of nuclear  deterrence" [sderzhivaniye posredstvom yadernogo ustrasheniya].  It was based on the principle of the "balance of terror" -- the  certainty that each party to a potential nuclear conflict would  inevitably suffer unacceptable damage in any nuclear war  scenario. The logic of deterrence presupposed the permanent  building up of the two superpowers' nuclear potentials and an  increase in the number of nuclear munitions and delivery systems  to an irrational level (a kind of "foolish multitude") that  guaranteed the impossibility of one side winning in any  meaningful way. Implementation of this concept turned into an  outright arms race.  At the end of the sixties the stupidity of this approach to  the organizational development of strategic nuclear forces was  so obvious that the parties to the confrontation came to the  conclusion that it was expedient to seek (very cautiously and  gradually) new approaches to maintaining strategic stability and  to implementing the concept of combining nuclear deterrence with  arms control (so far only control).    If the strategic nuclear forces of the two states (or  coalitions of states) are capable of inflicting unacceptable  damage on each other in retaliation (retaliatory strikes and  counterstrikes), then both sides restrain each other from  aggression, military equilibrium exists between the states, and,  consequently, military-strategic stability in their relations is  maintained. Thus, deterrence is achieved by the possibility that  strategic nuclear forces will deliver a retaliatory strike of  such force in response to an enemy first strike that the idea of  carrying out a first strike ceases to be attractive.    The method of maintaining strategic balance on the basis of  the use of nuclear deterrence proved its effectiveness from many  standpoints over the decades. But, like any "precision"  instrument, it is very fragile and subject to many factors in  real life. Thus, of itself the conclusion that stability exists  at any specific moment of time requires a very complex analysis  of the military-political and military-technical reality, and  consideration of a huge number of varied and, moreover, variable  quantities in the most unexpected areas. We can also cite the  sensitivity of this kind of stability to different symmetries  and asymmetries in arms systems, and imbalances between rivals  even within the framework of the "simple bipolar world." Any  changes in military potentials, on the one hand, promote the  emergence of excessive suspicion in interstate relations, while,  paradoxically, on the other hand objectively requiring the  maintenance of a certain level of mutual confidence.    In this context many necessary but unilateral steps to  sensibly improve national armed forces could upset the strategic  equilibrium and should therefore be most carefully weighed up  from the standpoint of whether or not they will be seen by the  opposite side as an attempt to change the balance in its favor.  Caution or active enmity can be caused by the improvement of  the technical potential of conventional (nonnuclear) weapons,  particularly in terms of warhead accuracy and yield, the  development [sozdaniye] of any ABM systems with ambiguous roles,  and so forth. The problem of somebody acquiring a decisive  military advantage through a technological breakthrough also  remains very topical. This likelihood does exist, which could  tempt people to play their "untrumpable" card for the purposes  of strong-arm blackmail.    That is why Russia and the United States, like other states,  need to improve their strategic nuclear forces in areas that  strengthen strategic equilibrium. And corresponding joint  information about weapons systems in service should be envisaged.    In order to define the main avenues for the organizational  development of national nuclear deterrence forces it is very  useful to comprehensively analyze and take account of new  concepts which have recently been actively developed and  actually implemented by Western specialists in the sphere of  strategic planning. These concepts are based on the initial  premise that the most realistic threat to the security of the  United States and its NATO allies now comes not from Russia and  the other CIS countries but from "authoritarian" regimes (read  "unfriendly," as distinct, for instance, from "friendly  dictators"), or regional interstate and interethnic conflicts  using conventional weapons. It is within the framework of this  doctrine that Western specialists have embarked on the  elaboration of new approaches which will define the principles  governing the use of nuclear arsenals for the next 10-20 years.  In the United States in particular, in early 1993 L. Aspin, the  then U.S. defense secretary, had already ordered an urgent  review of the concept of the use of U.S. strategic nuclear  forces. Although officially the adoption of the new concept is  planned only for this year, the main problems that have arisen  in the course of its elaboration have been covered in sufficient  detail. In particular, the U.S. strategists will not only have  to revise the list of targets, but also review once again  whether the United States needs such a big nuclear potential,  since maintaining it at its current level costs the United  States $10 billion a year at a time when the threat of an  all-out nuclear war has significantly diminished. The military  are also having to "rethink the methods for deterring new and  old enemies."  It is worth noting that, in L. Aspin's opinion (and there is  hardly any doubt about his competence on geostrategic matters),  the main threat to U.S. security is now posed not by an  increasingly predictable ("transparent") global strategic foe --  as was the Soviet Union -- but by a whole team of "political  monsters" in the shape of "nuclear smugglers and double-dealing  governments that reject international norms."    For all the lack of ambiguity in the interpretations of the  role played by nuclear weapons in the present-day world, the  renewed U.S. concept of "containment by means of nuclear  deterrence" nonetheless remains the most important nuclear  planning idea for the United States, and the novel aspect of the  utilization of strategic nuclear forces will most probably lie  in the search for "some kind of devilishly inventive new  principles." Nothing is as yet known about these, incidentally  -- although L. Aspin admitted, discovering compelling reasons  for it, that the approach of "monitoring the nuclear arsenal  together with a threat of retribution" which had effectively  influenced the Soviet Union, "may not frighten the new owners of  nuclear weapons at all." In this event it cannot be ruled out,  at least theoretically, that there will be an expanded range of  missions for strategic nuclear weapons to carry out -- from  peaceful containment through deterrence on the basis of the  inflicting of unacceptable damage, to the limited combat use of  nuclear weapons alongside conventional (nonnuclear) systems.  The main aim of the limited combat use of nuclear weapons would  be to prevent a military conflict from developing into all-out  hostilities -- that is, in an unfavorable direction for the  state under attack -- and to defuse the conflict. We cannot  rule out new and original ways of parrying the threat from  "nuclear smugglers and double-dealing governments." For  instance, the potential threat of nuclear terrorism could be  eliminated by implementing the idea of global information  transparency in the nuclear sphere, whereby secret activity in  manufacturing and moving not only nuclear devices, but in  accumulating a "critical mass" of fissile materials would become  impossible. Governments that prove intractable in this area  could be (as has already happened) removed from the political  scene for the required period of time by establishing control  over the ruling elites in these countries or with the help (and  there are plenty of examples of this too) of limited military  and other sanctions -- which would easily be feasible within the  framework of a policy of regionalism or simply under UN mandate.  But the latter measures might not always be successful --  therefore the reality of using strong-arm methods, regrettable  though it may be, should be retained.    We should be more interested in the question of whether  Russia is ready to propose its own vision of the use of  strategic nuclear forces. The undoubtedly honest position of  the new Russian military doctrine -- now being extensively  commented upon -- on the possible use of a nuclear first strike  can be seen mainly as a reaction to traditional strategic  challenges and as being largely brought about by the country's  situation and, accordingly, by the state of its Armed Forces.  To all appearances, even the modernization of Russia's  strategic nuclear forces, which is suggested under the framework  of the treaties on offensive arms reduction, does not make it  possible to do anything but implement deterrence within the  framework also of the "traditional" military-strategic situation  with the criterion of inflicting unacceptable damage on any  aggressor in retaliatory action.    When talking of the category of "unacceptable damage," we  should take account of present-day views of this problem. We  realize now that this category has, as it were, two dimensions,  and can be framed within two systems of coordinates. It is  usual to consider (and, incidentally, this understanding emerged  relatively recently), that the criterion of unacceptable damage  exists simultaneously as a certain quantitative level of losses  and as a kind of psychological barrier.    The question of the norm of unacceptable damage is  incredibly  complex. Military specialists honestly admit the failure of the  numerous attempts to define a more or less objective level for  it. Staffs in both Russia and the United States are now using in  their practical activity the mathematical value of a set amount  of damage (required for deterrence) which nonetheless plays an  important role in assessing the strategic balance when defining  the limits of restrictions in the course of drawing up  disarmament treaties and, most important of all, serves as a  kind of guideline in shaping major state programs for the  quantitative and qualitative development of strategic offensive  arms.  We should not downplay the positive significance that the idea  of a quantitative assessment of the force required to inflict  "unacceptable damage" on an enemy has possessed for the  development of the strategic situation, looked at  retrospectively. It was this idea that made it possible to  conclude more or less objectively that there was nuclear parity  between the USSR and the United States -- which made it possible  for one of the parties to dump its psychological baggage and  provided an incentive for a disarmament process based on mutual  recognition of the impossibility of either side's winning any  substantial advantage in the context of balanced cuts in  strategic offensive arms. At the same time, let us emphasize  yet again that the criterion of "unacceptable damage" was to all  intents and purposes never used as the basis for the adoption of  the "final" decision to launch a nuclear strike within the  context of the nuclear deterrence doctrine. Its mechanistic  meaning (incidentally, if it could have been used as a  guideline, then the choice of the time to launch a first strike  could easily have been delegated to computers) cannot be related  to the huge moral responsibility which a political leader would  have to assume when deciding to start a nuclear war. We need  only recall the Caribbean crisis, when the correlation of  nuclear munitions was 17-1 in favor of the United States. (The  Soviet Union had around 290 nuclear munitions, while the  Americans had something in the order of 5,000). You can also  imagine under what scenario the war in the Persian Gulf would  have been played out if Iraq had had a few primitive nuclear  munitions at the time. Most probably there would have been no  war, and the task of liberating Kuwait would have been resolved  by different means.    Few people give much thought to the fact that the category  of  terror and the category of "unacceptable damage" in its  psychological dimension are historical categories -- times  change, old moral principles and stereotypes are being tightened  up and new ones are taking shape; attitudes toward the  permissibility and probability of nuclear war are also being  reconsidered by the political leaders of the major nuclear  powers. Throughout postwar history common sense has never yet  deseted them, which has made it possible at least to avert  several global nuclear conflicts. There are no grounds for  supposing that the current U.S. leaders have "frozen" their idea  of what constitutes acceptable damage for their country as a  result of an exchange of nuclear strikes with Russia at the  level imagined by President Eisenhower. When in 1989 the U.S.  plan for a nuclear attack on the USSR, drawn up in 1957, was  declassified, environmental specialists were quick to produce a  model of the consequences for the United States of launching  such a nuclear strike against the USSR. It turned out that if  all the planned 180 high-yield atomic and hydrogen bombs were  exploded on Soviet territory, the USSR would be guaranteed to  cease to exist as a state, but in two or three weeks the level  of radioactive fallout on U.S. territory as a result of the  natural spread of radioactive dust through atmospheric air  currents would be comparable to 60 Chernobyls. Of course, the  accuracy of these assessments (from the "greenhouse effect" to  "nuclear winter") can be disputed, but one would like to hope  that nobody would try to do a real experiment to check them out.    More and more experts today are inclined to think that  nuclear weapons cannot be used in principle.    It is, nevertheless, not possible to wholly agree with this,  since the unambiguous exclusion of the possibility of the use of  nuclear weapons removes their deterrent effect. You could even  use sophistry to prove the opposite. But in practice the basis  of deterrence is the probability of the use of nuclear weapons.  References to the irrationality of their use and their terrible  consequences, which make it impossible to achieve the political  aims of a war, are convincing but leave room for doubt. For  instance, in August 1914, when World War I was already building  up a head of steam in Europe, certain U.S. newspapers thought it  appropriate to state something to the effect that the systems  (primarily artillery systems) in the sides' arsenals were so  destructive that it was difficult even to imagine the  consequences of a war -- and therefore there could simply not be  a war. Another example is that Indian tradition has it that the  events described in the heroic epic "The Mahabharata" (compiled  in its present form around the middle of the first millennium)  relate to some wars and great social upheavals of the fourth  millennium BC. The epic describes various types of what we  would now call mass destruction weapons, whose use required a  difficult psychological barrier to be overcome. R. Oppenheimer,  one of the developers of the atomic bomb, directly associated  the Mahabharata's "light brighter than a thousand suns" with a  nuclear explosion. For us it is not so important which modern  arms systems might correlate to the types of weapons described  there. What is important was something else -- there was an  entire science behind their use (star-gazing and their own  system of combat using "divine weapons"). "No man should ever  think of warring with them. Should they fall into the hands of  the weak, they could consume this entire transient world. They  should always be used as a defense against other weapons. They  are wonderful, they cannot be parried, but they can repulse an  attack in which any other weapon is used [divnoye, ono  neotvratimo, no udar vsyakim drugim oruzhiyem ono otbivayet]."  The psychological barrier was nonetheless overcome, and the  weapons were used, despite the warning that some types of them  would lead to an effect, seen in a modern reading, on the human  genetic code. We can only hope that the current system of  deterrence will prove more effective.    Unlike the United States, an effective strategic nuclear  forces structure for Russia which would guarantee the nuclear  deterrence of any aggressor in any strategic situations, is a  triad: Strategic Missile Forces plus Naval strategic nuclear  forces plus Air Force strategic nuclear forces. Excluding the  Strategic Missile Forces, the Naval strategic nuclear forces or  the Air Force strategic nuclear forces from the triadic  structure of Russia's strategic nuclear forces would lead,  according to certain calculations, to an increase in the number  of nuclear munitions required for deterrence within the  strategic nuclear forces by a factor of 1.2-1.6, and in  individual strategic situations, to the nonfulfill of the combat  mission. This discrepancy in the rational structures whereby  the Russian and the U.S. strategic nuclear forces are composed  is attributable to the inferior survivability of the naval  component of Russia's strategic nuclear forces (see V.  Belousov's article) as compared with the analogous parameters of  the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. This deficiency in the  Russian naval strategic nuclear forces may be compensated for  and is compensated for by a Strategic Missile Forces land-based  stationary and also road-mobile force. The triadic structure of  the Russian strategic nuclear forces provides a guaranteed  counter to technological breakthroughs in the military sphere,  for example in air defense, ABM defense, or antisubmarine  defense. Such a strategic nuclear force structure creates a  great deal of uncertainty for a possible aggressor as to the  effectiveness of his preemptive strike, and is a factor which  stabilizes the strategic equilibrium. Therefore it is  impermissible to remove one of the components from the Russian  strategic nuclear forces.</p>

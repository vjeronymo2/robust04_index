He talked about  politics, the economy, and prospects for political dialogue.  Here is a summary of the main topics from Malek Elilmi.    [Malek] At a request from the National Dialogue Commission,  Mr. Redha Malek said the Higher State Council [HCE] is  continuing its task for another month to give greater  opportunities for the dialogue to continue and for a national  conference to be held. Mr. Redha Malek said the HCE has  completed its task and had prevented Algeria from becoming a new  Afghanistan. He said history will bear witness that in this  difficult situation we have saved the state and democracy.    Redha Malek said the aim of the national conference is to  arrive at the minimum level of consensus among Algerians who  understand the democratic game and those who favor the rule of  law and political pluralism. He said the dialogue is open to  all reasonable Algerians who oppose terrorism and realize it is  an impasse. We favor breaking with the mistakes of the past,  Redha Malek said. We have gotten into this situation because  the state did not play its role and the consensus which existed  was broken up and eroded. Deviations occurred, Redha Malek said,  which caused the people to lose confidence in the state.    The political authorities will now endeavor with full  determination to build a firm state which has credibility among  the people, Redha Malek added.    On Algeria's debts and economic revival, Redha Malek said  Algeria will meet all the deadlines and will pay all its current  debts of $25-26 billion. Debt servicing has become a heavy  burden this year, reaching 9.3 billion. Since December, we have  opened up a dialogue with the IMF. A meeting with our experts  resulted in notable progress, and in January we will try to  reach an agreement to ease debt servicing.    This stage is difficult, Redha Malek said, but it is  temporary. We have great human and material resources, and we  will endeavor to convince the international community to  participate in reviving the Algerian economy.</p>

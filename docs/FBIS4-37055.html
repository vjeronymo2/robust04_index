			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Syria Does Not Succumb to  Pressures," AL-BA'TH says in its editorial: Once again  pressures on Syria increase as a result of its firm patriotic  and pan-Arab position in face of the intensive Israeli attempts  to empty the peace process of its contents and derail it from  its track and objective of just and comprehensive peace in the  region.    The newspaper adds: This is not the first time Syria is  subjected to pressures. Before the peace process, the pressure  campaigns had been at their peak to draw Syria into something it  did not want and did not approve regarding Arab land and rights.  During the peace talks, pressures increased and took various  forms, such as accusations, lies, and warnings all aimed at  undermining Syria's decision which is primarily based on not  relinquishing the national and pan-Arab rights.    AL-BA'TH says Syria has overcome these pressures and has not  yielded to intimidations and maneuvers. It has been proven that  peace for Syria is a strategic option, not a negotiations game  or casual position for the sake of diplomatic gains. Peace is a  principle that was presented by Syria when President Hafiz  al-Asad called for full withdrawal in return for full peace.    The newspaper emphasizes: We in Syria have always been with  the peace process. We have cooperated, and are ready to  cooperate to render it successful, but we do not accept anything  less than the principles set for this process.    Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria is  experienced in resisting and confronting pressures, and no one  can force it to change its firm positions that represent the  national and pan-Arab interests of its people and Arab nation.  Syria acts in harmony with its principles and those of the  international legitimacy in the efforts to achieve a just and  comprehensive solution that secures the restoration of rights to  their owners, and realizes solid peace, security, and stability  for all parties in the region.</p>

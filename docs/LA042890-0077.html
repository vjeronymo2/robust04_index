			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CONNECTICUT;  </P> <P> SENATORS APPROVE ABORTION-RIGHTS BILL  </P> <P> The state Senate approved a bill guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion and  repealing Connecticut's unenforced anti-abortion statutes.  </P> <P> The measure requires counseling for girls 15 and under before getting an  abortion and encourages them to tell their parents. It now goes to Gov. William  A. O'Neill, who has said he will sign it. The bill effectively codifies into  state law much of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision. It  allows abortions late in pregnancy -- when the fetus is capable of living  outside the womb -- only when the life or health of the mother is in danger.  </P></p>

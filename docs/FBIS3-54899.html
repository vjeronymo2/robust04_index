			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Valentin Vernodubenko for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev January 4 TASS -- A Ukrainian Government  meeting chaired by Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy  discussed today the stabilization of basic industrial branches.  The meeting was attended by government members and heads of  ministries and departments of the mining and coke-chemical  industries, metallurgy, power engineering and transport.    "The discussion was suggested by a recent meeting of the  Cabinet of Ministers that dwelt on prices on energy carriers,  primarily coal," Ukrainian Vice-Premier Vasiliy Yevtukhov told  UKRINFORM.    "We have raised coal prices, which resulted in the increase  of prices on sausage, milk and bread. It is clear as soon as  coal prices are raised, coke prices immediately go up, which is  followed by price increase on machine-building and agricultural  products.    "Some meeting speakers noted we can raise fuel prices and  keep those in metallurgy and power engineering on the same  level. It is impossible since the production costs in these  branches include coal spending. The meeting aimed to reach a  parity of prices in the coal industry, metallurgy and power  engineering and achieve mutual understanding without which it is  impossible to overcome the economic crisis," he added.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Observer: Oxford calling John Flemming, the energetic chief economist of Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is not the first officer to jump ship. But he is the most senior, and his planned return to a less turbulent academic life will leave a nasty hole at the top of the two-year-old institution. Flemming's decision to join the EBRD less than two years ago did much to establish its credibility in the City. He had been number four in the Bank of England hierarchy and during his six years as chief economist had done much to increase the Bank's standing in the economics profession. Admittedly, his departure from the EBRD is still some way off. But it sounds as if the 51-year-old economist is going to be the next warden of Wadham College, Oxford. Statistician Sir Claus Moser, who has been warden since 1984, will reach the normal retirement age of 70 in a few months time, and a straw poll of dons has already decided in Flemming's favour. A formal election will take place during the coming academic year and Flemming could be in his new job by October 1993. Flemming - one of the UK's brainiest economists - was an undergraduate at Trinity College, has studied and taught at Nuffield and Oriel, and still lives in Oxford. Given that Wadham is not one of the richer Oxford colleges, Flemming is likely to spend a good deal of his time on the fund-raising for the college and free-lancing on his own account.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: New York rejects UK judgment BACHCHAN v INDIA ABROAD PUBLICATIONS INC New York Supreme Court: Judge Shirley Fingerhood: April 13 1992 A UK libel judgment obtained by a private person against a media defendant in respect of a news report of public concern, is unenforceable in New York in that, having been obtained under English law which imposes the burden of proving truth and justification on the defendant, it fails to satisfy US standards for protection of free speech and the press under which the plaintiff must prove falsity and fault. Judge Shirley Fingerhood so held when giving judgment for the defendant, India Abroad Publications Inc, on a motion by the plaintiff, Mr Ajitabh Bachchan, to enforce a libel judgment obtained by him against India Abroad in the UK. HER HONOUR said that judgment was granted in the UK High Court against the New York operator of a news service. The story held to be defamatory was written in London, and wired to the news service in India. It was reported in two Indian newspapers, copies of which were distributed in the UK. It was also reported in an issue of India Abroad in New York, and an edition was printed and distributed in the UK by a subsidiary. The story stated that a Swedish daily newspaper, Dagens Nyheter (DN), had reported that Swiss authorities had frozen an account belonging to Mr Bachchan to which money was transferred from a coded account into which commissions paid by Bofors were deposited. Bofors was a Swedish arms company which, some time before, had been charged with paying kickbacks to obtain a large munitions contract with the Indian government. Mr Bachchan brought an action against DN in London at the same time as it sued India Abroad. DN settled and issued an apology. The jury assessed Pounds 40,000 damages against India Abroad and its reporter. As authorised by section 5303 of New York's Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR), Mr Bachchan sought to enforce that judgment by motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint. Entry of judgment was opposed on the ground that it was imposed without the safeguards for freedom of speech and the press required by the First Amendment to the US Constitution and article 1 section 8 of the Constitution of New York State. India Abroad asked the court to reject the judgment as repugnant to public policy, which was a ground for non-recognition of foreign judgments under CPLR 5304(b)(4). If the public policy to which the foreign judgment was repugnant was embodied in the First Amendment or the free speech guaranty of the New York Constitution, refusal to recognise the judgment was 'constitutionally mandatory'. Under English law any published statement which adversely affected a person's reputation was prima facie defamatory. A plaintiff's only burden was to establish that the words complained of referred to him, were published by the defendant, and bore a defamatory meaning. Statements of fact were presumed to be false and the defendant must plead justification. English law did not distinguish between private persons and public figures or those involved in matters of public concern. None were required to prove falsity of the libel or fault on the part of the defendant. No plaintiff was required to prove that a media defendant intentionally or negligently disregarded proper journalistic standards in order to prevail. The defendant had the burden of proving not only truth but also of establishing entitlement to qualified privilege for newspaper publications and broadcasters where the matter published was 'of public concern' and publication was 'for the public benefit' (section 7, Defamation Act 1952). India Abroad argued that English defamation law failed to meet US constitutional standards because Mr Bachchan, a friend of the late Rajiv Gandhi, and the brother and manager of a movie star and former member of parliament, was a public figure. In New York Times v Sullivan 376 US 254, 279-280 (1961), the US Supreme Court ruled that to recover damages for defamation a public official must prove 'actual malice'. That burden of proof was placed on public figures who sued media defendants in Curtis Publishing v Butts 388 US 130 (1967). It was unnecessary and inappropriate to decide whether Mr Bachchan, an Indian national residing in England or Switzerland, was a public figure. In Gertz v Robert Welch 418 US 323,347 (1974), the court held that a private figure could not recover damages for defamation without showing that a media defendant was at fault. In Philadelphia Newspapers v Hepps 475 US 767,775,777, Justice O'Connor stated that when the speech at issue was of public concern but the plaintiff was a private figure the Constitution supplanted Common Law standards, 'but the constitutional requirements are . . . less forbidding than when the plaintiff is a public figure'. Finding the plaintiff to be a private figure and the newspaper article to be of public concern, the court held that 'the Common Law's rule on falsity - that the defendant must bear the burden of proving truth must . . . fall here to a constitutional requirement that the plaintiff bear the burden of showing falsity, as well as fault'. India Abroad's publication related to a matter of public concern. The affidavits and documents revealed that the wire service report was related to an international scandal which touched leading participants in Indian politics and was reported in India, Sweden, the US, the UK and elsewhere. Placing the burden of proving truth on media defendants who published speech of public concern had been held unconstitutional because fear of liability might deter such speech. In Hepps, it was said that 'because such a 'chilling' effect would be antithetical to the First Amendment's protection of true speech on matters of public concern' a private figure plaintiff must show the speech was false before recovering against a media defendant. The 'chilling' effect was no different where liability resulted from enforcement of a foreign judgment obtained where the burden of proving truth was upon media defendants. Accordingly, Mr Bachchan's failure to prove falsity in the UK made his judgment unenforceable in the US. There was another reason why enforcement would violate the First Amendment. In the UK, a plaintiff was not required and did not meet the 'less forbidding' constitutional requirement that a private figure must show that a media defendant was at fault. New York's standard for liability in actions brought by private persons against the press was set forth in Chapadeau v Utice Observer-Dispatch 38 NY2d 196, 197 (1975). Where the content of the article was arguably of legitimate public concern reasonably related to matters warranting public exposition, the party defamed might recover. However he must establish 'that the publisher acted in a grossly irresponsible manner'. UK courts did not require a plaintiff to prove that a press defendant was at fault. Mr Bachchan certainly did not establish that India Abroad was 'grossly irresponsible'. The UK and the US shared many Common Law principles. Yet a big difference between the two jurisdictions lay in the UK's lack of an equivalent to the First Amendment. The protection of free speech and the press embodied in that amendment would be seriously jeopardised by entry of foreign libel judgments granted pursuant to standards deemed appropriate in the UK but considered antithetical to the protection afforded to the press by the US Constitution. The motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint was denied. For Mr Bachchan: Stephan Skoufalos (Chalos &amp; Brown, New York; Sarosh R Zaiwalla, London). For India Abroad: Laura R Handman (Lankenau Kovner &amp; Bickford, New York). Law reports now appear on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday</p>

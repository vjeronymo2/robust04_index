			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Private View: Sibyl of an age of anxiety Liz Greene, a Jungian psychotherapist, talks about the age of Aquarius She was poised, a beautiful sibyl, under her own painting of a church hewn from the rock in old Cappadocia. Her dark feline eyes were highlighted with ochre, and there were long scratches on her bare forearms. Two fluffy Burmese cats skidded about the floor. In the centre of the contemporary-elegant room stood a bust of the emperor Hadrian. Dionysiac masks grinned from the walls. Cretan snake-goddesses and steatopygous figurines adorned the mantelpiece; a three-eyed Mexican cat with human paws guarded the fireplace. We were in the house of Liz Greene, doctor of psychology, Jungian analyst and scholar of astrology. Dr Greene had been hesitant about this visit. Now she sat, quiet and composed, on the edge of the sofa, occasionally leaning forward to light another cigarette. I asked her: Is the world suffering from Pre-Millennial Tension? 'Yes, certainly. But I call it collective anxiety. There is certainly an enormous amount of it around.' What is the anxiety about? 'I think you can only partly explain it by millennial fantasies - we have very funny ideas about millennia. I think it is deeper than that. There are, it seems to me, very profound changes taking place in people's perception of reality.' World-views, she said, had a finite span. 'And the world-view which we have been relying on, the scientific world view, is showing serious signs of wear.' Why should we notice that? 'We still have a collective psyche. We are still plugged into, if you like, a unified life which I think all human beings share. There is something which connects us. It lies behind mass movements and the appearance, for example, of the same mythologies in different parts of the world.' Meanwhile, the 2,000-year-old moral fabric of Christianity was 'falling to bits'. Liz Greene speaks slowly and softly, like a sleepwalker, in a gentle American accent acquired from a childhood in New Jersey. She went to university in Boston and Los Angeles then, having an English father and feeling culturally European, moved to England 20 years ago. Was this pressure for change coming from humanity or from some cosmic or divine force? They could not be separated, she replied. Psychology might use neutral language 'but I don't see a lot of difference between what Jung called 'the collective unconscious' and what religion calls God.' Scientific knowledge prevented us from going back to the ancient world of myth. We had lost something en route. 'You see a tremendous reaching out for answers. People are desperate for something that will make the anxiety go away.' So they come to psychotherapists? 'They come to us, to astrologers, to priests, to fundamentalist religion, to political ideology - they come to isms.' Collective anxiety and cosmic pressure might just be inventions of the psychiatric industry, I said: if not Pre-Millennial Tension, then Post-Copernican Depression. 'That's an attitude one can take,' she said. 'I don't think it helps a lot. It's like blaming advertising for something becoming popular.' I had read a feminist theory that collective anxiety is a men's crisis. Was the gender war, if such it be, a symptom? Greene said she understood the idea but did not subscribe to it. 'I think it's a symptom of scapegoating, the most characteristic manifestation of anxiety.' She mentioned Germany and the Jews. 'It's particularly ugly but very human.' Talk of gender wars bred hatred and made the problem worse. I pointed to the pagan images around her room and asked if the occult played some part in her worldview. 'The objects are here because I like them. The images of ancient gods are symbols, not actualities and are imaged beautifully. That's why I collect them, not because they are altars at which I sacrifice black chickens.' She smiled suddenly, her mouth describing a great V. 'It has nothing to do with magic or witchcraft. I mean, astrology was never occult.' As everyone ought to know, our equinoctial point is shifting out of Pisces into Aquarius. The Age of Aquarius starts about now, give or take 50 to 70 years depending on which star you pick. Astrological shifts coincide with changes in religious beliefs, attitudes and values, Greene said. Aquarius, being a collective type of sign, is appropriate for conglomerate activity such as the European Union, multinational companies, even superstores. Are you saying there is a causal connection? 'No. I don't think that we are being made to do anything because it's the Age of Aquarius. There isn't an 'out there' and an 'in here'. They're part of the same thing. So planetary patterns do seem to synchronise with changes that take place in individuals and collectives.' She said there was a Uranus-Pluto conjunction, portending upheaval, in the 1960s. People may have been demonstrating in Paris, I objected, but what upheavals were there in Indonesia or among Eskimos? 'I am not a world historian. You would expect to find something happening but it would only happen within the structure that Indonesians or Eskimos built.' Orthodox scientists scream bloody murder about this kind of thing. 'That's their problem, not mine.' Now she actually laughed. Liz Greene can afford to laugh. Probably half the world, including Ronald Reagan, consults horoscopes. Nor are all modern scientists hostile. The French researcher Michel Gauquelin is reported to have found compelling statistical evidence of zodiacal congruity among individuals. Does it matter how it works? 'Of course I would like to know, but I'm not going to lose sleep over it.' Do you expect the link to be discovered one day? 'Yes, I think it will. But I suspect it's going to require an opening up of the scientific frame of reference for measurement.' Liz Greene sometimes uses astrology to help her identify the probable crisis points in her patients' lives. I asked if she was not worried she would impose her unorthodox beliefs on vulnerable clients. 'Of course I'm concerned with that. I think any intelligent therapist is.' That was why responsible analysts underwent analysis. It may be just another symptom of our anxious transition to Aquarius that psychotherapy has come in for a lot of stick. Therapists have been accused of feeding off their clients, encouraging selfishness, even breaking up families. I asked Liz Greene if she was aware of it. 'Well, I'm aware of Fay Weldon.' She laughed again. Weldon is bringing out a novel, Affliction, based on the story of her husband's defection to a female analyst. Greene was not sympathetic. 'He probably had a great many other reasons for going. I think he heard what he'd been waiting to hear.' Nor did people go to analysts casually, except perhaps in the Woody Allen world, she said. It was too expensive for that, both emotionally and financially. How far should one person poke inside the personality of another? 'As much as the person needs. But I think the psyche limits itself. I think we all have a kind of inner sanity which tells us when something is not functioning properly and when it's OK.' Is not introspection an unhealthy substitute for what used to be extrovert worship of some deity? 'I don't think it's a substitute and I certainly wouldn't call it unhealthy. But as we can no longer find God 'out there' it's not a bad idea to find something like it inside, to discover some kind of inner morality or integrity or ideal which is worth living for.' Beneath the inner distress, she said, was something 'more intelligent than the person is on the conscious level'. What we used to call 'the soul'? 'Yes, if you like.' Is psychotherapy a voyage of self-discovery for you as well? 'Certainly. I find people quite miraculous. My sense of - if you like - the 'soul' keeps getting reaffirmed every time I work with someone. You see something mysterious and remarkable coming alive in them.' Liz Greene studied stage and costume design but found the actors more interesting than the plays. She also suffered a crisis at university and problems with relationships. She would not tell me more. I asked for her star sign. It is Virgo. So your account of the world is one that suits your temperament? 'Of course it suits me or I wouldn't espouse it.' You don't claim any more for it than that? 'I could be wrong.' About the collective anxiety? 'I could be wrong about all of it. I can only tell you what I have observed. I draw the conclusions that fit my frame of reference. 'Whether it's absolute truth I haven't the foggiest idea. But it is a very rich and meaningful frame of reference, not only to me but has been for 4,000 years to minds far better equipped than mine. I'm in good company.'</p>

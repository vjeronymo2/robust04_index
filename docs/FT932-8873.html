			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Union members back ties to Labour MOST union members want to keep the link with the Labour party, a Mori poll of 2,000 members of four large unions suggests. Members of the TGWU, GMB, Nupe and Cohse were interviewed in April. The poll showed that three-quarters of them want their union to maintain its connections with Labour and to continue to sponsor MPs. The poll brought a sceptical reaction from senior Labour party figures, who suggested the unions had asked their members the wrong question. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said no one in his party was challenging its links with the unions. It was strange, he added, that the poll had not asked about support for the call by Mr John Smith for 'one member, one vote' arrangements in the selection of MPs and the party leader.</p>

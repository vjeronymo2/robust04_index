			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELLS FARGO IS FIRST TO ERASE BAD LDC LOANS;  </P> <P> WRITEOFFS, DISCOUNT SALES CLEAR BOOKS; COST IS HIGH  </P> <P> Wells Fargo &amp; Co. has become the first of the nation's major banks to  eliminate its troubled loans to less developed countries.  </P> <P> The San Francisco-based banking company's announcement came Tuesday in its  earnings report for the first quarter, which showed an 18% increase in profits  over the same period a year ago.  </P> <P> Four other big banks reported strong first-quarter profits Tuesday, with New  York-based Citicorp leading the way by posting a profit of $529 million, a gain  of 48% over a year ago.  </P> <P> In addition, New York's Bankers Trust said its profit for the quarter was up  30%, and two banks on the mend, Continental in Chicago and Mellon in  Pittsburgh, posted good performances.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo began whittling down its LDC loan exposure last year by a  combination of selling off loans at a discount and writing off others as  losses. The bank said Tuesday that it eliminated the last $245 million in  medium-term and long-term LDC debt during the first quarter.  </P> <P> The cost of selling loans and writing them off was high -- $196.5 million was  charged against loan-loss reserves in the first quarter. But the only loans to  developing countries now on the bank's books are short-term debt that is  considered much safer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focusing on State  </P> <P> While some other major banks, including Los Angeles-based Security Pacific and  First Interstate, have been paring down their LDC debt substantially, Wells  Fargo is the first to get rid of it altogether.  </P> <P> The move is an integral part of the effort at Wells Fargo to withdraw from the  international arena to concentrate on California. Because it will give the  company a cleaner balance sheet, it is also expected to make the its stock more  attractive to investors.  </P> <P> Wells, the nation's 10th-largest banking company, was able to improve its  profit for the quarter despite the big charge-offs for erasing the LDC loans.  </P> <P> A big jump in net interest income as a result of a higher net interest spread  -- the difference between rates on interest earned on loans and those on  interest paid on deposits -- helped Wells Fargo post a profit of $141.5 million  in the period. That compared to $120.4 million in the first quarter of 1988 and  to $136 million in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The bank's return on assets and return on equity, two key measures of  performance, also improved compared to the same quarter in 1988. The ROA rose  to 1.23% from 1.10% and ROE was up to 24.52% from 24.18% a year ago.  </P> <P> Elimination of the LDC loans enabled the bank to cut its total non-performing  loans substantially from a year ago despite an increase in troubled loans for  real estate construction.  </P> <P> The bank said real estate construction loans listed as 90 days or more past due  rose to $235 million in the first quarter from $91.7 million in the same  quarter of 1988 and $173.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Division Up Sharply  </P> <P> But Dan B. Williams, an industry analyst in the San Francisco office of Sutro  &amp; Co., a regional brokerage, said the percentage of non-performing loans in  the bank's total portfolio is "not enough to keep you awake at night."  </P> <P> Citicorp, the nation's biggest banking company, said the strong performance of  its individual bank division helped boost profits for the first quarter to $529  million, by far the highest among U.S. banks. The division, which includes the  company's consumer and credit card operations, posted a 28% increase in income.  </P> <P> Citicorp's earnings included a one-time gain of $77 million in the sale of its  building in Tokyo. The bank is moving its expanding Japanese operations to a  new center in 1992.  </P> <P> ROA at Citicorp was 1.01% for the quarter, up from 0.70% a year earlier, and  ROE rose to 24.2% from 22.75%.  </P> <P> Unlike Wells Fargo, however, Citicorp retains a heavy burden of LDC debt. The  bank said its outstanding loans to developing countries were $9.3 billion at  the end of the quarter, down from $9.5 billion at the end of the year.  </P> <P> Bankers Trust, the nation's ninth-largest banking company, said first-quarter  profit of $164.3 million was up primarily as a result of increased non-interest  revenue from its trading activities and fees from trust and custodial accounts.  </P> <P> The nation's 14th-largest banking company, Continental Bank, continued to show  a strong performance. Earnings for the quarter were a record $76 million, up  10% over the same period a year ago.  </P> <P> The bank, which has scaled down to concentrate on commercial banking, said  expenses for staff and other costs declined over the past 12 months, chiefly as  a result of the elimination of nearly 1,500 jobs.  </P> <P> At Mellon Bank, profit was $53 million for the quarter, compared to $25 million  in the first quarter of 1988 and $48 million in the last quarter of 1988. In  addition, the bank reported a one-time gain of $24 million from its capital  refinancing program.  </P> <P> Compared to the same quarter of last year, the 16th-largest bank reported  increases in net interest income and service fees and decreases in operating  expenses and provisions for loan losses.  </P></p>

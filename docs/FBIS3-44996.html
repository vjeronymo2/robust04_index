			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F> (6392 6647 1987)]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- During a recent  interview with XINHUA reporters, Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang  said: In 1994 the agricultural sector will deepen reform in an  effort to achieve the following four targets in developing the  rural economy: the stable growth of grain, cotton, and  oil-bearing crops; the sustained growth of vegetable products;  the fairly rapid improvement of efficiency in village and town  enterprises; and the sizable increase of farmers' per capita net  income.    Liu Jiang said: In 1993, which is about to end soon, China's  agriculture and rural economy have maintained their steady  development: there has been an overall increase in the output of  grain, meat, eggs, milk, and aquatic products; village and town  enterprises have been developing in a sustained, speedy, and  efficient manner; and farmers' per capita net income has  increased to a certain extent. He said that the all-round  development of agriculture and the rural economy has played a  positive role in ensuring the smooth progress of reform and  opening to the outside world as well as ensuring the sustained  growth of the national economy.    Liu Jiang pointed out: The new situation regarding the  reform and development of the national economy in 1994 requires  that agriculture plays a greater role. Therefore, while  focusing on the goal of stabilizing the supply of farm products  and increasing farmers' income, the agricultural sector should  strive to do the following three tasks well:    First, it is necessary to stabilize the development of the  output of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. On the  prerequisite of basically stabilizing the sown acreage of grain,  it is necessary to boost per unit area yield by relying on  science and technology, continue optimizing the product mix, and  improve the quality of grain; at the same time, every means  should be taken to reverse the situation regarding the decline  of cotton output in the past two years by restoring the planting  acreage, ensuring rational geographical distribution, improving  methods of controlling plant diseases and insect pests, in order  to raise total grain output to the level of a normal year.    Second, it is necessary to raise the "shopping basket  program" to a new level by vigorously developing animal  husbandry, aquatic production, and vegetable production so as to  supply more and better nonstaple food to the urban and rural  population.    Third, it is necessary to focus on economic results in  developing village and town enterprises.    Liu Jiang said: To meet the need of establishing and  developing a socialist market economy in rural areas, the  Ministry of Agriculture has decided to vigorously strengthen the  construction of an information network to store information  about policies, laws, and regulations about capital construction  projects, science and technology, and qualified professionals.  Through this network and the storing of information about the  four aspects, the Ministry of Agriculture will be in a better  position to exercise overall control over the country's  agriculture.</p>

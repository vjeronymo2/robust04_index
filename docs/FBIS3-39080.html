Despite this calm assurance,  European experts in Brussels do not hide the fact that they will  be following these talks with the greatest attention.    "So far, Tokyo has categorically refused to commit itself to  actual import figures, but you never know what might happen. We  could be forced to totally revise our approach," commented a  close collaborator of European Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan.    Sir Leon's staff explain that the Community, like the United  States, intends to create a bigger opening in the Japanese  market, but that it is totally opposed to the method chosen by  Washington. "There is no question of negotiating import figures.  On this point, we side fully with Japan."    This is a position of principle that barely conceals the  bitterness of certain officials in the face of the EC's  powerlessness to impose the same concessions on Tokyo as the  United States has done. This irritation is exacerbated by the  fact that the concessions demanded by Washington are, generally  speaking, "seriously discriminatory to European exports."    "Take the example of semiconductors," stressed the expert.  "The Japanese made assurances that the 20 percent of their  market offered to imports was open to all countries, while  everyone knew that a secret clause reserved this 20 percent for  the United States."    "Do not be impressed by the American song and dance,"  insists  another expert nevertheless. "We continued to reduce our trade  deficit with Japan last year."    In other words, unless the "Clinton method" leads to a  genuine success this weekend, Brussels should continue its  strategy: Examine all the obstacles -- with Tokyo and on a  sector by sector basis -- facing EC exporters and the ways of  surmounting them. "Seven working meetings have already been  held since January 1993, and we hope," stressed this expert, "to  be able to report concrete results at the next interministerial  meeting in late April."</p>

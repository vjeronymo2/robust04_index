			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Fuel to power the future: South-east Asian countries are increasingly turning to nuclear energy Power cuts are the bane of industrialists in south-east Asia from Manila to Johor, but visiting executives from companies such as France's Framatome, Germany's Siemens and Atomic Energy of Canada can be forgiven for smiling when the lights go out. South-east Asia's fast-growing economies are increasingly looking to nuclear power to meet growing demand for electricity, a trend that offers attractive opportunities to suppliers of western nuclear technology and equipment while arousing concern among environmentalists. Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines have all announced recently that they are contemplating the development of nuclear power stations, and the idea has also been discussed in Malaysia. Their more advanced east Asian neighbours - Japan, Taiwan and South Korea - already have nuclear power programmes, as does China. 'The Asia-Pacific region has by far the greatest market potential in the next decade,' said Mr Woodrow Williams, manager of advanced reactor commercial programmes for GE Nuclear Energy, part of the US power engineering group, speaking at an FT power conference in Singapore recently. 'We are talking in terms of Dollars 160bn over the next 15 years.' Taiwan and South Korea are already established markets for nuclear suppliers, but it may take time and effort to convince other south-east Asian countries that nuclear energy is cheap enough and safe enough to be worth pursuing. 'Can the Thai public be sure that a nuclear power plant built and operated in Thailand will be well managed and attain the safety standard as in France?' asked Mr Pisit Pakkasem, secretary-general of Thailand's National Economic and Social Development Board, a state think-tank, in a speech to Canadian businessmen. Thailand is unusual in south-east Asia in that its electricity generating authority has invested enough in conventional power plants to be able to meet the demand for electricity so far, although that demand has almost doubled in the past five years. Thai officials, however, feel they are reaching the limits of what they can do with non-nuclear power. They believe electricity demand will increase by 10-15 per cent annually in the next decade, equivalent to about 1,000MW a year. Thailand is therefore planning to build six nuclear power plants with a total capacity of some 6,000MW; final approval to go ahead will be needed by 1997 if the first two units are to be commissioned on schedule in 2006. The authorities acknowledge that public concerns about the risks of nuclear power, the problems of waste disposal and the potentially high capital costs will have to be allayed before a final decision is made. Thai officials have suggested that countries supplying radioactive material to Thailand may have to take back the spent fuel because the country lacks storage facilities. 'We can't hide it in the klong (canal),' said Mr Pisit. Some Thai and foreign conservationists doubt that a bureaucracy incapable of enforcing basic environmental and safety regulations will be able to establish a viable supervisory authority for a nuclear power industry, or make it cost-effective. 'Cost will be the big problem,' said one foreign energy expert. Thailand's vocal but ineffective environmental groups recommend gas-fired power stations or lignite plants fitted with emission treatment systems. They say Thailand could shave at least 3,000MW from future demand by promoting energy efficiency. Mr Witoon Permpongsacharoen, director of the Project for Ecological Recovery, a lobby group, says government forecasts of a 10-15 per cent rise in electricity demand over the next few years are too high. Fewer qualms about public opinion or safety issues appear to be found in Indonesia, a less open society than Thailand, which has gone further down the road to nuclear power. President Suharto backs nuclear energy and has played down the possibility of an accident: 'With careful planning we should not have to worry too much about such a risk.' A 1,200MW nuclear power complex costing an estimated Dollars 2.4bn is expected to be built at Muria in central Java by 2005. This will be followed by the gradual installation of a further 5,800MW of nuclear capacity, despite a complaint from Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, that Java's record of seismic activity meant that the country 'could be heading for another Chernobyl'. In Malaysia, the atomic energy debate is at an early stage. Last year Mr S Samy Vellu, the minister responsible for energy, announced that the country would opt for nuclear power generation and that the first power station would be on stream within a decade. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, subsequently contradicted this and put a stop to any nuclear plans for the time being, saying there was no need for nuclear energy because the country had plenty of gas, oil, coal and hydro-electricity. If anything should discourage south-east Asians from investing in nuclear power it is the experience of the Philippines. Construction by Westinghouse, the US power engineering group, of a 620MW, Dollars 2.1bn plant at Bataan began in 1976. But it was mothballed on completion 10 years later because the government alleged that Westinghouse and Burns &amp; Roe, the engineering consultants, had bribed Ferdinand Marcos, the late dictator, to win the contract. There were also reports that the plant had been built on an earthquake-prone fault line. A Philippine inquiry last year concluded that the plant did not lie on a geological fault, and this year the Philippines lost its US court case against the American companies, which were found not to have bribed Marcos. Manila has spent millions of dollars on the case and continues to spend millions on interest payments for the plant, which lies idle while the main island of Luzon is subjected to black-outs up to 10 hours long. Officials say a further Dollars 400m will have to be spent over 30 months to upgrade the plant to 1992 safety standards, only slightly less than the cost of a new conventional power station of similar capacity. The Philippine government seems undeterred by this financial disaster. Last week President Fidel Ramos ordered his government to prepare a nuclear power plan by November. Mr Pablo Malixi, the former chief of the National Power Corporation, the state-owned utility, said he doubted if either the Indonesians or the Thais would backtrack on their commitment to nuclear energy. 'It's going to be the fuel of the future,' he said.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Armed Truce Within PDS"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- It was a heavy blow that was delivered, and  the reaction -- probably -- was the expected one. And so, on  the day of the interview by means of which [Democratic Party of  the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto suddenly jumped into  the race to the PDS secretariat, it was above all the majority  of the leadership's silence which betrayed the sort of  impression produced at the Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] by  the secretary's move, by the peremptory way in which the man who  ferried the party [from communism to social democratic values]  staked out the field for a confrontation which is bound to flare  up again after the European elections. However, the silence  hardly concealed the concern felt at the tense atmosphere within  the PDS -- an armed truce inviting many to postpone any further  comment, thus adopting, basically, an attitude which [PDS  official] Gavino Angius summarized on everyone's behalf in the  following terms: "I would rather not say anything for the  moment."    [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni kept rigorously silent,  taking up the position of a spectator, and so did [PDS Deputy  Leader] Massimo D'Alema, the main addressee -- according to the  unanimous interpretation at Montecitorio [Parliament] -- of the  messages from a secretary who flatly rejected the idea of  "transition" being round the corner, and who was prepared to  throw down the gauntlet of a congress with opposing motions, in  the event that the request for a change of the guard at the  Botteghe Oscure were motivated by policy considerations.    Inevitably, within the next few days problems will arise in  connection with the debate on the reshuffle of the secretariat,  as already apparent from a number of venomous remarks, bordering  on bad taste, which were leaked here and there. However,  nothing was known -- everybody agreed -- about the role that  Occhetto intended to assign to the "member for Gallipoli  [D'Alema]," although the latter's return to the party leadership  was a foregone conclusion. For his part, D'Alema was watching  developments like a bystander, saying only that he had started  working on an article for L'UNITA, in which he will summarize  his political platform "in a more structured way," and without  attempting to cash in on the success of an operation which bears  his distinctive signature (on the same day that Occhetto  welcomed the entire Socialist contingent into the progressive  group in the Chamber of Deputies, and Francesco De Martino was  elected as the progressive senators' "guarantor" in the upper  house).    It was [PDS official] Fabio Mussi who stressed that "what  should have been done immediately is now being done belatedly,"  explaining that unity was the prerequisite for the progressives  "to be able to carry some weight in this period, which is still  transitional in nature, and in which the Right's victory has not  closed the game."    However, the progressive deputy floor leader did not refrain  from commenting on Occhetto's interview: "As regards the  method," he said, "Occhetto, quite rightly, is not ruling out  any solutions. As regards the substance, clearly we find what  may be called a strong vindication of his own merits. In short,  the pot is boiling, albeit still slowly, and we will have to  wait and see what comes out of it. The main point is that the  leadership issue has finally been raised, which is as things  should be -- provided that this does not interfere with the need  to resume the debate on political issues, to replenish our fuel  tanks: Otherwise we will end up with a referendum, and we run  the risk of a debacle. Instead, we must go back to the climate  of the transition, when political choices and men were closely  linked."    Mussi's concerns are shared by the party's most significant  local leaders, regardless of their position in relation to the  fixed stars in the Botteghe Oschure's firmament. However, from  Sergio Sabattini's words, Occhetto obtained confirmation that  the Emilia PDS's "armored tanks" were siding with him: "I  believe the interview in L'UNITA signals a turn for the better,"  said the secretary from Bologna. "Honestly speaking, this year I  did not see any disagreements emerge within the majority that  led the party. Am I wrong? Are there any? If there are, it  will be a good thing if they are expressed, if majorities and  minorities are formed at the congress, and if a leadership is  defined on this basis. Otherwise it makes no sense to speak of  renewal: Occhetto may not be a secretary for life, but the task  of guiding the completion of the PDS's formation, and of opening  up a stage of broader alliance, falls to him." Sabattini, one  of the staunchest advocates of a "federal party," had a further  message for the Botteghe Oscure: "They must realize in Rome,"  he stressed, "that organizations with a strong membership and  strong support from the voters, such as the Emilia PDS, are no  longer prepared to passively accept choices that do not involve  the real party. Occhetto is accused of being a centralist? All  right then, the answer to that, if we want to prepare for the  congress, is for at least three regional secretaries to join the  new Secretariat, and of course I have in mind those from Emilia,  Tuscany, and one of the southern regions in which we won. If we  carry on along the old path, I believe a very firm reaction can  be expected from the stronger organizations."</p>

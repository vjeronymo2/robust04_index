Speaking beneath a PLO and a  British flag, the British secretary said that the meeting was  good and that in it, the parties discussed the future of the  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.    Speaking at the conclusion of the meeting, Dr. Hanan  'Ashrawi  said: Britain plays an important role in the negotiating  relations between Israel and the PLO. Asked about progress in  the negotiations, 'Ashrawi said: Well, goodwill alone is not  sufficient for the continuation of the Israeli-PLO negotiations.  We need very serious, concrete, and constructive action in  order to make progress. [end recording]</p>

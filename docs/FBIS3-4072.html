			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Yueh-ying (0491 4727 3841): "Dai </F> Xianglong, Vice Governor of People's Bank of China, Speaks on  the Four Conditions Needed for Foreign Banks To Expand Business  in China"]    [Text] The Chinese Government once said that when the  economy inside the country develops to a certain level, foreign  banks can come to China in large numbers to set up branches.  What is the current situation?    According to Dai Xianglong, vice governor of the People's  Bank of China, China has a positive attitude toward foreign  financial organizations which want to come to China to develop  business, but because it involves the problem of changing  China's financial system, many areas have to be considered and  looked at carefully.    Regarding the question of whether foreign banks can also  engage in renminbi business in China, Dai Xianglong frankly  pointed out that the branches of foreign banks in China are  mainly operating foreign exchange business, and that there are  quite a number of them who have also wanted to operate renminbi  business, but here several conditions have to be considered:    First, the management standard of mainland banks must go  through a process of improvement and internationalization, and  speaking in terms of the current conditions, the commercial  banks inside the country do not have the ability to compete with  the commercial banks from outside the country. Second, the main  objects of service of the Bank of China are the enterprises  which cannot operate completely on their own; when the state  bank can rid itself of this burden and can release loans at its  own discretion, it can then compete with foreign banks. Third,  the tax rate among Chinese banks is different from the tax rate  among the branches of foreign banks in China, and he said that  after these three problems are solved, foreign banks can start  operating renminbi business. "But we have already tried it out  in Xiamen and some other areas, and we may expand the project in  the future."    In addition, what must be stressed is that when foreign  banks  come to China to set up financial organizations, the main  purpose is to arouse interest among investors in their own  countries for investment in China, and not to completely rely on  the operation of renminbi business in China to earn foreign  exchange.    Talking about the intention of Taiwan's financial  organizations to come to the mainland, Dai Xianglong said that  in this area, Taiwan funds are somewhat the same as foreign  funds, and the mainland will still handle Taiwan funds in the  same way it handles foreign funds. However, a more lenient  attitude can apply to certain areas; for example, when a foreign  bank wants to set up a branch in China, it should have 20  billion [no currency as published] in capital and it will take  three years for it to set up a representative office. When  Taiwan's financial organizations come to China to do business,  these rules can be lifted appropriately. He disclosed that, at  present, 14 nongovernmental commercial banks in Taiwan have  expressed an interest in setting up offices on the mainland.</p>

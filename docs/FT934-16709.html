			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Business fears for Bermuda's future dominate election BERMUDA goes to the polls today amid claims that an opposition Progressive Labour Party victory might undermine the growth of the island's offshore financial centre. The moderate PLP, which derives most of its support from Bermuda's 60 per cent majority black population, needs to capture six more seats in the 40-seat legislature to form its first government. The PLP insists that it wants to keep and develop the UK dependent territory's offshore insurance and investment businesses. In the past 12 months some Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) has been pumped into new Bermudian reinsurance companies by international investors. Mr Frederick Wade, the PLP leader, says: 'No government would last a week if they tried to mess around with the industry.' The party simply wants to implement more effectively an existing government policy giving Bermudians first choice for jobs when they have the necessary qualifications and experience, he says. The PLP wants to create a new ministry to 'troubleshoot' on behalf of international companies. But business leaders, who almost unanimously support the ruling United Bermuda party, are concerned about the PLP's ability to manage an economy now equally dependent on the earnings and jobs generated by tourism and offshore finance. Mr Jeffrey Conyers, who heads First Bermuda Securities, a local securities firm, says: 'Whether it is justified or not, people have jitters.' Offshore reinsurers are attracted by the Atlantic island's record as a light but reputable regulator, and the absence of taxes on income and profits. However, other offshore centres, such as the Cayman Islands, offer similar advantages. Mr David Saul, the finance minister and head of the local subsidiary of Fidelity, the US fund and investment management group, plays up the significance of former links between the PLP leaders and Sir Lynden Pindling, the former prime minister of the Bahamas. Sir Lynden's aggressive economic policies led to a rapid contraction in his country's offshore financial sector in the late 1960s. However, Bermuda's recent difficulties have much to do with external factors. Depressed tourist numbers are expected to bounce back this year, and GDP to grow modestly. Politicians of all parties agree that Bermudians - who have one of the highest rates of GDP per capita in the world at more than Dollars 25,000 - usually vote with their wallets.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN FRONT OF THE LINE IS BACK OF THE BUS;  </P> <P> RACISM: A MAN HAILING A CAB AT LA GUARDIA MIGHT BE A STAR, A HERO, EVEN THE  NEXT MAYOR -- BUT IF HE'S BLACK, HE'LL WALK.  </P> <P> "Sir!" the black man running the cab stand was saying.  </P> <P> "Sir!" he repeated, finally catching my eye. "Would you mind standing up here  for a minute?"  </P> <P> Instantly, I knew exactly what he was talking about. I knew the problem. I also  knew the trick the big, open-faced fellow had in mind.  </P> <P> The scene: New York's La Guardia Airport. The time: a few minutes before 10  p.m. New Year's Eve. Like the other passengers just off the Trump Shuttle from  Washington, I had been waiting in the cab line without success. Cab after cab  would make the turn from the expressway, drive slowly past our cab stand, then  swerve away.  </P> <P> I could see exactly what was happening. The cab drivers, one after another,  were taking one look at the faces of those just-arrived passengers at the Trump  Shuttle cab line, then speeding up and heading over to the better pickings at  the Delta terminal.  </P> <P> Why? Most of the passengers waiting in the Trump Shuttle line were black.  </P> <P> I knew this. So did the frustrated guy running the cab stand. I could see it in  his look when our eyes connected after the 20th or 30th cab had chosen Delta  over Trump for his choice of fare. He knew what was happening all right. This  is what went on night after night. Why should it be any different because a  white man was standing four or five places back in line?  </P> <P> I had almost had enough of this little vignette in American race relations  circa 1990. After waiting a good 20 minutes, I prepared myself to just bolt the  hapless Trump line and make the couple-hundred-yard walk to the Delta terminal.  What was I supposed to do? I was already late. Was I supposed to stand here all  night just to prove I'm willing to play and suffer by the same rules that  punish black people?  </P> <P> But something stopped me. Maybe I'd have been marooned there all night, but I  also couldn't bring myself to just zip over to the Delta terminal. I kept  flashing on the looks and feelings that would be exchanged by those left  behind, those watching a white man striding off to his accustomed better  treatment.  </P> <P> "Would you mind standing up here?"  </P> <P> Grabbing my bags, I headed to the front of the line. "I thought that's what was  going on," I said to the man running the stand.  </P> <P> Then it happened. The very next cab swerved to the left, rejecting the Delta  terminal and making the wide turn toward those of us who had been waiting  without hope.  </P> <P> I stepped back and let the group of young black men ahead of me board.  </P> <P> "Thanks," said the man at the stand.  </P> <P> A few days before this, a man named Colin Powell, who happens to be chairman of  the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was cheered as the liberator of Panama. A few  hours later, an easy-going politician named David Dinkins took the oath as  mayor of New York. The following evening, a wonderful quarterback named Tony  Rice led the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame to its big Orange Bowl victory over  Colorado.  </P> <P> Had they been waiting for a cab at La Guardia Airport New Year's Eve, they  might still be standing there.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SATURDAY NIGHT SECRET  </P> <P> Regarding Lawrence Christon's article "Live from New York" (Sept. 17), I am  shocked that he neglected to mention one of the most extraordinarily accurate  satirists of the last 15 years: Christopher Guest. Not only was he arguably the  main component of the National Lampoon Radio Hour, but for two seasons he  astonished us with his comedic flexibility, musical prowess and character  subtlety.  </P> <P> TONY FORKUSH  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE GUARD PLANS TRANSFER TO LSU  </P> <P> Justin Anderson, a 6-foot-5 junior guard from UC Irvine, has asked for and been  given his release from the school.  </P> <P> Anderson, who averaged 8.1 points and started 13 games for the Anteaters last  season, told Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan he plans to transfer to Louisiana  State.  </P> <P> Dale Brown, LSU coach, recruited Anderson when the guard was at Valley City  High School in North Dakota. As a senior, Anderson averaged 22 points and 10  rebounds and was named the state's player of the year. Brown and Anderson's  father, Darrell, played one season together at Minot State.  </P> <P> "I'm really happy for him," Mulligan said. "I was surprised. I thought he was  more into academics than basketball."  </P> <P> Anderson, an engineering and psychology major, will redshirt the 1990-91 season  and have one year of eligibility remaining at LSU.  </P> <P> Last season at Irvine, Anderson's playing time decreased as freshman Dylan  Rigdon emerged as the Anteaters's top outside shooter.

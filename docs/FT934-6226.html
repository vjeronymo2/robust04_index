			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Court rebukes big retailers The European Court of Justice has issued a stern warning that it is fed up with examining complaints from big retailers against national restrictions which have no effect on cross-border trade. The ruling comes in the wake of a series of cases brought against national laws which prohibit Sunday trading. Court officials said the European judges wanted to deter retailers from making similar challenges in the future unless they can prove that national rules are discriminatory and a hindrance to the free movement of goods - one of the central planks of the single European market. 'There's an increasing number of these cases and I think their lordships are thoroughly fed up with them,' said one court official yesterday. The warning comes in the form of a judgment yesterday on a test case brought by two French supermarket chains against national laws which prevent retailers from selling everyday products at a loss to bring customers into their stores. The European Court ruled that the national legislation restricting use of 'loss leaders' was compatible with European law. The judgment means two managers from the big French supermarket chains Cora and Coop could be prosecuted for flouting the rules. The last British case of this sort to be judged by the Luxembourg-based court was in December 1992, when the court decided that rules restricting Sunday trading in England and Wales were not contrary to European law.</p>

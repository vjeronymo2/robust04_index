			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Democrats Separate Themselves From </F> Liberals"]    [Text] On Saturday in the House of Culture of Medical  Workers there was a conference of the Equal Rights and Legality  [RiZ] voter bloc.    As became clear from the discussion, in 20 of the republic's  rayons the bloc's activists had not yet submitted registration  documents to rayon executive organs. In seven of them the  documents have been submitted and the organizations have been  registered.    RiZ has postponed the question of compiling a consolidated  list for the forthcoming elections to representative organs of  power of the Republic of Tatarstan until the lists of candidate  deputies in political organizations are coordinated.    The greatest amount of discussion was evoked by the second  question on the agenda, which was raised by republic People's  Deputy Z. Latypov--on the RiZ voter bloc subscribing to the  Agreement on Accord signed on 28 April in Moscow.    Opinions differed sharply. The bloc's leader, State Duma  Deputy I. Grachev, stated that because of his participation in  the Yabloko faction he could not support Z. Latypov's  initiative. But he feels all right about the signing. In the  voting, I. Grachev and also RiZ acting chairman, I. Sultanov,  and the leader of the city party organization created on the  basis of Russia's Choice, D. Galyautdinov, abstained.    As usual, the discussion and the outcome of the voting led  the disputing parties to personal accusations.    And although in the corridors things did not reach the point  of "physical disagreement," during the recess certain hotheads  lapsed into unprintable language. In our opinion, the  ideological separation of liberals and democrats within the RiZ  bloc is proceeding painfully but predictably.    The position against signing the still unstudied text of the  agreement was argued most consistently by the chairman of the  Tatar division of the SDPR [Social Democratic Party of Russia],  Deputy Chairman of Vakhitovskiy Rayon Soviet Yu. Rostovshikov,  and the leader of the local organization of the DPR [Democratic  Party of Russia], I. Konov?    In the end 11 members of the council of the RiZ bloc voted  in  favor of joining the Agreement on Accord. They were one vote  short of having enough to adopt a decision.</p>

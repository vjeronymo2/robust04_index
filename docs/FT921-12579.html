			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Ivory towers come under siege: The antipathy between the business world and universities THE PROFESSOR at a large and prestigious business school in a North American university set his class a question and gave it a list of articles to consult for the answer. When the the students went to the reference library, they found someone had got there first and removed all of them with a razor. They complained to the professor. Instead of deploring what had been done, he commended it because, he said, it showed the sort of initiative needed in the business world. That true story dramatises a feeling shared by many academics in Britain: that universities and commerce are not good partners. To which the men of commerce reply: 'Those damned dons . . .' The damned dons doubtless include some who are in academia because they are too feeble to do anything else; but an intrinsic fear of change does not account wholly for their objections either towards business studies as a subject or else running universities like businesses. There is a widespread feeling that it is not the business of universities to teach business; that as soon as you start putting university education onto a utilitarian basis, its nature is perverted. This is an odd argument: the instruction of doctors and lawyers was one of the first purposes of our universities. When initial moves were made in Cambridge to expand courses in management studies, one hostile professor declared to the Senate that 'British management' was as much of a joke as British weather or British Rail. He said he saw plenty of British university lecturers being lured to work in the US - but no British managers. The answer to this sort of hostility is simple. If Britain wants better managers, it ought to take their education seriously and accept the study of management as an intellectual discipline in its own right. Further donnish dismay is caused, I think, by an association between businessmen and philistines. Again, this depends on ignoring commerce as a traditional buttress of higher education. The last Cambridge college to be founded was Robinson: it was made possible by the success of Radio Rentals. The Cambridge Department of Archaeology is thriving not because of its student numbers but because the late Daniel McDonald, an engineer obsessed by the earliest developments in human technology, endowed it with Pounds 10m. The residual worry to university teachers, though, is whether a business-like attitude towards higher education might mean that in 20 years' time the study of, say. Egyptology would be impossible. And this is the crux of the present debate. To those involved in it, the situation has become an issue of two cultures: the pure and the applied (or, the pure and the businesslike). This dichotomy quite supplants the old two cultures of CP Snow, for the division between pure and applied affects the sciences as much as it affects the humanities. To the world of commerce, a degree in pure mathematics is as useless as a degree in Egyptology. No accountant need be vexed by the concept of an infinitesimal number; if, in the future, mathematics departments are to depend upon accountancy firms for their funding, then the fear is that applied mathematics will bully pure mathematics out of existence. Snow's two cultures always struck me as a trumped-up thing. It must have been plain to everyone 30 years ago that the divisions within most university English literature departments ran much deeper than any divisions between the 'humanities' and the 'sciences.' And Snow's notion that novelists and arty types have behaved generically like Luddites towards industrial progress now looks outmoded. My revised two cultures' divide works much better. Its obvious features were satirised neatly in David Lodge's Nice Work: pin-stripes v. corduroys, and so on. Poles of opposition are easy to identify, especially using the measure of remuneration. For instance, external examiners - that is, staff from one university who monitor the examinations of another - have been told recently by the new Academic Audit Unit to think of themselves as management consultants. Fair enough: external examiners perform the task of consultants, reporting on efficiency of teaching, progress of students, success of new courses, and so on. But they do so at a rate of something under Pounds 5 an hour. Who has the right to judge their performance by commercial standards so long as they work from vocational motives? It sounds sanctimonious, but it is true: university teachers do not generally work for the money. So, one can understand the sentiment that when professors begin to be paid like company directors, then university departments can be subjected to the same sort of auditing procedures as a commercial concern. Resentment against the managerial annexation of the universities ought to be tempered by optimism: after all, it should suit most dons to be paid at commercial levels. But while businessmen may feel frustrated at the way in which the idea of a liberal university education - stated classically last century by the theologian JH Newman - still dominates British academia, they must recognise a genuine concern for intellectual standards there. Imagine that a firm producing canned beans pours money into a nutrition research unit. Would anyone be surprised if it published a report telling us that a can of beans a day was the only way to avoid heart disease? The patronage of university research by private companies always will be prone to this sort of abuse. There are, however, signs that men of commerce are coming to terms with a fact that redeems the whole notion of an ivory tower. The pure and the applied constitute, in common parlance, the ivory tower and the real world; what happens in the tower is supposed, commonly, not to integrate with what goes on outside. The history of the advancement of scientific knowledge reveals that supposition as foolish. So it is that many of the most commercially-successful advances in chemistry came not from directed, applied or 'strategic' inquiries but from what scientists call 'blue skies' research (or, put another way, the notion that what drops out of the blue skies might be worthless - or worth a fortune). One example. Herchel Smith was a lecturer in organic chemistry at Manchester when he and a colleague, experimenting on methods of synthesising steroids, came across something which became the contraceptive pill. A patent was secured and neither chemist need ever have done another day's work in his life. But Smith has used his fortune to endow a set of professorial chairs in Britain; and, with his experience of patenting, he has promoted study of the law of intellectual property. Every company worth the faith of its shareholders ought to be trying to get its hands on a stake in that commodity: intellectual property. It is something which, on the whole, is appreciated better in Germany and the US, but some sectors of British business are well aware of it. According to a recent survey* of research and development spending, companies such as ICI, Shell, Unilever and Glaxo are most generous. Nuances of emphasis in spending vary; but Michael Elves, director of external scientific affairs at Glaxo, says spending is by no means confined to the sort of directed research which guarantees a quick return. Glaxo supports contractual research for the sake of convenience - when it is easier to have a particular task assigned to a university laboratory - and provides for a number of studentships and fellowships aimed at producing graduates who will be useful to the company. But it also has endowed several professorial chairs at British universities which are intended solely to further basic scientific understanding. Of course, such research ultimately might be very much in Glaxo's interest. But the Glaxo philosophy is based on an understanding that the future targets of the company - say, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, parasitic diseases, Alzheimer's - are difficult and distant. Short-term applied research is myopic; to see far enough takes time, unrestricted time, in the ivory tower. So where, you might ask, does this leave our budding Egyptologists? They might take comfort from the American paradigm: specialised subjects within the humanities survive healthily, for the very good reason that they are fascinating areas of study to some people. If you find a subject fascinating, you tend to do well in it; and a first-class degree in Egyptology is, ultimately, worth more than a third-class degree in economics. As Newman pointed out: The 'opposite of a liberal education is a servile education: the education of slaves, not thinking individuals.' In the tradition of a liberal education, it is as valuable to support Ventriss and Chadwick working towards deciphering Mycenaean Linear B as it is to support Crick and Watson on their course to DNA. To quote GM Trevelyan, the historian: 'Disinterested intellectual curiosity is the life-blood of civilisation.' Trevelyan's words might well have been used by Enoch Powell, the classicist and former politician, as the epigraph of his recent document** deploring the present government policy of losing the distinction between universities and polytechnics. He declares: 'If thought and study had been restricted to whatever held out the prospect of material advantage, that explosive coruscation of human achievement which is European civilisation would never have occurred.' As a former professor of Greek, Powell will know all about Archimedes who is said to have disdained to write any textbooks on the applications of his discoveries, preferring to work upon 'speculations whose beauty and subtlety were untainted by the claims of necessity.' That university dons are difficult to deal with must be due partly to this Archimedean kind of high-mindedness - a refusal to meet the humdrum world on its own terms. The irony however, is that the inventions of Archimedes proved useful, within his own lifetime and with his own sanction. Despite themselves, the two cultures of pure and applied can never stay apart for long. *The Business Contribution to Higher Education: Council for Industry and Higher Education, Summer 1991. **Enoch Powell, Of Universities and Polytechnics, Centre for Policy Studies, Sept. 1991.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (6): Instability holds back the markets  -Patrick McCurry on the progress of Latin America's financial capital While decades of high inflation have turned Brazilians into some of the world's most creative financial managers, this instability has also held back the development of the capital markets and its principal financial centre, Sao Paulo. But things are changing. A more open economy, increasing foreign portfolio investment and the prospect of an end to high inflation could turn Sao Paulo into Latin America's chief financial capital. During the last decade Sao Paulo has consolidated its position as the heart of Brazil's financial system. Its stock market has a capitalisation of over Dollars 130bn, making it the biggest in South America. It has the developing world's largest futures market and is home to most of the national and international banks based in Brazil. Already this year many foreign investment banks and funds have opened offices in Sao Paulo, betting on an explosion in business as Brazil's big companies, most of which are based in the state, seek to finance expansion. 'Except for a handful of Brazilian banks still in Rio de Janeiro, all the big players have moved to Sao Paulo,' says Mr Jose Monforte, Citibank's director of capital markets in Brazil. This move began in the 1970s when Rio de Janeiro began to lose its position as the dominant financial centre. Sao Paulo's industrial strength, combined with aggressive targeting of new companies coming to market by the Sao Paulo stock exchange (Bovespa) were the main reasons for the change. Today, the Bovespa represents 90 per cent of the trading volume of Brazil's nine exchanges. It is hoping that, with stabilisation, it will recover its position as Latin America's biggest stock market from Mexico City. However, the Bovespa is a highly volatile market, lacking liquidity. Trading is concentrated in only a few shares and one company, the government-controlled telecom giant Telebras, accounts for about half the trading volume. Mr Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, Bovespa chairman, admits: 'We have an underdeveloped market.' Largely due to Brazil's economic problems, such as inflation of 2,500 per cent last year, there has been a fall in the number of listed companies and few capital issues in recent years. But a more stable economy combined with rising share values should increase the attraction of the stock market for firms seeking investment capital, Mr Vidigal believes. The concentration of trading in a handful of shares has been partly responsible for the volatility, according to Mr Julius Buchenrode, director of investments at Chase Manhattan in Sao Paulo. Investors have generally done well in the 1990s. The main Bovespa index more than doubled last year after falling slightly in 1992. The bullish trend looks likely to continue if the markets' preferred candidate, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, wins presidential elections this year. Much of the index appreciation has been due to the opening of the market to foreign institutional investors in 1991. They now account for about 20 per cent of average daily trading volume, which has soared from Dollars 34m in 1991 to Dollars 278m in the first half of this year and approached Dollars 500m in August. According to Mr Vidigal, volume could reach Dollars 700m to Dollars 800m if economic reforms continue. While equities have grown in importance due to foreign investment, Sao Paulo's local bond market has mostly stagnated. Brazil's problems have made raising capital through local debt issues extremely expensive for companies, which must pay interest rates of 25-30 per cent in real terms. Analysts say this market is likely to remain undeveloped in the short term as companies seek finance through equity issues. Stabilisation reforms could also boost Sao Paulo's futures and commodities exchange, which has grown to become the fifth largest in the world with a daily average of 350,000 contracts, although this growth is partly due to Brazil's economic instability. 'The market's growth is obviously related to companies trying to protect themselves against Brazil's inflation,' says Mr Marcos Eugenio da Silva, a University of Sao Paulo economist, referring to the fact that 60 per cent of the exchange's volume is in one-day interest rate futures. But a more stable economy with sustained growth would increase the exchange's business and lead to a lengthening of contract terms, he says. Mr Manoel Pires da Costa, the exchange chairman, says future development will depend on the ending of government restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, which make it difficult to increase links with foreign futures exchanges. As Brazil is one of the world's biggest exporters of coffee, soya and orange juice, Mr da Costa believes there is potential for attracting some of the trading in agricultural futures from exchanges in Chicago. But, according to Mr da Silva, such integration is 'wishful thinking' as it presupposes a stable and convertible currency, something Brazil still lacks. A traditionally weak currency has, however, allowed Brazil's commercial banks to make large profits. With inflation eroding the daily value of Brazil's currency, banks have been able to invest their clients' money that is held in current accounts, or the values of cheques being cleared, in the high-yielding money markets. Sao Paulo dominates the country's banking system. Twelve of the top 15 private sector banks, measured in terms of deposits, have their head offices there and the city's banks hold about half of all deposits in Brazil. The future for the banking system in a low-inflation environment is uncertain, especially for the less efficient state-owned banks. However, private sector banks will be able to expand on the back of increased banking charges and long-term consumer credit. Some larger state banks, including Sao Paulo's Banespa, will be able to rely on their asset bases and wide branch network. For foreign investment banks Sao Paulo has become a magnet. After the 1980s debt crisis, Brazilian companies have gradually returned to the international debt and equities markets and the country finally sealed its Brady plan debt deal earlier this year. Commissions and fees from companies issuing securities abroad, local issues and mergers and acquisitions could soon total Dollars 1bn a year, say market analysts. Longer term, optimists believe that Sao Paulo's role as Brazil's financial powerhouse will be extended with the growth of regional integration, particularly the Mercosul common market due to come into force at the beginning of next year. 'We are likely to see close links between Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires, including dual listings and the creation of a regional financial market,' says Mr Monforte of Citibank.</p>

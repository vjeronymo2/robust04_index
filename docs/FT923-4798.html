			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont's big move Civil servants like elegance, and borrowing Ecu10bn to buy pounds and fund the borrowing requirement neatly manages to kill two birds with one stone. Interestingly, this Treasury stunt for supporting sterling pleased the gilt and equity markets, which both managed healthy gains yesterday. But the foreign exchanges seemed slightly sceptical. The reaction in gilts is understandable given that the market now has to face some Pounds 7.5bn less supply this year. Equities will be impressed not so much by the government's defence of the ERM parities as by its fierce determination to avoid an interest rate rise. As for the foreign exchanges, while the amounts involved are substantial, the money must still be used skilfully to drive sterling higher. The gesture of the commitment is certainly the most important part of this announcement. But investors should bear in mind that if the gamble fails and sterling eventually falls, the government's loss, though substantial, would hardly be fatal. And given its rigid adherence to the parity, the Treasury also seems strangely reluctant in this case to make a long-term commitment. With interest rates at current levels, the government could save itself 2 percentage points in interest by borrowing marks through 10 or 20 year bonds, rather than shorter term bank loans. While the scheme hands the Treasury plenty of firepower in the run up to the French referendum, this alone is not going to affect significantly the supply and demand balance in the foreign exchanges. Investors will no doubt still ponder the fundamental position of the UK economy and the amount of intervention which may be required if the French say No.</p>

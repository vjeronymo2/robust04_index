			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / 'Wise men' favour open skies policy: EU report says airlines must cut costs The European airline industry must end the debate over its future and get down to practical cost-savings measures if it is to have any assured future, according to the committee of 'wise men' set up by the European Commission to look at the financial crisis in civil aviation. The committee, headed by former Belgian transport minister Herman De Croo, presented an interim report to EU transport ministers in Brussels on Tuesday, and is due to finalise its recommendations by mid-January. The meeting widened the rift between a French-led coalition looking to spare their flag carriers the sharper measures of the EU air transport deregulation put in place over the past seven years, and a more or less equal UK-led group of member states seeking to preserve and extend the 'open skies' regime and ban state aids to national airlines. But Mr De Croo told the ministers that 'the European airline industry cannot afford continuing such a largely ideological debate with only sterile results. What we need are practical measures that work and bring about incentives for cost savings. 'The European airline industry can no longer afford selling a product, produced at European cost levels, at world market prices,' the report says, rejecting any solution which rolls back liberalisation. The committee's preliminary findings state that: Europe's airlines have long combined above average growth with below average profitability, a phenomenon it describes as 'possibly unique'. On average, the industry has a considerable cost disadvantage compared to its main international competitors, with flag carriers' operating costs at 45 per cent above their US rivals. 'A significant part of this gap stems from lower productivity,' the report says, pointing out that salary levels do not substantially differ between Europe and the US. Airlines in Europe pay higher airport and air traffic control costs, while chronic congestion adds to overall costs. They also pay higher financial costs, because of exchange rate risks, less favourable conditions for tax-lease arrangements, and 'the higher efficiency of US capital markets. However, the report notes that financial difficulties have not hit all sectors of the industry equally. Charter and cargo services have done remarkably well during the recession. Independent carriers increased jobs in 1990-92 by 10 per cent, while employment at flag carriers fell 4 per cent, with more redundancies in prospect. The latter are losing market share in and outside the EU, the report notes. The options, Mr De Croo said, are 'major cost-cutting on all fronts or declare bankruptcy', or to let the taxpayer pick up the bill through state aids. 'If we do nothing a combination of all three options will occur.' The interim report does not rule out public funding to aid industry restructuring, but its tone clearly strengthens the liberal camp in EU aviation.</p>

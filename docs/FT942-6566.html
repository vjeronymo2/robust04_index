			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Managers volunteer surplus expertise British managers in the caring '90s like nothing more after a hard day at work than to start managing again, it seems - but this time for no pay and to help others. The image of do-gooding managers has emerged from a survey published today of 3,000 members of the Institute of Management. More than half of the 857 managers who replied to the survey say they undertake some form of voluntary work in the community. Two-thirds of those who do not carry out community work say they would like to. The main constraint cited is lack of time, particularly among younger managers. The typical volunteer, says the report, is a male senior manager in his fifties. Their motives appear pure as well. Only one in 10 managers surveyed admits that he or she is seeking to make social or business contacts. Most say they volunteer from a sense of social responsibility and a feeling of satisfaction from helping others. One in four of the managers who do voluntary work is helping a charity. Other activities include serving as school and college governors and as trustees of charities, housing associations and health bodies, and involvement with youth groups and heritage societies. A quarter spend more than six hours a week on voluntary work and 80 per cent receive no payment. Mr Roger Young, the institute's director-general, said: 'This report shows there is such a thing as a caring society after all. 'Britain's managers clearly do care about their communities and are prepared to help by giving freely of their time and skills.' He suggested that employers could allow managers more time to undertake such work. The expansion of the voluntary sector, including the creation of Training and Enterprise Councils, housing action trusts and grant-maintained schools, is creating increasing demand for good managers. The survey says there is untapped potential among younger managers, many of whom support the principle of giving their time and skills free of charge. The report, published jointly with the Local Government Management Board - the employers' body - says there is a need for some kind of brokering service to match managers with voluntary opportunities.

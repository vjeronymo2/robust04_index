			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing (CEIS) -- A senior official with the  Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation  (MOFTEC) has explained China's basic policies for using foreign  lendings and investments.    Highlights of the basic policies, announced by MOFTEC  Assistant Minister Liu Xiangdong at a recent seminar on China's  economic reform policies here, are as follows:    -- To attract foreign lendings and direct investments by  various methods and through various channels.    While continuing to accept investments by foreign small and  medium-sized enterprises, China will make efforts to attract  more direct investments by transnational companies.    While using foreign direct investments, the country will  continue to apply for foreign loans, especially loans from  foreign governments and international financial institutions  under favorable terms.    -- To continue carrying out the current preferential  policies  for encouraging foreign direct investment.    -- To open more new fields to foreign direct investments.    The fields open to foreign investors will be extended from  the production sector to the circulation sector, with the  opening up of nine new fields, namely, retailing, foreign trade  (limited to bonded areas in the beginning), communications and  transport, civil aviation, finance, tourism, real estate,  culture and education, and social services.    Meanwhile, China will further encourage foreign investment  in  projects related to energy, communications, basic industries and  infrastructure, those to introduce advanced foreign technology,  upgrade products, cut energy consumption and expand production  capacity, those to promote China's exports, those to produce new  equipment, new materials and products not available in China,  and those to fully or mainly produce exports with major imported  raw materials and also without quota limitation.    Projects to do harm to social security, national economic  development, environment, natural resources and human health  will be barred from entering the country.    -- To guide foreign investments to expected industries by  granting inclined policies for industries, rather than for  regions as has been practiced in the past. Foreign-invested  technology-intensive projects and new and hi-tech projects that  are encouraged by the state and involve large amounts of  investment will be offered some domestic markets, so as to make  them help upgrade the related domestic industries.    -- To improve administration over foreign-invested  enterprises.</p>

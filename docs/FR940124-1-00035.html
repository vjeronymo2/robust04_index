			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If sufficient progress has not been made by Indiana toward the implementation of an approvable I/M program to be operational on or before January 1, 1995, EPA hereby announces its intention to impose sanctions on May 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Rationale and Approach for Section 110(m) Sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(m) of the Act allows USEPA to apply the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and 2:1 emission offset sanction at any time (or at any time after) it makes a finding under section 179(a). Based on its finding dated December 30, 1993, USEPA is proposing to impose both the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and 2:1 emission offset sanctions. USEPA believes that the imposition of both sanctions is appropriate because of Indiana's failure to adopt legislation to enhance its existing vehicle inspection and maintenance program. In the absence of an improved vehicle inspection and maintenance program, the ability of the State's metropolitan areas to meet the Clean Air Act deadlines for attaining healthy air quality is severely compromised. As previously noted, enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance is the single most effective air pollution control measure available and delayed legislative approval of an acceptable program further burdens major industrial sources of air pollution with responsibility for cleaning the air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 110(m), USEPA may apply sanctions to any portion of the state it determines is reasonable and appropriate. During the 24 months following the finding, USEPA may not impose the sanctions statewide if one or more political subdivisions within the state is principally responsible for the deficiency that is the basis for sanctions. USEPA has proposed criteria for determining when a political subdivision is principally responsible (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992). The criteria provide that a political subdivision is principally responsible if: (1) It has the legal authority to perform the required activity; (2) it has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform, the required activity; (3) it has received, where appropriate, adequate funding, or authority to obtain funding, from the state to perform the required activity; (4) it has agreed to perform (and has not revoked the agreement), or is required by state law to accept responsibility for performing, the required activity; and (5) it has failed to perform the required activity. A ``political subdivision'' is defined as the representative body that is responsible for adopting and/or implementing air pollution controls for any combination of political subdivisions created by, or pursuant to, Federal or State law. If no political subdivision meets all 5 criteria, USEPA may use its discretion to determine whether it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions on a statewide basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this notice, USEPA is proposing to use the above proposed criteria to determine if it may impose highway sanction statewide for Indiana because of the failure to submit a complete enhanced I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA believes that the first criterion has not been met by any political subdivision. Only the Indiana legislature, composed of representatives from all portions of the State of Indiana, has the authority to revise the state statute to provide for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and EPA requirements. Once the legislature has acted, only state government agencies can adopt any implementing regulations. While individual air pollution control districts or air quality management districts may request implementation of the state I/M program within their districts once that program is adopted, this authority is meaningless unless the State has first established an appropriate program through legislation and regulations. Since the State legislature has not enacted the legislation required to provide the legal authority for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and USEPA requirements, the program is not available to areas within the State that require the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since no political subdivision within the State has met the first criterion, EPA believes that no political subdivision is principally responsible for the failure to have an enhanced I/M program. Therefore, EPA is not prohibited from imposing sanctions statewide. As noted above, the State legislature bears the ultimate responsibility to adopt the requisite legislative authority and IDEM, not the individual air quality districts, must subsequently adopt adequate regulations. Since the State does bear the ultimate responsibility, USEPA believes that it is reasonable and appropriate for USEPA to impose the highway sanction on the entire State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 2:1 offset sanction requirements apply only to new or modified major stationary sources located or to be located in areas that are required to have a permit program pursuant to section 173. Thus, USEPA is proposing to impose the 2:1 emission offset sanction in the following ozone nonattainment counties: Lake, Porter, Clark, Floyd, Marion, St. Joseph, Elkhart, and Vanderburgh. The 2:1 emission offset would apply to all new or modified major stationary sources for volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen that are locating to or located in each of these areas. USEPA proposes to impose the offset sanction in the manner described in the proposed action on the sequencing of sanctions (58 FR 51270, 51275&hyph;51277 (Oct. 1, 1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anna Politkovskaya: "Will Russia Become a </F> Switzerland?: Marginal Notes in Connection With the Signing of  the Social Accord Treaty"]    [Text] So will our own internal Switzerland, tranquil,  understanding everything, blaming no one, pacifist, and  maintaining strict neutrality, but eaten up by no one thus far  because of this, emerge here? This is, of course, the question  of questions for Russia today. While our native political  scientists are attempting to gather their thoughts, Russia's  journalists have been attempting to answer it as quickly as  possible.    The very next morning following the ceremony in the Kremlin,  IZVESTIYA introduced to the political vocabulary the terms  "signatory" and "nonsignatory," which is, in fact, what is most  important in the situation that has been created around the  latest exercise of the president, who is an acknowledged expert  at creating difficult situations, from which subsequently all of  society begins to emerge with clatter, noise, and losses.  IZVESTIYA recalled the "moral and political responsibility"  which would undoubtedly ensue from a violation of the articles  of this treaty. Otto Latsis, a member of the editorial board, no  longer recalls, it would seem, in presenting material on this  topic the country's recent past, when any "moral and political  responsibility" seamlessly flowed over into criminal  responsibility and there came to be added in parallel with a  criminal investigation the skillfully organized public  persecution of individual citizens who at the due moment either  had not signed something or had suddenly been taken ill or had  failed to put in an appearance somewhere or had simply remained  silent at a plenum, congress, presidium session....    IZVESTIYA quotes Gennadiy Zyuganov, a "nonsignatory," to the  effect that "there is no need for any special agreement, it is  necessary merely to observe the constitution of Russia." Say  what you will, the words of the principal communist of  present-day Russia appear perfectly justified, whereas the  "barbs" of the principal political observer of a respected  mass-circulation newspaper are sincerely distressing. This is  what O. Latsis writes, arguing with G. Zyuganov: "...observing  the constitution formally, sociopolitical tension--by, included,  demands for a review and revision, perfectly legitimate in form,  of this constitution and various sociopolitical demands, which  are so easy to make at a time of crisis--could be incited." It  is worth recalling that this is that same Latsis who just a few  months ago was assuring society in that same paper of the acute  need, without delay, for the adoption of Yeltsin's draft  constitution inasmuch as it, the draft, was, at least, good.    Deliberately brushing aside the "nonsignatory" and, hence,  antipresidential, which sounds for it almost like an  anti-Russian, thought movement, IZVESTIYA inveighs also, for  example, against the demands of the Political Council of the  Russian Democratic Reform Movement in respect to the possibility  of the signing of the treaty: "Such demands reek of populism."  The word "reeks" is, you will agree, painfully familiar to  Soviet hearing. In addition, it has to be recalled that it is  none other than Yeltsin himself who is the recognized leader of  modern Russian populism, and if anyone is to be accused of  anti-Yeltsin sentiments, the subject of "populism" should not  even be broached here--this is a loser for the president.    The position of another "nonsignatory"--the Agrarian  Party--is pilloried by IZVESTIYA as a "self-interested  approach." The entire self-interest amounts to the fact that the  agrarians are refusing to sign the treaty on the grounds that it  omits the sectoral demands of the agro-industrial lobby. But on  what other grounds could they, in fact, reach accord or not? But  the newspaper writes: "Hardly anyone could fail to understand  this, and if he does understand it and still insists on getting  his own way, we should take a close look at the motives of such  actions." Let us scrutinize what are, in our opinion, the key  words of the sentence--"should take a close look." These began  also many frightening government and newspaper campaigns of the  USSR against the individual, did they not? As we know, in time  society and the publications had great moral difficulties  "washing off" the involvement in these campaigns. How much did  that same IZVESTIYA have to confess its restructuring to  Solzhenitsyn and to Rostropovich and to Sakharov and to other  citizens of our fatherland who were innocent sufferers. O.  Latsis concludes his article entirely in the spirit of the  Brezhnevite editorials: "The fact of nonsigning is just as  eloquent as the fact of signing." But should everything begin in  the country so expressly from scratch?    The position of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY differs from that of  IZVESTIYA, but the difference is merely that ARGUMENTY I FAKTY  produces a real tear-jerker. In the opinion of Vladimir  Savichev, "What is that thing held in common for the sake of  which the president is calling for accord? Primarily the  interests of Russia and its people, strong authority and a  strong economy. It is those who do nothing and who are  responsible for nothing who do not want to `reach accord'  today." And the author goes on to use altogether impossible,  even disgraceful words, it would seem: "V. Zhirinovskiy, leader  of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], may be viewed  variously, but he cannot, in any event, be denied one thing--he  speaks clearly and pleasingly (!?--author's comment) for the  hearing of ordinary people."    It is significant that many newspapers representing the  interests of various political currents and movements, while not  coming to terms, have expressed themselves in the spirit of G.  Zyuganov, the leader of the communists, looking, perhaps, the  most respectable of all in the current situation. And this is  very indicative inasmuch as the further we go, the clearer it  appears that the only thing we will derive from the present  stage is the communists in the saddle once again and profound  disenchantment with the democrats in power. NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA  GAZETA (correspondent Yelena Afanasyeva) writes about this  disenchantment: "I happened to hear at the Kremlin entrance a  discussion of the preparations (not so much for the signing as  for the banquet) by two officers of the security service:  `Plenty of vodka. They'll sign on!'" Was that really how things  were THERE! The information concerning these "retainers'"  maxims, which are of considerable importance for an  understanding of Kremlin psychodynamics, is borne out fully by  the newspaper SEGODNYA--the vodka is explained there by a  "senior guard to a junior guard," and the whole action takes  places at the Tsar Bell. And, further: "Social accord is even a  very remarkable thing, particularly if it is more or less clear  to society whom the contracting parties represent. The chosen  line of political behavior is very reminiscent of the rash  Soviet `ostrich' principle--ignoring the large-scale phenomena  of life going beyond the framework of the ideologically  acceptable picture. Ostrich-like instincts are understandable in  human terms, but historical experience testifies that when the  head is buried in the sand, it is very difficult to observe  reality."    All this clearly shows the exclusively theatrical nature of  the action, which we might, of course, have guessed, but it is  better to know, this having been permitted us by the reporters  admitted to the scene of the event.    PRAVDA, as an exclusively opposition spokesman, was even  more  definite on this score: "The immense number of signatories  creates the illusion of the unity of political forces in the  country. This is not in fact the case. This should force the  president to wonder: Why? So with whom was the treaty signed?  Between the president and the people or his own entourage? The  outcome of a survey reveals an interesting newspaper breakdown:  On the one hand, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA,  IZVESTIYA, TRUD, ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, and many other publications  which unconditionally supported the presidential side. On the  other, NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, SEGODNYA, KURANTY, PRAVDA,  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, KOMMERSANT-DAILY....    All newspapers were united only on one point, perhaps--for  the first time they made forecasts concerning the future of the  treaty. The most interesting were published, in our view, in  KOMMERSANT-DAILY. The author of the first is the well-known wit  Maksim Sokolov, and this is what he writes: "From the cynical  viewpoint, the process of the redivision of power and property  in Russia is approaching completion--evidence of which is the  constantly declining level of inflation--and the result of the  revision is peace." The author of the second is the paper's  policy department: "There is no reason to suppose that Boris  Yeltsin, who is persistently molding the image of `father of the  nation,' will himself now constantly be pointing the finger in  the direction of the nonsignatories, attempting to make of them  his adversaries, and publicly dividing society into `good  fellows' and `bad fellows'. But it cannot be ruled out that the  `radicals' in his entourage--the politicians that obtained  offices in the Kremlin on the wave of opposition to Mikhail  Gorbachev or the Supreme Soviet--will not involve themselves in  this. At least, they would acquire in the person of the  nonsignatories actual opponents, attacks on whom would not, most  likely, evoke their boss's displeasure. The treaty is simply the  latest product of the official ideological machinery, which,  probably, needs somehow to justify its existence. It may be  assumed with every confidence here that it will hardly prove  more effective than the previous food programs and antialcohol  campaigns."    MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' forecast is definite and tragic:  "None of the signatories believes that the treaty will prevent  any trade union boss striking in the near future or regional  forces becoming fixated with unbridled separatism..." (Yuriy  Zaynashev, author). KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA adds fuel to the same  fire: "The probability of the treaty soon being forgotten cannot  be ruled out. Much now will depend on the press. The president  is entrusting to it the duty of keeping an eye on compliance  with the terms. Well, we are used to this sort of thing. And we  have survived" (Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin, author).    Let us sum up: Despite the multitude of words uttered by  everyone, the treaty is still more the outward appearance of a  process than a process itself. In a week or a month the  president will rest content with the first--this has happened  before. Primarily because this business imposes on him  personally precisely no clear obligations. But as long as the  outward appearance continues to be observed, some people might  very much have to pay for it even. Sanctions against both the  "nonsignatories" and the "signatories" will be applied, and this  is clear even now, primarily by the press. So, colleagues, be  vigilant, do not treat that seriously all that you hear from the  Kremlin, be in no hurry to carry out an order--remember the  immortal Schweik--for the direct opposite could follow....    [begin box]  <H5>  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Pact </H5>   Yes, we have a plan for the conclusion of a corporate High  Pact. Let them have their treaty, we will have--for simplicity  of distinction--a pact. This idea was suggested to us by the  social emanations about which M. Leontyev spoke so splendidly in  the newspaper SEGODNYA: "The will to accord, more, to its  formalization on paper, is very clearly gaining momentum at the  present turn of social life," which we had, of course, to have  heard. Taking up a position in the rear of this modern  phenomenon, we offer our colleagues a draft Pact on the  Procedure of Coverage of the Social Accord Treaty in the  National News Media. It is just two sentences long; discussion,  therefore, will not be protracted and will create a real  opportunity for the general signing of the pact the day after  publication of this issue. So, our version: "Journalists  subscribing to the pact shall categorically refrain from  propaganda of the division of society into `signatories' and  `nonsignatories.' The list of subscribers to the OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA Pact is open, beginning 6 May." [end box]</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US weighs use of sanctions bludgeon - Nancy Dunne assesses Washington's reaction to an 'unacceptable' Japanese surplus Japan is now so strong and wealthy that its massive trade surplus is 'simply no longer acceptable,' US President Bill Clinton said yesterday. After the failure of the US-Japan summit to agree on a plan to reduce the surplus, Mr Clinton said he was reviewing all options and ruling out nothing. Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said US officials had embarked on 'a series of meetings and a series of actions.' But she said there had been no action as yet. 'We should not be talking about trade war now.' In fact, there may be no sanctions for months. Sanctions announcements are likely and, if the administration's pressure is successful, negotiations may follow. However, the administration is united on one point: any pacts must be watertight to produce results. The administration's credibility is at stake - in Congress, with the US public and with China, which is being told that the US needs progress on human rights by June if China's Most Favoured Nation trade status is to be renewed. Officials yesterday acknowledged that the president was considering an executive order that would resurrect the now expired Super 301 provision of the trade law. This would provide a domestically legal basis for a broad range of trade complaints, followed by investigations, negotiations, and deadlines for sanctions. However, Mr Clinton added that he was considering 'some (options) that have not been widely discussed that may offer great promise.' There has been some suggestion, for example, that the administration may gamble on a complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade alleging that Japan's invisible market barriers 'nullify and impair' its trade liberalisation pledges. This might assuage critics who say US unilateral action is destructive to the world trading system. The administration could also attack Japan's keiretsu system of interlocking companies by bringing an anti-trust case against Japanese subsidiaries in the US. The Federal Trade Commission has already begun an anti-trust investigation. Meanwhile, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, has asked the US Customs Service for data to be used in developing a sanctions list. It is thought this could speed the retaliatory process if senior administration officials decide a quick response to the summit failure is necessary. The most likely area for sanctions is cellular telephones, with today set as the deadline for a review of the cellular telephone pact with Japan. But another candidate is the semiconductor deal, which was supposed to help foreign manufacturers get at least 20 per cent of the Japanese market. The target was hit in the fourth quarter last year - sales, slowed by the Japanese recession, have been sinking ever since. Last year, the Clinton administration followed its predecessors in setting aside numerous trade complaints for the sake of getting the Uruguay Round completed. In the same period, access to Japan's public works market was agreed and its rice market was pried open. However, a broad menu of options for sanctions remains: candidates can be gleaned from the most recent of the National Trade Estimates reports, issued yearly by the US trade representative. The most recent NTE devotes 27 pages to Japan - more than any other country and 10 more than the EC - and there is vast scope for trouble between the economic superpowers. Japan's government procurement practices have long been a target of US complaint. Sanctions in that area - in response to government discrimination against US computers and supercomputers - would be likely to hit Japanese companies that bid for US contracts. Another pact the US could find actionable is the US-Japan Wood Products Agreement signed in 1990. The NTE noted 'significant strides' made towards reducing market access barriers, but concluded that 'satisfactory market access ultimately hinges on the implementation of agreed-upon tariff reductions in the Uruguay Round.' Zero for zero tariff cuts were not agreed, and the failure convinced US officials the Hosokawa government was less than serious about its deregulation efforts. 'That alone would have brought down housing costs by 50 per cent  .. but they absolutely refused to do it,' said one senior US official. Japan's insurance market - one of four sectors in the failed talks - is another nominee for sanctions. Japan has decided to begin insurance deregulation in the areas of nursing home care, medical insurance, and personal and travel accident - the only sectors where foreign companies have access.</p>

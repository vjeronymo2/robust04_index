			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Ch Climens - drinking well - Appetisers Chateau Climens of Barsac has an average production of 4,000 cases and is, in quantity, eighth of the 12 first-growth Sauternes, but is second in quality only to Yquem. Past vintages are hard to find in the UK but recently Threshers held a vertical tasting of 10 vintages from 1991 back to 1980, with the 1976 served at the following lunch. In spite of variations, all were very drinkable. 1991 - light golden colour, rich nose, already fairly well developed flavour. 1990 - less colour, less aroma and taste very closed, but with fine prospects for the future. 1989 - lighter in colour than the '90, but more mature, botrytis (noble rot)(noble rot) on the nose and flavour. A typical fine Sauternes. 1988 - the first of three acclaimed Sauternes vintages, it was more backward than the '89, with medium gold colours, restrained aroma, good currently, not exceptional. 1986 - one of Sauternes' finest years. Good but not too deep colour, very rich nose and botrytis flavour, fine balance, and long in the mouth. 1985 - lacking botrytis in a very dry year, but a charming, appealing flavour. Perhaps at its best. 1983 - the first top vintage of the decade, luscious and rich, similar to the '66. 1982 - difficult to taste after the '83. Fair, agreeable drinking, but lacking length and character, parallelling the exceptional reds. 1981 - better than '82, agreeable drinking, but lacks character and botrytis at best now. 1980 - very deep colour, lacks balance of acidity and so rather heavy on the palate. The '76 at the lunch had medium gold colour, a very distinguished bouquet, and luscious, complete flavour, the best vintage until '83. Threshers lists the 1991 at Pounds 21.99 a bottle. Bottoms-Up offers a case of six single bottles, the '91,'89,'85,'82,'81 and '80, for Pounds 180. Seventeen privately-owned Pride of Britain hotels, including Michael's Nook in the Lake District, Calcot Manor in the Cotswolds, and the Elizabethan Whitechapel Manor in North Devon, have dreamt up an appealing offer for July and August this year. For Pounds 75 per person per night, they offer de luxe twin or double accommodation plus dinner, breakfast, and a bottle of Piper Heidsieck on arrival. The only stipulation is that the stay must be for at least two nights. Three new(ish) eating out guides to look for. The first is Richard and Peter Harden's clever adaptation of their exhaustive restaurant data bank, Good Cheap Eats in London, which includes 400 entries, maps and lists and costs Pounds 3.95. The second, for the computer literate, is the software application of Time Out's guide to run on Apple Computer's Newton MessagePad. It includes 700 London restaurants, costs Pounds 54.95 plus VAT, and is available from Dixons, Ryman and John Lewis.

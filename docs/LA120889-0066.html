			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA WINS, BUT FALLS 48 POINTS SHORT OF 200  </P> <P> U.S. International University, college basketball's favorite punching bag,  decided to fight back Thursday night, hanging even with Loyola Marymount for 30  minutes before falling, 152-137, in front of 1,264 in Golden Hall.  </P> <P> USIU, playing some of the heavy hitters of the NCAA this month -- the Gulls  fell to Oklahoma, 173-101, last week and play at Arkansas next -- fell to 2-5.  But they had a 94-92 lead midway through the second half before Loyola turned  it up a notch.  </P> <P> The Lions (4-1) eventually pulled away with a 58-43 burst in the final 12:35,  withstanding a school-record, 54-point barrage by USIU guard Kevin Bradshaw.  </P> <P> This game had been billed as Loyola's shot at college's first 200-point game.  The marquee here even predicted: "History in the Making." But USIU was the team  that looked hungry when the game began.  </P> <P> The Lions needed 37 points and 27 rebounds from Hank Gathers and five other  players in double figures to win their fourth in a row. Bradshaw, who hit 20 of  37 shots, was supported by Demetrius Laffitte with 25 points and Steve Smith  with 23.  </P> <P> "I think (a record) was on our mind, but my guys didn't really have that 200  look on their faces," Gathers said. "USIU did a good job of smacking us and  making us wake up."  </P> <P> The Lions led by as many as 10 points early, but USIU, thanks to second efforts  and numerous Loyola turnovers, went on a 31-19 run to take a 55-53 lead with  4:47 left in the half. The Gulls forced 14 Loyola turnovers in the half.  </P> <P> Loyola, with Gathers controlling the boards, forged an 11-3 run to build a  64-58 lead, but couldn't put the Gulls away in the half. USIU pulled to within  one point twice in the closing seconds and trailed by only 75-72 at halftime.  </P> <P> Loyola's slim lead was due mostly to the work of Gathers, who had 23 points and  11 rebounds, and Per Stumer with 14 points. Bradshaw had 20 in the first half.  </P> <P> The pattern continued into the second half, with USIU starting fast and taking  leads of five points behind Bradshaw's three-point shooting. Loyola finally  caught up at 90-90 with 14:05 left but didn't take the lead for good until the  10-minute mark. The fast break suddenly kicked in and the Lions ran off a 24-4  surge and built a double-figure lead. This time, USIU didn't have an answer.  </P> <P> Bo Kimble added 27 for the Lions, and guard Terrell Lowery had a career-high  24.  </P> <P> Loyola and USIU played the highest-scoring game in college history in January,  181-150. Thursday night's 152-137 was the fourth-highest combined total in NCAA  history, but Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said he wasn't shooting for records  Thursday.  </P> <P> "Last year it was midseason," Westhead said. "We're still trying to find our  team. It's too early to worry about records. I want to accumulate some wins."  </P></p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Moscow woos foreign investors Russia's prime minister yesterday made his strongest bid yet for foreign investment - promising tax holidays and an end to restrictions on capital movements and land ownership. Speaking to leaders of foreign companies with substantial investment in Russia, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin claimed his package of draft laws - which must still pass through parliament - would improve the meagre investment record by the end of the year. 'For any normal economy it is a sign of improvement when it moves towards a realistic investment policy - and Russia has made the first steps in that direction. 'Never since the start of 1992 (when economic reform began) have we had a political atmosphere so favourable for a normal course of reforms,' he told the business group, which is advising Moscow on investment. Government figures show that foreign investment is weaker than had been thought. Mr Jakov Yurinson, the first deputy economics minister, told the gathering that foreign investment had totalled only Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) over the past five years - and would be no more than Dollars 1bn in 1994. The government also said yesterday there were signs of economic improvement. Inflation would be brought down to below 7 per cent a month by the end of the year - and would fall further to 5 per cent by the middle of next year and to 3 per cent by its end, Mr Sergei Dubynin, the acting finance minister, said. The lengths to which Mr Chernomyrdin was prepared to go appears to signal a realisation that Russia's maze of regulations and taxes and the growing power of organised crime gangs are a powerful disincentive to international capital with other, more stable, developing markets from which to choose. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president, this week introduced a decree to crack down on organised crime, although parliament argues the decree is unconstitutional. The measures promised by Mr Chernomyrdin are: A five-year income tax holiday for foreign companies; An end to restrictions on the movement of capital in and out of the country; The right to retain all hard currency earnings from exports; No import tax payable on materials used for production; A three-year exemption from any changes in tax legislation - seven years if the foreign holding is above Dollars 100,000. Further drafts shown by Mr Chernomyrdin to business leaders yesterday were plans for the establishment of free economic zones and a new law on foreign investment. The group is chaired by Mr Michael Henning, chairman of the consulting company Ernst and Young, and includes heads of such companies as ABB Brown Boveri, Coca Cola and United Technologies. The government is also being pressed, according to one western businessman at yesterday's meeting, to create either a new ministry to deal with foreign investment or a series of committees with the power to push through legislation and improve the climate. Mr Chernomyrdin laid out a long and tempting list of projects in which he wanted foreign participation - such as toll highways, bridges, tunnels and cargo terminals. He said that the government attached particular importance to the development of small and medium-sized business with the aid of foreign partners.</p>

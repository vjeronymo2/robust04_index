			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (5): The big five quietly do their own thing - Mergers and the rush to create new products are changing the face of banking THIS WAS supposed to be a bad year to be a big bank in Spain. Mr Luis Vals, the enigmatic co-president of the world's most profitable bank, Banco Popular, mused late last year that 1992 would be a 'sabbatical year' for Spanish banks as the economy slows and bad debts mount up. But, in relative terms at least, the 500th anniversary of the creation of a unified Spain is not turning out that badly for most of the big five private-sector banks - Banco Central Hispanoamericano, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Santander, Banco Popular and Banesto. The mood at the big new state-owned conglomeration of public sector banks, Argentaria, which includes Banco Exterior, is positively buoyant. The problem with making predictions about the big Spanish banks is that they are no longer a colourless mass. The mergers of the past four years (Bilbao and Vizcaya, to form BBV; Central and Hispano, to form BCH), the inexorable shrinking of margins in their traditional retail business and the rush to create new products and services is changing the face of Spanish banking. The big banks are going their separate ways, each quietly becoming identifiable for what it is doing that is different, rather than, as in the past, for how they are managing to shadow each other. Banco Santander is reinforcing its position as the country's most aggressive bank. In 1989, it was first to offer interest on current accounts, igniting a fierce battle for new customers that drained the resources of most of its large rivals. Last year it was slower off the mark than the BBV to launch mutual funds but quickly became the market leader. It has scorned mergers with local banks to concentrate on buying abroad. It has 10 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland, and has also bought 13 per cent (with an option on another 13 per cent) of First Fidelity in the US. The bank is accumulating large cash positions. First quarter 1992 pre-tax profits of Pta28.6bn (Pounds 155m) were up 19.2 per cent. Bilbao Vizcaya is over the worst of its 1988 merger. Staff and branches have been deeply cut, and a further 3,000 jobs are to be lost. The bank has expanded its interests in profitable foods and electricity distribution markets, and is entering communications. GEC Capital is a new shareholder, through which BBV plans to branch out into the private credit card business in which GEC Capital is a world leader. It is also establishing a large presence off the US market, in Puerto Rico. It is shedding peripheral banking units and may this year be hit by a drop in extraordinary profits. Excluding these gains, group pre-tax profits rose 11 per cent in the first quarter to Pta25.9bn. Central Hispano, merged last year, still faces a daunting task in trimming duplicated branches and staff. The bank has also been born with a huge industrial empire vulnerable to industrial business cycles but also capable of generating occasional large profits. Its industrial strategy remains, however, unclear while management of the two merged banks get accustomed to each other. First quarter 1992 pre-tax profits were up 4.5 per cent at Pta18.7bn. Banco Popular sails along doing what it always has - making lots of money. It is not tempted by industry nor by mergers, and concentrates on retail and niche services. It processes, for instance, all Spanish air ticket transactions. Pre-tax profit in the first quarter was up 9 per cent at Pta22.5bn on a third of BCH's assets. Banesto is being tortured by its large industrial group, where profits fell 48 per cent last year. The banking group, though, may be beginning to reap the rewards of huge investments in computerisation, though the biggest boost to profits last year came via its new Portuguese acquisition, Banco Totta. Financial group first quarter pre-tax income rose just under 1 per cent to Pta17.2bn after a 54 per cent rise in provisions and write offs. Banco Exterior has absorbed the state's industrial credit bank BCI and, itself, been pooled with the rest of the state's financial institutions under a new holding company, Argentaria. The Government is thinking of privatising more of Exterior (it now owns 69 per cent of the bank) or part of Argentaria. Exterior is still shedding some of the deadweight it inherited with BCI, but reported first quarter pre-tax profits of Pta11.4bn, up 13.6 per cent. Although it is possible now to tell the big banks apart, they still suffer a number of common complaints and enjoy some similar advantages. Despite efforts to break into fee-earning services, retail business still accounts for around 90 per cent of banking profits in Spain. And the banks with large industrial holdings still tend to force these companies to do their banking business through the owning bank, rather than allow finance directors to seek more competitive arrangements. The high lending margins enjoyed by Spanish banks mean, though, that they are well cushioned as they try to diversify their banking business and, as many analysts still insist, wait for one last big bank merger in Spain. Banesto would probably be part of such a venture, but it is hard to see how the other two 'single banks', Popular and Santander, could buy it or merge with it without damaging their profitability. One other possibility is that a major foreign bank could buy all or part of Banesto, but foreigners are much more wary now of the Spanish market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           THE TOP 10 SPANISH BANKING GROUPS: 1990 (1987 rank)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Equity   Assets   Deposits   Pre-tax profit 1990                    Pta bn   Pta bn    Pta bn       Pta bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Banco Argentaria* (7)      485    9,243     3,345             104.0 Central-Hisp** (2 &amp; 4)     709    8,829     5,605             129.0 BBV (1)                    550    8,433     5,373             141.5 La Caixa (3)               225    5,627     4,723              20.0 Banco Santander (6)        336    5,346     3,428              96.1 Banesto (5)                293    5,005     3,239              74.5 Caja de Madrid (9)         193    2,549     2,076              38.1 Banco Popular (8)          175    2,387     1,829              67.6 Bankinter (10)             121    1,203       949              26.5 Banca March (20)           138    1,176       948              20.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Pro-forma after merger, renamed from CBE, 1987 rank is Banco Exterior's. **Pro-forma, after merger                Source: UBS Phillips &amp; Drew  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 MARKET SHARE OF MAJOR BANKING GROUPS (%)         (excluding post office and official credit institutions)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1980   1985   1990   1980=100  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BANK BRANCHES Private banks                    54.8   50.3   50.5         92 Foreign/foreign-owned*            0.3    2.0    3.7      1,371 Savings banks                    34.2   35.0   40.8        119 Co-operatives                    11.0   10.9    8.7         79  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL ASSETS Private banks                    70.8   67.0   60.8         86 Foreign/foreign-owned*           negl    8.2   10.1        n/m Savings banks                    26.0   29.9   36.3        139 Co-operatives                     3.2    3.1    2.9         91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LOAN PORTFOLIO Private banks                    75.8   69.9   62.5         82 Foreign/foreign-owned*           negl   10.9   11.6        n/m Savings banks                    21.2   26.6   34.4        162 Co-operatives                     2.9    3.5    3.0        104  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPOSITS Private banks                    66.0   59.4   53.8         82 Foreign/foreign-owned*           negl    3.7    5.9        n/m Savings banks                    29.7   36.0   42.6        143 Co-operatives                     4.2    4.6    3.6         85  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *UBS Phillips &amp; Drew calculations, including 1991 acquisitions Sources: Bank of Spain, Consejo Superior Bancario  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

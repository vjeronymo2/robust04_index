			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: GM foregoes bonuses for senior executives General Motors (GM), which returned to profits in 1993 after three years of losses, did not pay any annual bonuses to its top executives, including Mr Jack Smith, the chairman and chief executive. Mr Smith received Dollars 1.37m in base salary, plus a package of share options - well below the Dollars 1.9m salary and bonus received by Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of the much smaller Chrysler. GM's preliminary proxy statement yesterday explained that 'management believed corporate awards should not be granted until the executive group achieves sustained profitability, and better positions the corporation to grow its core automotive business. 'While it is competitive practice for a company to pay for 'turnaround results', the committee believes this decision . . . underscores GM's commitment to its pay-for-performance philosophy and focus on stockholders' interests.' The proxy also revealed that GM wants shareholders to approve a doubling of its authorised common shares to 2bn. It has 718.7m shares outstanding.</p>

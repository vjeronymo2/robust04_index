			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["bf" report: "Monetary Policy `Does Not Prevent' Recovery"] </F>   [Excerpt] Duesseldorf, 21 Apr -- In the view of its  president, Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank can be satisfied with  its policy. In the introduction to the annual report Tietmeyer  writes that the central bank has carefully sounded out the  existing margin in a difficult situation. With the slowing down  of the persistent inflation and the resulting positive  developments on the financial markets, the preconditions for an  "appropriate and lasting" economic growth have improved  decisively. "Monetary policy did not and does not prevent the  process of economic recovery."    A "short-winded" monetary policy, which would have reduced  the central bank interest rates aggressively and without  consideration for the reemerging expectations of inflation,  would hardly be so successful. "Cautious action, aimed at  making positive expectations permanent, was, in the end, also in  the interest of the other European countries." Also with a view  to the second stage of the European Monetary Union, which has  already begun, no doubts must arise about the orientation of  German monetary policy toward stability.

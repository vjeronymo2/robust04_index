			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Minister of Government German Quiroga interviewed by Carlos </F> Mesa in the "Up Close" television program in Associated  Journalists Television, PAT, studios in La Paz -- live]    [Excerpts] [Mesa] Good evening. Bolivia is currently  experiencing difficult times. It has to prove the strength of  its democratic system and show its ability to resolve a problem  which until very recently no one would have suspected would ever  happen: unproven charges that a political party, and even a  former president, maintained close ties with drug traffickers  and drug trafficking.    This has led to other secondary issues: Bolivian ties with  the United States, our degree of dependency, and our limited  independence.    We will be discussing this and other issues with German  Quiroga, minister of government of President Sanchez de Lozada's  administration. Mr. Quiroga is here with us to discuss, as  already announced, if Bolivia has a strong degree of dependency,  if Bolivia is as submissive as it seems in its bilateral ties,  and how are we to combat drug trafficking in Bolivia.    Good evening sir, and thank you for accepting our  invitation.    [Quiroga] Good evening, and thank you, Carlos. I believe it  is important to discuss the trafficking issue, which is an  increasingly growing phenomenon.    Trafficking is probably the largest multinational company  that has ever existed in the history of humanity. Its networks  have spread worldwide. It has huge fleets of planes and  sophisticated communications systems. They are excellent and  powerful financial experts.    Unfortunately, because of difficult conditions, Bolivia has  become the second largest producer of cocaine in the world.  This has compelled us to think beyond our daily limitations,  beyond political parties, beyond government administrations that  change every four years, and even beyond our borders. The  trafficking issue compels all Bolivians, men and women, to make  a joint effort to halt this harmful problem.    Once we agree on the elemental principle of what trafficking  consists of and its huge dimension, we have to revise many of  the issues linked to the antidrug struggle.    [Mesa] Allow me to ask you an odd question. In practice, is  Bolivia a truly independent and sovereign country?    [Quiroga] Yes, absolutely. It is an independent and  sovereign country, at least in spirit. If we view the issue of  dependency, it is closely tied to economic problems, to  resources. From this point of view, Bolivia is a strongly  interrelated country. Above a true political willingness to  define specific issues -- specifically referring to resources --  there are certain prerequisites which do not allow us to put  them in practice. Today we live in an incredibly interrelated  world. As you might recall, there was a serious scandal a  couple of years ago in the United States because some Japanese  businessmen bought almost a fourth of Manhattan. One of the  most prominent buildings in Manhattan, the Rockefeller Center,  was purchased by the Japanese. Americans took to the streets  with their placards to stage their characteristic protest  demonstrations and say what was wrong with the officials who  allowed the Japanese in.    I mention this just to show that all countries are strongly  interrelated. Bolivia is an independent country because it is  capable of making its own decisions.    [Mesa] But you surely agree that we should not compare  Japanese-U.S. ties with Bolivian-U.S. ties.    [Quiroga] Definitely.    [Mesa] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada views the  situation differently. In his 9 April speech he said Bolivia is  very dependent, although his words were softened when the text  of his speech was published.    [Quiroga] But it is not a permanent dependency, am I right?  Despite the interrelation I mentioned previously, Bolivia is a  very independent country because it enjoys the absolute freedom  to elect its officials and to enforce its own rules and  regulations. So, in spite of what you have said and the great  interdependency among countries, Bolivia enjoys an acceptable  level of sovereignty.    [Mesa] You have just mentioned a key issue regarding  dependency. You have just said that we are absolutely free to  choose our national officials.    Let us view the issue in context. It is obvious that the  U.S. Government -- to which we refer -- does not care who is  appointed social communications minister, or customs director,  or director of the regional sports institute. But obviously it  is interested in who is appointed to the cabinet post that is  directly involved in fighting drug trafficking.    This is the first issue: the difficulty of appointing  officials directly involved in the fight against drugs.    Moreover, there is specific evidence that the U.S.  ambassador  has exerted direct pressure on one president, Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada [as heard]. With or without justification, U.S.  Ambassador Robert Gelbard specifically forced [former President  Jaime] Paz Zamora to request the resignation of [FELCN, Special  Antinarcotics Force, chief] Faustino Rico Toro, General Carvajal  [not further identified], and Interior Minister Guillermo  Capobianco.    Paz Zamora said in an interview that if the U.S. ambassador  disagreed with the appointment of some officials -- who, we  could add, were involved in the fight against drugs -- the  ambassador just had to accept them.    Would you say the U.S. Embassy is today completely  indifferent in this regard, are you saying it accepts and does  not question these appointments with the minister of government,  or is it that the minister of government and other government  officials do not discuss with the ambassador the appointments of  the FELCN chief or other key police officials involved in the  antidrug fight?    [Quiroga] I believe these are completely separate issues.  The sovereignty issue, the freedom of governments and officials  to appoint their government team, is based on confidence.    The fact that Bolivia lost this confidence -- for whatever  reason -- the process of allowing officials to lead the antidrug  struggle with the absolute certainty that it was being properly  handled resulted in different levels of intervention which do  not exist at this time.    Today we are facing a credibility problem in Bolivia. This  is not just the result of what in the last few days has been  described as narcopolitics, it is the result of many things  which have even caused international organizations to lose  confidence in Bolivian authorities. One thing leads to another,  it grows and grows until it is up to the United States to decide  whether the interior minister stays or goes.    Under normal conditions, under conditions of mutual  confidence -- because I am aware that President Clinton is  absolutely certain Sanchez de Lozada will not permit these kinds  of defects -- I reassert that we enjoy complete freedom to  choose our officials.    Probably if we make a first mistake, if we nominate an  official who had ties with drug trafficking, or if we overlook  some ties with drug trafficking, this confidence will be lost  and we will return to this vicious circle. But this is not the  case now.    [Mesa] You mentioned some incidents that caused U.S.  Government officials and international organizations to mistrust  Bolivian officials. Would you say this has just changed  following Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's election? Would you say  the Americans fully trust him, was this an automatic process...    [Quiroga interrupting] No, not at all. This entails a  process. The situation did not change abruptly overnight.  Things do not work like that. This entails a process. It is a  slow and joint effort, based on honesty, which has restored  confidence in Bolivia.    This lack of confidence probably halted what I choose to  call  the nationalization of the drug struggle. Had Bolivia, as a  nation and under the previous administration, not experienced  profound faults in its handling of drug trafficking and not been  associated with drug trafficking, today Bolivia would probably  be playing a more important role in the drug struggle. Although  this was not the case in our bilateral ties with the United  States or in our multilateral ties with international  organizations, we are reacquiring this confidence. Thanks to  the work of a team of men and women at the national level, not  just at the Ministry of Government, we have been able to restore  this confidence.    [Mesa] Theoretically speaking, what would happen if the  government, for any reason, decided to replace the current FELCN  chief and appoint someone else. Would you say the government  would appoint this new authority without consulting -- without  discussing it, if you will -- with the U.S. Embassy?    [Quiroga] I would consult the FELCN and the intelligence  organizations and ask them to give me a report on the background  of the person to be appointed to that post.    [Mesa] Not the U.S. Embassy?    [Quiroga] No, not the embassy because there is an  information  system. Perhaps it would be interesting at this time to define  the FELCN and how it operates...    [Mesa interrupting] ...yes, allow me to...    [Quiroga interrupting] ...to explain...    [Mesa interrupting] .... yes of course...    [Quiroga interrupting] ...then, yes...    [Mesa interrupting] Allow me to pose a few more introductory  questions so that we may later discuss this issue which is of  course very important.    Another important question is whether the Ministry of  Government, which you head, has any U.S. Embassy officials  working inside it?    [Quiroga] No, no.    [Mesa] Did any U.S. Embassy officials work there in the  past?    [Quiroga] I do not know. But there are none at this time.    [Mesa] Are there any policemen, or high-ranking personnel in  charge of coordinating any tasks with the United States -- a  liaison officer? Someone like "Our Man in Havana," as the novel  goes...?    [Quiroga interrupting] ...Well, there are coordinating  activities. There are joint undertakings but at this time no  one can say there is a U.S. Embassy official within the  structure of the Ministry of Government. Absolutely not.    [Mesa] You told me you would like people to know about the  FELCN. First I would like you to explain, how is the Ministry  of Government organized? What does it do? What does it  encompass? What are the responsibilities of the ministry under  you charge?    [Quiroga] Well, the Ministry of Government is divided in two  sections: The domestic control system, under the police force.  This is headed by the Domestic Order and Police National  Secretariat. The other section is the Social Defense Secretariat  which deals with coca, cocaine, and drug prevention. These are  the two main ministry branches from the operational viewpoint.    [Mesa] It is important to explain that the justice system is  no longer under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Government.  This is very important because based on the new organization of  the justice system, the Ministry of Government has ceased to be  in charge of the prosecutors office, etc., is this true?    [Quiroga] Yes, that is correct. [passage omitted]    [Mesa] You have mentioned that many people believe the DEA  is involved in FELCN operations. What is more, Bolivians  believe the DEA is really in charge of conducting intelligence  work and even indirect antidrug operations. Some even say the  Americans arrested Faustino Rico Toro, but this is not the issue  in question.    The BBC has produced a documentary, which we have already  aired on PAT and on which journalist Amalia Pando did some  research. This documentary showed DEA agents kicking down doors  in Chapare. I believe this is not part of the DEA's work.    This is not our invention. It is documented in a film which  shows the operations were planned in Washington in conjunction  with the Southern Command, which is based in Panama, and that  the FELCN chief was merely informed about the operation once it  was complete.    This documentary also shows DEA officials directing  operations aboard a flight to Santa Ana, giving instructions to  the pilots, the Red Devils, and carrying guns.    This is not just theory. It is documented -- not by  ill-intentioned Bolivians but by reputed and objective BBC  journalists who are free of all suspicion.    There is evidence that the DEA is not limiting its  activities  just to advisory or intelligence work.    [Quiroga] As I told you a few minutes ago, the DEA works in  conjunction with two FELCN units, one of them being UMOPAR  [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas].    We are currently implementing a program to gradually  decrease  the number of DEA agents in the country. Those who are working  are personnel contracted by the DEA. They are U.S. police  agents, contracted by the DEA, who have had military training.  The number of those advising and training our police personnel  is gradually decreasing. For example, in 1992 there were 35  Snow Cap agents. In 1993, there were 21. This administration  has agreed with the U.S. Embassy that there will be 11 DEA  agents in Bolivia.    [Mesa] This means then that there are 11 DEA agents in  Bolivia.    [Quiroga] Eleven Snow Cap agents. We are speaking about  UMOPAR and the DEA, not the entire set up because they comprise  completely different and independent units.    There are 11 U.S. officers who were brought in by the DEA  and  who are directly working with Bolivian troops.    In 1991, the year the BBC report was aired -- Operation San  Ramon took place in 1990 -- there were probably about 100 Snow  Cap agents. This number has decreased. At the time Bolivia did  not have trained personnel or the means to conduct antidrug  operations. Let me remind you that at the time we were  conducting antidrug operations using hired gunmen, highly  trained killers -- that is what those Colombians were.    But this is not the case today. Not because Government  Minister Quiroga has more leeway to make independent decisions  than previous government ministers. Not at all. This is  because of current prevailing conditions in UMOPAR and because  of its increasing effectiveness. We now have just 11 U.S.  citizens working closely with our troops.    Beyond the fact that we can make more sovereign decisions,  Bolivian police officers are now in charge of conducting  antidrug operations. They are the ones who conduct the raids  and seize....    [Mesa, interrupting] How many DEA agents are there in  Bolivia?    [Quiroga] Right now there are 33. The number of DEA  officials vary from 25 to 40 or 45. It depends on the season of  the year. Sometimes the Bolivian Government requests the  presence of an expert in a specific field. Sometimes they send  us one or two. They train people in their field and then leave.  At no time are there more than 40 or 45 DEA agents in the  country.    [Mesa] Is there a specific U.S.-Bolivian agreement defining  the limitations, prerogatives, and restrictions on DEA agents?    [Quiroga] There is no specific agreement establishing these  terms. Our ties in this area are mainly based on three  documents signed by the Bolivian and the U.S. Governments.    One is a general document -- the Vienna Convention -- which  defines the prerogatives of representatives of foreign  countries. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rooting for Italy leader Silvio Berlusconi </F> by Vittorio Testa on 24 January in Milan: "A Knight Almost on  Horseback...."]    [Excerpts] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Testa] So, Mr.  Berlusconi, almost everyone is only waiting for you, for your  decision. The meeting between [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and  [League's lower house floor leader] Maroni has taken place, and  they have come to an understanding. The miracle that you hoped  for has happened. What next?    [Berlusconi] I heard about it, and I have just issued a  statement explaining where I stand. That is, I appreciate the  step forward taken by Segni and Maroni toward an accord among  the liberals and moderates opposed to the left-wing forces'  cartel, on a program that we identify with and that expresses  our aspirations and beliefs concerning what the country needs.  We are starting to perceive the formation of a potentially  victorious alliance. I am also very pleased that others too  have come to the realization that the agreement cannot be merely  technical and electoral.    [Testa] According to your wishes, it is only [Italian  People's Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli that is missing  now....    [Berlusconi] Yes, now I hope that Martinazzoli too will  promptly add his unreserved support. We shall see. Meanwhile,  however, we will pursue our own path, proceeding with the  operational phase, because hitherto what has happened exists  only on paper. However, one thing must be quite clear: The  agreement between the liberals and democrats must be based on  the rejection of any unjust discrimination.    [Testa] Yes, but what are the confines of the moderate  alignment?    [Berlusconi] Those of the liberal-democratic area, excluding  extreme positions.    [Testa] So is it all over with [Italian Social Movement  (MSI)  Secretary] Fini?    [Berlusconi] We are watching carefully all that is happening  in the right-wing area and within the National Alliance. We  followed the congress proceedings and are waiting to see the  documents that were approved; I will read them carefully.    [Testa] Let us return to Segni and Martinazzoli.    [Berlusconi] A step forward was taken today, but it is not  complete.    [Testa] Yes, but what if Martinazzoli joins the accord?    [Berlusconi] Let us wait for the PPI's decisions, then we  shall see. But, frankly, I cannot conceal the fact that,  especially in recent hours, I have been subject to pressure from  almost all sides -- private individuals, heads of organizations,  businessmen, people from the financial world, members of Rooting  for Italy, candidates, clubs, ordinary people. I am really  being bombarded with demands. And I have always said that I am  not accustomed to shirking my responsibilities. Everyone is  telling me that in order for there to be a genuine  liberal-democratic pole, it must be truly new. People very much  need new faces, new experiences, and a real change from the old  politics. And everyone is telling me that what there is now was  basically there before.    [Testa] So even if Martinazzoli were to say "yes," would you  stand as a candidate nevertheless?    [Berlusconi] I would be very glad not to. But, I repeat: I  cannot dismiss this pressure, this demand being made of me by  people, a great many people. Moreover, by now Rooting for Italy  is a fully-formed force, a significant force. This was  confirmed by the latest opinion poll.    [Testa] What does the latest opinion poll say? The previous  one granted Rooting for Italy 16.7 percent. What about this one?    [Berlusconi] The figures have rocketed now. Perhaps there  was an announcement effect, insofar as today's newspapers  suggested that I have already decided to enter the arena. There  has been a rise in the figure, a considerable rise.    [Testa] What percentage have you reached now?    [Berlusconi] The figures are not definitely proven yet, but  I  can say that one in four interviewees said that they would vote  for us; in other words, we have 25 percent. [passage omitted]</p>

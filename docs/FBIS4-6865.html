			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the issue of North Korea's  suspected development of nuclear weapons, a top Foreign Ministry  official on 21 April touched on the possibility of Japan  imposing its own economic sanctions against North Korea before  the UN Security Council votes to impose them on that country.  He then said, "Japan has been consulting with the United States  about various options." In this way, the top Foreign Ministry  official hinted at the possibility of both Japan and the United  States imposing their own economic sanctions on North Korea  before the UN Security Council decides to impose them on that  country.    Both Japan and the United States are believed to have been  studying the possibility of imposing their own economic  sanctions on North Korea before the UN Security Council decides  to do so in anticipation that China's opposition to the  sanctions may block the UN Security Council from voting to  impose the economic sanctions, thereby delaying enforcement of  the economic sanctions against the DPRK.    Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister,  and  U.S. Defense Secretary Perry are scheduled to meet on the  morning of 22 April and are likely to discuss this possibility  during their meeting.</p>

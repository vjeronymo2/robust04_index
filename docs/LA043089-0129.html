			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLAMING APPRAISERS  </P> <P> In answer to a question from a reader (Real Estate Q&amp;A, April 16), Robert  J. Bruss has charged the appraisal profession with fee gouging, internecine  warfare and, if I understand correctly, conspiracy to jeopardize the loan  portfolios of all the mortgage lenders.  </P> <P> I would answer the first charge by saying the profession of which he is a  member is considered standard reference on the topic; thus he may be a closet  authority. I would agree that fees should not depend on the value of the  property being appraised. But they do depend on the amount of time necessary to  complete an appraisal.  </P> <P> Proceeding to his second charge, Bruss says, "Yet the appraisal societies are  fighting among themselves." That is true. They are fighting over the quickest  way to enter government regulation Nirvana: become certified, licensed,  sanctified and maybe rise to the rarefied ethical atmosphere occupied by the  American Bar Assn.  </P> <P> His final charge is: "Ask most mortgage lenders, and you will find bad  appraisals are the major cause of their loan losses." There it is. Forget  conventional wisdom attributing the national S&amp;L crisis to deregulation  consequences, ineffective regulatory agency supervision and incompetent or  dishonest management. The appraiser did it.  </P> <P> Most mortgage brokers or loan officers with S&amp;Ls live or die on commission  income paid only for loans funded. Loans based on values documented and  established by the appraiser's opinion of fair market value. Does an appraiser  work for them twice if he, in good faith, undercuts one of their deals?  </P> <P> DAVID M. CALLAHAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Callahan is an independent fee appraiser.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Giorgio Battistini: "President Appeals to </F> Judges, Press, Television"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] "I want to state  clearly," [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary]  Occhetto said, "that it is unacceptable for someone such as  Bettino Craxi -- who has been implicated several times in  serious public offenses -- to permit himself to tour Italy's  attorneys' offices in order to issue slanderous and groundless  charges against the PDS and its officials."    "What Craxi is trying to do," Occhetto continued, "is harm  the PDS and its leadership group. I solemnly declare here and  now that we feel united by this charge brought by someone who is  seeking to lay obstacles and traps in the path of justice. In  the presence of this blackguardly and clumsy initiative, let it  be known that the position of all the comrades slandered by  Craxi -- from Occhetto to D'Alema, Stefanini, and the rest -- is  the same. It is the position of someone who proclaims his own  innocence and aloofness from the Bribe City system, the very  system of which Craxi was no less than the main architect and  leading representative."    Having dealt with Craxi, the secretariat also issued an  appeal to the judiciary urging them not to allow themselves to  be used by "meddlers" and to ensure that at least those working  on delicate inquiries "maintain full control over and full  responsibility for information relating to their work and  decisions. This would prevent the creation of any areas of  uncertainty" that could be occupied by those wanting "to  irremediably undermine the election campaign." For the sake "of  democracy," the PDS calls for a "rigorous, honest, and correct"  election campaign. And it "trusts" that "everyone will  understand this supreme necessity." [passage omitted]</p>

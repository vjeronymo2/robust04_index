			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Arts: London Sinfonietta celebrates 25 years - Music With its penchant for celebrating anniversaries, the London Sinfonietta is spending this season feting its own twenty-fifth. Self-congratulatory, of course, but pardonable: its proud list of past and present commissions in the programme-book for 'Happy Returns', its current South Bank series, must be unmatched by any other band. Most of the music in this series was, indeed, commissioned or co-commissioned by the Sinfonietta and its fraternal Voices, and on average the quality has been bracingly high. Still, claiming 'to have defined the course of contemporary music over these past 25 years' is a bit strong. During that time, and especially since the end of the 1970s, the course of 'contemporary music' has branched into rivulets going every which way. The Sinfonietta has managed to dip a cautious toe into many of them, unlike more doctrinaire ensembles, but mostly it is loyal to its own favourites. And a typical Sinfonietta programme, like Saturday's at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, chiefly demonstrates how disparate and incommensurable even those are. The concert offered extremes of tough- and tender-mindedness, respectively at the outer ends and in between. At the start Oliver Knussen conducted his own Coursing (1979), potent and thrilling as ever; first a wild unison tootling by everybody, gradually overlaid and underpinned by slower strands which at last make a towering wall of sound. All that in just six minutes] The evening concluded with Elliott Carter's 1981 song-cycle In Sleep, in Thunder, which even in a superlative performance like this (the intrepid soloist was Jon Garrison, a fine operatic tenor who could compete with Carter's fierce band) strikes me as one of his toughest pieces to digest. Six Robert Lowell poems are set to angular, high-flying vocal lines, no less vehement than the ensemble with its minatory trumpet. The idea must be to make explicit the dramatic implications of the verse: dark, troubled, bitter; as word-setting, however, it seems a long way off Lowell's quietly tense, gritted-teeth style. In between, we had Robin Holloway's scrupulous, gentle Evening with Angels (1972, but later shorn of its musical 'frame' and a whole song), and a characteristic idyll by Takemitsu. His 1988 Tree Line evinces all the qualities which have kept him laden with commissions from people wanting listener-friendly 'new' music: tranquil and exceedingly pretty, with its delicate sound-palette, in an idiom just a step beyond early Impressionist Roussel or Florent Schmitt. It has been curious to follow Takemitsu's progress, or regress, from music of tiny, exquisite flourishes in an impeccably atonal postwar idiom to his recent canvases, which glow so sweetly and sound so old and familiar. To be fair, they are always shapely in ways which are his very own. A new piece by the emigre Dmitri Smirnov, The River of Life ' inspired by a Blake watercolour ' sounded equally sincere and out-of-its-time. Here, though, the harking-back was to Skryabin: not to his exacerbated harmony (Smirnov uses quasi-serial note-patterns, planned to afford plenty of major triads), but to his tremulous ecstasies. As the vision developed, a soulful trumpet sealed the resemblance. Skryabin himself, however, might have stopped short of putting harp, celesta and glockenspiel in unison to make his celestial effects.</p>

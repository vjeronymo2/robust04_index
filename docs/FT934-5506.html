			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Growing threat to Israel-PLO deal A fortnight before Israel is due to begin pulling troops out of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank's Jericho region, dissident members of the PLO's mainstream Fatah faction threatened yesterday to resume the armed struggle, and Israeli and PLO negotiators remained at loggerheads over a number of crucial issues. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said that while he still hoped all autonomy arrangements would be finalised in time for the December 13 start of the troop withdrawal, he did not intend to give ground merely to ease the negotiating process. He said Israel needed satisfactory understandings on security for Jewish settlers and for other Israelis travelling on main roads of the occupied territories, on the precise Jericho boundaries and on control of the autonomous areas' external borders. It would be better to delay autonomy by two or three weeks, he said, if that would guarantee 'a clear agreement which won't cause misunderstandings in the implementation'. Delegates from Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation resumed their autonomy talks in Cairo yesterday. Mr Nabil Sha'ath, chief PLO negotiator, said there had been progress on the demand for release of the 10,000 Palestinians prisoners held in Israeli jails. But he said that 'the Israelis are really not moving on the issues that separate us. . . There is the threat that Israel will not withdraw on December 13'. In the occupied territories there were signs of growing impatience at the lack of progress. On Sunday night, undercover troops shot dead a member of the Fatah Hawks in a Gaza refugee camp. About 5,000 people attended his funeral yesterday, and members of the Hawks distributed leaflets announcing a return to the gun. Shots were fired at two Israeli police stations and three army bases.</p>

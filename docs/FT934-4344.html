			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Clinton welfare reform plan comes under fire The Clinton administration is nearing completion of its welfare reform plan but already faces controversy over how to pay for the changes. While officials believe the plan will eventually save money by encouraging people out of the welfare system and into the workplace, it will require considerable government spending to provide training, job schemes, childcare and medical coverage. Proposals to pay for these measures by cutting other programmes have already drawn scepticism from members of Congress who feel there is little fat left to be used in the system, but the administration is nervous about any semblance of a tax increase to pay for the reforms. President Bill Clinton said yesterday he was encouraged to believe that a bipartisan welfare reform plan could be achieved by a counter-proposal from Republicans in Congress. 'I don't agree with all of it, but there are some very good ideas in it,' he said. 'We are moving toward making welfare a second chance, not a way of life.' Mr Clinton's plan, like the Republican proposal, would require welfare recipients who have spent more than two years on the welfare rolls to work in return for their benefits. But debates have been vigorous on how severely the cut-off of benefits should be applied, how the work requirement should be enforced, and how long people could remain in government-run job schemes before being abandoned altogether.</p>

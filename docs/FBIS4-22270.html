			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Pustogarov, Dr of Law: "More Questions </F> Than Answers: On the International Ties of the Subjects of the  Russian Federation"]    [Text] Comparatively recently, new energetic  figures--"subjects of the Russian Federation," Yaroslavl Oblast  and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya), Buryatiya, and St.  Petersburg have appeared in the international arena: They send  official delegations abroad, they sign agreements with partners  from the near and the far abroad, and they open representations  there. In the case of some subjects of the Russian Federation,  the agreements with foreign states number already in the dozens,  but, very likely, not a single federal department has a complete  picture of their international activity today, since these  international ties are developing in many respects chaotically,  without the proper coordination within the scales of the  Federation.    The chief reason for the chaotic development is the lack of  a  corresponding legal base. The only provision that one can be  guided by is one of the points of Article 72, which includes  "the coordination of international and foreign economic  relations of the subjects of the Russian Federation" among the  subjects of joint jurisdiction. Consultation of the Federal  Agreement allows one to clarify that the subjects of the Russian  Federation are "independent participants" of such ties (Article  III).    The available legislative base is not only scant, but  extremely indeterminate, and at times poorly formulated. It  gives rise to more perplexed questions than it provides clear  answers. What is meant by "international ties?" The authors of  the Constitution clearly wanted to underscore that these are not  "international relations" that pertain to the jurisdiction of  the Federation itself. But in what consists the difference  between them? Elucidations in regard to this cannot be found  either in the Constitution, or in foreign legislation, or in  international law. It must be stated that the key concept of our  legal base--"international ties" does not have a concrete  juridical content.    And what is an "independent participant of international  ties?" In relation to whom is it independent? In relation to the  Federation? And to what extent is it independent--without any  limitations or with limitations? As we see, this concept, too,  does not have concrete juridical content, and it is impossible  to find its interpretation [rasshifrovka] either in foreign  legislation or in international law, since such a term does not  exist there.    Perhaps, things are still more difficult with respect to  "the  coordination of international relations." Throughout the world  the coordination of the international activity of the subjects  of the federation is effected (in various forms) by the federal  authorities. Originally (in the Federal Agreement) this is how  it was planned in our country, too. But the Constitution for  some reason included such coordination in the joint  jurisdiction. In practice, this means that coordination of the  international relations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, to put it mildly, is  not entirely lawful, since both ministries are not joint organs,  but organs of the federal executive authority.    De facto there exists at the present time a vast vacuum in  the sphere under review--a vacuum that may have serious negative  consequences and for this reason should be filled very soon.    From a legal standpoint, the best way out of the situation  that has developed would be the adoption of a relevant  constitutional amendment [novella]. However, the present policy  and juridical situation in the country make such a path  improbable. A more realistic and satisfactory solution is the  adoption of a federal law on the international and foreign  economic ties of the subjects of the Russian Federation.    In the given context, there is no possibility of examining  the conception of such a law. But it is expedient to point out  some key aspects.    Taking into account world practice and our own experience,  the right of the subjects of the Russian Federation to  agreements with foreign states should be anchored in the law.  Here one can utilize the experience of the FRG, whose  Constitution establishes: "In so far as the laender [states]  have the power to legislate, they may, with the consent of the  Federal Government, conclude treaties with foreign states"  (Article 32).    The law should precisely define the rights of the subjects  of  the Russian Federation to permanent representations abroad. The  subjects of other federations have many dozens of such  representations, and the rich world experience must find  reflection in the law. In particular, it is important to point  out that the foreign representations of the Russian Federation  act outside the sphere of the authority of the embassies and  consulates of the Federation.    The law will have to establish a concrete mechanism for the  coordination of the international activity of the subjects of  the Russian Federation in accordance with both the Constitution  and with international law. Here it is expedient to establish a  mechanism for the examination of disputes in regard to the  application of the powers of the Federation and its subjects.    The law, naturally, must establish the rights as well as the  obligations of the subjects of the Russian Federation, including  the conscientious fulfillment of both their own international  obligations and the obligations of the Federation. The  agreements of the subjects of the Russian Federation must not  contradict the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the  international obligations of the Russian Federation.    Finally, the law must establish that the maintenance of  international links is effected by the subjects of the Russian  Federation at their own expense. This last limitation, possibly,  will break up some ambitious designs, but it is necessary for  the development of normal federative relations.    On the whole, the law is called upon to guarantee the unity  and effectiveness of the international activity of the Russian  Federation on the basis of the powers of the Federation and its  subjects and with mutual consideration of their interests.    In the discussion of the proposed law, it should be taken  into account that at the present time, in the overwhelming  majority, the 89 subjects of the Russian Federation have neither  sufficient experience nor an adequate number of trained  personnel. If it is our desire for the law to function on the  level of international standards, it is necessary to assist the  subjects of the Russian Federation. Since the problem has  all-Russian dimensions, the adoption of a long-term federal  program of support for the international ties of the Russian  Federation is expedient, in my view.</p>

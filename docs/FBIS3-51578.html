			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Ramon J. Velasquez has responded to the  charges made by the Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of  Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] president  [Edgardo Romero Nava] that the government is partly responsible  for what happened at Banco Latino. Velasquez said emphatically  that the government had been closely watching the bank since  November. Finance Minister Silva said the Banco Latino disaster  was due to the risks top bank officials took with bank funds  rather than to withdrawals made by state institutions.    [Begin recording] [Velasquez] I want to emphasize that I  have been monitoring this case since late November. I have  continually held night meetings with those who are bound by law  to [words indistinct]. We have had countless night meetings  with the finance minister; the Central Bank president [Ruth de  Krivoy]; Bank Superintendent Roger Urbina; Bank Superintendent  Negron; Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] President Esperanza  Martino; Dr. Hernan Anzola, government representative at the  Central Bank; and Banco Latino shareholders. I had to trust the  information given to me by the Bank Superintendency and by the  Central Bank, so what Dr. Romero said is untrue. I have been  very interested in this case because it is my job. However, I  had to accept the information provided to me by the Bank  Superintendency as the truth.    [Silva] This institution's history is linked to the  political advancement of some of its leaders, but this is  something that will be explained in due time. [end recording]    Just as President Velasquez had, [Deputy] Reinaldo Cervini  rejected the charges made by the Fedecamaras president and  called for a thorough investigation.    Renowned expert Domingo Maza Zabala also spoke about the  case  after meeting with President Velasquez, saying that people must  believe that the financial system will solve this crisis and  that their funds will be recovered. However, Maza also thinks  that specific responsibilities must be determined.    [Begin recording] [Maza] The financial institutions must be  interested in clarifying what happened and how it happened. The  new banking law must be good and efficient in order to correct  these irregularities, mistakes, and vices of bank management,  because the banking service is not a private business but an  eminently public service in which the state must be interested  and for which it must be responsible.    [Cervini] It is distressing to realize that what happened at  the Commerce Bank or at the National Discount Bank could happen  in Venezuela; that rich businessmen, such as (Gonzalo de  Roldoma) and his son, are stashing their fortunes abroad but  keeping bankrupt businesses in Venezuela. This must stop. If  shareholders are responsible, they must be liable. The concept  of financial crime must be established [as heard]. I don't  think the country should operate under privately enforced rules.  This is not a state problem. It is a state problem, however,  to improve the General Bank Superintendency [Superintendencia  General de Bancos]. [end recording]    Domingo Maza Zabala also spoke about the possibility that  the  National Congress may repeal or amend the value-added tax [VAT].  He thinks the Venezuelan fiscal system requires sweeping reforms  and recommends that if the National Congress decides to repeal  VAT, it will have to seek other fiscal revenues to replace those  generated by VAT. He added that if it is not done, much larger  economic imbalances will be created.</p>

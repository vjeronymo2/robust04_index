			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BOC It is rough justice that BOC's effort to blaze a trail in financial reporting highlights what a hash it made of US home healthcare. Under old accounting rules a small book profit on the sale of Glasrock would have flattered yesterday's full year results. In fact the figures are overshadowed by an ugly Pounds 117m write-off of goodwill against earnings. Taken with historic profit figures for discontinued business - another innovation - and last year's reorganisation provision, Glasrock looks to have been a mistake on the scale of BOC's involvement with carbon graphite in the 1980s. The broader question is whether BOC can make a better fist of its remaining healthcare activity. The market might be forgiven for wondering whether the latest venture in biotechnology will be equally botched. With research expenditure on the project running at only Pounds 8m a year, though, this is hardly the biggest threat. More immediately, competition from generic drugs in the US means that BOC's new anaesthetic, Suprane, will have to perform well just to maintain healthcare profits this year. Conditions in industrial gases are no better than at the nine-month stage. The UK market took another lurch down in the fourth quarter. Japan is slowing and US demand is flat. All the more impressive, then, that operating profits from gases were 12 per cent higher once changes in exchange rates are stripped out. While earnings are clouded by the write-off and changes in presentation, BOC's promise to increase the dividend is backed by a formidable ability to generate cash. The company paid back debt last year despite an ambitious capital expenditure programme. The new-style cash flow statement should be one change in accounting standards which works in BOC's favour.</p>

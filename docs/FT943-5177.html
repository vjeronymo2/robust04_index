			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Rate rise fears ease on lower consumer borrowing The patchy nature of the recovery in UK consumer confidence was underlined yesterday after official figures showed that consumer borrowing and new mortgage lending fell back sharply in July. The figures disappointed the City and slightly damped fears about an imminent rise in UK base rates. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, will hold their monthly monetary meeting tomorrow. But although financial markets still indicate that an interest rate rise will occur soon, the weaker consumer data yesterday led some economists to suggest the rise might be delayed until late in the year. According to the Central Statistical Office, net lending to consumers through finance houses, credit cards in the Visa and Mastercard system and non-mortgage building society loans fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 296m in July. Net lending in June was a record Pounds 683m. Measured on a three-monthly basis - a more accurate guide to the underlying trend - net lending to consumers fell to Pounds 1.19bn in the three months to July, down from Pounds 1.28bn in the three months to April. The main reason for the monthly fall, the CSO said, was a significant repayment of credit card debt. But with monthly credit figures known to be volatile, analysts were divided about the significance of July's drop. Although some argued that the data pointed to a weakening in consumer spending, as April's tax rises gradually began to bite, others argued that the figures had been distorted by June's record surge in consumer credit. Doubts about consumer confidence were reinforced yesterday with the publication of Bank of England figures for new mortgage lending in July. On a seasonally adjusted basis lending undertaken and loans approved in total by banks and building societies in July was at a lower level than in June. City doubts about a rate rise were backed by Bank of England figures showing the annual rate of growth for M0, the narrowest measure of money supply, fell to 6.2 per cent in August - its third consecutive monthly slowdown. Some analysts suggested that this fall might lessen the likelihood of an interest rate rise. But others pointed out that M0's annual growth rate remained well outside the government's 0-4 per cent target range and had been slightly distorted by a sharp fall in the level of bank deposits.

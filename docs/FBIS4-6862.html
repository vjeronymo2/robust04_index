			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan and the United States will start informal  vice-ministerial negotiations on the Japan-U.S. framework talks,  which have been broken off, after the Golden Week holidays [from  the end of April through early May]. It was revealed on 23  April that there are differences between Japan and the United  States in their views on the connection between the goal of the  framework talks themselves, and individual sectors.    The point at issue is the overall goal of the framework  talks  mentioned in the joint statement about a bilateral agreement on  a new framework for trade talks, which was reached between the  Japanese and U.S. leaders in July last year. The statement  stipulated that a goal of the framework talks is to  "substantially increase access and sales of competitive foreign  goods and services." While the United States believes that this  goal is applied to every individual sector such as insurance,  Japan understands this "is not applied to all sectors." The  breaking of the deadlock in the framework talks will possibly  depend on whether both sides can fill the recognition gap.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR) Mickey Kantor met in Marrakech, Morocco, on 15 April. In  making a new proposal during the meeting, Kantor stated that the  framework talks would be resumed on the condition that progress  should be made in three areas: macroeconomy; the overall goal;  and objective criteria. There have so far been clear  differences between Japan and the United States in their views  on macroeconomy and objective criteria. However, Kantor's new  proposal "indicated obviously for the first time that Japan and  the United States differ in views on interpretation of the  overall goal" of the economic framework talks (as stated by a  top official at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry).    According a source at the negotiations, the U.S.  understanding is that the improvement in access of competitive  foreign products "is the overall goal of the framework talks and  this applies to every individual sector." It is observed that  this U.S. view has led to its demand that numerical targets be  set in all of the three priority sectors, including automobiles  and auto parts. On the other hand, Japan maintains: "Of the  three priority sectors, the goal of the government procurement  sector is the same as that of the framework talks themselves.  However, while the goal of the insurance sector is  deregulation, that of the automobile and auto parts sector is  the improvement in chances for access."    The handling of the overall goal will inevitably become an  important topic at informal negotiations from now on. If Japan  generally promises "increased sales of competitive foreign  goods," the United States will be satisfied with it. Will Japan  and the United States discuss individual sectors in light of the  characteristics of each sector? Or, will they apply the overall  goal to each individual sector and recall arguments on numerical  targets? Attention will be focused on moves by both Japan and  the United States.</p>

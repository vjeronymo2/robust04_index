Aksenoka's explanations followed to a note from the Russian  Embassy in Riga to the Latvian Foreign Ministry. The note said  the publications in the national radical ATMATA and PAVALSTNIEKS  papers endanger the mentioned servicemen and complicate  relations between Latvia and Russia.    The note describes as provocative headlines "They are  Occupants" and "Under their Feet the Land Moans" and says  Russian diplomats hope that Latvian authorities will take legal  steps to prevent further incidents.    The Prosecutor's Office, however, can only bring charges for  misinformation. So far, it has received no claims that the  published information was not true, said Deputy Prosecutor  General Edvins Ziedins.    If there is enough evidence to prove that the publications  called for violence, the papers may face adequate charges with a  prospect of being closed, said Aksenoka.</p>

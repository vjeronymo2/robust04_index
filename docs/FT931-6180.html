			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Ukraine N-arms 'leaking radiation' UKRAINE'S nuclear missiles are leaking dangerous amounts of radiation because Kiev is refusing to give Russia access to the weapons for maintenance, General Mikhail Koleznikov, head of the general headquarters of the Russian army, said yesterday. 'According to our data,the radiation levels from some sites exceed the permissible levels by thousands of times,' Gen Koleznikov said. The state of the weapons was now 'very serious'. Russia had 'lost control' of the missiles and could no longer take responsibility for their safety. Mr Boris Tarasiuk, Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, yesterday described the latest Russian claims as 'imaginings'. He said Russia was pressing Ukraine to give up the missiles. 'According to our experts the state of the nuclear missiles located on Ukrainian territory in no way differs from that of the missiles found in Russia,' Mr Tarasiuk said. He said that Russian experts had full access to the missiles to perform necessary maintenance and that Ukraine was fully prepared to pay for Russian spare parts. A senior Nato diplomat in Kiev said yesterday that he was concerned about the safety of the warheads and hoped the issue would be resolved quickly. He said it was difficult to determine the true state of the missiles 'but I am more inclined to believe the Ukrainian claims'. Mr Shaun Gregory, a nuclear weapons specialist at the University of Bradford's School of Peace Studies, said nuclear materials would deteriorate more rapidly in older and less sophisticated weapons such as the six-warhead SS-19 missiles, which were deployed more than 10 years ago. Ukraine has 130 of these missiles at Khmel'Nitskiy and Pervomaysk. Warheads would normally be refurbished every couple of years, Mr Gregory said.</p>

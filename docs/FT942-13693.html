			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Inchcape makes agreed Pounds 176.6m bid for Hogg Inchcape, the motor distributor and services company, yesterday announced a Pounds 176.6m bid for Hogg Group, which it hopes to merge with its own insurance broking subsidiary, Bain Clarkson. Hogg Group's board has recommended the cash offer which, if it goes ahead, will create the seventh largest insurance broker in the world. Shareholders' approval for the deal is expected, especially following the decision by HSBC to sell its 6 per cent stake in Hogg yesterday afternoon. HSBC, along with Inchcape, had been one of the groups to show interest in Hogg in recent weeks, whose share price fell sharply earlier this year following a profits warning. The deal, the biggest in the insurance broking sector since the Chicago-based Aon Group, acquired Frank B Hall for some Dollars 475m (Pounds 325.3m) in July 1992, has followed extensive speculation about consolidation among a range of medium-sized UK insurance broking groups which are under growing pressure from larger rivals. Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, said Inchcape had been seeking to increase the size of its broking activities through an acquisition for more than a year. It expected to seek a stock market listing for the new entity within the next two years. The group will, through this merger, take a big step towards achieving its strategic aim of creating a leading company in another of its core businesses, said Mr Mackay. Bain Clarkson had been highly profitable in recent years, but if it was 'unable to move from the middle ground' it would be 'squeezed by cost competition.' Mr Anthony Howland Jackson, Hogg's chairman, said he was 'delighted' with the offer, which would make the enlarged company a market leader in UK commercial broking. Mr Howland Jackson, who once worked with Bain Clarkson, will become chairman of the new group, with Bain's chairman, Mr Simon Arnold, taking the role of deputy chairman. Bain's chief executive Mr Ron Forrest, who recently joined from Alexander &amp; Alexander, will take over as chief executive of the new group once the offer becomes unconditional. Bain Clarkson's strength in the UK, Europe, the Far East and south-east Asia compliments Hogg's strength in North America, Australasia, Africa and Latin America. In the UK, Hogg is well known in the market for its expertise in the credit and political risk areas. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, advised Inchcape. Hogg, which was advised by NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, expects to write to its shareholders before the end of next week. The deal values Hogg ordinary shares at 255p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tighina (Bender), BASAPRSS, 22/6/1994 -- The Joint  Control Commission held today in Tighina (Bender) a meeting. At  the Moldovan delegation's proposal, the sides kept a moment of  silence in the memory of those died in the World War II at the  beginning of the meeting. Then the joint military command  presented a report on the situation in the security zone during  last week. The group for investigating the chases of those  disappeared without trace during the 1992 armed conflict also  presented a report. The session discoursed the project on  cooperation between the Joint Control Commission and CSCE in the  security zone proposed by the CSCE mission to Moldova. The  report of the Joint Military Command indicated that a grenade  and 16 cartridges were confiscated from a Tighina inhabitant  last week. Some 107 people were detained for violating the  regulations of the security zone. The report also states that  the Dniester side again impeded the Joint Control Commission  from inspecting the Tighina fortress where as it was earlier  reported a Dniester motorized battalion is located. The report  also mentioned that Dniestr guardians detained a car belonging  to the Moldovan peace-keeping forces. The Dniester guardians  were located in the security zone contrary to the 1992 agreement  between the Moldovan and Russian Presidents. It was suggested  that the parties examine the CSCE mission's proposal and discuss  it at a new joint session with the CSCE mission representatives.</p>

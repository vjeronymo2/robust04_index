			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Cuts draw blood on US campuses: Cash-strapped universities are wielding the axe YALE UNIVERSITY, for 292 years a breeding ground of America's ruling elite, has seen better days. Entire academic disciplines are on the cutting block. Many faculty positions and sports teams are already gone. Even Commons, the Greek revival hall where undergraduates have taken meals throughout this century, has been closed for dinner. An Dollars 18.5m budget shortfall, the second in as many years, has forced the country's third-oldest establishment of higher education down this path of contraction. And Yale is not alone. It is a debt struggle that is going on everywhere, says Acting President Howard Lamar, an avuncular historian brought in to calm waters when the previous president, Mr Benno Schmidt Jr, resigned after trying unsuccessfully to make drastic cuts last year. Mr Lamar, who has tapped Professor William Nordhaus, the Keynesian economist, to help put the fiscal house in order, quickly adds that Yale, with a Dollars 2.6bn endowment, is 'far less desperate' than other universities. New York's Columbia University, another bastion of the east coast Ivy League, plans a Dollars 30m deficit over the next two years on its annual Dollars 1bn budget. In California, Stanford University has begun efforts to eradicate a Dollars 125m deficit over the next three years. Less well known schools like the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut have even threatened bankruptcy. The reasons are clear. Rising faculty salaries and health care costs which have grown by 360 per cent in the past eight years, have strained budgets. Potentially lucrative research in fields such as particle physics and molecular biology is capital intensive and the federal government, with its own budget pressures, does not want to continue footing most of the bill. State schools face additional pressure from fidgety legislatures. For the first time in 33 years, state support for higher education went down last year. In California, the state legislature, struggling with a Dollars 10.7bn deficit, cut the education budget by Dollars 2.2bn, roughly 12 per cent. The allocation to nine-campus University of California system, which includes Berkeley, was cut by 11 per cent. The university, once a model for other state systems, has frozen pay, cut 5,000 jobs and doubled student fees over the past two years. A proposal to reduce salaries by 5 per cent across the board is on the table. 'A great university is a fairly fragile body,' laments Mr William Baker, University of California vice-president for finance and administration. 'It can be destroyed in a short time, but it takes years and years to build up excellence.' The universities, meanwhile, are getting less sympathy than they used to. This reflects a popular sense, frequently evident in local newspapers, that academia has become bloated, combined with a number of embarrassing disclosures that some universities, notably Stanford, have misused federal funds. Officials at Stanford and other universities say the government has harnessed an anti-intellectual populist sentiment to shrink support for the sciences. But Mr Erich Bloch, who ran the National Science Foundation in 1984-91, points out that after 30 years of steady growth the government must level support. Tuition has also done little to endear universities to the middle-classes, too rich to qualify for financial aid but too poor to afford large term bills. Just last week, Yale became the first US university to break the Dollars 25,000 a year fee threshold. The 5.9 per cent increase was the school's lowest in 20 years but still far outpaced inflation. More troubling is the sense that the money is wasted. American faculties, faculty members, notorious for spending little time in the class, have developed a taste for lucrative research or writing books. After all, those are the criteria for achieving academic tenure. Congress, which called academics to account on science funding, has responded to the public unease. Ms Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat, last autumn held a well publicised select hearing under the loaded title, 'College Education: Paying More and Getting Less'. Academics feel a bit indignant. A lot of good research, particularly in the emerging biotechnology field, is done at universities. The misuse of funds at most universities was scant in relation to the volume of research, it is frequently argued. 'It's plain to everybody that it was blown out of proportion,' says Professor Donald Kennedy, former Stanford president. What is not clear is whether the squeeze is a cyclical readjustment or a permanent shift. Faculties were reduced in the 1970s. And the bureaucratic cuts are probably long overdue. But, this time, universities have been forced to rethink their long-term priorities and, quite without precedent, to pick and choose their strengths. This idea of 'selective excellence' - often associated with Mr Robert Zemsky, who runs the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania - works on the assumption that schools got too big for their own good during 1980s. Yale followed this creed last year by trying to trim the applied sciences, such as engineering, sociology, applied physics and operations research, along with 10.7 per cent of the faculty. The faculty rebuffed the measure, and along with it the president, provost and dean. But some departments may still go. In any case, universities seem ready for a fresh start after a tumultuous year. Duke, Columbia and the University of Chicago have named new presidents. Mr Gerhard Casper, the German-born scholar who took over at Stanford last autumn, has worked quietly to restore the university's tarnished reputation. Yale has yet to name a chief executive. Not surprisingly, the leading candidates are good administrators - often with a background in economics.</p>

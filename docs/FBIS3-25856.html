They emphasized that mountainous areas are the key to  whether Beijing can achieve a fairly comfortable standard of  living. All trades and professions in the municipality should  support the development of mountainous areas, visit these areas  more often, and make contributions to their development.    Fanzipai Village used to be the poorest village in Beijing's  suburban mountainous areas. Chen Xitong has come to the village  seven times since early 1990, when Chen Xitong came to the  village to help it shake off poverty. Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan  arrived in the village by a minibus very early in the morning.  They first listened to reports given by Li Yonghua, secretary  of the village party committee; and Zhang Lianyin, head of Miyun  County.    Fanzipai Village again reached new heights in development in  various trades in 1993. Its industrial and agricultural output  value was 30 million yuan, up 50 percent from the preceding  year; its per capita income was 1,150 yuan, up 3 times from the  290 yuan of 1989; output of haw was 1.22 million kg, up 100  percent; and number of goats in stock was 540, which enabled 50  households to earn more than 1,000 yuan. [passage omitted]    Chen Xitong gave a speech to affirm the great progress  achieved by the village and urge it to make continuous efforts  to tap its potential. He said: Miyun used to be a  revolutionary base area during the revolutionary war years.  After liberation, Miyun people made tremendous and special  contributions to the capital by building the Miyun reservoir.  It would be unfair to the people of Miyun County if we did not  help its mountainous areas to promote their economy.    Chen Xitong pointed out: Mountainous areas are the key to  whether Beijing can achieve a fairly comfortable standard of  living. Beijing's mountainous areas have a population of 1.5  million and 60 economically less developed villages, thus  lagging far behind the plain areas. If the economy of the  mountainous areas is not promoted, and many villages and  households remain poor, Beijing will have a big difficulty in  achieving a fairly comfortable standard of living.    He emphasized: All trades and professions in the  municipality should support the development of mountainous  areas, which is their duty and an honor permitting no turning  back. Instead of visiting advanced localities and units or  attending parties, their leaders should visit mountainous areas  more often to conduct investigation and study to learn about the  situation and help solve specific problems. All departments,  committees, and offices of the municipal party committee and  government and large and medium-sized enterprises should also  visit mountainous areas more often, not just during Spring  Festival, to help solve problems together. Mountainous areas  continue to be the largest problem in Beijing's endeavor to  achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living. If everyone  makes concerted efforts and contributions together, mountainous  areas will be developed more rapidly. This is a task we should  fulfill if Beijing is to achieve a fairly comfortable standard  of living three years ahead of schedule. It should be given  wide publicity in the municipality.    Chen Xitong said: Development of the mountainous areas is an  important part of the development of the capital. We should  make more reports to the central departments and welcome them to  develop the capital with us and to support and help the  development of the mountainous areas. We should also establish  more ties with other provinces and municipalities and welcome  them to help the capital in developing mountainous areas. In  short, we should mobilize the forces and positive factors from  all quarters to accelerate the development of Beijing's  mountainous areas.    He pointed out: The municipal rural work conference held not  long ago was a very important conference. Mountainous areas  should make particular efforts to conscientiously implement the  new ideas and new moves put forward at the conference and, on  the premise that laws and plans are abided by, further relax  policies. It is a good thing, not a capitalist thing, for  households in mountainous areas to earn 1 million or even 10  million yuan. We should relax policies resolutely and act  bravely.

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Television (Saturday): Meatiest dishes to be found in restaurants This is a good day for staying as far away as possible from the television screen: up a mountain, out on an estuary, or tucked into a nice little Anglo-Italian restaurant eating something meaty with the currently ubiquitous onion marmalade perhaps. Start with pasta because the British are now so much better at cooking it: al dente is more common today than boiled slimy, and real potato gnocchi . . . whoops, sorry, television. For those with flu or babysitting obligations the trick is to hunt around the edges of all the weekend rubbish and Easter treats. BBC2 promises Monty Python's Fligender Zirkus, a special episode of the famous series, made for German television and not shown in Britain since 1973. All the chaps are featured including John Cleese and Michael Palin, as is Connie Booth who went on to create 'Fawlty Towers' with Cleese (5.35 BBC2). A little later BBC2 shows the semi-final for brass players in the Young Musician Of The Year competition (7.05). The late Dieter Plage, one of the world's greatest wildlife cameramen, followed in the footsteps of the explorer Wilfred Thesiger, penetrating the hot and desolate regions of Ethiopia, to make 'Forbidden Desert Of The Danakil' in Channel 4's Kingdoms In Conflict series (8.00). BBC2 is running a series called Arena Relics which today features 'Curse Of The Firebeetle'. Described as 'a spaghetti western for the 1990s' and set against the civil war in Peru, this tells the story of Ortiz, a grave robber who happens upon the huge golden shield of the ancient sun god, Atahualpa, and sets off for Lima to sell it (9.10 BBC2).</p>

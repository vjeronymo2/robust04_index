			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Shares system 'will cost Pounds 30m' Total capital costs for the Bank of England's proposed Crest share settlements project will be Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m, with the core processing system costing only Pounds 5m, far less than the failed Taurus programme it is intended to replace. Taurus, proposed but abandoned by the Stock Exchange earlier this year, would have cost about Pounds 75m. 'We could build (Crest) for less than the annual cost of running Talisman,' said Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England, referringto the Stock Exchange's current settlements system. Mr Kent said that Crest could start operations as early as mid-1996. The Bank's Crest committee, of which Mr Kent is chairman, unveiled the project specifications yesterday. They are far less comprehensive than was envisaged for Taurus. Like Taurus, however, Crest aims to to replace the use of paper share certificates with electronic records of share ownership. Those who want to retain certificates may continue to do so. Mr Kent said: 'This is going to end the paper chase.' Unlike Taurus, Crest will not accept credit risk to its members or to settlement banks 'so far as is practicable'. It will not take responsibility for 'reporting', which means that users will have to design their own information systems to carry necessary data in a form they can use. It will not provide users with analysis or aggregate of bargains. While this may require greater spending by some members, smaller participants involved only in equities will be able to buy a specialised personal computer package from a commercial provider, which will cut their costs. Mr Kent said that the question of ownership of the system would be addressed by the committee at the beginning of February.</p>

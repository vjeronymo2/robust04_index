			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Stamping out Greece's pine fires There are few trees so inflammable as the resinous Aleppo pine that provides a green backdrop for summer villas and tourist resorts along much of Greece's coastline. When fire breaks out, exploding pine cones shoot out in all directions. Last year, a record number of fires devastated more than 50,000 hectares of forest, scrub and grazing land around Greece. The forestry service logged 2,100 fires - almost double the average for the three previous years - in a season marked by prolonged hot weather and fierce winds. Despite increased spending on firefighting aircraft, communications systems and hiring several thousand temporary forest guards for the summer, governments have failed to establish an effective fire protection system. Indeed, as firefighting methods grow more sophisticated, it becomes harder to enlist public support for the forestry service. 'People just sit in the cafe watching the fire and waiting for the aeroplanes to start dropping water,' says Dimitris Katsoudas, the government's secretary general for forestry. However, the disastrous fires in 1992, including blazes on Rhodes and Crete, Greece's two most popular tourist islands, prompted a switch in policy. The government says it will shortly seek bids from private companies to set up a nationwide fire protection service. Greece's pine forests have grown more vulnerable to fire because of steady depopulation of the countryside, together with the encroachment of tourism. Access to forest areas became easier as the coastline was opened up for development. Villagers who return home for the summer to cater for tourists no longer make use of the forest. 'Woodland isn't considered a resource. The charcoal-burners and resin-tappers are gone. Dry branches and undergrowth aren't collected for fuel so when a fire starts there's a wealth of combustible material,' says George Mavrommatis, head of the Forest Research Institute in Athens. What Greece needs is better prevention techniques and improved co-ordination in firefighting, according to Conair, a Canadian company that has studied forest fires in Greece and operates fire protection services in other Mediterranean countries. 'Communications and training are crucial in firefighting. Aircraft should be used with discrimination - after all, you have no guarantee the fire is out without people on the ground,' says Jim Dunkel, Conair's vice president. Without better prevention, the coastal forests will go on shrinking. Regardless of the law on reforestation, only about 10 per cent of burned acreage is replanted in an average year, mainly because the forestry service is chronically short of funds. This year, the figure will rise to 20 per cent thanks to support from the European Community, which will cover 75 per cent of the Dr8bn (Pounds 24m) cost of replanting 10,000 hectares. Although Aleppo pine is often used for replanting as it grows quickly, the Forest Research Institute has pioneered cultivation of less inflammable trees. It recommends planting spiny varieties of oak similar to those that covered Greek hillsides in ancient times. Yet the chances of restoring forest cover are sharply reduced unless barriers are built to stop soil erosion and water loss. And even if the water-table remains high enough to support tree growth, young saplings are often eaten by roaming goats. 'The biggest enemy of forest regeneration is the huge goat population in Greece of about 6m. Goat herds are in short supply these days, but EC subsidies encourage farmers to keep goats, who let them run free much of the time,' says Katsoudas.</p>

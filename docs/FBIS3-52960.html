House Speakership member brother  Muhammad al-Khadim al-Wajih attended.    At the outset of the meeting, the house speaker noted that  the House of Representatives, through its sessions and also  through the follow-up committee it has formed to find the facts  pertaining to the crisis, will continue to play its effective  national role to resolve the crisis, given the fact that the  House of Representatives is the legislative authority elected by  the people. He added: Moreover, it is this house that began the  efforts to address the crisis when it issued its statement on  the crisis on 5 November 1993 and formed a fact-finding  committee from among its members.    The brother house speaker went on to say that the task of  addressing the crisis must remain, first and foremost, within  the confines of the Presidential Council, the House of  Representatives, the Council of Ministers, and the coalition  government committees.    The house speaker said: The people who elected us asked us  to keep the trust, the significance of which was accentuated  when the house members took the oath during its first session.  Hence, the house will remain alive. It will continue to hold  its sessions, given the fact that it is the representative of  the people, an elected body, and the legitimate constitutional  authority, which is the guardian of the constitution,  legitimacy, law and order, and which oversees all executive  organizations.    Afterward, the committee examined various developments and  repercussions of the crisis. The debates of the conferees  during this session underlined the need to remove the effects of  the crisis by resolving the problem of price hikes, halting the  decline in the exchange rate of the national currency, promoting  security and stability, improving the living conditions of the  people, safeguarding Yemeni unity, and consecrating national  unity. The conferees also reaffirmed the need to continue  efforts to reach drastic solutions to the crisis democratically  and objectively, within the constitutional and legitimate  frameworks, and in a manner that will rid the homeland and  people of the ordeal, as well as the economic difficulties  created by the crisis. The endeavor to defuse the crisis, the  conferees noted, must also ensure the strength and entrenchment  of united Yemen, as well as the creation of a democratic,  shura-inspired, civilized, and modern community.</p>

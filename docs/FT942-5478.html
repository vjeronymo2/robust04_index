			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Counties review 'is policy fiasco' England's local government review is a 'policy fiasco' driven by 'doctrinaire' commitments, says a report by six academics. They say the review is proceeding 'because continuing with it is seen by the government as less politically embarrassing than stopping it'. The independent Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, has to recommend alternative structures for non-metropolitan authorities to the Department of the Environment. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, prefers all-purpose 'unitary' authorities as replacements for the present two-tier system of counties and districts. Mr Steve Leach of Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government Studies, who edited the report, said: 'The commission appears to be driven by a doctrinaire commitment to the unitary concept for its own sake. This leads to it having to argue the case for a size of authority which will often neither reflect local community identity nor be able to carry out strategic functions.' The academics say the strongest options, using Mr Gummer's own criteria, are 'often the two-tier status quo, or a county-wide unitary authority' with genuine devolution of power to local communities.

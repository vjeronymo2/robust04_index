During his visit to China last year, Chancellor Kohl  surprised leading diplomats with his statement that another  consulate should be established in Canton. Since Genscher's  time in office, the idea of a consulate has appeared in  diplomatic reports. This additional diplomatic representation  is not necessary because, as a high-ranking German diplomat in  China said: "Based in Canton, our economic interests will not  be considered for a long time to come."    According to a diplomatic message, it would be possible  neither to find suitable rooms there nor to promote economic  interests, because German companies still conduct business from  Hong Kong and intend to carry on doing so. Following the  completion of the new highway, Hong Kong is only two hours from  Canton. The German diplomats' argument is that two German  consulates would be a waste of money. This would appear to be  borne out by the fact that France, which was the only European  country with a consulate in Canton until it was closed following  weapons deliveries to Taiwan, has decided not to reopen its  representation there.    A new German consulate in central and southwestern China  (Wuhan or Chengdu) would be much more sensible than two  neighboring consulates in south China and that is something that  business circles have pointed out. Hong Kong, according to top  diplomatic reports, will remain a "catalyst" for the development  of China and even more so after the transfer of the territory to  China in 1997. Diplomats, as well as business people, will be  able to work on southern China from Hong Kong. What the report  states with resignation is: "We now have to implement the  chancellor's decision against our will."</p>

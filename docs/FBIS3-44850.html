			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- The society and  security panel of the preliminary working committee for the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region (SAR) of the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress opened its second session in Beijing on January 9-10.    During the two-day meeting, the members of the panel  discussed the legal condition for the question of "Taking Hong  Kong as a Permanent Residential Place" and the question of Hong  Kong residents' freedom in entering and leaving Hong Kong.    According to the stipulation of the Basic Law of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region, non-Chinese persons must  meet the following three conditions for their becoming permanent  residents in Hong Kong: that is, they must have valid travel  visas upon entering Hong Kong, normally they should stay in Hong  Kong for seven years or more and they should take Hong Kong as  their permanent residence.    The members of the panel insisted that there should be  objective and subjective requirements for non-Chinese people who  will "take Hong Kong as their permanent residence" and the  requirements should be clearly defined in some related laws.    They held that in principle, non-Chinese people should be  permitted to adopt convenient and simple methods to recognize  the requirement of "taking Hong Kong as permanent residence."    The members of the panel held that the stipulations of the  Basic Law on Hong Kong residents' freedom in entering and  leaving the region after 1997 are quite broad either in contents  or in extent in comparison with the constitutions of some  countries. These stipulations should be further publicized so  that the Hong Kong residents really understand them, they said.    The panel decided to meet again in Beijing from February 28  to March 1.</p>

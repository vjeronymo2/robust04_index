			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The International Weightlifting Federation, stung by a fresh wave of positive  drug tests, is introducing a controversial testing system that critics say is  unfair and unlawful.  </P> <P> "We are ready to adopt the steroid profile procedure," Tamas Ajan, general  secretary of the IWF, said. "It would be a good idea if other sports followed."  </P> <P> Under the system, created by West Germany's Manfred Donike, the amount of  steroids in an athlete's body can be detected not only at the time the test  takes place, but several months beforehand, although the drug is not  identified.  </P> <P> The procedure has not yet gained formal approval from the International Olympic  Committee.  </P> <P> "If the IWF uses it, it'll be sued," said Arnold Beckett, a member of the IOC  medical commission.  </P></p>

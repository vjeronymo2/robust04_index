			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Franco to oversee prices policy BRAZILIAN President Itamar Franco has taken control of prices policy, bringing under his direct purview all monthly adjustments for public sector tariffs and medicines, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. The controversial decision, announced by presidential decree, means Mr Franco will decide the prices of petrol, telephone calls, electricity, rubber, interstate transport and sugar cane. These are now adjusted monthly by a department of the Economy Ministry to reflect inflation (running at 26 per cent a month). Mr Franco was concerned for the ability of Brazil's poor to afford basic items and medicines. However, Petrobras, the state oil company, has been losing Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.5m) a day because of delays over price increases. The pharmaceutical companies retort that it is impossible to make medicines cheap enough for people who earn Pounds 33 a month. The financial community fears the next step will be a return to full price controls in an attempt to control inflation.</p>

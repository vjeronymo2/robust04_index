			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BEAR ROOKIE, WOMAN DIE IN CRASH  </P> <P> Rookie defensive tackle Fred Washington of the Chicago Bears and a woman  companion were killed in a one-car crash at 2:30 a.m. Friday.  </P> <P> The car driven by Washington struck a tree about two miles from his home in  suburban Lake Forest, Deputy Police Chief Gary Wieczorek said.  </P> <P> Lake County Coroner Barbara Richardson said the car appeared to have been  traveling at high speed. The victims were pronounced dead at the scene.  </P> <P> Weather conditions were good and no evidence of alcohol or other drugs was  found in the car, which was registered to the woman, Petra Stoll, 22.  </P> <P> Coach Mike Ditka said that Washington, a second-round draft choice from Texas  Christian, was a "coach's dream (who) worked hard and never complained, never  was hurt, never griped. We're going to try and dedicate the rest of the year to  Fred."  </P> <P> The 6-foot-2, 277-pound Washington had been used sparingly until recent weeks,  when he began filling in for injured Dan Hampton.  </P></p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Arts: Hopkins reigns over impressive Chekhov - Theatre When you see Anthony Hopkins on stage, you realise that he has a force of temperament (also of physique and voice) that is rare in our theatre; and that this is coupled to a generally surprisingly low level of energy. The effect makes him seem, much of the time, like a dormant volcano. He does not come on and electrify or galvanise; what fires he reveals have already been long smouldering within. He is currently appearing at Theatr Clwyd as a Welsh Uncle Vanya, or Uncle Ieuan (pronounced Yuyan, rhyming with Guy-an) in August, Julian Mitchell's new adaptation of Chekhov's classic; and, though he has assembled an ex-cellent troupe of co-actors with him, it is easy for him to dominate. This is not to say Hopkins out-acts the others. Everything he does has weight and interest; and you can only admire the way he has kept finding new roles to extend himself. His Ieuan is a shambolic, tottering study in despair, a generous mind caustically embittered by unrequited love and unacknowledged toil, a sturdy type crumbling as he perceives the end of all his hopes. He is always impressive; entertaining, too; and he can make himself by turns absurd, pathetic, infuriating. The way his voice combines leonine power and dolcissimo tenderness is riveting, and the wavering off-balance deportment he gives to Ieuan acutely sums up the character. He is not, however, invariably persuasive. The big tirade explosion of Act III is too blustering, the shambling antics sometimes overdone, and he too frequently interrupts or undercuts other actors. This version of Uncle Vanya - Hopkins' first venture as a director - is connected to one of several (]) Vanya films at present - for example, Louis Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street. Hopkins has already directed August for Granada Film, using several of his current cast, filming it near Theatr Clwyd. Maybe he will seem even more the star of the movie version. On stage, however, I wish he had cast himself against, in particular, a stronger Astrov (or, here, Dr Lloyd). Gawn Grainger, who plays this role, is an excellent actor in the wrong part: he has more elegant detachment and ironic languor than this virile role needs. But Hopkins knows that this is an ensemble play. He certainly gives Grainger full scope to brand Lloyd on our minds, and he has produced sharp character studies all round. His way with Chekhov is basically in the Stanislavky tradition: full of realistic detail, and a succession of evocative off-stage sounds (birdsongs, church bells, piano music). With the help of handsome designs by Eileen Diss (sets) and Dany Everett (costumes), he and his adaptor, Mitchell, have placed the action on a large Welsh estate during the 1890s - to take away bogus Russian mystique. There are still times when Chekhov's thought remains unalterably Russian, but mainly the effect is adroit. Especially in the very English moans of Professor Brathwaite (Serebryakov) against Wales ('Wales] It's like living in exile . . . I feel as if I've fallen off the earth on to some undiscovered planet.' 'Wales,' here, is what, in Chekhov, is simply 'the country'; the Professor will retire to Chelten-ham. As the urbane, testy, selfish professor, Leslie Philips gives one of the two sharpest characterisations. The other comes from Hugh Lloyd as a downtrodden mouth-agape, shuffler. And no one gives a poor performance - however, vocal projection in general is not strong enough, and several soliloquies were slightly dull. Lisa Orgolin is Helen/Yelena, utterly convincing as an American beauty (even if I am not convinced that any American beauty in 1890s Britain would regard herself as 'always a minor character'); and Rhian Morgan is touching as Sian/Sonya. Everyone reacts to one another with such accord that the stage world acquires the strange multi-dimensional realism of the best Chekhov. At the end, while Sian speaks of present work and future peace, Ieuan - seated beside her - crumbles before our eyes, Prosser plays his mouth organ, and the two old women - Gwen/Marina (Menna Trussler) and Mair/Marya (Rhoda Lewis) - sit motionless on either side,in the evening still-ness, like a pair of Whistler's mothers. At the Theatr Clwyd, Mold.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Sterling stable Both the sterling cash and futures markets had another quiet day as the pound continued to hover around DM2.7900 on the foreign exchanges. For the second day running, sterling futures stabilised a little above the 89.00 level, although they continued to price in a rise in UK base rates in the immediate future. The September short sterling contract dipped down to 89.15 from its previous close of 89.18 as the pound softened against the D-Mark. But it later finished at 89.18. The December contract closed 4 basis points down on the day at 89.14. Cash rates in the sterling money market closed unchanged, although there was some selling in the 1-month and 3-month periods towards the close by dealers who did not want to leave their positions exposed over the long weekend. Three-month money, a key indicator of where the market thinks base rates are moving, again closed at 10 5/8 per cent on the offered side. One month money again closed at 10 1/4 per cent on the offered side and the 1 year rate at 10 7/8 per cent. The 'overnight' hit 10 1/2 per cent before the finish. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn at the start of the day which was completely removed in the early round. Once again, the Bank was accommodating, buying the longer dated Bands 3 and 4. As usual, dealers will have wanted to push the short dates down as far as possible before a 3-day weekend. But the Bank was clearly concerned to sustain the mildly improved mood of the last day or two after the trials and tribulations of the early part of the week. No Treasury bills were allotted at the regular Friday Treasury bill tender. After the rise in trading rates this week, offers for the bills would have been at rates that were too high to be accepted by the Bank of England, given the government's adherence to 10 per cent base rate. The Bank purchased Pounds 100m of Band 3 Treasury bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 732m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 100m of BAnd 4 Treasury bills at 9 per cent and Pounds 344m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1.35bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 1m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1.4bn and the Bank did not operate in the afternoon.</p>

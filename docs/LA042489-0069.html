			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A.C. Nielsen Co. is inches from beating out Arbitron Ratings Co. for a more  than $30-million, multiyear contract to upgrade TV ratings measurement of  Latino households for the all-Spanish Univision and Telemundo networks. "It  will probably be Nielsen, but no contract has been signed," said Doug Darfield,  vice president of research for Univision. "You can agree in principle, but once  you start poring over contract documents, many things can happen. It's in the  hands of the lawyers." When and if negotiations are finalized, he said, Nielsen  will install People Meters in about 1,000 Latino households in Los Angeles and  other cities nationwide. The new service won't be fully operational until 1991.  Claudia Puig and ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Japan's ambassador to the  United Nations Yoshio Hatano expressed support Wednesday [20  April] for a request by U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  to give him the authority to order air strikes against Bosnian  Serb forces.    Hatano said, "The U.N. has neither sufficient military  capability nor financial means, so it is quite natural that it  asked NATO to cooperate in making up for its limited military  capability." Hatano made the remark at the Japan National Press  Club two days after Butrus-Ghali requested that NATO authorize  him to order air strikes by NATO planes against Bosnian Serb war  machines.    Nato's 16-member decision-making meeting, the North Atlantic  Council, is to decide on Butrus-Ghali's request later Wednesday.    Hatano, who has served at the U.N. Headquarters in New York  for four years, is to be replaced by former Vice Foreign  Minister Hisashi Owada soon.    U.S. bombers under NATO command destroyed a Serbian tank and  other military machines as the Serbs pushed into the  U.N.-designated safe area of Gorazde last week. NATO and U.N.  officials said the strikes were conducted not to deter the Serbs  from taking territory but to comply with the U.N. request to do  so in order to protect peacekeepers from the U.N. protection  forces.    However, after the limited NATO action was suspended,  Serbian  forces stormed into Gorazde and threatened to attack the  northern Bosnian corridor around the town of Brcko as their next  target.    Butrus-Ghali's request was for NATO to authorize him to  order  air strikes to prevent the Serbs from killing more Bosnian  Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "Serbian forces may initiate a large-scale offensive as soon  as they hear NATO say it is not going to intervene militarily,"  Hatano said. "Although decisive military intervention may not  be desirable...the U.N. could deter Serbian aggression  effectively by threatening that NATO planes might make other  strikes," he said.    Hatano called on NATO to comply with Butrus-Ghali's plea,  saying, "Mr. Butrus-Ghali said during his official visit to  Japan in February last year the most crucial need for the United  Nations is how to secure and maintain cooperation from regional  security organizations" like NATO.    Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, has balked at the  further use of NATO warplanes, saying it might involve the U.N.  in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Meanwhile, Hatano urged the Japanese to accept the notion of  "peace with justice," saying the international community "has  questioned the Japanese attitude that peace is equivalent to  justice."    "The international community believes it should intervene  even with military force to restore justice, as in Yugoslavia  and Somalia," he said.    Hatano asked the Japanese to give more thought to the plight  of people in faraway countries, noting that European and U.S.  television and newspapers often devote their top news slots to  "the agony of starving Somalis or Yugoslavian children being  evacuated from Sarajevo with their mothers left behind."    "The Japanese have to learn to develop an interest in events  all over the world," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Labor Minister Leszek Miller announced that even if  Solidarity goes on strike as planned on 4 May, the government  will be ready to continue negotiations on that day in the  Trilateral Commission, composed of trade union, employer, and  government representatives.    In a statement for the "Signals of the Day" program on  Polish  Radio First Program, Minister Miller recalled that, in  accordance with yesterday's decisions by the Trilateral  Commission, the talks on 4 May will concern the wage control  law, the implementation of the State Enterprise Pact, and  changes in tax regulations. These problems, Leszek Miller  pointed out, recur in the trade union demands.    Minister Miller called yesterday's decision by the  Solidarity's Protest Action Headquarters to hold strikes on 4,  5, and 6 May incomprehensible. He stressed that implementation  of the trade union demands can only be achieved through  negotiation. According to Miller, the possible Solidarity  strikes announced for next week can only hamper the talks in the  Trilateral Commission.</p>

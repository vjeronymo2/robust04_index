			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance  (MOF) issued a report Thursday [3 February] explaining the  financial reasoning behind the 7 percent rate of a new national  welfare tax in an apparent bid to win public support for it.    The move also appeared intended to clarify remarks to  reporters by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii early Thursday  denying any intention of a net tax increase in the new tax plan  decided by the government.    The plan calls for 6 trillion yen worth of tax cuts,  including 5.3 trillion yen in national income and local  resident's tax, to be paid for by the new 7 percent tax, to be  adopted in April 1997 in place of the current 3 percent  consumption tax.    The MOF said the new tax is expected to generate new  revenues  of some 9.5 billion yen a year, while the tax cuts amount to 6  trillion yen.    Regarding the net revenues of 3.5 trillion yen, it cited  some  800 billion yen needed in additional welfare spending, about 1.3  trillion yen in increased burdens from the new tax on government  purchases of goods and services, and some 1.4 trillion yen in  repayments of principal on bonds.    The ministry estimates that some 18 trillion yen in  short-term government bonds must be issued to cover the  three-year period before implementation of the new tax, and over  10 years are needed for principal repayments, or longer if  interest is included.    Referring to the three-year time lag before adopting the new  tax, Fujii told reporters that the government hopes to get the  economy on a full-fledged recovery track in fiscal 1994 and into  stable growth in fiscal 1995. The extra year is to monitor  economic growth, he said.    He pledged utmost efforts to win public support for the new  tax and stressed that revenues would go to social welfare.    Unlike the consumption tax, the new tax would be introduced  by a law stipulating that it is "politically objective," Fujii  said.    Details are yet to be decided but will include pensions and  social infrastructure for welfare primarily in line with a  government "welfare vision" to be compiled by March, Fujii said.    Meanwhile, Fujii did not rule out the possibility of raising  the new tax rate further in future.</p>

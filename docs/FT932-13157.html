			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Nomura plans 33% payout cut NOMURA Securities, the leading Japanese securities house, plans to cut its annual dividend to Y10 from Y15 a year earlier. It is the first reduction since 1975 and a sign of the pressure on the broking industry. The dividend announcement follows a forecast that the broker would report a pre-tax profit of zero for the year ending last month on revenue of Y345bn (Dollars 3.1bn), down from Y421bn in the previous year. Yamaichi Securities, another member of Japan's Big Four brokers, said that its annual dividend would be cut from Y5 to Y2.5.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali  Tuesday [11 January] met with Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister  Hiroshi Fukuda who reaffirmed Japan's appreciation of Jordan's  role in the Middle East peace process and Tokyo's pledge to  extend assitance to the Kingdom.    Mr. Fukuda said that during the 30-minute meeting, he made a  general review of the developments in the peace process and  Japanese-Jordanian relations.    Noting that Dr. al-Majali visited Tokyo last month and  "impressed the (Japanese) government of the difficulties facing  Jordan resulting from the Gulf war," Mr. Fukuda said his country  stood ready to extend assistance to help the Kingdom overcome  its economic difficulties.    Speaking in an interview with the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. Fukuda,  who is on a Middle East visit billed as a familiarisation trip,  recalled that his prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, had  promised Jordan to help it alleviate its foreign debt burden.    "The promise meant that Japan will make more assitance  available to Jordan since (Tokyo) is in no position to write off  debts," Mr. Fukuda explained. Japanese assistance was discussed  during his meeting with Dr. al-Majali, Mr. Fukuda said. But he  declined to be specific.    However, he confirmed that Japan was "in the final stage" of  granting an $80 million loan to help develop Jordan's energy  sector.    "We also touched upon other potential projects and  programmes  which will be of mutual interest," he said.    Japan holds about $900 million of Jordan's $6.88 billion  foreign debts. Most of the Japanese part of the debts is in the  form of soft loans for long term at nominal interest rates  extended during and after the Gulf crisis of 1990-1991.    Japan attaches high importance to its relations with Jordan  because of the Kingdom's key role in the Middle East peace  process and its "geopolitical" features, Mr. Fukuda said.    "We are watching with admiration the efforts demonstrated by  Jordan to advance the peace process and also towards a free  market economy," he said, adding that Japan also appreciated the  Kingdom's participation in international peacekeeping operations.    By coincidence, he said, during a trip to the Dead Sea on  Tuesday he met a Jordanian officer who served with the U.N.  force in Cambodia, where Japan also maintains an army unit.    The officer, whose name was not immediately available, spoke  about his time in Cambodia and of his meetings with Japanese  counterparts, Mr. Fukuda said.    The encounter, the Japanese minister said, "is the kind of  experience" that one enjoys and gives an added personal  dimension to bilateral relations.    In the broader context of Japanese contribution to the  Middle East peace process, Mr. Fukuda noted that Tokyo has  pledged $200 million in assistance to support the Palestinian  self-rule envisaged under the Sept. 13 Israel-Palestine  Liberation Organisation (PLO) deal.    "This is not a political statement, but a firm commitment,"  he said, adding that $25 million of the aid were already  disbursed in the public health and health sectors in the  occupied territories.    "We are in a hurry to disburse the rest of the amount, and  we  are in continuous contact with the World Bank and others," he  said.    Asked whether Japan shared a reported international feeling  that there are no "credible" Palestinian institutions to channel  the more than $2.2 billion aid pledged at a donor's conference  in October, Mr. Fukuda said:    "The legal requirement of the Japanese assistance has to be  met; afterall it is tax-payers' money. We have to be satisfied  on our side that the...assistance is spent for the purpose for  which it has been allocated and intended."    Mr. Fukuda, who arrived here Monday overland from Israel  through the occupied West Bank, said he had met with Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, his deputy Yosi Beilin and other  Israeli officials as well as Palestinian leaders in the occupied  territories, including members and advisors of the peace  negotiating team.    "These meetings were very enlightening to me," given the  fact  that it is the first visit to the Middle East after taking  office, Mr. Fukuda said.    Japan is playing a key role in the multilateral phase of the  Middle East peace process. in addition to chairing the  multilateral working group on the environment, it is  vice-chairman of the committee on regional economic cooperation  and water.    Japan is also a member of the working groups on refugees and  arms control.    Japanese officials accompanying Mr. Fukuda said two meetings  were planned in Cairo next month, of consultative committees of  the multilateral phase, to discuss "a series of specific ideas"  for specific projects involving regional cooperation in various  fields.    Asked how he viewed the progress of the peace negotiations  between the Arabs and Israel, Mr. Fukuda said: "It is important  to be optimistic."    Expressing hope that the peace talks would eventually lead  to  a just and fair peace settlement in the region, he added:  "Nobody is going to benefit from failure (of the peace  process), but everybody will lose from failure."</p>

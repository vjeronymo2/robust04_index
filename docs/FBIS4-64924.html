			<p>BFN     [Text] According to sources at the Moncloa Palace, Spanish  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has decided to postpone his  official visit to Paraguay, due to take place at the beginning  of next week.    Felipe Gonzalez's trip to Paraguay was scheduled for 16-18  May. Ten days ago Gonzalez also postponed his trip to Romania  and Bulgaria, due to take place last week, because of the  political crisis unleashed by the flight of Luis Roldan, the  former head of the Civil Guard, and by the fact that the former  governor of the Bank of Spain and Manuel De La Concha, former  head of the Madrid stock market, were sent to jail, as well as  by the resignations of Interior and Agriculture Ministers Antoni  Asuncion and Vicente Albero.</p>

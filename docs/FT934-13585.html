			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Weaker exports threaten growth: Chambers concerned at pace of upturn ECONOMIC recovery is slow and hesitant and threatened by weakening export demand, says a survey of the manufacturing and service sectors by the British Chambers of Commerce. The BCC said that its September poll of 7,873 companies employing 1.1m people showed the rate of improvement in the economy was slackening. It found that home orders increased slightly for both manufacturing and services in the third quarter while the growth of export demand slowed sharply. The survey will add to the pressure on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, not to tighten fiscal policy too rigorously in his Budget on November 30. But despite the sense of gloom engendered by faltering exports, its news was not all bad. The BCC poll found that business confidence continued to climb in the three months to the end of September, reaching its highest point since early 1989. A growing number of service and manufacturing companies revised upwards their plans to invest in plant, machinery and buildings. For the first quarter since the start of the recession, the number of companies saying that they had increased staff exceeded those reporting that their labour forces had declined. Replies to the survey suggested that more staff would be recruited in the current quarter, although at a very modest rate. There was a slight increase in the number of companies reporting difficulty recruiting staff with the necessary skills and professional standards in the past quarter. Mr Richard Brown, BCC deputy director-general, said the survey suggested that the recovery was beginning to flatten out, and there were some disturbing trends in some regions. 'If we are at the peak of the recovery, that is a cause for concern,' he said. The Scottish and Welsh economies lagged behind the rest of the UK while manufacturers in Merseyside reported a fall in home sales. The Thames Valley, after growing strongly for a year and a half, reported strong growth in its manufacturing industry but declines elsewhere. Signs of a healthy recovery in the south of England went into reverse. Although London's manufacturing and service companies reported growing sales and orders at home, manufacturing exports fell sharply. Weakness in London's manufacturing exports have often preceded a national downturn. Recovery in the south-west is fragile, the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative said yesterday in its quarterly survey of more than 300 companies, Roland Adburgham writes. More companies reported improvements rather than deterioration in domestic sales and orders, exports, turnover, profitability and investment. But the chamber said the recovery appeared to be slowing, especially in manufacturing.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Congress set for by-election boost INDIA'S Congress party received a boost to its morale yesterday when it seemed certain of regaining a key parliamentary seat in a by-election in New Delhi. Mr Rajesh Khanna, the Congress candidate and a star of Hindi films, seemed assured of a comfortable victory in a seat which Mr L K Advani, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), leader had won in the general election last year. Mr Advani had to vacate the constituency because he took another seat in Gujarat. The result comes at a time when Congress feels on the defensive both because of continuing high inflation and because of the Bombay stock market scandal. It suggests, however, that Congress is still winning back voters who turned to the BJP in the last election out of weariness for the Congress party. The Congress victory in New Delhi is part of a trend reflected in scattered local elections this year. Last month Congress defeated the BJP in municipal corporation elections in Simla - the capital of the Himalayan hill state where the BJP is in power. Congress in February also scored a strong victory over the BJP in municipal by-elections in Bombay in February. The New Delhi by-election was one of two for which voting took place on Monday. At the same time 13 state assembly seats were being contested. Voting in Delhi aroused little enthusiasm though there was widespread violence.</p>

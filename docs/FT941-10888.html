			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Polish coalition to discuss disputes The leaders of Poland's coalition partners are expected to meet today to try to resolve the fighting between the two parties over economic policy which culminated last week in the resignation of Mr Marek Borowski, deputy premier and finance minister. At the weekend Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the Social Democratic movement (SLD) leader, said he would continue to urge Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister and Peasant party leader, not to accept the resignation of Mr Borowski, an SLD member. He was speaking after an SLD leadership meeting which saw no alternative to the present SLD-PSL coalition. Mr Borowski resigned on Friday after failing to win assurances from Mr Pawlak that economic policy and personnel decisions would be agreed between the coalition partners. Also the weekend, the Finance Ministry said it would reduce the scale of electricity and gas price increases planned for this month.</p>

The ambassador's residence in Bonn, purchased in October  1984  for 2.4 million U.S. dollars, sprawls over 5,500 pyong. The  house will be put out on the market in the first half of the  year at an asking price of 3 million dollars.    Other residences in the European Union and Saudi Arabia will  be sold after the real estate market picks up, officials said.    The ambassador's residence in Brussels, a 400-pyong building  standing on 15,000 pyong of land, was bought for 3.7 million  dollars in May 1989 but the current market price is 2.5 million  dollars.    The residence in Saudi Arabia stands on 3,100 pyong. It has  been renovated and has a value estimated at 7.56 million  dollars, but its sale is complicated by the fact that the house  is within the diplomatic complex, the officials said. The  ministry had ambitiously sought to increase its overseas assets,  reasoning that owning the residences of mission chiefs would  save money in the long run.    "We received much criticism during a National Assembly  hearing last year that made us reconsider this plan," an  official said.    Renovation of the official residence for the ambassador to  the United Nations, recently purchased for 10.83 million  dollars, was budgeted at 5 million dollars but will be cut by  more than 1 million dollars.</p>

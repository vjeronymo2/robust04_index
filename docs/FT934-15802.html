			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: BNP expects to attract 1.3m private shareholders BANQUE Nationale de Paris, the first candidate in the French government's privatisation programme, yesterday estimated that it would attract between 1.3m and 1.4m private shareholders. Mr Pebereau, the chairman, earlier yesterday said that the final number of private investors should be 'considerably' higher than the 1m goal by the time the public part of the BNP share sale closes next Tuesday. The economy ministry this week announced that it was closing the institutional part of the issue because it was already more than 12 times subscribed after only two days. The BNP offer price at FFr240 (Dollars 42m) was lower than analysts had expected, thereby triggering a flood of applications. However, the government is also anxious to encourage the French public to invest in BNP. This is partly because it hopes the BNP issue will set a successful precedent for future sales and partly because the Balladur administration hopes to use the privatisations to boost individual share ownership in France, where the public has traditionally been ambivalent about equity investment. Under the original offer terms the public will be entitled to 37.5m shares in BNP, or 52 per cent of the 72m shares on sale, with 12.5m shares reserved for French institutions and 23.5m for foreign institutions. The government also has an option to clawback 9.5m extra shares for the public from the institutional tranche. The government initially intended to allocate 40 shares to each individual investor, with an additional 40 for people converting their Balladur bonds intro shares. However, Mr Pebereau said the public response had been so strong that, even with the clawback, the number of shares given to individuals might have to be reduced.</p>

Anthony Lake said  today that further improvement and development of U.S.-Chinese  relations is of great strategic significance.    Lake made the statement during his meeting at the White  House  with visiting Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, who  arrived here Tuesday [25 January] at the invitation of the State  Department for political consultations.    The Sino-U.S. informal summit meeting in Seattle last  November was important to both sides and it is very encouraging  that the channels for dialogue are open and contacts are  increasing, Lake said.    Both sides have done their part to improve their relations,  and Washington in no way "belittles" the positive steps taken by  the Chinese side, Lake said.    He expressed the belief that with such continuous joint  efforts, it is certain that U.S.-China relations will constantly  improve and develop.    In reply, the Chinese vice minister said the Seattle summit  marked a new beginning for improving Sino-U.S. relations and  both sides should seize upon the favorable opportunity to push  their ties back onto the normal track.    There exist broad and common interests between China and the  United States, Liu said, adding that the two sides should start  from the fundamental interests of the people of the two  countries and the overall situation in developing mutually  beneficial cooperation.    Changes in the world situation have not altered the  importance of Sino-U.S. relations, Liu said, adding that their  differences should be properly settled through candid dialogues.  As for the differences which cannot be settled for the moment,  the two sides should seek common grounds while preserving the  differences and should not let the differences block the  development of their relations.    Liu stressed that both sides should face reality, respect  each other's actual situation, take an attitude of seeking truth  from facts and appropriately solve their existing differences  through joint earnest efforts and on the basis of mutual respect  and equality, thus enabling their relations to advance in a  healthy and stable way.    Besides meeting Lake, Liu also held separate meetings today  with Assistant to the U.S. President for Economic Policy Robert  Rubin and his deputy W. Bowman Cutter.    The American hosts expressed their admiration for the  achievements China has made since its reforms and opening up to  the outside world and they are optimistic about the prospects of  China's development in the coming years.    In view of the changes that have taken place in China in the  past 15 years, Rubin noted, there are reasons to believe that  China will become one of the world's strongest economies in the  first half of the next century.    He said Washington is fully aware of the good opportunity  that China's development has provided for the U.S. economy and  hopes that the difficulties in bilateral relations will be  solved as soon as possible so that multi-cooperation of great  potentials would be further strengthened and expanded.    Meanwhile, Cutter said that China is of strategic  significance to the United States and nobody can deny this.    Despite their differences, opportunities for further  cooperation outstrip the existing problems, Cutter said.    It really conforms with the interests of both countries for  the United States to handle its relations with China from a  long-term point of view, he said.    Cutter said both sides are experienced in settling their  differences through mature and wise ways and the U.S. is willing  to continue to work with China in overcoming the differences and  strengthening their cooperation.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: United Airlines bank on discussions UNITED AIRLINES said it hoped to keep alive discussions with unions aimed at radically shrinking its cost base, in spite of a statement yesterday from the Association of Flight Attendants that it was pulling out of the talks, writes Richard Waters. The Association said its decision was prompted by United's move to open a flight attendants' base in Taiwan and its plans to open other bases in east Asia. While indicating it would not change its decision, United said it remained 'fully receptive' to continuing its discussions with the unions about the serious economic and competitive issues facing the airline. Shares in UAL, United's parent, were Dollars 3 3/4 lower at Dollars 137 1/4 at the close in New York yesterday.</p>

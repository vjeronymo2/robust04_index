			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "awo": "CBOS on President"] </F>   [Text] The Small Constitution did not arm the president  with sufficient range of powers to meet his suggested ideal  model of the sociopolitical and administrative state system.  However, the citizens of the Polish Republic do not share his  view in this matter. In a March poll conducted by the Public  Opinion Survey Center [CBOS], they expressed the opinion that  the president wields too much rather than too little power.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |How much power does the president have at the moment?                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Too little                            |22|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Too much                              |36|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |As much as he should have             |29|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hard to say                           |1310006040ercent                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The picture emerging from the public response to the poll  seems to highlight the president's "political games." Lech  Walesa is perceived more as a person entangled in a variety of  tactical stratagems than a politician concentrating on solving  the state's problems.    In its commentary on the poll, the CBOS admits that it is  not  clear how far the president's identity and personality influence  respondents' inclination to accord him a wider range of powers  or, conversely, to stipulate that his powers should be  restricted. It seems that the office is to a large extent  identified with the person. Lech Walesa generates much public  emotion, and, as a result, he is easily assessed according to  stereotyped categories. Consequently, the CBOS claims, it could  be assumed that opinions on the president's place and range of  powers are influenced by the fact that we are talking  specifically about Lech Walesa as incumbent in that office. It  follows from this that it is important to identify the  president's goals.    The ultimate targets to which the public believes Lech  Walesa  aspires are as follows: reinforcement of his power, 46 percent;  winning the next election for another term of office, 40  percent; weakening his political opponents, 25 percent;  attainment of law and order in the country, 24 percent; keeping  the "commies" firmly under control, 19 percent; improvement of  Poland's position in the world, 16 percent; acceleration of the  economic reforms, 13 percent.    A lenient attitude toward the president is conducive to  greater tolerance in assessing the activities of the Solidarity  Independent Trade Union. Acceptance of the work of the Sejm is,  as a rule, accompanied by approval of the government's  activities. These two options are, to a large extent, mutually  exclusive. Those questioned are on the whole more ready to  accept the work of the Sejm and the government than that of the  president and Solidarity.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Personal View: Europe's pensions quandary The question of how pensions should be financed and who should pay them remains at the top of the policy agenda across the world. In the UK, today's white paper in response to the Goode report will propose new solvency standards and regulatory reforms, while in Italy the government is faced with a budget 'hole' of perhaps one-fifth of the planned 1994 deficit as a result of a court decision this month on state pensions. There is a widespread feeling that something has to change but - as demonstrated by last week's abandonment of the troubled European Union pensions directive - no agreement as to what. But the problem cannot be swept under the carpet. The adverse demographic trends at the heart of the pensions quandary are a source of strain for public sector budgets already swollen by unemployment due to an explosion of low-cost competition. The extent of the strain cannot be gauged from published public sector statistics, which are purely backward-looking, with no inclusion of unfunded pension liabilities. Researchers at ABP, the Dutch civil service pension fund, have quantified the present value of unfunded pension liabilities in Europe. If the present value of tax receipts from public and private pensions is deducted from this sum, and the conventionally measured debt burden is added, the result gives a measure of 'true' debt (see chart). While this does not represent a complete set of adjustments to gross public debt data - which would include assets to be sold off, as well as future liabilities - there is merit in singling out pensions. First, pensions are among the most important categories of public expenditure. Second, to the extent that they are unfunded, they are most vulnerable to demographic trends. The 'true' debt/gross domestic product ratios are more than double conventional ratios almost throughout the EU. The UK - with both the lowest public pension in the EU and one of the best developed private-funded sectors - stands out as having the smallest unfunded liabilities in relation to GDP, and that ratio will have fallen after the 1993 announcement of a phased rise in the pension age for women. Financing problems are not confined to pensions promised by the public sector. In Germany, private schemes are usually of the defined benefit type and more than 60 per cent of private pension obligations are held within company balance sheets. But under the pressure of redundancies, some companies have begun to create separate pension funds, partly because the employee contributions which are proving increasingly necessary must by law be made into a hypothecated fund. Some means of encouraging savings needs to be found. An alternative solution to underfunding is to reduce the real value of pensions, but there are clear political limits to this; in the Netherlands the Pensioners' party won six seats in May's elections. In the UK the state earnings related pension scheme became less generous in 1988, and since 1981 the basic pension has been linked to prices rather than wages. Greater availability of appropriately supervised private sector pension funds, free to invest as their managers see fit, is the only realistic way forward. Make no mistake, governments will progressively renege on their pension payments. The only way to head off political consequences is to encourage saving, particularly via private pensions. In continental Europe, where cross-border sales and investments are commonly constrained, Sir Leon Brittan gave the lead in 1991 with the draft Pensions Directive. But although all European leaders support free capital movements in principle, in practice the ERM and the Maxwell crises, coupled with lingering resentment of the UK's tactics during the Maastricht negotiations, destroyed the political support for the directive, and it has been abandoned. Europe's pensions quandary is not a suitable case for 'muddling through'. A directive which genuinely liberates capital would radically improve the allocation of savings, raising growth and generating jobs. In stark contrast to last year's Commission white paper, free cross-border pensions in Europe could help finance investment without adding to high government debts - both revealed and hidden.

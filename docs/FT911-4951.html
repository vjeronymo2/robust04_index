			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Letter: Reminder over PR for every Christian Democrat Euro-MP Sir, David Buchan's article, 'UK Tories win Euro embrace from centre-right', (April 15), in common with every article I have read on the prospective link between the Tories and the Christian Democrats in the European Parliament, studiously avoids mentioning the one issue upon which this 'engagement' will be broken off. Members of the EPP Group (The European People's Party) in the European Parliament who proudly boast that they are 'the heart of Europe' will certainly demand a form of proportional representation in the United Kingdom in time for the European elections to be held in 1994. This is a price no Conservative government can afford to pay. I am writing to every Christian Democrat member of the parliament reminding them of their duty to ensure that the 2m or so British European citizens disenfranchised by our winner-takes-all system of election in 1984 and 1989 have at least the possibility of proper representation in the next parliament. Anthony Kinch, 36 Greenways, Beckenham, Kent</p>

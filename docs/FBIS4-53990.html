			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 24 (OANA/ANTARA) -- The Governments of  Indonesia and Czech signed here Monday a new trade agreement in  an effort to boost bilateral trade ties.    Czech Minister for Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy in a  press conference after signing the agreement with his  counterpart, Indonesian Minister for Trade S.B. Judono, said  that the two countries' business circles are expected to realize  the trade agreement.    Previous trade agreement between Indonesia and  Czechoslovakia, signed in 1975, terminated when Czechoslavakia  was split into two countries, Czech and Slovakia, on January 1,  1993.    According to Dlouhy, Czech offers ample and good  opportunities for Indonesian businessmen to increase exports to  the East european countries because Czech is now an open market  with a favourable macro-economic condition.    He also said that Czech businessmen are interested to form  partnership with their Indonesian counterparts in manufacturing  Tata truck engines, which have been exported to Egypt, Turkey,  China and North Korea. Besides, he went on, Czech automotive  industry is also interested to export Skoda cars to Indonesia.    Czech businessmen are also interested to be involved in the  construction of a toll road betleen Cikampek and Padalarang in  West Java, he added.    In the meantime, Judono said that Czech is indeed a  potential  market for Indonesia's commodities and that it is the right  gateway for Indonesian commodities to enter the eastern and  central European markets. He also appealed to Indonesian  businessmen to make harder efforts so as to gain access to the  Czech market, especially in view of a trade deficit of 4 million  U.S. dollars recorded in 1993 in favour of Indonesia.    Indonesia usually imports from Czech among other things  steel, raw materials for plastics, milk, machinery and equipment  for cement factories, glassware and chemical products, and  exports inter alia its natural rubber, coffee, plywood, office  machinery, furniture, fisheries produce, telecommunications  equipment and textiles.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Agip sells 15 motorway hotels for Dollars 135m AGIPPETROLI, the petroleum refining and distribution arm of Italy's state-owned Eni energy and chemicals concern, yesterday took a significant step in the country's fledgling privatisation programme with a L185bn (Dollars 135m) sale of 15 motorway hotels. AgipPetroli also signed a long-awaited agreement with the UK's Forte hotels and catering group on a joint venture to rent and manage the 15 hotels, along with three others. This will make Forte the biggest foreign hotel operator in Italy. The surprise buyer for the properties is National Westminster Bank, of the UK. The bank, which will today inaugurate its first Italian office, has hardly been prominent on the Italian property scene, which has led to speculation that the portfolio may have been parked pending an onward sale. Separately, Forte is paying Agip-Petroli L17bn to set up the joint management venture, to be called Agip Forte International. AFI will subsequently spend more than L70bn to improve and market the 18 hotels being operated. The scope of the deal is substantially greater than expected. AgipPetroli, which is one of the Eni subsidiaries on the government's privatisation list, will receive a cash injection in order to boost investments in its core refining and distribution business and lower debt. Forte, which already owns four hotels in Italy, will gain a significant foothold in the business travel market. All but one of the 18 hotels will be modelled on the group's UK Posthouse chain, while the other, on the outskirts of Milan, will be run under the Crest brand. AgipPetroli has 40 hotels, built up with the development of Italy's motorways since the 1950s. The Forte deal covers those hotels not already managed by third parties, while the sale to NatWest of only 15 of the 18 to be run by AFI is explained by the fact that the remainder are either not owned by AgipPetroli or are on rented ground. Mr Pasquale De Vita, AgipPetroli's chairman, said the group also wanted to sell its Nuova Scaini car batteries subsidiary. The company, which lost L4.8bn in 1991, is the third-biggest maker of car batteries in Italy, with 1991 sales of L37bn. He forecast AgipPetroli would report 'a good result' this year, which would be higher than the L78bn that the company made in 1991. AgipPetroli, which recently opened its first filling station in Prague, plans ambitious growth in its established markets - such as Italy, Germany and France - as well as in southern and eastern Europe. The group's current four-year plan envisages investments of around L4,600bn, just under half of which will go on the refining side. Mr De Vita said that the money would come from the group's own resources, without raising new debt.</p>

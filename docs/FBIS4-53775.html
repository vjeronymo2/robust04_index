			<p>BFN     [Text] The government released a statement today, through a  National Unification Board spokesman, pertaining to the demand  made by North Korea for the repatriation of the loggers who  defected. The government statement stressed that their defection  was done legally from the humanitarian standpoint, and urged  North Korea to immediately stop carrying out acts that heighten  tension on the Korean peninsula by raising a row on this  defection.    The government pointed out that the loggers, who defected  recently, came to our side voluntarily, seeking their freedom  and welfare. However, North Korea claimed that they had been  abducted and so forth. This is totally groundless. Thus, the  government called on North Korea to stop committing  irresponsible acts.    Earlier today, North Korea sent a telephone message in the  name of Yi Song-tok, head of the North Korean side's office of  the North- South Liaison Office, claiming that the ROK forcibly  abducted and kidnapped the loggers. North Korea urged the South  to unconditionally repatriate them to North Korea.    Threatening that if the ROK fails to repatriate the loggers,  grave consequences would be brought about to the overall  North-South relations, North Korea claimed that the ROK would be  held responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.</p>

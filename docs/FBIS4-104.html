			<p>BFN     [Text] In an attempt to attack areas controlled by the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], the  People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] have  just suffered a major setback in Cunene Province. Our  correspondent reports that Jose Eduardo dos Santos mounted a  two-pronged offensive to capture the Cuchi, Cuvango, (Quelem),  and (Luassanha) Districts. Early this week, a FAPLA battalion  was put out of action, abandoning (?two) killed and large  quantities of war materiel. FAPLA troops are being backed by  MiG-23's stationed at Techamutete.</p>

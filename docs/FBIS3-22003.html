			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Mar (NA) -- Alberto Lestelle,  secretary for the prevention of drug abuse, denied today that  the U.S. Government has "imposed decisions or exerted pressure"  in order that the "repentant" figure be included in Argentine  legislation on narcotics. He also reiterated that the Armed  Forces "will have no direct participation" in the struggle  against drug trafficking.    Lestelle explained that the inclusion of the figure  "repentant" in the legislation had already been foreseen "before  the visit by U.S. Vice President Al Gore."    Lestelle said that the government sent the bill to Congress  in 1992, and that in addition to the repentant figure it also  included the role of the "informer," release on one's own  recognizance, and the undercover agent.    He also denied that the "freezing" of the initiative  coincided with the alleged link of Amira Yoma, former  presidential protocol director, to the money laundering case  known as Narcogate.    In this regard Lestelle said: "The question should be asked  of the members of the Penal and Drug Addiction Committees, who  never debated the issue."    Lestelle added that 30 days ago the government submitted to  the legislature a bill modifying the previous one, and that  coordination would be done with the respective committees on the  possibility of drawing up a single bill so that "it can be  approved as soon as possible."    Regarding the possibility of including the Armed Forces in  the struggle against drug trafficking, Lestelle said to Radio  Continental that the government "has decided that they will have  no direct participation."    Lestelle explained, however, that "logically, a security  organization could ask the Armed Forces for radar support if,  for example, it is known that an airplane is about to take off  from a neighboring country."    He added: "In any case, once the airplane lands in Argentine  territory the operation will continue, but will be under the  jurisdiction of the National Border Police." He confirmed that  the participation of the Armed Forces in intelligence is  "absolutely ruled out."</p>

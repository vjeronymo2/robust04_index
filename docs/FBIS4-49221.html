			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview by Reporter Yu Shui (0060 3055) with He Zhukang, </F> secretary of Jilin Provincial CPC Committee, on Jilin's  implementation of the "outlines for China's educational reform  and development" and "law on teachers" on 21 April]    [Text] [Yu Shui] How has Jilin implemented the "outlines  for China's educational reform and development" promulgated by  the CPC Central Committee and the State Council?    [He Zhukang] The "outlines for China's educational reform  and development" promulgated by the party Central Committee and  the State Council is a very important document, and it  represents an important measure adopted by the party and state  to accelerate the modernization drive overall. Comprehensive  implementation of the "outlines" is a major task for our party  committees and governments at all levels. The provincial party  committee and government have attached great importance to  implementation of the "outlines" and the "law on teachers" and  adopted the following three major measures.    First, we explicitly defined the strategy of "developing  Jilin with science, technology, and education" at the sixth  provincial party congress held in April 1993 and regarded  education as a strategic priority. Because enthusiasm alone is  not enough for our endeavor to build a developed border province  near the sea, we need the necessary conditions and ability to  accomplish this endeavor and, more fundamentally, an overall  education level that is compatible with it. The endeavor of  building a developed border province near the sea itself  includes developing education and relying on education.  Manpower resources equipped with modern scientific knowledge  constitute the foundation for us to achieve economic prosperity,  and various forms of education are the means to strengthen this  foundation. After the party congress, six leaders of the  provincial party committee have gone to schools of higher  learning and relevant departments to conduct investigation and  study and hear opinions on how to develop Jilin with science,  technology, and education. The provincial party committee holds  that to implement the strategy of "developing Jilin with  science, technology, and education," we should respect knowledge  and trained personnel and give full play to the role of  intellectuals. Therefore, the provincial party committee and  government decided to issue special allowances to the 15  academicians and one foreign academician of the Chinese Academy  of Sciences and 21 advisers to doctoral candidates who were  working in Jilin. Such an act was the first of its kind in the  country.    Second, the provincial government held a working conference  at an opportune time in May 1993 on raising education funds  through various channels and on improving teaching facilities.  It studied ways to correctly handle the relations between  reducing peasants' burdens and developing rural education.  While resolutely carrying out central guidelines on reducing  peasants' burdens, we persistently raised education funds from  various channels and formulated 10 special policy measures for  raising education funds, thus maintaining the healthy  development of rural education.    Third, to comprehensively implement the "outlines," the  provincial party committee and government held a provincial  education work conference to study and define the "several  opinions of the Jilin Provincial CPC Committee and People's  Government concerning implementation of the 'outlines for  China's educational reform and development'" (consisting of 30  articles in six parts). I spoke on four issues at that  conference, and pertinent leading comrades of the provincial  party committee also attended and gave speeches. These measures  have effectively promoted Jilin's educational reform and  development.    [Yu Shui] What practical work have the provincial party  committee and government done for education since the  promulgation of the "outlines for China's educational reform and  development?"    [He Zhukang] We have firmly focused on increasing  educational  investment and improving the status and material benefits of  teachers when doing practical work for education. At last  year's provincial education work conference, I said: "Shortage  of funds will be a long-term problem, and the key is how to use  funds and make the limited funds play a still greater role," and  "we should firmly establish such a guiding idea that we must  promote education even if we have to do so by cutting expenses  in other fields, and we should be determined to achieve success  in education, a major undertaking that concerns future  generations." What I said has become the common understanding  in the province, and party committees and governments at all  levels have adopted every means to increase educational  investment despite strained financial resources.    --The provincial government strived to increase the budgeted  educational funds, which showed a 20.9 percent increase in 1993  as compared with 1992.    --The provincial government decided to establish two special  funds for establishing key schools of higher learning and key  disciplines in the province and for making the nine-year  compulsory education universal.    --The provincial government formulated a package of  policies on raising education funds from various channels,  which, when successfully implemented, will enable Jilin to  increase its educational investment by 500 million yuan every  year. We increased the 2-percent urban education surcharge to 3  percent, making the total surcharge increase by 27 percent over  the preceding year; we extended fund raising in cities, and 58.3  percent more funds were collected when compared with the  preceding year; we collected from hotel guests an education  surcharge to be used in developing education; fees for shops,  environmental benefits, pollution, and land transfer were  exempted, and fees for supporting urban facilities were reduced  or postponed with government approval when building colleges and  primary and middle schools and building houses for school  administrative staff and teachers to lower the construction cost  by over 100 yuan per square meter, which was equivalent to  making an investment of 100 million yuan in the whole year; a  part of the fines and confiscated funds from industrial and  commercial units was set aisde for educational development;  tuitions and fees for noncompulsory education and compulsory  education were adjusted to increase by 30 percent over the  preceding year; tax breaks were continued for the industries  developed by schools of various categories to make the net  income from the industries developed by primary and middle  schools and secondary specialized schools in the province reach  300 million yuan, ranking the per capita income of students  first in the country.    --We supported relevant schools of higher learning to  cooperate and recommended the cooperated universities to first  enter the state's "211 project."    --In view of the current price rises, we allocated special  living expense allowance to the particularly difficult students  of colleges and universities.    To improve the status and material benefits of teachers, we  have done the following:    --The provincial party committee and government decided in  June 1993 to issue government special allowance to a small  number of high-grade intellectuals beginning 1 July and equally  treated the high-grade intellectuals of the units under  ministries and those under the province. Academicians of the  Chinese Academy of Sciences were given 1,000 yuan each per  month, and advisers to doctoral candidates were given 300 yuan.    --Last year, we selected 108 special-grade primary and  middle  school teachers and 33 outstanding school masters who enjoyed  the benefit of special-grade primary and middle school teachers  (80 yuan of allowance per person every month).    --We accelerated construction of houses for the  administrative staff and teachers of urban colleges and  universities as well as primary and middle schools. Thanks to  the preferential policies formulated by the provincial party  committee and government, housing construction for the  administrative staff and teachers of the colleges and  universities as well as primary and middle schools in the  province made new headway. New houses totaling 321,000 square  meters were built for the teachers of the schools of higher  learning under the province; and 349,000 square meters of new  houses were built for primary and middle school teachers to make  the per capita living space 6.8 square meters.    --We strived to improve the material benefits of the  teachers  supported by local people. The provincial party committee and  government demanded that the wage of such teachers, which  includes unified township allocation and state subsidies, not be  lower than two-thirds of that of the teachers paid by the  government. In the past three years, 5,400 outstanding teachers  supported by local people became the teachers supported by the  government after appraisal.    [Yu Shui] What issues should we emphasize in our current  efforts to implement the "outlines for China's educational  reform and development?"    [He Zhukang] In my opinion, we should emphasize three issues  when studying, publicizing, and implementing the "outlines for  China's educational reform and development" at present and for  some time to come. First, our understanding should be in place.  When implementing the "outlines," we should understand not only  the strategic position of education but, more importantly, the  new issues and new conditions we encounter in accelerating  educational reform and development. Guided by the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line, the "outlines" summarized the experiences in  educational reform and development gained in the past four  decades and more, especially since the third plenary session of  the 11th party Central Committee, analyzed the situation in  education work, and put forward the targets, strategies, guiding  principles, and many important policy measures for China's  educational development for the 1990's and even the early 21st  century. The "outlines" are a programmatic document guiding  China's educational reform and development.    It should be  said that party committees and governments at all levels in the  province have attached great importance to the study and  implementation of the "outlines" over the past year. Propaganda  and education departments of the province held training for  county, city, and district heads in charge of education and  carried out mass study and mass discussion on the education  front, thus promoting Jilin's education work to a new height.  Judging from the situation in the entire province, however,  progress in the study and publicity of the "outlines" varied  from place to place. The education front did a better job, but  as far as the entire society was concerned, study, publicity,  and implementation of the "outlines" remained a long-term task.  We are carrying out socialist modernization in a country with a  large population, relatively insufficient resources, and a  rather backward economy. To attain the grand target of  modernization and further liberate and develop productive  forces, we should develop education on a priority basis, raise  the quality of laborers, and turn the heavy burden of population  into an advantage in personnel resources. Therefore, an urgent  task for the entire party, entire society, and all the people is  to study well and conscientiously implement the "outlines." We  should include the study of the "outlines" in the political  study of party committees, governments, enterprises, and  institutions so that every citizen will know and understand the  "outlines."    Second, investment should be in place. To develop education  on a priority basis means to increase educational investment on  a priority basis. All undertakings need to be developed, but  our financial resources are limited. This is a contradiction,  which exists not only today but will also exist for a very long  time to come. We should not wait until economy is developed to  develop education. Otherwise, developing the economy will also  become very difficult. Therefore, governments at all levels,  despite their limited financial resources, should strive to have  education funds increase at a higher rate than the "increase  rates of the two other fields." Educational development is also  an undertaking of the masses. We should mobilize the masses to  continue donations for education, raise funds for developing  schools, expand financial resources, and collect education funds  from various channels. Through the efforts of all fields, we  should ensure an increase in education funds every year and  tackle the fund shortage as much as possible.    Third, our work should be in place. Education is the  foundation for the undertakings of vital and lasting importance.  Now that we have the "outlines" and the blueprint, the key is  for leaders at all levels to meticulously organize their  implementation. As far as governments are concerned, they  should earnestly do more work and practical work for educational  development. There are many difficulties in developing  education, which cannot be resolved by teachers, schools, and  even education departments alone. Government help is required.  For instance, they should organize and coordinate efforts to  address the issues on the preferential policies on developing  education, on improvement of teaching facilities, improvement of  the social status and material benefits of teachers, and the  favorable conditions for the social practices of college, middle  school, and primary school students. Not only should the  leaders in charge of education take care of this matter, but  also other leading cadres should render help so that all  comrades are assigned the tasks and responsibilities for doing  practical work in education.    The tasks to implement the "outlines" are still heavier for  the vast number of education workers on the education front.  When studying the "outlines," education workers should further  correct their ideas for education and for running schools,  persist in the comprehensive moral, intellectual, physical, and  aesthetic development, put moral development particularly in the  first place in school work, and train the necessary qualified  personnel in the socialist modernization drive. We should  extensively educate students with modern history, contemporary  history, national situation, patriotism, collectivism,  socialism, and the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation.  Currently, we should attach importance to and intensify  vocational and technical education, provide vocational courses  for middle school students, and ensure that students learn some  skills before employment. We should improve the quality and  efficiency of education in an all-round manner, continuously  upgrade the quality of teachers, deepen the reform of education  and teaching, and comprehensively implement the party's  education policies to turn the next generation we are training  into the builders and successors who will carry on our causes  into the 21st century. This is where China's hope lies.</p>

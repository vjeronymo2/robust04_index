			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mia Doornaert: "NATO Caught Between Two </F> Fires in Relationship With Russia"]    [Text] Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will perhaps provide  clarification at the end of this week regarding whether, and  under what conditions, Russia is willing to join the Partnership  for Peace (PFP).    Twenty states of the former East Bloc and ex-Soviet Union  have already joined the PFP. On Friday [10 June] in Istanbul,  Kozyrev will meet his colleagues from NATO and the other  countries of the former East Bloc at the meeting of the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council. This will take place, in  accordance with tradition, after the meeting of the NATO Council  of Ministers.    Russia wants its entry to the PFP, greatly desired by NATO,  to be accompanied by an agreement which recognizes its status as  a major power, in the form of a special relationship between  Russia and NATO. This point will be one of the major subjects  of the Council of Ministers on Thursday. But in that respect,  NATO is caught between two fires. All 16 member states agree  that a good relationship between the alliance and the major  power in the east of this continent is of the greatest  importance for European security.    But at the same time, NATO must not give the impression to  the countries of Central and East Europe, which regard Russia's  ambitions toward its "near abroad" suspiciously, that their fate  is being fixed without them being consulted, that they are in  some way second-class states.    The relevant formula of British Foreign Minister Douglas  Hurd, that the dialogue between NATO and Russia must be one  "without vetoes and without surprises," has already been adopted  by Russian leaders. Nevertheless Russia, which rejects the  eastward expansion of the alliance, is using a kind of veto  against the Central and East European countries pushing for  membership of the alliance.    In any case, the alliance is also contributing to this.  Various of its leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton,  have said that NATO "does not want to draw any new lines in  Europe." From which Russia concluded that the old partition  continues to exist in a lesser form.    While all NATO countries agree on the importance of a good  relationship with Russia, attitudes differ regarding the  question of to what degree this special relationship can  overshadow the plans of the Central and East European countries.    The United States gives the highest priority to the best  possible relationship with Russia. They want no initiatives  which could destabilize President Boris Yeltsin and the  government team of Vyktor Chernomyrdin. Just the fact that  Russia has enough nuclear weapons to destroy the whole world  makes it for the United States a partner which far outweighs the  aspirations of Central and Eastern European countries. In  addition, Washington is striving for the closest possible  cooperation with Moscow in combating the spread of technology  and material for nuclear weapons, one of the priorities of the  Clinton government.    At the other end of the spectrum, Germany is now pushing  less  openly than in the past for the Central European countries, to  start with, to join NATO as quickly as possible. But the fact  remains that Germany does not want to remain the eastern border  of NATO (and the European Union), that it gives precedence to  integrating Central and East Europe in the Western institutions.    All this will provide new matter for discussion at the NATO  Council of Ministers on Thursday in Istanbul. And as yet there  are also no clear answers to the question of what form can be  given to the special relationship between NATO and Russia.    NATO is a strict intergovernmental alliance. There is no  question of its secretary general starting political dialogue  with Moscow in the name of the 16 member states. Should there  be NATO Councils of Ministers in which their Russian colleague  participates? Or should there be special consultation about  questions in which Russia wants to have its say? And what  answer will be given when for example Poland, which has so often  in its history been the victim of the ambitions of powerful  neighbors, asks why Iceland is involved in dialogue between NATO  and Russia over European security, but Poland is not?    These are all questions to which there is as yet no answer.  The communique of the Council of Ministers in Istanbul will  probably talk about "substantial dialogue" between NATO and  Russia. But its content will remain vague and will also depend  on the price wanted by Russia for joining the PFP.</p>

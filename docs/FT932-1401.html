			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Industry fury over oil taxes THE German industry federation (DBI) yesterday issued an outraged warning against government plans to raise the tax on oil products following an agreement by leaders of the country's coalition parties. The BDI said a heavier tax burden on car drivers would be 'absolutely counter-productive'. It warned that the move 'will sharpen the downturn in the motor industry and will have negative consequences for the whole economy'. But the government, in desperate need of extra revenues, seems determined to go ahead. Coalition leaders meeting representatives of their parliamentary groups yesterday agreed to increase petrol tax by 16 pfennigs, from the current 92pf per litre, starting on January 1. The diesel tax is to go up by 7pf from its current 54pf. The government coalition is expected to ratify the planned increases formally today, after which legislation will be introduced for parliamentary approval. It will also discuss a controversial plan to have motorists pay for using the German motorway network through the use of a vignette (tax sticker) which motorists would have to display. The oil tax increases will raise DM8.5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) a year - funds to be used for restructuring the loss-making railways and improving motorways. Long-distance road hauliers are also up in arms against the planned increase in the diesel tax, warning that 'it would destroy any positive effect' from the deregulation of the EC road haulage market. The cabinet yesterday approved a bill to extend health insurance to the 1.1m elderly and chronically sick who need residential care and who are not covered by the social welfare system. The bill, which will go to parliament at the end of July, has encountered fierce criticism from business and the trade unions.</p>

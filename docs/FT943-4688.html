			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei continues easier as Seoul rises to year's high Investors focused on the listing of Japan Telecom and the release of the Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly survey on business sentiment, and share prices lost marginal ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average lost 15.20 at 20,393.98. It saw a day's low of 20,331.37, just before the listing of Japan Telecom on the second section, but rose to a high of 20,529.71 after JT fetched an initial trading price of Y4.7m, its public offering price. Japan Telecom ended its first day at Y4.65m after reaching a high of Y4.98m in the morning session. The stock became the first privatisation offering to close lower than its public offering price. Buying by banks and investment trusts supported equities in the afternoon, but many investors remained inactive ahead of the tankan release. The survey failed to affect share prices as it revealed that negative sentiment among large companies was easing, matching expectations. Volume totalled 225m shares, against 272m. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 5.31 to 1,613.15 and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.20 to 293.87. Declines led gains by 646 to 311, with 222 issues unchanged. The ISE-Nikkei 50 index eased 3.73 to 1,309.65. Telecommunications-linked stocks were lower, dragged down by JT. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y13,000 to Y893,000 and DDI Y23,000 to Y948,000. Kyocera, DDI's leading shareholder, slipped Y10 to Y7,360 and East Japan Railway, a leading shareholder of JT, receded Y8,000 to Y513,000. Steelmakers continued to meet profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, declined Y5 to Y372. The rise of the yen above the Y99 level to the dollar hurt high-technology issues, Fujitsu declining Y10 to Y1,080. Some defied the trend, Sony firming Y50 to Y5,950 and TDK Y30 to Y4,390. Fujitsu General, a home electronics maker, advanced Y26 to Y877 on expectations of higher profits thanks to demand for its air conditioners and refrigerators prompted by the summer's heat. In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 83.02 to 22,635.29 in volume of 26.1m shares. Roundup Strong performance emerged in some Asian Pacific markets. Karachi was closed for a national holiday. SEOUL saw a persistent rally in primary blue chips, aided by liquid institutions, lift the market to its high for the year, although other issues remained weak on swift profit-taking. The composite index put on 7.89 at 977.50, surpassing the previous peak of 974.26 on February 2. Samsung Electronics posted a record high, gaining Won3,000 at Won135,000. Both Posco and Kepco - heavily weighted in the index - went the day's limit up, adding Won2,500 and Won1,000 at Won88,700 and Won30,200 respectively. Petrochemicals, papers and financials lost momentum on profit-taking following recent sharp gains. Brokers said that the central bank's easing of monetary policy ahead of Chusok holidays, which fall from September 19 to 21, boosted investor sentiment. An official at the central bank said that about Won3,000bn would be released before that time. SHANGHAI's A share index rose a further 7.0 per cent, smashing through resistance at 1,000 points in record turnover of Yn16.37bn. The index surged 68.45 to 1,041.94, with blue chip issues based in the Pudong development leading the market rise. Shanghai's B share index rose 1.39 to 83.27 in response to the A market climb. In Shenzhen, the A index gained 18.65, or 8.8 per cent, at 231.27 but the B index lost 0.59 at 231.27. COLOMBO jumped 3.0 per cent amid growing optimism over political developments, the all-share index ending 32.27 up at 1,114.75 as volume increased to 233.5m shares from Monday's 151m. KUALA LUMPUR was higher as retail investors demonstrated their continued confidence in the market. The composite index added 12.73, or 1.1 per cent, at 1,172.24 in turnover of 434.1m shares. Selangor Properties rose 34 cents to MDollars 3.82 as investors speculated on a reverse takeover of the company. HONG KONG encountered late bargain hunting which erased early losses and pushed the Hang Seng index back above 10,000. It was finally up 73.93 at 10,035.97 as turnover dwindled to HKDollars 3.57bn in the absence of US investors. Most blue chips benefited from the late purchases, Sun Hung Kai Properties gaining HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 57.75. Demand for China-owned stocks or H shares intensified, sending the H share index ahead 17.73, or 1.3 per cent, to 1,399.35. SINGAPORE received a last-minute boost from a late push in Keppel after an otherwise quiet day. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 10.49 up at 2,338.55 and Keppel put on 40 cents at SDollars 11.90. BANGKOK fluctuated throughout the day to close slightly higher on buying of small, cheap stocks. The SET index firmed 3.84 to 1,535.14 in moderate turnover of Bt9.14bn. The communications sector was firm as Shinawatra Satellite, which said it was to launch another satellite to widen its service area on October 4, appreciated Bt6 to Bt123. TAIPEI ended weaker after institutional investors sold electronics and plastics issues, but financials posted minor gains. The weighted index shed 35.85 to 6,830.47 in thin turnover of TDollars 57.03bn. MANILA slid at the close as investors sold heavily to position themselves for the much awaited listing of Petron Corp shares today, but brokers said selected second-liners cushioned the fall. The composite index retreated 17.82 to 3,086.48, pulled down by declines in many blue chips. SYDNEY was higher in thin trade following Monday's holiday closure of Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index moved forward 8.2 to 2,103.6. Dealers said that the stronger tone of the market was partly due to technical factors, with bargain hunters targeting stocks that had been sold lower in the previous two sessions. WELLINGTON was dominated by trading in Telecom, which accounted for nearly one-half of the market's NZDollars 48.4m turnover. Telecom's 5-cent rise to NZDollars 5.39, on strong US demand, was also mainly responsible for the NZSE-40 index remaining in positive territory, up 2.71 at 2,179.22.</p>

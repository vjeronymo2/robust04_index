			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: A WEEK TO RECOGNIZE OLDER WORKERS  </P> <P> Carmen Ugalde was 68 when she accepted a human services job with the city of  Montebello. After three years of widowhood, Ugalde wanted more social life and  supplemental income. She credits her return to work with bringing her back into  the mainstream of life.  </P> <P> Her supervisor, Marie Bagwell, describes Ugalde as a "dedicated, efficient  person" who "accurately fields all questions from City Hall and the public."  </P> <P> Ugalde demonstrates the characteristics of older workers, whose contributions  are celebrated during National Employ the Older Worker Week, March 12-18. Since  it was first observed by the American Legion in 1959, U.S. Presidents,  governors, mayors and other officials have joined in declaring this a week to  celebrate the talents older men and women bring to the workplace.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Every Sector  </P> <P> More than 13 million people 55 and older are in the labor force. While they  work in every sector of the economy, most are in service and trade industries.  Fifty-five percent work in white-collar occupations.  </P> <P> In California, the Los Angeles Council on Careers for Older Americans is  coordinating an older-worker poster contest and reception honoring older  workers at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum. The winning poster will be  distributed to 10,000 businesses and community organizations. Says Phyllis  Meltzer, chairperson for the event: "Our theme is 'Western Classics' because  that is what we believe California's older workers are."  </P> <P> Arkansas ABLE, a senior employment program in Little Rock, plans a lunch to  honor employers with strong records of hiring older workers. ABLE, or Ability  Based on Long Experience, also distributes place mats announcing the week to  local restaurants.  </P> <P> The Older Kansas Employment Program in Manhattan has encouraged a local  discount variety store to pay for newspaper ads congratulating employers who  have hired older workers during the past year.  </P> <P> Question: I am a 74-year-old nurse. Recently, the new head nurse decided that I  should retire and asked me directly to resign. She then wrote a negative review  of my work, which her managers refused to sign because they thought it didn't  reflect my performance.  </P> <P> Her most recent tactic was to transfer me from the night shift to the day  shift, disrupting a schedule I've had for years. I believe I'm being  discriminated against because of age. What recourse do I have?  </P> <P> Answer: The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits  discrimination against most workers 40 and older in virtually every aspect of  employment.  </P> <P> To pursue an age discrimination case, you need only establish an apparent  violation of the law. This means showing that you are in the protected age  group and were adversely affected by some employment action in which age was a  consideration. The burden then shifts to your employer, who must defend his or  her actions.  </P> <P> Age discrimination charges must be filed, in person or by mail, with the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission within 180 days of the discriminatory act.  (In states with age discrimination laws, you have 300 days.)  </P> <P> Be aware that you may wait months for an EEOC investigator to be assigned to  your case. If you want faster action, consider filing a private lawsuit or  using your organization's established grievance procedures.  </P> <P> Q: My brother and I recently returned home to Kansas City for the funeral of  our 87-year-old uncle. The only family we have left in the area is his  89-year-old widow, who has always been a free spirit and thinker. I stayed with  my aunt for several days after the funeral, and she said that, should she  become terminally ill, she wants no heroic attempts to save her life.  </P> <P> I couldn't tell if she really means this or if it was a reaction to the death  of her husband of 65 years. How do I determine if she is competent to make this  judgment?  </P> <P> A: Competence is a legal concept that can be determined only by a legal  proceeding. The general assumption is that competent people can decide whether  to accept proposed medical treatment. The law assumes a person is competent  unless a hearing determines otherwise.  </P> <P> Your aunt may be reacting to her profound loss. Sometimes the death of a loved  one triggers depression and a person's judgment may come into question. It's  too early to judge in her case. People may verbalize wishes for their own death  after such a loss, and those wishes usually changes with time.  </P> <P> You may want to contact your aunt's physician and ask that she be given some  added attention in the next few months.  </P></p>

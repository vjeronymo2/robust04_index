			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANCELING EGYPT'S $7-BILLION DEFENSE DEBT  </P> <P> Our presence in Saudi Arabia is costing us a lot of money, obviously much more  than we can readily afford.  </P> <P> I have a suggestion as to who should pay the cost. It is Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> Iraq probably has $200 billion or more of assets that are available to us. The  money we should use immediately for our daily expense, and other assets we  should prepare to sell.  </P> <P> We have been too good to the Iranians, and will probably, eventually, give back  to them the billions we have seized.  </P> <P> But it's time to get really tough with this ruffian. Make him understand that  every day he postpones getting out of Kuwait, he is frittering away his assets.  </P> <P> JAY PATRICK  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

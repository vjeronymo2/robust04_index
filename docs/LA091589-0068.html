			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: IN SERVICE  </P> <P> Actor Rob Lowe, fulfilling his court-ordered community service, has been  speaking this week to inmates at detention and rehabilitation centers in his  hometown of Dayton, Ohio. He also took a side trip to visit former baseball  manager Pete Rose, and helped his father, attorney Chuck Lowe, celebrate his  50th birthday. The visit is the first Lowe has made to his hometown since he  was accused of shooting a sexually explicit videotape involving a teen-age girl  during the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. A Georgia court  sentenced him to 20 hours of community service, which he agreed to do to avoid  possible criminal action. He remains the subject of a federal lawsuit by the  girl's mother who contends that Lowe, 25, seduced her underage daughter. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

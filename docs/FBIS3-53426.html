			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Decisionmaking on the Leadership Level"] </F>   [Text] The first oil deals in 1994 were concluded last  Monday. The New Year began with reports on probable agreement  among OPEC members on production cutbacks and an early meeting  -- prior to the previously determined date. The combination of  these factors brought about a slight rise in the price of oil in  the early days of the year.    In transactions concluded on the final days of 1993, oil  prices sank to the lowest level in the past five years, and the  average price for OPEC oil basket was fixed around $12.67.    The 30 percent decline in oil price in 1993 created serious  difficulties for most of the petroleum exporting countries.    Iran and Saudi Arabia have always played key roles in OPEC  since the creation of this highly significant world economic  organization in 1960. In fact OPEC is the only international  organization which sets price on a single raw material that is  produced mainly by a number of Third World countries. The  industrially advanced countries of the world have never really  liked this system of price determination. They had been  accustomed for too long to the arrogant assumption that it was  their natural right to determine prices both for the raw  materials they imported from the Third World countries as well  as the price of the industrial commodities they exported to  those countries. That is why they have always been trying to  weaken OPEC and undermine its very foundations.    Even before the Islamic Revolution in February 1979, the  industrial powers of the world tried to create tensions between  Tehran and Riyadh, and although at that time government systems  in both countries were monarchies attached to the West, for the  reasons cited above the industrial powers of the world did  everything and mostly succeeded in keeping bilateral ties  between the two countries in a strained condition, specially  during the 8 years of Iraq's war of aggression against Iran.    Nevertheless, in spite of all the casualties and the losses  to which the countries in the region had been subjected, the  events of the war had the ironic effect of lifting the veil of  deception and exposing the bare truth. The countries in the  region, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia which perform key  roles, realized the problems of the region and its security  needs will have to be settled and resolved through peaceful  cooperation among themselves. And once the regional countries  have learned to settle the basic issue of the regional security  through peaceful strategies, more expanded cooperations such as  preserving their natural right to set the price of oil will  automatically follow.    No doubt small groups in both Tehran and Riyadh will try to  create tension and crisis between the two countries. But these  groups are not in decisive positions in either of the two  capitals, and in the final analysis what counts is the decisions  reached at the level of the leaders of the two countries  regarding the creation of cordial relationships.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard reaps the reward of Risc - The computer company's new chief executive finds no room for complacency HEWLETT-Packard, in common with other leading computer companies, is adjusting to a new chief executive. But, unlike IBM and Digital Equipment, Mr Lewis Platt, who replaced Mr John Young as head of the California-based company last July, took over a well-tuned machine in no immediate need of running repairs. Revenues, profits and orders at Hewlett-Packard are buoyant, in marked contrast with many of its competitors who are struggling with weak sales and heavy overheads. Mr Platt, aged 51 and with the company for 26 years, sees no cause for complacency: 'A company has continually to re-invent itself. The difficult part is making changes while you are doing well. You have got to start before the downhill trends are obvious.' When Mr Young was appointed chief executive in 1978, revenues were Dollars 1.3bn, mostly derived from test and measurement equipment and hand-held calculators. This year, sales are likely to top Dollars 16bn, placing it among the world's top three information technology suppliers. Its chief strength is now in computers and desk-top printers. It benefited greatly from a relationship with Canon of Japan in laser printers, but exploited its own technology in taking the lead in ink-jet machines. The computer sector remains a difficult market, however, and investors are nervous. A report of Mr Platt's remarks to analysts in Frankfurt last week caused havoc when it seemed he was warning of slowing sales and order growth in the second half of the year. The shares fell Dollars 7.50 to Dollars 79.50, and 160 analysts called HP's headquarters to check the accuracy of the report. In fact, Mr Platt explained, he had made no prediction of sales growth: he had simply warned that growth in new orders was unlikely to reach the 26 per cent seen in the first half. 'I do not want to come in with an 18 or 20 per cent order growth rate - which I think would be spectacular in this environment - and have the analysts say: 'Oh God, they're not at 25 any more'.' Late last week, the shares settled at Dollars 81. HP's trading performance over the past few years has been impressive at a time when IBM, Digital Equipment and the leading Japanese computer manufacturers have been making losses. Last month, the company reported a net income of Dollars 608m for the first half of the year, compared with Dollars 293m in the same period the year before. Mr Platt said order growth had been strong across all product lines and all geographies: 'Europe was exceptionally strong, the US was good, the Far East was good and in Japan where we have been struggling, growth was in double digits.' His explanation why HP seems to be performing so well while others are in trouble turns on the company's domination of the desk-top printer business - not the sexiest of product lines, but a valuable model for the rest of the company. 'We were lucky to have been successful in laser printers,' he said. 'It is a business characterised by low margins and needs a radically different cost structure. So we started to work on our cost structures some years ago. 'It was logical to assume the same low margins would eventually be obtained in the rest of the business. Now in personal computers gross margins are probably 20 per cent, compared with the 60 per cent HP had been used to. 'We learned the lesson the whole computer business is going thorough and we learned it just that little bit ahead of everybody else'. He also drew attention to HP's product portfolio, ranging from palmtop personal computers to medical diagnostic equipment: 'We have been good at hitting the mark with the right products.' HP, in fact, is harvesting the benefits of a bold decision in the mid-1980s to revamp its entire computer line to take advantage of a powerful but unfamiliar technology - reduced instruction set computing (Risc). Invented by IBM, Risc computers get their speed and power from a combination of complex software and simple hardware. It was a troubled time for HP: 'We were not in vogue at all then,' Mr Platt says drily. Today, all the leading computer manufacturers are turning to Risc and to open, or industry standard, systems. HP's version of Risc, Precision Architecture, is well-established and the basis of its healthy computer business. It is a key to client server computing, a significant trend today. HP's move to Risc is an example of the way the company reinvents itself. Another is the rejuvenation of its test and measurement operations. HP started in test and measurement; the division is 53 years old. Three years ago, however, profits slipped as spending in aerospace and defence declined and customers turned to computer workstations rather than dedicated instruments. A re-engineering team moved in to spruce up the products and restructure the division. One decision was to develop equipment for the fast-growing telecommunications industry: 'We jumped in with both feet,' Mr Platt says. 'That sector of the business grew 30 per cent last year.' He has three objectives for 1993 and beyond. The first is aggressive restructuring to improve profitability. The second he describes as 'order fulfilment' by which he means tackling customer dissatisfaction - the company has the reputation, for example, of being difficult to deal with. The third is to reinforce HP's culture with its emphasis on enlightened management. When will he initiate HP's next round of re-invention? 'What we are doing today is going to work for several more years,' he says. 'Open systems, the Unix operating system, client-server computing - we are in the early days of these trends.'</p>

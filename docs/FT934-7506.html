			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Technology: Pin-sized chip pricks thieves - Worth Watching A tiny microchip, just the size of a pinhead, could help police identify stolen vehicles, computers or mobile telephones. Developed by Selectamark Security, of Kent, the Selectatag is programmed with a unique identification code - in the case of a car that could be the chassis number. Once programmed, using a hand-held reading and writing device, the tag cannot be changed without the appropriate authorisation. If a car is then recovered the police can use the hand-held device to read the number. The tiny chip, which is circled by its own antenna, can be read through glass, wood, plastic and in metal from distances of up to seven inches. Selectamark: UK, 0689 860757.</p>

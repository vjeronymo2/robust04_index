			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (2): Technology advance drives sales growth; On-Line Transaction Processing - The view from the US, Louise Kehoe in San Francisco assesses changing market strategies and unveils a palmtop ON-LINE transaction processing has grown to encompass a full third of world computer market since its beginnings in airline reservation systems and banking. These interactive computer systems serve in a growing range of business applications, from production management to customer service. With sales last year of approximately Dollars 40bn worldwide, OLTP is growing at an annual rate of about 20 per cent and will be a Dollars 72bn market by 1994, according to market analysts. Growth in the OLTP market is being driven by its broadening use in telecommunications, manufacturing and retail industries, which have become big users of OLTP. Technology advances in parallel processing and microprocessor performance have downsized OLTP, creating applications and making this mode of computing available to small and medium-sized businesses as well as large corporations. OLTP has been impacted by the trend toward open systems based upon the Unix operating system. Unix-based OLTP will grow to between Dollars 18bn and Dollars 21bn by 1994, according to Dataquest, the market research company. The emergence of relational database management systems software has been a driving force in the growth of OLTP. These programs, which enable users to access information wherever it resides in a database, have become the basis for a broad range of business applications running on OLTP systems. 'Fault tolerant', or 'high availability' computers represent an important segment of the OLTP market. As businesses entrust their most critical functions to computer systems, the reliability of the systems and their ability to continue functioning through power failures, component failures, software updates and all manner of events that can bring the average computer to its knees has become vital. Traditionally, OLTP systems have been based upon mainframe computers with International Business Machines claiming the lion's share of the market. IBM holds an estimated 55 per cent share of the OLTP market, largely based upon its dominant role in mainframe computers. While IBM is expected to remain the market leader, its share of the OLTP market will decline, according to industry analysts, as microprocessor-based parallel processing systems - many of them running the Unix operating system - displace traditional mainframes. Tandem Computers, pioneered the 'fault tolerant' computer market selling its proprietary computers to banks and securities companies. Lower spending in the financial services industries have hurt Tandem's earnings over the past year but with 1990 revenues of Dollars 506.1bn the company remains the market leader in fault-tolerant computers. Last year, Tandem introduced its first open systems products, offering a range of Unix computers based upon Mips Computers Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) chips. In addition to selling its Unix computers direct to end users, Tandem signed an agreement with A T &amp; T under which the telecommunications and computing company will resell the Tandem products. Biting at the heels of IBM and Tandem are a new generation of specialist OLTP computer companies led by Stratus Computer, Sequent Computer Systems and Pyramid Technology. Stratus specialises in what it terms 'critical on-line computing' or high availability computing for mission critical applications. Stratus's stronghold is in the financial services industry where it provides systems for stock trading, automatic teller networks and credit card authorisation. Stratus is, however, expanding its customer base in other fields such as retailing, manufacturing and telecommunications. Stratus recently launched a new product line based upon Intel's 860 Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor, following a trend toward the use of high performance RISC processors in OLTP. The company is also making a transition from a proprietary operating system to open systems based upon the Unix operating system. Some 20 per cent of Stratus's Dollars 404m 1990 revenues came via IBM, which sells Stratus computers on an OEM basis. Over the past year, however, Stratus's business with IBM has flattened as IBM increasingly targets 'mission critical' applications with its own computers. Stratus expects to expand its direct sales to more than compensate for the IBM shortfall. The company is in particular targeting the emerging market lligent networks' as deregulated telephone companies offer new services such as store and forward facsimile, free-phone numbers and voice messaging services. Sequent Computer Systems' products, based upon the Intel line of microprocessors running a version of the Unix operating system, demonstrate the price and performance advantages that microprocessor-based parallel processing has over traditional mainframes. Sequent's Symmetry 2000 family of computers, introduced in January, incorporates up to 30 of Intel's latest 486 microprocessors and achieves mainframe class performance at what the company claims is an 80 per cent price/performance advantage over other Unix mainframe computers and an even greater edge over traditional proprietary mainframes. The 8-year-old Sequent, with 1990 revenues of Dollars 249m, has built its business upon automating applications that cannot be cost-effectively handled by a mainframe computer. Examples range from a currency management system for British Airways to an emergency room scheduling system for a California hospital. Pyramid Technology, another OLTP specialist, achieved a remarkable 73 per cent growth in revenues in fiscal 1990, to reach Dollars 180m for the year ending last September. Pyramid, of the Silicon Valley, is about to launch a range of products based upon Mips Computer's RISC microprocessors. While the niche players of the OLTP market are making inroads, the big companies of the computer industry are not standing still. Unisys, traditionally a large supplier of mainframe-based OLTP and also a re-seller of Sequent computers, last week unveiled hardware and software products that establish its strategic direction toward open-systems based OLTP. Unisys expanded its product line with mid-range systems, which it will manufacture in-house. Based on the Intel 486 with up to five processors, the new Unisys 6000/65 has a peak performance of 118 MIPs and will run the latest version of A T &amp; T's Unix, System V4. Unisys also unveiled new Unix OLTP software including an improved version of A T &amp; T's 'transaction manager' which will improve performance and reliability, the company claims. Digital Equipment's OLTP revenues grew by approximately 35 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn in 1990, according to analysts at Hambrecht &amp; Quist, the San Francisco investment bank. Digital is emphasising fault tolerance. DEC launched its first specifically fault-tolerant computers early last year but according to industry analysts the products failed to have a significant impact on the market. Last month, DEC unveiled its second generation fault tolerant products - a new range of aggressively-priced VAX minicomputers designed for mission critical applications which analysts predict will do much better. Hewlett-Packard is also taking a stab at the fail-safe computer market through an investment in Sequoia Systems, a small manufacturer of fault-tolerant computers. HP will resell Sequoia's machines and gain access to its technology. As competition mounts, the OLTP market will become increasingly segmented, analysts predict. Increasingly, the ability to perform OLTP will become a prerequisite of commercial computing systems or all sizes.</p>

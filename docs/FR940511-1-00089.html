			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the analysis used, EPA is proposing to add tribromophenol to the list of 40 CFR Part 261 Appendix VIII toxic hazardous constituents based on its structural activity relationship with 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and the potential exposure as described above. The Agency also is proposing to add tribromophenol to the list of commercial chemical products (40 CFR 261.33) that are hazardous wastes if discarded or spilled. The wastes specifically proposed for listing are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> K140_Waste solids and filter cartridges from the production of 2,4,6- tribromophenol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U408_2,4,6-Tribromophenol. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will evaluate carefully all public comments and information received in response to this notice, particularly data which tend to support or refute a finding of risk to human health and the environment from TBP wastes. Based on the comments received, the Agency may finalize or re-evaluate today's proposed listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Wastewaters. Data available to the Agency suggests that tribromophenol is produced only at the part of the one major facility in which the wastewaters are injected into non-hazardous deep wells. As off-site management of these wastewaters is probably economically prohibitive, the Agency assumed for the plausible mismanagement scenario that the plant would continue the use of underground injection. In order to estimate risk, EPA had to estimate the length of time injection would continue. The Agency assumed that the plant would inject these wastewaters for up to 60 years, at which point the production of tribromophenol could end because the supply of raw material could run out. Because of the large volume of wastewater generated by this process, the Agency used more sophisticated modelling than for the lower volume wastes. Modelling of the risk due to the management of the wastewaters from TBP production in underground injection was based on the use of three linked submodels. The overall model included:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A submodel which simulates the subsurface lateral migration of TBP from the injection wells to nearby abandoned oil wells penetrating the injection horizons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A second submodel which simulates the vertical migration of TBP from the injection horizon upward to the drinking water aquifer; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Finally, a submodel which predicts the lateral spreading of the chemical from the abandoned oil well in the drinking water aquifer and exposure to vertically averaged concentrations present in drinking water wells within the aquifer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was assumed that the abandoned wells are filled with compacted sand. Results of the simulated runs are presented in the background document in terms of concentrations as a function of time for various exposure distances. The initial concentration of tribromophenol in the injected wastewater was measured in record sampling to be 7 mg/L and the health-based level (based on a 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  risk level) was assumed to be 0.01 mg/L (using the same high end exposure assumptions described above for tribromophenol solids). The modeling results showed that the health-based level (based on a 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  risk) would be exceeded in the upper aquifer after 60 years (the amount of time the injection is expected to continue) at very short distances (less than 10 feet) from a leaking, abandoned, and plugged (i.e., filled with sand) oil well. The results also indicated that the plume of contamination would migrate through the aquifer, away from the plugged oil well, and slowly dissipate over time. Therefore, this plume of contamination could result in exposure to TBP over the health-based level beyond a short distance from the abandoned oil well, if a drinking water well is drilled downgradient from that abandoned oil well. However, this exposure would probably be limited because of the relatively small size of the area in the migrating contaminated plume where TBP is above 0.01 mg/L. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has also sampled drinking water wells at the plant site and at a private facility 1.3 miles distant. No tribromophenol was found at a detection level of 0.001 mg/L. The plant has been producing TBP since 1976. The absence of TBP in groundwater at present, however, does not completely preclude its presence at a future date. Considering that TBP was not detected in the aquifer and that the model predicted only limited exposure to TBP above the health-based number, the Agency is proposing not to list this wastestream because of relatively low risk to human health. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Agency recognizes that the modeling results described above are dependent on numerous assumptions, including the injection timeframe (i.e., 60 years) and the number and characteristics of the abandoned oil wells. Modifying certain of these assumptions could significantly change the results of this analysis. For example, if the Agency assumes that the abandoned oil well is unfilled, underground injection of this wastewater could result in a contamination plume (with TBP levels above the health-based level) of up to 4000 feet from the well over 60 years and even further away as the plume continues to migrate after 60 years. Also, depending on the exact location of the drinking water well relative to the plume centerline, a person drinking from that well could be exposed to a high concentration of TBP (up to around 5 mg/L) for many years as the contaminated plume moves by. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

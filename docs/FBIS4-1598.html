			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Croats and  Muslims have taken new steps toward federation as the Bosnian  Croat parliament approved the plan, and military leaders from  both sides agreed to set up a joint army command Saturday [26  March].    In Mostar, south-western Bosnia, lawmakers of the  self-declared (Croatian) republic of Herzeg-Bosnia voted almost  unanimously for the new federation plan signed in Washington  last week.    The Muslim-dominated Bosnian parliament is also due to meet  on Monday in Sarajevo to debate the plan, crafted by U.S. and  Russian mediators and signed by Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic, Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak, and Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman.    Earlier today, the commander of the Muslim-led government  army, General Rasim Delic, and the chief of Bosnian Croat  forces, General Ante Roso, signed an accord in Sarajevo on a  joint army command, the first practical step toward forming the  new federation.    The military leaders agreed that the joint army command  should operate until the formation of a new federal army, after  a new federal constitution has been passed.    The agreement on the new federation would mean the end of  Herzeg-Bosnia as an independent entity. The Serbs, however, who  control nearly 70 percent of Bosnia, have rejected any  participation in the new union, ignoring appeals from Washington  and Moscow.    Delic told reporters after signing the military accord that  he had held "cordial and constructive" talks with his Croatian  counterpart. But he failed to give more details.    Roso also spoke highly of the accord, saying that it has  created the necessary conditions for Croats and Muslims to live  together in peace.</p>

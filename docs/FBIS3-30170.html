In this period, a remarkable progress has been made in the  comprehensive mechanisation of agriculture, the number of  tractors increasing 6 times, lorries 5 times, weeding machines  5.6 times, harvester combines 7 times and rice harvesters 1.5  times.    Each subworkteam of the cooperative farms across the country  has one or more rice-transplanting machines and rice-seedling  pullers, putting the mechanisation of farm work on a high level.    In "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country",  the great leader President Kim Il-song set the task to carry out  the comprehensive mechanisation of agriculture, a part of the  rural technical revolution, and indicated ways for its  implementation.    He saw to it that many industrial establishments engaged in  agriculture such as tractor, spare part, farm machine and farm  tool plants and farm machine stations were built in all parts of  the country.    Thus, the Kumsong general tractor works, the "chungsong"  tractor plant and several hundred trailing machine factories and  farm machine stations have made their appearance in many places  of the country.    With the brisk training of agrotechnicians, experts and  tractor drivers the number has markedly increased.    Under the bright rays of the rural theses, the agricultural  working people of Korea now do all farm work ranging from  ploughing of paddy and non-paddy fields to sowing,  rice-transplanting, weeding, harvesting, threshing and transport  with the help of machines.</p>

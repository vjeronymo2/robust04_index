			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV OF THE PUBLIC BY THE PUBLIC AND FOR THE PUBLIC  </P> <P> For a long time, the only time people watched or heard about public access  television was when it became the subject of a national news story on TV. White  Aryan Resistance leader Tom Metzger, a rebel with a cause, stirred up the press  when he used the platform for electronic free speech to show his "Race and  Reason" program. Porno magazine publisher Al Goldstein raised some eyebrows  when he titillated New York with "Midnight Blue," a nude public access talk  show.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the Orange County producers of "Secret Passions," the  nation's first homosexual soap opera, reportedly sent their program to local  public access channels because it was the only arena where they believed they  could find air time.  </P> <P> But community programmers insist that such controversial programming is no  longer the norm. Public access viewing audiences are expanding because the  producers are getting more sophisticated.  </P> <P> Public access is a permanent fixture in roughly 2,000 of the 9,010 cable  systems in the United States, including Copley/Colony Cablevision in Orange  County. The service is part of the franchise agreements that city and county  governments arrange with cable companies.  </P> <P> With public access, anyone can be a producer.  </P> <P> "The normal guy who sits down at home in front of his television set can relate  to us," said Omar White, a direct-mail advertiser and public access producer in  Costa Mesa. The 37-year-old spends most of his spare time producing "Fish  Report," a half-hour cable program for local fisherman. In one episode, White  went shark fishing off the Newport Beach coast.  </P> <P> "Public access is kind of a nuts-and-bolts approach to television," White said.  "You learn how to balance production budgets, schedule shoots, write scripts.  It brings television down to the community level. I'm not some guy from New  York who shows up in a box on the TV screen. I go to the grocery market in town  and people recognize me."  </P> <P> "The main advantage of public access is the freedom," Sarah Kuhn of Costa Mesa  said. "I'm able to do whatever topics interest me." The 55-year-old  telemarketer produces "People, Places and Things," a magazine show that deals  with sensitive topics such as AIDS, battered women, drunk driving, drama  therapy and pregnancy options.  </P> <P> "I like to think I'm offering something to the community," Kuhn said.  </P> <P> Other producers with Copley/ Colony have created programs that range from a  health show to community theater productions to a sort of "Two on the Town" for  teen-agers produced by local Girl Scouts.  </P> <P> The Federal Communications Commission first mandated public access in 1972.  Growth of public access in Southern California was slow to catch on, due in  part to the abundance of local television programming and a scattered patchwork  of cable TV systems.  </P> <P> "In Los Angeles there is no one public access center, no one entity that is  responsible for creating a community image," said Sharon Ingraham, chairwoman  of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers in Washington, D.C. "In a  smaller community, the public access channel may be the only form of local  television available. It draws the community together because it's where people  turn to for local news, issues and events."  </P> <P> To help stimulate public access in Orange County, cities such as Costa Mesa and  Cypress offer grants of up to several thousand dollars to producers to help  ease production costs.  </P> <P> "We obviously don't have the money to work with that the networks do, but then  again, you don't have to deal with the politics," said Shelly Lash, a member of  the Costa Mesa Cable Television Committee, which advises the City Council on  grant funds. "There's no excuse for complaining what's on television when you  can do your own show."  </P> <P> The only qualifications to sign up for the free public access certification  classes are that producers must be 18 years old, or accompanied by a certified  adult producer, and live or work in the cable-service area. In addition,  productions are exclusively for local programming and cannot be used for  commercial purposes.  </P> <P> Roger Heaney and his twin brother Ryan of Cypress used part of their $500 grant  to rent fog machines to produce a 20-minute "sight and sound fantasy" called  "Touch the Horizon," a tale about the last girl on Earth following World War  III. For the 23-year-old brothers' next production, a musical extravaganza  called "Prowl," they are building sets, designing costumes, renting laser  units, composing original music and featuring a cast of 30 dancers.  </P> <P> "When it comes down to it, not a whole lot of people are interested in doing  production work," Roger Heaney said. "Sure, people look at it and it looks  really glamorous. But when you go out and actually do it, you realize how much  work producing a TV show really is."  </P></p>

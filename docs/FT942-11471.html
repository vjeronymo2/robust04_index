			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Forestry groups find way out of the woods - Recovery is under way in Nordic paper and pulp sector A long-awaited recovery is taking hold in the Nordic pulp and paper industry, as first-quarter figures from Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, clearly show. The company reported a SKr1.07bn (Dollars 140.6m) profit after financial items, compared with a SKr78m loss a year ago. Even after stripping out one-off items, the group swung to a SKr430m profit from a SKr93m deficit. The revival is fuelled by rising prices, although the development is so recent it will only begin to affect Stora from the second quarter. In the first quarter the improved outlook was reflected in increased orders and higher deliveries rather than prices. The group also benefited from the strong dollar, cost-cutting and lower interest rates. However the market has turned dramatically. Pulp prices, which languished at Dollars 380 a tonne last November, are targetted to reach Dollars 560 a tonne in June - a rise of nearly 50 per cent. This has had a direct impact on fine paper grades, where prices have risen by 20 per cent, and it is slowly feeding through to other grades. Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora president, said one factor in the revival was a faster-than-expected recovery in European markets. 'The market in Germany has stabilised and a slight upturn was noted during the spring,' he said. With Europe swallowing more than 70 per cent of the Nordic region's pulp and paper, improved demand there will be the quickest way for Nordic companies to boost output and ultimately lift prices. This will enable them to build on the momentum which saw a return to profitability in 1993, after two loss-making years - a turnround achieved after a three-year cost-cutting drive. Another big factor was the weakness of the Swedish and Finnish currencies, which sharply improved Nordic competitiveness. The recovery is still not fully entrenched, however. Prices for some paper grades, such as newsprint and coated magazine papers, have risen by no more than 5 per cent. In the case of uncoated magazine paper, there has been no price increase at all. There are also worries that the pulp price has risen too far, too fast. The surge has been driven by several short-term factors, including disruptions in hard wood supplies from Russia, stock rebuilding, and fears of strikes in British Columbia. Many analysts, fearing that overcapacity is still endemic in the industry, believe there could be a correction in prices later in the year. Even more worrying for Swedish and Finnish producers is their strengthening currencies and the weakening dollar. For some grades, such as uncoated magazine paper, receipts in local currency terms are lower this year than last. 'The strengthening of the Finnish markka, which started at the end of 1993, combined with rising production costs will show in 1994 as poorer results than for (1993),' Mr Olli Parola, chief executive of United Paper Mills, warned. He said 'internal arrangements' and a 'clear improvement' in prices would be needed if the group was to match last year's FM1.25bn (Dollars 234m) profit. UPM is the world's biggest producer of uncoated magazine paper and the fifth biggest in newsprint, an unfavourable bias in current conditions. By contrast, fellow Finnish producer Kymmene, which last year suffered a FM256m deficit, is well positioned for a strong return to the black this year. Last year's handicaps - a big exposure to fine paper and a high degree of production in 'hard currency' countries such as France and Germany - have turned into this year's advantage. A key question for Nordic forestry groups will be whether they can hold costs down. Warning bells have already sounded as producers in Finland and Sweden have recently conceded increases in wood prices, although they stress that this was a natural re-adjustment after a drop in prices of up to 35 per cent in the last three years. In the past, devaluation benefits have been squandered by explosive costs growth, particularly in wages. However, Mr Timo Poranen, chief executive of Metsa-Serla, says Finland will be cost competitive for a long time. Like most of its competitors, Metsa-Serla expects a better result this year, but it notes that much of the impact will come from lower financial outlays following a big reduction in debt. Other groups will see the same effect, due to improved cash flow, low investment levels, and capital-raising exercises. Companies will also benefit from lower interest rates and reduced foreign exchange losses.</p>

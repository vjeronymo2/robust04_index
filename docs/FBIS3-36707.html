However, he added that if the  first president of the Crimea violates the Ukrainian  Constitution or any other laws, the Ukrainian president will  have the right to annul his resolutions. The position of the  Supreme Council of Ukraine was not so clear at that time. As  everyone knows, many deputies stated that the Crimean elections  were unconstitutional. I asked Supreme Council Chairman Ivan  Plyushch to give his opinion on the results of the elections in  the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.    [Plyushch] Elections in the Crimea have been held. I  accepted the results of the first round, and likewise those of  the second. According to the results of the second round, Yuriy  Meshkov was elected the Crimean president. I always want to see  more bright, white things than dark and dangerous ones.  Therefore, as you know, we drafted constitutional resolutions  that were discussed by the Supreme Council Constitutional  Commission with the participation of committee chairmen and  presidential representatives. Later, they were submitted to the  Supreme Council for consideration. True, the drafts have not  been approved, but they do contain a provision for the entire  population of an oblast to elect an official to head the local  council and executive authorities. The Crimea is one of our  territories that has the status of an autonomous republic.  Following the example of the Crimea, we develop relations  between the center and regions. The first thing we did was  therefore to adopt legislation on the division of economic  powers between Kiev and the Crimea. I supported this at the  time, and I continue to do so, since it does not make any sense  to govern everything from the center, as was previously done  from Moscow. Replacing Moscow with Kiev does not make any  sense. By doing so, we would have 25 cabinets of ministers all  over Ukraine. Everything that is provided for by basic  constitutional resolutions has taken place in the Crimea -- they  have elected a president who will head the executive branch.  The fate of the legislative branch is, as yet, unknown. Yet,  according to Crimean legislation, their president has no right  to dissolve the Crimean Supreme Council or ordain a referendum  on confidence or nonconfidence in the Crimean parliament. This  means that there is no problem. The legislative body elected by  the Crimean people is still functioning. Although Mykola Bahrov  tendered his resignation following consultations with members of  the Supreme Council Presidium, or maybe with somebody else, it  was decided to send him off on leave, to let him relax after his  disappointment. Meanwhile, the Crimean Supreme Council will  continue to operate under Maslov, who has to perform the duties  of its chairman. A plenary session is to be held today, at  which Crimean President Meshkov will deliver a speech and take  the oath of office.    I am glad that Yuriy Meshkov, neither during the first round  of elections nor the second one, nor at press conferences, has  said that he would pursue a course of separating the Crimea from  Ukraine. Regarding his statements on broad and close integration  with Russia and an economic zone, may God grant that this  happens. If regions integrate economically, it will be easier  for Ukraine to integrate with foreign countries. I would not  like to make a problem out of this. One should try to gain some  experience from this issue. Although Meshkov says that he does  not see any forms of cooperation with Russia and Ukraine at the  moment, I believe that our legislation provides for such forms.  Still, there are certain acts adopted by the Crimean  legislature which do not conform to Ukrainian ones. Our  Committee for Legal and Legislative Issues has therefore listed  discrepancies between the two sets of legislation. The Crimea  has also obtained this list. We have asked our Crimean  colleagues to adjust their legislation to meet that of Ukraine.  I believe that, after a meeting between the Ukrainian and  Crimean presidents, and following an official statement by  Leonid Kravchuk, this issue will again be addressed. Although  there are various ways of achieving this, I am for consolidation  rather than confrontation.    I categorically disagree with those who compare Zhirinovskiy  with Meshkov and what is taking place in Russia with  developments in the Crimea. I do not see the elections as  Bahrov's defeat and Meshkov's victory. More than 70 percent of  the people voted for an improvement of life on the peninsula.  They want everything to remain as it was in the past -- they  want all nationalists, from the near and far abroad, to continue  visiting the Crimea, the economic zone to continue functioning,  and mutually beneficial ties to continue developing. If Meshkov  manages to achieve this, of course without leaving Ukraine, I  will praise him and be envious of his successes. If he fails to  do so, well, not everyone can succeed.    [Mostovaya] Ivan Stepanovych, what do you think about  the tripartite declaration signed in Moscow?    [Plyushch] My opinion about the declaration is unequivocally  positive. I think that it was the only possible decision in  terms of sense, although its form is not perfect. However, we  are only a subject of the tripartite declaration. Could we  dictate the form? Of course not. I would have surely preferred,  as a citizen and an official, that Clinton had met with Kravchuk  not at the airport but at his official residence, as with any  other state leader.... I believe that this declaration was yet  another step toward satisfying the Supreme Council's  reservations about the 18 November resolution on ratifying the  START I treaty. Although the declaration includes a chapter  concerning other types of nonnuclear strategic weapons, we  should not make a problem out of this. Let us liquidate the  nuclear weapons first, and then we will talk about other types  of strategic offensive arms. I believe that this declaration  not only gives us guarantees, but also prevents territorial  claims and interference in Ukraine's internal affairs. This  agreement came in the very nick of time, since it included  security guarantees for us. Even if they were not formulated as  we wished, they are still better than none.    [Mostovaya] Will the current parliament examine the  tripartite declaration?    [Plyushch] Although it is very hard for me to speak about  this, I do not think that the declaration is an agreement.  Therefore, it is not subject to ratification by parliament.  Moreover, the document was signed on behalf of Ukraine, Russia,  and the United States. Only agreements, not declarations, are  signed this way. Although there are some flaws, this is not the  most important aspect. The most important thing is that the  declaration answers the reservations put forward by the  legislature on 18 November. Therefore, I believe that the  current Supreme Council should decide whether or not the  tripartite declaration signed by our president conforms to the  resolution concerning the START I treaty.    [Mostovaya] Yet the president has requested that the  issue of acceding to the treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons also be examined....    [Plyushch] This will be the responsibility of the next  Supreme Council. It will depend on how the provisions of the  tripartite declaration are fulfilled. Such issues should not be  rushed.</p>

Ciampi this morning began a series of consultations in view  of the January 12 debate on no-confidence motions in the Senate  and Lower House. He met with delegations from the Christian  Democrat, Socialist, Social Democrat, and Liberal parties, all  of which said they did not have any strong objections to holding  general elections at the same time as European Parliament  elections, already scheduled for June.    Ciampi also met Marco Pannella, the Federalist Party leader  who submitted the no-confidence motions.    Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Pannella reiterated  his claim that Ciampi should resign immediately and that a  second "political government," again led by Ciampi, should be  formed and allowed to govern "with full powers" until early  elections are held.    But Christian Democrat Party leader Mino Martinazzoli at a  press conference after meeting Ciampi said there was no need "to  rush to elections" and did not rule out the possibility of  linking general elections with those for the European parliament.    Socialist Party Secretary Ottaviano Del Turco said he will  ask those party members who signed the no-confidence motions to  withdraw their signatures, adding that Ciampi can count on the  full support of the Socialists in parliament. Del Turco, too,  said that joining general and European Parliament elections  would be "good fortune for the country."    The Social Democrats said more or less the same things as  the  Socialists, adding that holding only one round of elections  would save the state about one trillion lire (588 million  dollars).    Even Liberal Party Senate whip Luigi Compagna, who yesterday  had denounced Ciampi for allegedly siding with the Left  Democrats, today conceded that Ciampi was "not at all  off-balance in favor of Achille Occhetto," the Left Democrat  chief, and was instead "very concerned about maintaining his  government's institutional standing."    The Liberal Party Lower House whip, Savino Melillo,  commented  that the idea of putting together two elections in June "does  not seem inappropriate."    Most politicians officially agree that the cabinet led by  Ciampi, a former central bank governor who does not belong to  any party, and parliament have both fulfilled their main duties  (approving an austerity budget and getting new election laws in  place) and should now step aside. But the no-confidence motions  were in fact signed by those members of traditional parties that  have governed Italy for decades, that have been hit hardest by  corruption scandals and that stand to lose the most if elections  are held immediately.    The no-confidence motions are therefore seen by opponents as  a last-ditch attempt to delay general elections and give the  old-style politicians the opportunity to save their careers.</p>

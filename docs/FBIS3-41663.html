Michael  Graetzel of the Physical Chemistry Institute of the Federal  Technical College in Lausanne has succeeded in developing  dye-coated titanium dioxide elements which are far simpler to  make than conventional silicon solar cells.    Graetzel told an international convention on solar and  hydrogen technology in Freising a few weeks ago that the new  solar cells are already being used in electronic bathroom  scales. They are also used in solar-powered wrist watches, the  material replacing the watch-glass. Although the output is only  a few microwatts, it is quite sufficient for the watch mechanism.    The starting point for Graetzel's idea was photosynthesis,  the photochemical principle used by plants to obtain energy from  sunlight. Graetzel's ``photoelectrochemical'' cell uses a dye  to capture light quanta like chlorophyll does in plants.  Graetzel found titanium dioxide to be a semiconductor material  which transmits the photon charge as electricity in the form of  electrons; tests have shown it to be extremely stable.    The essential trick is to roughen the titanium dioxide  coating to increase its surface area and thus the number of  photons captured. In direct light the new solar cell currently  achieves a 10 percent voltage efficiency. Graetzel believes the  efficiency can be doubled in the next few years. By comparison,  cells made from amorphous silicon, currently the cheapest  material, reach an energy efficiency of only around 5 percent.    In diffuse light, where silicon cells provide hardly any  power worth mentioning, the efficiency of the titanium dioxide  element is now already around 18 percent. This is chiefly  because the titanium dioxide's rough nanocrystalline surface is  suited to the spectrum of diffuse (longer wavelength) light.  This makes the new technology of interest for applications in  our latitudes since the solar cell can provide electricity even  with a cloudy sky.    Graetzel describes manufacture as relatively simple,  requiring neither high temperatures, vacuum, nor nitrogen  pressure chambers. Titanium dioxide can be applied to glass by  screen printing. Titanium is also a common natural element, and  titanium dioxide is nontoxic, unlike the semiconductors cadmium  tellurite and copper indium diselenite, which are also used for  solar cells.    Graetzel said that a Gelsenkirchen plate glass firm intends  to make 100 watt solar modules. A pilot plant for mass  production will be ready there in three years' time. The  material is expected to cut the current high costs for solar  modules to one tenth.</p>

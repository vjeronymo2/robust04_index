			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Books: British justice in the dock - New insights into the disturbing story of the Birmingham Six CRUEL FATE: ONE MAN'S TRIUMPH OVER INJUSTICE by Hugh Callaghan Poolbeg hardback Pounds 16.99, 207 pages; paperback Pounds 4.99, 237 pages After 16 years in prison for the Birmingham pub bombings, with which he had no connection, Hugh Callaghan spent his first night of freedom at a television company's expense in a smart Berkshire Hotel. He opened his wardrobe door in the morning to receive an unpleasant shock. A 'screw' (prison officer) was standing in the room. It took Callaghan a moment to realise that the figure was his own reflection in the long mirror. The disorientation caused by his terrible 16-year experience has not been easy to overcome. This book, written with an unaffected simplicity which gives it disturbing strength, is evidence that he has completed the process. It is also a humble but devastating indictment of the moral corruption that can lie at the heart of those British institutions which Michael Portillo says should command 'social respect.' Society's respect for the law depends largely on the law's ability to make itself respected. It is due only to the conscientious work of 'disrespectful' people like Chris Mullin MP that the law, which had for 16 years so complacently refused to listen to their protestations of innocence, eventually released Callaghan and the five other men. They were released, however, in a manner which ensured that the full truth did not emerge of the flawed process which had ruined their lives, and left the relatives of 21 people murdered in Birmingham equally without justice. This leaves respect for the law still wanting. People in high places can whisper that the convictions of the Birmingham Six were quashed 'only on a technicality.' They are put to shame here by the modesty with which Callaghan tells his story, in conjunction with Sally Mulready. The story's force comes from reliance on the power of the unsophisticated word. By the time Callaghan finds himself, to his bewilderment, in the hands of the police, you know the sort of straightforward man he is - an Aston Villa supporter fond of the occasional drink and a bet. His happiest memories of poor childhood, in the Belfast from which he had emigrated, are of playing football with a tennis ball in the streets; his worst memories of being beaten by a drunken father. After his arrest, though Callaghan never claimed to have been badly beaten by the police, as were the others, you soon find yourself asking if it can really be Britain in which such things are happening. For it becomes all too possible in these pages to see how a man can be brought to confess to a crime he did not commit. His description is primarily of psychological torture but he strikes a chill when, on arrival at Lancaster prison for the trial, still officially on remand, he remarks placidly: 'I began to realise that I was reasonably safe from assault here.' The few simple pages describing his bewilderment at the trial portray, as forcibly as any detailed study of the vast documentation available, that it was -for all its assumption of authority -a mockery of what authority ought to be. Not, of course, that there was any shortage of the proper procedures. The learned judge took three days to sum up. Callaghan writes: 'He lost his voice at one stage; but he could have saved his breath.' The same quiet note pervades the rest of the disturbing story - an account, over many years, of the degradation of prison life as hope and despair alternate like the seasons, while self-respect and the knowledge that dishonour is not on his side keeps him going. It is a quietness in which one can hear a number of pins drop - the second-rate quality of certain of the higher prison officials, including most of the (Catholic) chaplains, and the third-rate -and worse -quality of some of the lower officials. There are a number of ugly sounds too but they are conveyed with a near-poetic touch. 'There were many people in Albany who were mentally unstable. At night I could hear them screaming and talking to themselves, or sometimes laughing hysterically. It was a strange, terrible sound, bouncing off the walls of the prison.' Yes, this is a book about much more than a monstrous miscarriage of justice. One for Mr. Portillo in fact.</p>

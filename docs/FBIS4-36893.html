			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Riyad Miqdadi: "OPEC Expects Oil Prices To </F> Continue To Increase Until End of Year"]    [Text] Vienna -- Well-informed OPEC sources have confirmed  that OPEC ministers could decide to cancel their next  ministerial meeting, scheduled to be held in September, with a  view to sending a strong message to the market that OPEC is  going to adhere to its decision to extend the enforcement of the  output ceiling totaling 24.528 million barrels a day until the  end of the year.    The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that there is great  support for the Saudi proposal to cancel the meeting. They  pointed out that this issue is at the top of the agenda of the  OPEC ministers' meetings in Vienna this week. That is, in  addition to compliance with output quotas and the election of a  new secretary general.    An OPEC source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: "The talks are being  held this time in favorable conditions, as oil prices have  increased by more than 25 percent since the organization's last  meeting in March, and they are expected to improve further in  the coming months."    The source added that "the continued gradual improvement in  oil prices since OPEC's last meeting in Geneva last March  confirms the success of the organization's strategy to defend  its market quota."    The organization's sources expect oil prices to increase by  another $3 between now and the end of the year, provided member  states adhere to their quotas. An official from one of the  delegations said that "production excesses were the main cause  of the organization's loss of a lot of its credibility in the  market. And even though production excesses in recent months  have been relatively limited, they have limited the chances of a  bigger improvement in oil prices."</p>

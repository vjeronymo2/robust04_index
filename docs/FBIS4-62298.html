			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 12 May -- Moldavia [Moldova]  will be able to restore its economy, retrieve its former  positions, and gain a foothold on the huge Eastern market  through the creation of a single economic space of the CIS  countries, which will function without administrative and  economic difficulties. This was stated today by President  Mircea Snegur at his meeting with Christoph Parisini, Austrian  ambassador to Moldavia.    Joining the CIS and the Economic Union is a natural  necessity  for the republic's economy, which is closely connected with the  economies of the Commonwealth countries, Mircea Snegur stressed.  In his words, Moldavia plans to make its goods competitive by  modernizing its industry, including the processing industry,  with the help of Western firms.    Mircea Snegur said that after conducting the first  democratic  elections and the sociological poll on independence, the  socio-political situation in Moldavia gives rise to optimism.  The well-balanced stand of the parliamentary majority creates  prerequisites for settling the Gagauz and Dniester problems.    In the president's opinion, the decentralization of power by  way of granting a special legal status to the left-bank regions  is a sensible compromise.</p>

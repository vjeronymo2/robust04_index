			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] What prompted the Serb fascists to commit a new and  by far the largest massacre of civilians since the outbreak of  the war is a challenge for all conscientious analysts. The  chetniks knew that -- upon seeing the large number of killed and  badly wounded people at the Markale market -- the U.S.  Government would immediately hold an extraordinary session and  that the demands by the international community for air strikes  against the positions of Karadzic's Serbs would become more  urgent. They not only decided to lob the shell on the place  where most of the Sarelians gather, but they did it  deliberately, following a detailed project concocted not in  Pale, of course, but in Belgrade.    So what was the real motive for this crime? This is the  topic of today's editorial commentary.    [Unidentified commentator] Some believe that this was a  desperate move, as all the chetnik offensives have been crushed,  and the Croatian Council in Sarajevo (has broken off ties) with  Mate Boban, Karadzic's main ally in the partitioning of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Others believe that this was an attempt to  provoke our negotiators into giving up in Geneva. [sentence as  heard] Others -- and most foreigners are in this group --  believe that this is the culmination of the psychological  pressure exerted on Sarelians to give up further resistance.    The majority of people, however, believe that this was  really  a manipulation with the Serbs, this time devilishly planned.  Such a monstrous crime in front of the entire world community  is meant to cut off any retreat that the forcefully mobilized  youths in Karadzic's army might have, youths who have realized  what a bloody mess they have been forced into. The message to  them is: Try to go over to the other side. After such a crime,  the Muslims will slaughter you.    There is, of course, no need to mention that this shell,  just  like all the previous ones fired at Sarajevo, wanted to provoke  hatred and retaliation against the Serbs who are Bosnian  patriots, particularly those in Sarajevo. These Serbs have  shown the world that coexistence is possible; the entire concept  of greater Serbia collapsed on that. Analysts say that  Milosevic, Karadzic, and the rest of their gang hate no one as  much as they do these honorable and proud people.    However, even though all these reasons stand, the main  reason  is of a political nature. Milosevic has promised the  impoverished, hungry, and miserable Serbians that the sanctions  will be lifted soon and that normal life will resume. Now he  has to tell them that the worst is yet to come. Since the  Serbian regime and their puppets in Pale will never voluntarily  return the territories laid to waste through an act of genocide  and give up new conquests and crimes, the tightening of  sanctions is inevitable, while air strikes against their  positions still remain a possibility. Try to put yourselves in  the shoes of the Serbian rulers now when they have to explain to  the people who is to be blamed for their catastrophic situation.  Since the rulers of the fascist regime treat their subjects as  if they were mentally retarded, their explanation is: Well, see,  the Muslims have again massacred their own people and caused the  wrath of the international community against the Serbs. That was  how they explained the introduction of the sanctions. According  to them, the sanctions had nothing to do with Serbia's  aggression, massacres of defenseless people by the heavily armed  Serb army, concentration camps, and the mass liquidation of camp  inmates. According to them, the sanctions were imposed after  the allegedly plotted massacre of one own's people on Vase  Miskina Street in May 1992.    The circle of lies, deceits, and crimes of the greater  Serbian fascists is now closed, and the Markale market and the  scene of the Vase Miskina Street massacre are near each other,  very near. They are barely 100 meters apart, and they will be a  monument to the evil, brutality, and corruption of this new type  of fascism. Symbolically, this is an act much stronger than the  burning of the Reich Stag and the false Polish attack on the  German border post, as engineered by Hitler's Nazis.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Tuning in to rising fortunes: Commercial radio is in a confident mood Radio stations are to advertise in newspapers next year in an effort to persuade businesses to advertise on radio. The Pounds 2.5m campaign, aimed at decision-making readers of the broadsheet papers, claims that radio reaches 59 per cent of business people each week - 'more than the combined readership of The Times, Financial Times and Daily Telegraph.' The hope is that the campaign, backed by radio advertising which would cost a further Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m at rate-card prices, will help propel radio advertising towards 6 per cent of display advertising by the end of the decade. The campaign is a further sign of confidence and determination in an industry that two years ago had revenues stuck at 2 per cent of total advertising, and was ignored by many of the biggest brands and advertising agencies. It also coincides with an important symbolic crossover. Last week, for the first time in 21 years, the commercial sector won a bigger share of the total listening audience than the BBC. Revenues of Pounds 56.7m in the third quarter also mean the industry is on course to take a 4 per cent share of advertising for the first time this year, with more than half coming from national as opposed to local advertising. Mr David Mansfield, commercial director of Capital Radio, told the Commercial Radio Convention in Dublin at the weekend: 'Radio is no longer the medium of last resort. People are buying it for its unique qualities.' Advertisers and advertising agencies even felt the need at the convention to warn the industry of the difficulties of managing success and the need to avoid complacency and arrogance and putting their rates up too much. The most important single factor in the transformation has been the launch of the national commercial stations Classic FM and Virgin 1215, plus the 'unofficial' national station Atlantic 252 that broadcasts to the UK from the Republic of Ireland. Many advertisers have come to radio for the first time to advertise on the national stations - encouraged by the Radio Advertising Bureau, the first effective body set up to promote commercial radio - and have migrated to the existing independent local stations. Essex Radio, for example, expects to increase its national advertising revenues this year from about Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1m. A high proportion of the extra money will drop straight to the bottom line to boost profits. Last year the station had about 30 different national brands a month. Now it is about 50. The growth in confidence seems to be helping new stations coming on air. Mr Richard Huntingford, chief executive of Chrysalis Radio which launched Heart FM - one of the five new regional stations launched in September - said the station was already in profit at the trading level. Mr Huntingford said the soft rock format had 'exceeded our wildest expectations' with advertising revenue for October at 185 per cent of budget. The BBC will almost certainly continue to lose listening share as new stations come on air and may, according to Henley Centre estimates, fall to a 44 per cent share by 1999. At the weekend the Radio Authority, the body that regulates the industry, announced its plan for commercial radio development in the next 18 months to two years. On top of four new regional stations in the Yorkshire area, East Anglia, the east Midlands and Solent, the authority is planning up to 20 new local commercial stations in places as diverse as the Western Isles, Oban, the Yorkshire Dales, Oxford, Cambridge and Basingstoke. In addition a third raft of local stations is being considered, for example in Bromley or Lewisham in south-east London. A further boost to commercial radio revenues and audiences will come on February 4 next year, the expected launch date for Talk Radio UK, the last of the three official national commercial stations planned for the UK. By next year there will be at least 18 commercial stations broadcasting in the London area. Mr David Vick, director of development at the Radio Authority, said: 'The worst has yet to come for the BBC.'</p>

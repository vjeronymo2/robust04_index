			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS/HANUKKAH CARDS ASSAILED AS AFFRONT TO FAITHS  </P> <P> A Jewish group and an interfaith agency have criticized holiday cards that  combine Christmas and Hanukkah symbols, saying that they are "an affront to  Judaism, to Christianity and to serious interfaith relations."  </P> <P> In a joint statement, the American Jewish Committee and the National Conference  of Christians and Jews said that "true interreligious relations require respect  for the integrity of distinct faiths and a repudiation of syncretism. Greeting  cards that mingle Santas and menorahs, angels, trees, stockings and Stars of  David, are objectionable. This would also be the case with the symbols of  Easter and Passover."  </P> <P> Mort Yarmon, director of public relations for the Committee, provided samples  of cards that show an angel lighting a menorah, a menorah atop a Christmas tree  and a bearded Jew holding a menorah next to Santa Claus with a caption that  reads, "Happy Whatever."  </P> <P> In their statement, the two groups appealed to the publishers of such cards to  "refrain from future editions" and urged the public to "reject unequivocably  anything that blurs the distinctions between our unique and cherished religious  holidays."  </P></p>

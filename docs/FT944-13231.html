			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Europe looks for southern comfort: Links with N Africa and the Middle East European Union leaders are expected to bless a plan to embrace North Africa and the Middle East in a free trade zone, at their next summit at Essen in Germany this December. The EU is tantalised by the prospect of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours, and terrified of social and political collapse in Algeria, which could trigger mass emigration and spread to the rest of the Maghreb. At last, therefore, the EU is beginning to think strategically about the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean. The ambition - and it certainly is ambitious - is to create a Euro-Mediterranean Economic Area, helped by more than doubling EU aid to enable participants to restructure their economies. The proposal, launched by the European Commission last week, is akin to the European Economic Area, set up with the European Free Trade Association (Efta) this year. Over time, Euro-Med would increase the intensity of EU relations with its southern neighbours to a level approaching that now reserved for the states of eastern Europe. The obvious difference is that up to four of the Efta partners (Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway) are set to join the Union next year, and the central Europeans should start coming in around the turn of the century, led by Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. There is no question of EU entry for the Union's future Euro-Med partners. But there is another vital difference: the size of the wealth gap between the EU and its southern neighbours. According to the Commission, average per capita income in the Union in 1992 was Dollars 19,942; in the countries of the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya) and Mashraq (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) it was Dollars 993. This gap is far wider than, for instance, that between average incomes in the US and Mexico, which were joined early this year under the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the first attempt to yoke developed and developing economies. Even if output in the Arab Middle East and North Africa doubled between now and 2010 - the target date for a full Euro-Med free trade zone - the income gap would have widened much further, and possibly doubled, because of high population growth, according to the World Bank. It has taken Europe inordinate time to wake up to this, but now that it has, it is unsurprising to see the Commission's proposal loaded with adjectives such as urgent, fast, vital, rapid. 'At present, political, economic and social conditions in a number of these countries are sources of instability leading to mass migration, fundamentalist extremism, terrorism, drugs and organised crime,' says the Commission's document. Thus, at one level, what is being advocated is a strategy of containment. In intra-EU terms, a signal is being sent to Mediterranean member states such as France, Spain and Italy, which will succeed each other in the rotating presidency of the EU from January. These are the countries most exposed to migratory pressure, but they are also the countries that most fear that expansion to the north and east will shift the Union's political centre of gravity and exacerbate its north-south divide. 'It's important to get something settled now,' argues Mr Manuel Marin, the EU commissioner behind the Euro-Med initiative, 'otherwise it will be used as a hostage to block negotiations on enlargement to the east.' The Union wants putative Euro-Med associates to see an irresistible offer to modernise and achieve rapid economic take-off leading to sustained growth. Aid, leaving aside soft loans, would rise to a total of Ecu5.5bn in 1995-99 under the Commission plan, near par with planned outlays for eastern Europe over the same period of Ecu7bn. Last year, all non-EU Mediterranean countries got Ecu407m, against Ecu1.04bn for eastern Europe. In the short term, the Union would quickly conclude 'association agreements' already under negotiation with Israel, Morocco and Tunisia, analogous to existing treaties with the east Europeans on everything except eventual EU membership. The Commission hopes this will have an exemplary effect, encouraging Euro-Med nations to deregulate and liberalise their economies as the Moroccans and Tunisians have done. Domestic reform and greater market access to the EU helped lift the share of manufactured products in Moroccan exports to the Union from 24 to 66 per cent between 1979 and 1993, and from 40 to 77 per cent in Tunisia's case, one Brussels study points out. But the study also reveals that liberalisation has benefited EU exporters far more than it has benefited Maghreb and Mashraq exporters - something that Spain, Portugal and the eastern Europeans already know to be a by-product of drawing close to the Euro-club. For this reason, the future members of Euro-Med are likely to want to see not only the colour of Brussels's money, but real commitment to market access in sensitive areas such as textiles and agriculture, before they commit themselves to such a scheme.</p>

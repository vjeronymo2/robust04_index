			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bond scheme could remove 'black hole' of CAP spending Sir, Your headline, 'Steichen says no more farm reform needed' (January 7), is misleading and worried those of us who would like to see a more radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The Commission may feel that the cereals sector should not need further adjustment before 1996 but the sugar, wine and beef sectors will need to be reformed before then. It is not even clear whether we can pay for the existing reforms and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-imposed price reductions within the current legally binding agricultural spending ceiling. The Brussels European summit of December 1993 said clearly that if Gatt put further pressure on the reformed CAP, it would take the necessary steps (namely, to compensate farmers for price reductions) while respecting the decisions of the Edinburgh Council to stay within the agricultural guideline (the legally binding budgetary ceiling). We need to ask ourselves what 'taking the necessary steps while respecting the guideline' means. It can only mean one of two things. Either member states take the money from their own pockets and therefore begin to re-nationalise the CAP, which would be unthinkable, or they accept a way of re-reforming the CAP which does not break the budget. The only way to do this is through compensation in the form of one-off, transferable bonds, which would compensate for price reductions and give farmers a time-limited, annual income or a lump sum allowing them to invest or diversify. Either way they could plan for the future. Economists have calculated that this would save the EC budget Pounds 3.8bn a year. European taxpayers are paying Pounds 28bn this year for the CAP. It would be better spent on proper food, rural, and environment policies. The 'bond' scheme is the mechanism which can lead towards this, and free us from the black hole of CAP spending.

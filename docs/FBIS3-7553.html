			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A nationwide poll conducted by YOMIURI SHIMBUN on  19 and 20 March shows that the percentage of those who hope "the  Hosokawa government should be in power as long as possible" has  drastically decreased from six months ago. On the question of  which party they would vote for in the next general election,  the number of those who said they would vote for the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] increased, while the percentage of those who would vote  for the Japan New Party [JNP] dropped by 7 points. The results  show signs of Hosokawa's popularity waning.    Asked why they think the ruling coalition was thrown into  confusion over the plans to reshuffle the cabinet and introduce  a national welfare tax, the pollees raised the following  reasons: 1) Because Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief  Secretary Ichiro Ozawa exerted too much influence on the plans;  2) because, from the beginning, it was impossible for the ruling  parties to coordinate their opinions; and 3) because Prime  Minister Hosokawa acted a bit arbitrarily.    "Asked how many years they want the Hosokawa government to  be  in power," 33 percent said another year, 25 percent said another  two or three years, 19 percent said the government should step  down from power immediately, and 17 percent hoped it would be in  power as long as possible. The same question was posed in polls  conducted last September, and January this year. Compared with  the results of the September poll, the percentage of those who  want the government to be in power "as long as possible"  decreased by 14 points, those who said "another year" increased  by 15 points, and those who want the government to get out of  power immediately increased by 8 points.    In answering what parties they would vote for if the general  election is conducted, 28 percent said they would vote for the  LDP, 11 percent for the JNP, 10 percent each for Shinseito and  the SDPJ, and 5 percent for Sakigake [Harbinger]. Compared with  the results of the January poll, the LDP and the SDPJ gained  about 2 to 3 points, while the JNP lost a lot. Nevertheless,  the LDP and the SDPJ are far from the level of the approval  ratings they obtained last June -- 31 percent and 15 percent  respectively. The June poll was conducted immediately before  last year's general election in which the LDP and the SDPJ were  decidedly defeated.</p>

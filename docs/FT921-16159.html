			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Steetley expects to hold dividend despite profit fall STEETLEY, the building materials group facing a Pounds 595m hostile bid from Redland, one of its bigger rivals, has promised to maintain the dividend for 1991 despite an estimated 62 per cent fall in pre-tax profit. The expected profit figure of Pounds 32.5m, shown in Steetley's defence document, sent out on Saturday, compares with Pounds 85.2m in 1990. The 14p total dividend would not be covered by estimated earnings per share of 12.9p. A plan to at least maintain the dividend again in 1992 was defended as prudent by Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's managing director yesterday, because of the group's strong cash flow. Redland said the document focused on the past, and criticised Steetley for taking Pounds 15.1m of extraordinary costs - half of them for the bid defence. However, Mr David Donne, Steetley chairman, retorted: 'This is just clutter in radar terms. We are talking about more fundamental issues, such as weaving a focused business.' The bid defence document stresses Steetley's growth record in the five years to 1990, when operating profit went up by a compound 22 per cent a year. The profit peak came in 1989 with Pounds 110.9 pre-tax. In the same period, it says the predator's operating profit and earnings per share grew more slowly, and its share price performed less well. Redland countered that in the most recent five years, its pre-tax profit and earnings did better. Steetley accuses Redland of trying to grab valuable assets 'in the trough of a recession for well below their proper worth'. The 85-for-100 all-share offer values the target's shares at just over 372p, about 29 times the estimated 1991 earnings but only 8.1 times the 1989 peak. Among the long-term prospects highlighted in the defence document are the market positions Steetley has built up in France and Spain. In 1990, overseas activities contributed 52 per cent of operating profits, although a hard continental winter, the Gulf war and recession in Canada took their toll in the first half of 1991. Steetley also stresses the advantages of the joint venture planned with Tarmac before the bid jeopardised it. The venture aims to reduce brick-making capacity and to make savings of up to Pounds 10m. It would continue Steetley's efforts to cope with the falling UK brick market, down from 4.5bn units in 1988 to about 3.1bn last year. The defence document also goes on the offensive against the efficiency of Redland's UK brick factories, saying that costs are greater and a high level of stock is being carried. Redland replied that it made more profit per brick.</p>

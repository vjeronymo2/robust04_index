			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Food and Drink For Christmas: Let fax and phone do the walking - With the holiday fast approaching, Nicholas Lander and Jancis Robinson pick their top food and drink suppliers WE ARE encouraged to repeat last year's Guide to Armchair Shopping by an account of how one reader made full use of the column recommending top-class food producers. The reader, a 'legal eagle' during the week and a keen cook at the weekend, returned home late one night, sat down with his Weekend FT, worked out his requirements and sent them off by fax. In spite of the fact that it was late at night he received confirmation of one order, for wild boar, by return - obviously from a farmer who keeps his fax machine in the bedroom. Three days later the boar was delivered. We hope that this year's guide will save you all considerable backache.                            *      *      * WINES AND SPIRITS Most wine merchants are organised, and only too pleased, to despatch a case of wine by post or carrier.

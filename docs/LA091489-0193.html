			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCRIPPS OVER LAST HURDLE IN QUEST FOR NEW AQUARIUM  </P> <P> For years, they've been packing them in like sardines at the aquarium at UCSD's  Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the aging facility that officials have  long acknowledged has simply outlived its usefulness as a public attraction.  </P> <P> On weekends, for example, so many people jam into the 38-year-old building,  badly deteriorating from the ever-present salt water in the coastal mist, that  a waiting line often snakes out onto the adjacent aquarium grounds.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, aquarium officials realized a 20-year-old dream when the California  Coastal Commission unanimously approved construction of a new $10-million  aquarium and museum within view of the old one.  </P> <P> Over the years, the La Jolla facility developed a problem unique for an  aquarium -- too many schools.  </P> <P> "It gets pretty bad, especially in the summer," said Tom Collins, associate  director for administration at Scripps Institution. "We try to schedule all the  school-age tour groups during the week. But, if something goes wrong, they all  show up on the weekend.  </P> <P> "It's never happened to me, but I imagine that some weekend guests have  literally pulled their hair out at the commotion."  </P> <P> That is, if they could find a parking spot. The standing joke around the  aquarium is that the place accommodates 370,000 visitors a year with about nine  parking spaces.  </P> <P> "On weekdays, there were only nine spots outside the building that were  available to the public," said Donald Wilkie, director of the aquarium which  perches on a scenic hillside along La Jolla Shores Drive.  </P> <P> "The rest of the parking is in a remote location, so people have to walk a  quarter-mile uphill after their visit. It was a hardship for older people and  families."  </P> <P> The new Stephen Birch Aquarium-Museum will feature 34,600 square feet of  display area -- more than twice that of the existing 12,500-square-foot Scripps  Aquarium -- and include classrooms, offices, even a bookstore.  </P> <P> And, as if aquarium officials needed a hook, the facility will also include an  5,000 square feet more of displays on its grounds, including a new outdoor tide  pool.  </P> <P> Inside the new aquarium, scheduled to open in the fall of 1991, the museum  portion will be four times as big as its predecessor. The aquarium will also  intrigue visitors with 40 viewing tanks, almost twice as many as the existing  22.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Window on 70,000-Gallon Tank of Sea Life  </P> <P> It will also feature a new, 70,000-gallon tank that, with its 12- by 20-foot  viewing window, will provide the largest unobstructed viewing window in the  aquarium field, officials say.  </P> <P> "It will provide an unprecedented look into the tank within," said Wilkie, "an  opportunity to view the sport fish we'll have on display, the yellowtail jack  and sea basses -- larger variations of those species that the old tanks were  just too small to hold."  </P> <P> And, perhaps just as important, a 250-space parking lot will adjoin the new  aquarium, which will be built across the street from the old one, on a wooded  knoll on the east side of La Jolla Shores Drive.  </P> <P> The new site will provide a view of the ocean and beach, Scripps buildings and  pier, La Jolla and La Jolla Cove, and, on a clear day, San Clemente Island.  </P> <P> "The view will be utterly fantastic," Wilkie said. "You couldn't afford to buy  that lot with all the money in the world."  </P> <P> For the public, however, the new aquarium may demand a price. Officials now ask  adults for a $3 donation at the existing facility. They are considering  requiring a formal $5 admission fee at the new structure.  </P> <P> Like many associated with the aquarium, Wilkins could not hide his enthusiasm  Wednesday over the go-ahead for the new aquarium.  </P> <P> "It's a once in a lifetime event, the culmination of a 20-year dream for many  people associated with this aquarium," said Wilkie, who has been aquarium  director for more than 24 years.  </P> <P> "When they finally open those doors, it will be like winning the World Series.  I'll just be speechless."  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Funding Setback After Another  </P> <P> The museum will serve as the interpretive center for Scripps, the nation's  oldest and largest oceanographic center. Scripps has operated an aquarium and  museum in various locations since shortly after it was founded in 1903.  </P> <P> For more than two decades, however, Scripps has wanted to replace the existing  aquarium but has suffered one funding setback after another.  </P> <P> Collins said that UC San Diego, the oceanography institution's educational  parent, was unable to fund the project by itself.  </P> <P> "You have to remember that the aquarium is a public service funded by the  university, which has a long list of priorities," he said. "The aquarium  program is just part of our institution. Our main thrust is as a scientific  institution, and accommodating our students is the highest priority."  </P> <P> In 1986, however, officials announced the receipt of a $6-million donation from  the Delaware-based Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation. In addition to the $1.6  million they received from private donations locally, they still must raise  another half-million dollars to complete the project.  </P> <P> Wilkie has an enthusiastic answer to that. No problem, he says.  </P> <P> The Coastal Commission's blessing on the new aquarium was the last hurdle to be  cleared before the university could solicit bids on the project beginning next  month.  </P> <P> "We're finishing up design details right now," he said. "As soon as the final  drawings are done, this project will be ready to go to bed."  </P> <P> The aquarium will display mainly Pacific Coast marine life, including that of  the kelp beds off La Jolla and the vibrant sea life along the California and  Baja coasts.  </P> <P> But the aquarium's goal will be to attract support for marine science in  general, Wilkie said. "We have public education goals to increase the  understanding of the ocean and stress the point that its resources need to be  used wisely."  </P> <P> Though much larger than its predecessor, the new aquarium will be be about  one-fifth the size of the privately owned Monterey Bay Aquarium. But that  doesn't bother institute officials.  </P> <P> "I don't think the community would support something on that scale, certainly  not here in La Jolla," Collins said. "We don't do any advertising. Our role is  to provide a public service for the people of San Diego.  </P> <P> "We're not out hustling promotion. We take a different approach than in  Monterey or at Sea World."  </P> <P> The fate of the old aquarium is uncertain, Wilkie said. "There's some  structural damage, some severe corrosion," he said. "We won't know how bad it  is until we vacate the building.  </P> <P> "We'd like to use the place as a site for some scientific collections owned by  the university -- geologic and vertebrate collections. But right now the fate  of the building is unknown."  </P> <P> The new aquarium, Wilkie said, will be a better for both people and fish. For  the marine life, the image might be one of inmates getting a new prison with  expanded cells.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say 'prison,' " Wilkie said. "Actually, we're trying to provide the  closest thing we can to a natural habitat. The proximity to fresh salt water  allows us to keep species healthier and alive longer than many other aquariums.  </P> <P> "And besides, we'll have reproduction occurring in our tanks. That doesn't  happen in prison."  </P></p>

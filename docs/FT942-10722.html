			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (11): Problems linger on - A project with a troubled history Construction workers are putting the finishing touches to a shiny new fertiliser plant in Chittagong, south-east Bangladesh. It is all steel tubes, storage tanks and glistening metalwork - a sight to delight the eye of any engineer. Kafco is nearly ready for business. This Dollars 510m project is the biggest ever foreign investment in Bangladesh. Companies, aid institutions and export credit agencies from five different countries are involved. But even at this late stage, the plant is dogged by the controversies which have plagued the project from its inception. Arguments rage over securing adequate supplies from Bangladesh's natural gas fields, over costs and over whether the plant should have been built at all. The project is on target for completion next month. It will export 500 tonnes of ammonia and 1,725 tonnes of urea a day, mainly to India and China. Earnings are estimated at Dollars 100m a year. If all goes well, 4 per cent of the company will be floated on the Dhaka stock exchange in September, and the company will start exporting in October. Purchase agreements have been secured for all Kafco's output, and a complex financing package is in place, 75 per cent of it in government-backed debt and the rest in equity. The project has had a troubled history. In 1990, it was suspended for a year  -at a cost of Dollars 35m - when the newly-elected government of the Bangladesh National Party refused to honour government guarantees for the project's Dollars 400m loans. At the time, there were allegations of corrupt deals with the previous government. The BNP agreed to back the loans in 1992 only in exchange for places on the Kafco board and an increase in the gas price from the previously agreed 75 cents per thousand standard cubic feet, to Dollars 1. Now, with those political troubles in the past, Kafco is bracing for business. But there are still problems. Production of ammonia and urea requires two main raw materials: water and natural gas. At the moment, there is no gas. It is available - in Bangladesh's northern gas fields - but there is no pipeline to bring it south to the plant. A pipeline was to have been built to complete the north-south link by the end of this year. But it has failed to materialise. Construction and financing - originally expected from the World Bank - are still in doubt. The Government of Bangladesh, which is a 40 per cent shareholder in the project, has told Kafco that the Ashuganj-Bakharabad (A-B) pipeline will go ahead. In the meantime, it has promised to supply gas by rehabilitating two gas wells at Bakharabad, north of Chittagong, and to start drilling another at Feni. These, says the government, will supply the plant until the A-B pipeline is built. 'Kafco will get its gas,' says Mr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, the energy minister. 'We have enough to supply the plant for two to three years.' Kafco can only wait and hope. But much is at stake for both Bangladesh and its foreign partners, led by Chiyoda of Japan, which is also lead contractor. Other big foreign shareholders are Marubeni and the Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund, both of Japan. Smaller stakes are held by the Commonwealth Development Corporation of the UK, Haldor Topsoe of Denmark, and Stami Carbon of the Netherlands. The bulk of the funding is from Japan's export credit agency, with Dollars 250m in loans, and Dollars 32m from Italy's export credit agency. There is a Dollars 100m commercial loan syndicated by Citibank, with the rest of the funding from the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department, a Dollars 5m grant from Denmark's development aid agency and a soft loan from the Nordic Development Fund. Kafco stands to lose Dollars 8m a month if it is unable to start operating. The company says the government will have to pay interest on the loans due in July next year if it fails to supply the plant with gas. For Bangladesh, the Kafco project is important as a model for other foreign investors, which the country desperately needs. If it flops, foreign investors might be unwilling to risk their money again. The government is not convinced that the Kafco project is perfect for Bangladesh, but it now feels it cannot allow it to fail. 'There is no scope for second thoughts on this project,' says the energy minister. 'It has reached the stage where it must go ahead. But if someone came along now and suggested constructing such a plant, I would discourage it.' Kafco's managing director, Mr M. Towhidi, grits his teeth and smiles. He, too, believes Kafco has to go ahead. 'This is the ultimate test of whether projects of this magnitude are ever likely to succeed in Bangladesh,' he says. 'The country is hungry for foreign investment and everybody is watching to see what becomes of Kafco. They are watching to see if Bangladesh honours its commitments. 'I have no reason to doubt that it will, but it will have to get gas to us on time. Otherwise, we're going to be a big white elephant.'</p>

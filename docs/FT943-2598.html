			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / The main contenders for prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen The 51-year-old leader of the Social Democrats and incumbent prime minister. He ousted Svend Auken in a leadership contest to become head of the party in April 1992 and became PM in January 1993. A political science graduate, he made a career as an economist with the Confederation of Danish Trade Unions. While his government coalition seems certain to lose seats, he could well remain in office. Hans Engell The 46-year-old leader of the Conservative party and a former minister of defence and minister of justice. Trained as a journalist. Opinion polls indicate majority of non-socialist supporters would prefer him as PM in a non-socialist government over the Liberal party's Ellemann-Jensen. But his own party, reckoned to be to the left of the Liberals, is not likely to do as well in the election as the Liberals. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen The 52-year-old leader of the Liberal party and foreign minister from September 1982 to January 1993. Has a political science degree and made an early career in journalism. Won strong international reputation as foreign minister, but his provocative tongue offends many consensus-minded Danes. His party can expect a good result, but this will probably not be good enough to get him the top job.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In 1994, the Minneapolis Office introduced ``option''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices for its Other Fed and city fine sort products. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minneapolis and Richmond Reserve Banks also adopted option pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for some electronic payor bank services. The Board has determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there is no empirical justification to support the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option pricing for paper check products. As a result, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minneapolis Office will eliminate its option prices for Other Fed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and city fine sort products. Further analysis of the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure for electronic products is in progress. At this time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board will permit the Richmond and Minneapolis Banks to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue using the option prices adopted for electronic check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Under option pricing, depositors have a choice of paying a relatively low cash-letter fee and a relatively high per-item fee, or a relatively high cash-letter fee and a relatively low per-item fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Payor bank service revenue is estimated to have grown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 16 percent in 1994 and is expected to expand at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same pace in 1995. In 1995, Reserve Banks will continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage the use of basic electronic check presentment products by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting fees for those products at lower levels than fees for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic information products. In addition, several Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reserve offices will be offering electronic cash-letter (ECL)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit products, which reduce Reserve Bank processing costs by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing the number of rejects, adjustments, and other exceptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To encourage the use of ECL deposit products, Federal Reserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices will offer either lower per-item fees or later deposit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadlines to depositors than they offer for deposits that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accompanied by electronic data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

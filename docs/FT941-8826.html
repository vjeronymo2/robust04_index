			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Renewed hopes of a reduction in UK interest rates following the release of a mixed set of economic statistics kept stock index futures buoyant, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened strongly at 3,396, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index drifted for the first hour of trading as dealers awaited the 9.30am release of economic data on retail price inflation, unemployment and retail sales volume. When they came, the statistics brought renewed speculation of a cut in interest rates which sent dealers bidding for stock. A slight squeeze occurred over the lunchtime period, as several of the big houses joined independent traders as buyers of the contract. A firm gilts sector, along with a positive start to trading on Wall Street, gave a further boost to the contract, helping it to maintain a good premium to cash for most of the day. March finished at 3,414, up 24 from its previous close but around 3 points below its fair value premium to cash of about minus 5. Volume at the official close was 16,379 lots. In traded options, there was strong business in the FT-SE 100 option, ahead of tomorrow's expiry. A total of 42,417 contracts were dealt, of which 19,442 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 6,453 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Abbey National topped the stock options with 2,573 lots traded.</p>

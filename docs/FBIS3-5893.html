The two countries reaffirmed that the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) must conclude successful inspections in  North Korea and the two Koreas must exchange special envoys  before the Pyongyang-Washington meeting can take place, Kim  Sam-hun, Seoul's nuclear ambassador, said after consultations  with U.S. officials.    As to what constitutes successful inspections, Kim said the  IAEA is responsible for making that determination. "South Korea  and the United States will respect the IAEA's decision on the  inspection results," said Kim.    Seoul and Washington shared concern over Pyongyang's  negative  attitude at inter-Korean contacts, evidenced by its "impure"  demands, the ambassador told reporters. While repeating their  commitment to solving the dispute through dialogue, they noted  that the world's patience was running out.    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, also  chief  American representative at the two previous high-level talks  with North Korea, has come to Seoul to draw up strategies in  dealing with the North Korean nuclear crisis.    A team of IAEA inspectors is in North Korea, probably until  March 15, checking primarily whether the communist state has  diverted nuclear material to non-peaceful uses.    Earlier, Washington made conditional promises to North Korea  to cancel this year's "Team Spirit" military drill, held  annually with Seoul, and to meet for further high-level talks on  March 21.    But North Korea must permit full IAEA inspections and  exchange presidential envoys with South Korea before the  promises are carried out. The bilateral consultations here came  amid another budding crisis as Pyongyang holds out on  inter-Korean dialogue. Kim said after talking with Gallucci  that he cannot emphasize enough that the envoy exchange is a  precondition that must be met.    The three-hour session dealt with what the next North  Korea-U.S. talks would cover. "The meeting would in reality be  the last opportunity to solve the nuclear problem," said Kim.  "As stated at last November's summit, they would negotiate  related agendas on a thorough and broad basis."    Resolution of the nuclear problem means North Korea's  complete return to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT],  acceptance of special inspections of its undeclared facilities  and implementation of the inter-Korean agreement on  denuclearization, said Kim.    Exactly one year ago this Saturday, North Korea announced it  was bolting from the NPT, riveting the attention of the  international community.    Speculation here is that North Korea will hold out to the  last minute on the envoy demand, possibly offering to conduct  the exchange sometime after March 21.    "As I said, the envoys have to have come and gone. It's not  enough to just agree on the dates of the exchange," said Kim.  Asked whether that means the March 21 meeting might be delayed  or cancelled, Kim answered "yes."    North Korean and U.S. officials meet for their sixth contact  Saturday to arrange the envoy visits.</p>

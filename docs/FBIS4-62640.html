			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Pavel Spirin] </F>   [Text] Shanghai May 17 TASS -- "I was told that May will  become a `Russian month' in China. I think there should also be  a `Russian year' and a `Russian decade'," visiting Russian Duma  Speaker Ivan Rybkin said here today.    "We can and must cooperate. Friendship with great neighbour  China was created by many generations and it would be sinful to  break it," Rybkin told ITAR-TASS after meeting Secretary of the  Shanghai City Council of the Chinese Communist Party Wu Bangguo.    In the words of the Duma speaker, the official Chinese visit  of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to begin next week  will result in signing of several agreements, which are  essentially important for the Russian economy.    The current visit of the Duma delegation aims to search for  ways of bilateral cooperation. Despite the lack of time, the  Russian parliament deputies have met Chinese Chairman and  General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee Jiang Zemin, Parliament Head Qiao Shi, Deputy State  Council Premier Li Lanqing and Deputy Foreign Minister Tian  Jiangpei.    The delegation is interested in the Chinese experience of  economic reforms, stressed the Duma speaker. "When in Shanghai,  a major industrial center of China, we saw that the most  vulnerable layers are protected in the course of market reforms.  People are sure of their future", he added.    In the opinion of Rybkin, the Chinese market can become a  most promising for Russian businessmen. From 1.5 to two billion  U.S. dollars are transferred from Russia abroad each month, much  of this money is invested in inefficient real estate. This  money could be better used in creation of Russian-Chinese  ventures, he said.    "Thousands of Shanghai joint ventures include only four with  participation of Russian capital. It is too small. I am  convinced that Russian-Chinese ventures are promising," said the  speaker.    "Being the law-makers, we will support all decisions aiming  to develop Russian-Chinese cooperation," he said.    On the same day, Ivan Rybkin visited a Chinese major  metallurgical plant of Baoshan and the vegetable-growing farm of  Luodian.    After meeting the Chinese communist leader, the Duma speaker  left for the Shenzhen economic zone in the Chinese south, which  is considered to be a model of the Chinese economic reforms.</p>

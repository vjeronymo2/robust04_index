			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1401&blank;Anticollision Light System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would revise &sect;23.1401 to require the installation of an anticollision light system on all part 23 airplanes. Current &sect;23.1401 requires an anticollision light system only if certification for night operations is requested. When the requirements for anticollision lights were first added to the Civil Air Regulations (CAR), part 3, in 1957, those requirements were needed to increase the conspicuity of the airplanes during night operations because of the increasing air traffic density and the newer airplanes' capability to attain higher speeds. At the time, the operating conditions did not show a need for such lights for daylight operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of airplanes that have been added to the fleet and the increasing speeds resulting from improved technology, especially the increasing use of turbine engines, now necessitates the conspicuity provided by anticollision lights for day operations as well. The FAA Accident and Incident data for the period 1984 through 1990 shows that 269 aircraft were involved in midair collisions in which 108 fatalities occurred. A review of this data shows that 234 of these aircraft were involved in accidents or incidents that occurred during VFR conditions and that 224 were involved in accidents or incidents during day operations. The other 10 were involved in operations at night or dusk. The reports on 35 aircraft did not identify the type of condition that existed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the types of aircraft identified by the reports in this data, 60 were balloons, gliders, or other aircraft that were not certificated under part 23 and whose level of safety would not be changed by this proposal. When the data is revised by removing those reports, it shows that 209 small, part 23 airplanes operated under VFR conditions were involved in midair accidents or incidents and that at least 167 of these airplanes were being operated in day VFR conditions. Because the occupant capacity of all the aircraft in the data ranged from one to ten, it can be assumed that the fatality rate of .401 per aircraft (108 fatalities/269 aircraft) would be nearly the same for the 167 small airplanes operating in day VFR conditions as it was for the 269 aircraft. Based on this assumption, there would have been approximately 67 fatalities that occurred in these 167 small airplane accidents and incidents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reports do not show if the airplanes involved were equipped with or were using anticollision lights. They do show that a need exists to reduce the number of accidents. Requiring the installation of anticollision lights on all newly certificated airplanes and, as proposed by revised &sect;91.209 in this notice, requiring operation of anticollision lights during day operations would increase the airplane's conspicuity and contribute to a reduction in the number of accidents. Even if such action is only 25 percent effective, a review of the 6-year service history indicates that approximately 17 fatalities could be avoided in a similar 6-year period. Many manufacturers have realized the additional safety that can be provided by the increased airplane conspicuity of using anticollision lights and have elected to install an anticollision light system on all of the airplanes they produce. Therefore, most airplanes are now being manufactured with an installed anticollision light system, and the FAA expects that this proposal would not result in an economic burden on the aviation community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1431&blank;Electronic Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would add three new paragraphs to &sect;23.1431. Proposed new paragraph (c) would require that airplanes required to be operated by more than one flightcrew member must be evaluated to determine if the flightcrew members can converse without difficulty when they are seated at their duty stations. Accident investigations have shown that, in some instances, conversation between the flightcrew members was severely hindered by the noise level in the cockpit and that the inability to communicate contributed to the accident. If the required evaluation shows that the noise level does not impair conversation, no further action is required. However, if the evaluation shows that conversation will be difficult, an intercommunication system would be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new paragraph (d) would require that if installed communication equipment includes any means of switching from receive to transmit, the equipment must use ``off-on'' transmitter switching that will ensure that the transmitter is turned off when it is not being used. Transmitting equipment that remains in the transmit mode when not being used blocks the frequency being used and can create an unsafe condition by preventing other needed communication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new paragraph (e) would require that if provisions for the use of communications headsets are provided, it must be demonstrated that flightcrew members can hear aural warnings when a headset is being used. Aural warnings are required to warn the pilot of a condition that necessitates the pilot's taking action; therefore, it is necessary to ensure that such warnings would be effective even when headsets are being used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the development of the proposed new requirements in paragraphs (c) and (e), the FAA considered proposing a requirement that compliance demonstrations should be conducted under actual cockpit noise conditions when the airplane is being operated. The FAA, however, ultimately determined that such a requirement could result in demonstrations conducted under more severe noise conditions than needed. Accordingly, no such requirement is being proposed. If the FAA determines in the future that noise conditions for demonstrations need to be specified, the FAA will define these conditions in advisory material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1435&blank;Hydraulic Systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the close of the comment period for the Small Airplane Airworthiness Review Program Notice No. 3 (55 FR 40598, October 3, 1990), now adopted by Amendment No. 23&hyph;43 (58 FR 18958, April 9, 1993), the FAA has been involved in discussions of the installation of hydraulic accumulators that are permitted by &sect;23.1435(c). These discussions have shown that applicants are likely to find &sect;23.1435(c) difficult to understand because of the way it is worded. This notice would further revise &sect;23.1435(c) to clarify under what circumstances a hydraulic accumulator and reservoir may be installed on the engine side of any firewall. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

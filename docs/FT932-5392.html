			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Concern over growth and unemployment This is the preamble to the communique issued by the OECD after its annual meeting which ended in Paris yesterday. MINISTERS addressed the need to restore strong, sustained growth with improved employment prospects; they agreed on collective action to meet the major challenges facing their countries. They are deeply concerned that growth in the OEC area is insufficient and that unemployment continues to rise in most countries. To cope with these problems they are resolved to take additional action to improve both macroeconomic and structural policies and to extend international co-operation, in particular by strengthening the open multilateral trading system. Ministers are committed to a concerted strategy for growth and employment. It consists of the following planks. . . . monetary and fiscal policies willl exploit the opportunities that may exist  -without jeopardising the objectives of price stability and medium term budget consolidation; structural reform policies, including labour market policies, will aim for vigorous, competitive and efficient development of OECD economies, exploiting opportunities offered by technological progress and open international competition; intensive efforts will be made to continue to liberalise trade, to abide by and further strengthen multilateral disciplines and, as the first priority, to achieve a substantial, comprehensive and balanced outcome of the Uruguay Round by the end of the year - which would be a very powerful contributor to bolstering confidence, growth and employment both in OECD members and elsewhere. In pursuit of this strategy, effective support will be given for the progressive integration of all countries into the world economy; this will include the concerted international effort to support the economies in transition, in particular Russia, and developing countries. Ministers underline the particular relevance of the OECD and of the basic values its members hold in common: respect for human rights, pluralist democracy and the market economy. They appreciate its working methods and its multi-disciplinary character, as exemplified by the study under way on employment/unemployment. They call on the organisation to continue to build on its strengths and on the collective wealth of its member countries' national and regional economic, social and cultural experiences to further develop common approaches in order better to meet the challenges of a fast changing world and to foster worldwide sustainable development.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: TSW may don footwear to tread future path TELEVISION South West, the west of England ITV company, is in talks with a private West Country shoe manufacturer over the possibility of a reverse takeover. It is believed the company is the Bristol-based UK Safety Group, a medium sized company with turnover of Pounds 33.4m in 1991. Its subsidiaries include TUF, Safeco and GB Britton. Asked about talks with TSW, which failed to win a new broadcasting licence in last year's competitive tenders, Mr Colin Dunmore, chairman and chief executive of UK Safety, said: 'I can't comment on that.' He confirmed, however, that UK Safety was interested in obtaining a Stock Exchange listing. He referred callers to 'Rothschilds.' NM Rothschild, the merchant banker, is adviser to TSW. If the plan goes ahead TSW would take over the shoe company which would then get a listing. At a later stage the name would be changed. TSW has decided that the reverse takeover route would be the way of realising maximum value for its mainly institutional shareholders. Because of TSW's size and location the company decided there was no way of continuing as a broadcaster. Indeed it has decided to donate its film and video archives to a new charitable organisation to be set up in Plymouth. The archive would amount to a video history of the West Country. Another option for TSW would be liquidating its assets at the end of the year when Westcountry Television takes over as the ITV broadcaster. Sir Brian Bailey, TSW chairman, also declined to comment on the possibility of a reverse takeover.</p>

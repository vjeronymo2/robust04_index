			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Weak demand hits steelmakers JAPAN'S FIVE largest steelmakers reported lower pre-tax profits for fiscal 1991 because of weak demand and higher productions costs. They expect a further decline in earnings this year. Several companies have been trying to reduce dependence on steel by diversifying into other areas. This strategy has so far not increased profitability, but instead depressed earnings as interest costs climb due to increased capital spending. Nippon Steel, the world's largest producer, had a 37.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, to Y100.2bn (Dollars 773.74m), due to decline in steel sales. But a 21.7 per cent growth in its engineering business lifted total sales 0.8 per cent to Y2,629bn. Its net profit increased 24.9 per cent to Y83.7bn due to the sale of fixed assets. A cut in steel production will lift sales in fiscal 1992 to Y2,500bn, while pre-tax profits will tumble to Y55bn. Kawasaki Steel blamed rising operating costs and sluggish sales for its 46.5 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y43.1bn. Earnings were also harmed by heavier interest payments for capital spending connected with the overhaul of steel facilities. A domestic price increase had little impact on sales, which grew only 1.9 per cent to 1,208bn, because of weak demand for steel products. NKK said lower domestic demand and a higher interest burden were responsible for its 25.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y37.5bn. But net profit climbed 53.8 per cent to Y35.8bn due to the sale of land. Pre-tax earnings for fiscal 1992 are expected to fall to Y20bn, reflecting stagnant demand and a rise in interest costs as NKK almost doubles investment spending to Y218.4bn. NKK is streamlining its steel and steel-building businesses, while diversifying into new areas, such as electronics and chemicals. Sumitomo Metal Industries said increased sales from non-steel activities failed to prevent a 45 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings to Y40.4bn. A dip in steel revenues to Y990.7bn, combined with higher operating costs, caused the profit decline. Sumitomo expects the costs of its merger with Nippon Stainless Steel in October to nearly halve pre-tax profits to Y20bn for fiscal 1992. Kobe Steel said losses on securities holdings, as well as increasing operating costs, meant a 15.5 per cent drop in pre-tax earnings, to Y47.7bn. Net profit climbed 24.7 per cent to Y29.2bn due to the sale of land.</p>

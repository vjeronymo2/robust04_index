At a press conference hosted by the current session of the  National People's Congress (NPC), Qian said that such contacts  will contribute to the development of relations between the two  sides of the straits.    He said that it is a consensus of people on both sides of  the  straits that "there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is  a part of China." This is also a fact recognized by the  international community, he said.    Asked about China's stand on Taiwan's move to "develop  diplomatic space," he said that if the move aims to develop  economic relations, "we can understand."    "But, if (Taiwan) developing `diplomatic space' aims to  create `two Chinas,' that will harm the fundamental interests of  the Chinese nation and it will be detrimental to the cause of  the reunification of China," he said. "We, therefore, are firmly  opposed to moves toward that end."    On the question of Taiwan's "holiday-making diplomacy," he  denounced its avowed purpose of "expanding economic relations"  as "false."    "There are political intentions in it," he said.    Some countries seek to develop non-governmental relations  with Taiwan mainly out of economic considerations, he said. But  the Taiwan authorities take advantage of this to develop what it  calls "diplomatic space" in an attempt to create "one China, one  Taiwan" or "two Chinas," he said.    "It is a move that is not in keeping with the trend of the  times and goes against the aspirations of people on both sides  of the Taiwan Straits," he said.</p>

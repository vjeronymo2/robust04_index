"In case the accused agree with the (Duma) resolution I  shall  rule to drop criminal proceedings against each of the accused",  Kazannik told TASS on Thursday.    If the accused refuse to be pardoned the criminal cases  against them will proceed in a usual way, he added.    Kazannik said he had not yet received the Duma decision, but  stressed that his office does not give political assessments to  various laws. "It ensures lawfulness and a strict fulfillment of  all instructions of competent state bodies", he said.</p>

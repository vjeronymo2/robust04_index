			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Khaled Mahrez: "EEC Examines `Algerian </F> Situation'"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] The foreign ministers of the 12 EEC countries  yesterday began a 2-two-day meeting in Brussels in the course of  which the situation in Algeria will be considered, although it  is not formally inscribed on the agenda.    The Twelve will discuss what position to take regarding the  safety of Europeans living and working in Algeria, as well as  their position on fundamentalist groups resident or active in  certain European capitals.    The APS Brussels office believes the "Twelve," in today's  expected communique, will express support for Algeria's efforts  to combat terrorism and find solutions to its serious economic  problems, but will demand in exchange a national dialogue on  major political and economic reform.    A diplomatic source in Brussels yesterday disclosed that  Algeria will be urged to open dialogue with all those willing to  participate, with all sectors concerned about restoring security  in the country and opening the way toward a return to  democratization--"even with moderates in the FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front], if they have renounced violence and terrorism  and accept the ground rules of democracy," according to a source  in the Belgian delegation. "We're not giving the Algerian regime  a blank endorsement for anything it wants to do; rather it is  urgent to get on the path of dialogue with people who do not  resort to violence and assassinations, or who have renounced  that path," added a source in the French ministerial delegation.    A Belgian observer described this stance as "rather positive  for Algeria," but cautioned that the Twelve have yet to adopt  this common position on the Algerian question.    The deteriorating security situation, especially the new  strategy of the armed groups--which have begun indiscriminately  killing intellectuals, members of the security forces, simple  citizens, and now foreigners residing in Algeria--has shocked  public opinion in Europe and around the world and made  governments of those countries realize the threat to their own  societies posed by instability in Algeria.    This change in the position of Algeria's European partners  is first of all apparent at the political level. While it may be  true that Europeans are still unwilling to accept the  nullification of Algeria's elections, neither can they accept  the killing of innocent people--much less foreigners--as a means  to achieving political objectives.    The European countries, which to varying degree have been  plagued--in some cases still are--by terrorism, have thus  condemned terrorist acts committed in Algeria and expressed  their "sympathy" for the country.    The European Parliament has even endorsed a proposal to  forgive the debts the Algerian Government owes to the EEC, debts  which total some $6.5 billion. This was a highly symbolic  gesture of support to Algeria on the part of the Eurodeputies,  but actual implementation must first be approved by EC executive  authorities.    The Community is said to favor expressing its sympathy for  Algeria with cold, hard cash, on the condition that Algerian  authorities commit themselves to solving their political  problems through a national dialogue and pledge bold economic  reforms. The communique expected to be published today by the EC  demands, in exchange for greater economic and financial  cooperation with Algeria, the opening of a national dialogue,  acceleration of economic and political reforms, and launching of  negotiations with the international financial institutions.    Mr. Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign affairs minister and  current president of the Ministerial Council of the Twelve, has  clearly described Europe's position on the Algerian situation.  "It is obvious that we will support the democratic sectors and a  regime that will be opposed to the fundamentalists," he said,  maintaining that negotiations on economic and financial  questions will resume once "the Algerians express their resolve  to move ahead on economic and financial reorientations, which  will permit us to move quickly to put exploratory talks,  followed by negotiations in the framework of the Euro-Maghrebian  dialogue, on the Community agenda."    The recent decision of Algerian authorities to negotiate an  accord with the IMF--a decision that Jacques Delors, president  of the European Commission, described as "good news"--appears to  Algeria's western partners to be a step in the right direction.    The previous, incumbent, and next presidents of the Council  of Ministers of the Twelve, i.e., the foreign ministers of  Denmark, Belgium, and Greece, will visit Algeria in the coming  weeks, APS has announced, although the purpose of the visit has  not been disclosed. At all events, it seems Algeria has finally  broken through the financial blockade that has constrained it  for the last two years.</p>

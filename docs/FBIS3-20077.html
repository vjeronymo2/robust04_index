			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>   [Text] Any deal on Britain's future voting rights in Europe  which amounts to "a national veto by the back door" will not be  approved, the Government was warned today.    The leader of the majority Socialist group in the European  Parliament, Jean-Pierre Cot, made it clear the necessary minimum  vote to block Euro-legislation had to be 27 in practice.    Otherwise, he said, EU [European Union] accession terms for  Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria will not get the legally  required backing from Strasbourg.    "The Council of Ministers would do well to take account of  this point when it decides now on a blocking minority," he said.    Accession requires the votes of 260 of the 518 MEPs [members  of the European Parliament] by early May if enlargement is to go  ahead on time at the start of next year.    The leader of Britain's 45 Labour Euro-members, Pauline  Green, said she hoped enlargement would go ahead but warned:  "John Major is not out of the woods yet. He has a Cabinet  meeting tomorrow which could well see him lose his foreign  secretary. All this is of his own making."    A majority of the centre-right Christian Democrat MEPs --  the  group to which the 32 British Tories are allied -- are also  likely to oppose endorsing an enlargement deal which gives  Britain or any other government a firm blocking option with less  than 27 votes.    The fear is that even if the Cabinet accepts the terms of  the  weekend compromise -- offering a "reasonable time" to find  agreement where more than 23 but less than 27 votes are mustered  against EU laws -- some other EU governments will reject it,  throwing the Union into renewed confusion.    "All bets are off it that happens," said one official in  Brussels today.    The responses of the 12 governments to the compromise will  be  made tomorrow, probably by "written procedure" -- followed by a  formal gathering of ministers in Brussels on Wednesday [30  March] if a deal is on.    But any celebrations would have to wait until the European  Parliament delivers its final verdict.</p>

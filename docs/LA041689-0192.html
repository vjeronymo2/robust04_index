			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY;  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> History: The Cleveland Indians' sweep of the New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium  was their first since 1966, a span covering six U.S. presidents and 11  Cleveland managers.  </P> <P> Power Supply: First baseman Glenn Davis of the Houston Astros has hit three  home runs in 50 at-bats. The rest of the Astros have one homer in 388 at-bats.  </P> <P> Boooone: The Kansas City Royals' 5-4 loss to the Baltimore Orioles in 15  innings Wednesday had a major impact on Bob Boone's statistics. The ex-Angel  catcher went hitless in seven at-bats, dropping his batting average 122 points  to .333. He was also charged with two passed balls after being cited with only  one in 122 games last year.  </P> <P> The Pitch: Right-hander Dave Stieb of the Toronto Blue Jays credits  improvements in his slider for the fact he has thrown three one-hitters in his  last four starts going back to last year and pitched four shutouts in his last  five, allowing just one run and 11 hits in 44 innings.  </P> <P> Relief: The Chicago Cubs' Mitch Williams, acquired from the Texas Rangers in  the Rafael Palmeiro deal, had five saves in five opportunities through Friday,  though he had allowed nine hits and four walks in 6 1/3 innings, not to mention  a balk and throwing error. Williams had bailed himself out with eight  strikeouts.  </P> <P> Derricked: Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd, whom the Boston Red Sox hoped would fill the  breach left by Bruce Hurst, has an 11.25 earned-run average after two starts,  proving his spring ERA of 7.43 was no fluke. Boyd hasn't won since Aug. 26 and  hasn't pitched a complete game since 1986.  </P> <P> Poll: The Minneapolis Star Tribune asked readers whether they support Frank  Viola, who has rejected a three-year, $7.9-million offer from the Minnesota  Twins and said he will leave as a free agent when the season ends, or the club.  Viola received 611 votes. The Twins got 5,061.  </P> <P> Leadoff: How happy were the Milwaukee Brewers to see Paul Molitor come off the  disabled list Friday night? The four players they had used in the leadoff role  this season were a combined 0 for 24 before Mike Felder got a bunt single in  the fifth inning of Thursday night's game against the Texas Rangers.

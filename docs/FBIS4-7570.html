			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, March 31 -- Defence Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk failed to present Thursday a new deputy defence  minister coming from the ruling coalition, contrary to earlier  press reports.    At a press conference held shortly after his return from the  United States and Canada, Kolodziejczyk hinted that the  coalition itself is to be blamed for the lack of his deputy. He  confirmed that before he left for the United States he had  chosen one candidate from among four forwarded to him by the  coalition but this candidate had not been formally approved.    "After my return I encountered totally different situation  when the entire coalition pronounced itself against the interest  of the state while voting for the budget," Kolodziejczyk said  referring to the Defence Ministry budget which, in the ministry  opinion's, is unfavourable. He said that he wanted to meet  President Lech Walesa as soon as possible to discuss the matter.    In Kolodziejczyk's opinion, the parliament decision to  assign  300 billion zlotys (around 13.6 million dollars) from the  Defence Ministry budget for the purchase of "Iryda" planes does  not serve the defence interest of the state, does harm to other  arms industry plants and may delay the production of a Polish  anti-aircraft short-range missile.    Commenting upon his visit to the United States, the minister  said that "the foreign policy of the United States has shifted  towards Poland." "We are linked by strategic interests," he  added.    He explained that his talks in the U.S. focused on the U.S.  technological assistance for the Polish Army and on assistance  in financing "partnership for peace" programme. Kolodziejczyk  said that Poland cannot count on receiving money at present as  the matters related to the assistance are being discussed.    Asked what he thinks about the concentration of Russian Army  in the Kaliningrad District, he replied that this is groundless  from the operational point of view. "Poland wants to have  partnership relations with Russia but Russia is pretending to be  a besieged stronghold. Our streched hand, as far as economic  cooperation is concerned, usually is in vain, the minister said.</p>

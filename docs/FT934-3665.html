			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Brighter economic outlook indicated Another rise in the Central Statistical Office's shorter leading index of economic activity points to a favourable outlook for the economy. The index, which is supposed to indicate economic turning points in activity about five months in advance, was buoyed by increases in share prices and new-car registrations. There has been a slow-down in the fall of the longer leading index, reflecting increases in housebuilding starts in recent months. The coincident index, which tracks the business cycle, has maintained steady increases since the second quarter of last year.</p>

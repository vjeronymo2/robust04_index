			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Microsoft and Olivetti link in European deal Microsoft of the US has chosen Olivetti, the troubled Italian computer and office equipment manufacturer, as its second service and support partner for desktop systems in Europe. Earlier this year it said ICL, the UK-based company owned by Fujitsu of Japan, had been selected as the first of a number of companies able to provide pan-European support for Microsoft's international customers. Microsoft has taken a strategic decision to concentrate on software development, leaving systems integration, consultancy, maintenance and outsourcing to service partners. Olivetti's revenues from desktop services amounted to Dollars 1.13bn in 1993, including an Dollars 810m contribution from Europe.</p>

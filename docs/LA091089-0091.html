			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENTREPRENEURS CHART PLANS TO SELL THEIR GROUND WATER TO THIRSTY CITIES  </P> <P> The playing field of the new water market is still being laid out. In two of  the largest water deals by private entrepreneurs so far, eventual profits are  likely to be affected by decisions still to be made by politicians and the  courts.  </P> <P> Franklyn Jeans, for instance, is betting that his Nevada water basin won't be  too well-connected to the water basins of his California neighbors.  </P> <P> Jeans, a former newspaper reporter and Oakland attorney, bought a $2-million  ranch in the Honey Lake Valley, north of Reno, to raise alfalfa and cattle. He  found an unexpected bonanza of underground water, lost his interest in cows and  is now planning an $86-million water pipeline.  </P> <P> The idea struck him on a train ride back to Oakland one Sunday in November,  1985. Jeans, a self-confident Westerner, was commuting regularly then, spending  one week at work on the new ranch and the next at his law business in Oakland.  </P> <P> On the train with his wife, Susan, now a vice president of one of his  companies, Jeans read a report by Bob Firth, manager of water resources for  Westpac Utilities, the Reno water company. The report warned that the city was  running out of municipal water.  </P> <P> The next time that he was in Reno, Jeans arranged to meet Firth.  </P> <P> "If I told you there was maybe 12,000 acre feet of available (water) supply in  the Honey Lake Valley," Jeans remembers asking him, "what would you do?"  </P> <P> "He said," recalls Jeans, smiling at the memory of the normally taciturn Firth,  ' "I'd kiss you.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taking Most of Risk  </P> <P> As it happens, the deal with Westpac fell through. Jeans has since become  partners with Washoe County in an arrangement that leaves him risking $4  million in start-up costs for a possible $12-million return -- his share of the  $120-million sale of permanent water rights at an expected $6,000 per  acre-foot.  </P> <P> He admits that this is a "premium" return, but points out that his company is  taking the biggest share of risk in a private-sector structure that he predicts  will become more common around the West.  </P> <P> "It used to be if the government wanted to build a water infrastructure  project, build Hoover Dam," says Jeans, "it went out and took taxpayer's money  and it spent $5 million to do a study so that all the government types would be  protected if it went bad. And then they'd hire a contractor for $40 million and  they'd build a facility. And then they'd use tax revenues to pay the bonds  off."  </P> <P> The Honey Lake pipeline project, Jeans notes, is financed not by current  taxpayers but by fees that ultimately will be passed on to new homeowners.  "It's the incoming people," he says, "who get to pay for the right to move  here. . . . In effect, what we're doing is we're putting a cost on moving here  that will help us keep the quality of life up."  </P> <P> Jeans takes pains to point out that his scheme will not end up as a repeat of  the ecological disaster that befell Owens Valley.  </P> <P> For one thing, Jeans says, only the amount of underground water that is  naturally replaced each year in the Honey Lake basin will be piped south. There  will be no ground water mining.  </P> <P> Also, Honey Lake Valley, at least on the Nevada side, is almost uninhabited, he  points out.  </P> <P> "You can't develop ground water basins," says Jeans, "in areas where there's  substantial population, because it just screws it up for the people who are  there. You've got to go find essentially isolated agricultural areas."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans Water Ranch  </P> <P> That's exactly the point made by the 4,000 Honey Lake Valley residents on the  California side, who apparently share a set of interconnected water basins.  Their concern is that their water table will drop when Jeans starts pumping. A  U.S. Geological Survey team has been studying the basins and both sides hope  that modern hydrology will help produce a fair plan for dividing the water.  </P> <P> A far larger ruckus has been raised over the project of Ron Ober, a Phoenix  developer. Ober is piecing together a 30,000-acre water ranch in rural western  Arizona. He plans to sell water to the cities, when the price is right.  </P> <P> At the current price that Phoenix is paying, Ober's water would be worth about  $85 million, and that's not counting the cost of pumping it out of the ground  and transporting it to the cities. Ober thinks that the $85 million could be as  little as 5% of the total price that cities will ultimately pay.  </P> <P> Arizona's urban areas are in a squeeze. When former presidential candidate  Bruce Babbitt was governor, he promoted and signed a water law that bans ground  water mining around the cities. But the law also requires cities to demonstrate  that they have additional water supplies, enough to last 100 years, for any new  development.  </P> <P> An unforeseen consequence has been to force the politically powerful cities to  cast a covetous eye on rural water basins, where legally almost any amount can  be taken. The state Legislature has lately been trying to develop yet another  water bill, to both meet the cities' needs and treat rural residents decently.  </P> <P> But this year's bill foundered when the site of Ober's ranch, La Paz County's  water basin, became what Babbitt, now an attorney representing the county,  termed "the designated victim," the only rural area that would be left open to  big-time ground water mining. La Paz politicians stopped the bill by  complaining loudly in the Arizona press that they were about to become "another  Owens Valley."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rules Could Change  </P> <P> But water for Arizona's cities, where most voters live, must come from  somewhere, and the biggest water ranch scheme in La Paz County, not to mention  the state, is Ober's. This gives him a lot of clout in the Legislature, and in  the fight over the latest water bill, many environmentalists and rural  Arizonans considered Ober to be wearing a gray if not black hat.  </P> <P> Environmentalists are concerned, for one thing, that he plans to mine the  ground water, not treat it as a renewable resource.  </P> <P> Ober has already committed himself financially. Some water-policy observers see  considerable risk in this, since the Legislature can come along later and set  new rules for Arizona ground water.  </P> <P> Ober doesn't agree, especially in light of the powerful need for water in the  state. "The bottom line," he says, citing the simple economic engine that still  drives the West, "is that it's probably all going to get sold, because there is  more demand than there is supply."  </P> <P> Ober doesn't necessarily mean this literally. For instance, in the failed  Arizona water bill of this spring, La Paz County's water would have been  divided, with 65% being open to sale, and 35% being kept in the ground, for the  locals' future use.  </P> <P> Ober could even hear less environmental concern over his proposed ground water  mining -- or in water parlance, an overdraft, when underground water is taken  out faster than nature replaces it.  </P> <P> "We used to just say, 'ground water overdraft is bad,' " Thomas Graff, a senior  attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund, notes. "We now say, 'It's  something to worry about, because you want to husband resources over the long  haul.' On the other hand, we mine everything else. We mine coal. We mine oil."  </P> <P> Still, Graff isn't about to encourage ground water mining.  </P> <P> "You build up an economy based on water that you eventually exhaust, and then  what?" he asks. "You have to go somewhere else, and usually that means  environmental degradation in some distant locale."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE PROTESTERS  </P> <P> In response to the false accusation made by the Los Angeles Chinese Consulate  ("Chinese in L.A. Trade Allegations: Consulate's Charges of Payment to  Protesters Angrily Denied," Metro, June 28), I would like to make a proposal:  </P> <P> Let the Los Angeles Chinese Consulate offer $100 per person to support the  Chinese government for its "justified" actions. I would like to know how many  participants the Consulate can get.  </P> <P> It is an insult to all who participated the demonstrations, including myself.  </P> <P> I finally realized what level of intelligence those people are at after they  killed and jailed those who are better. I am really sad and ashamed, as a  Chinese, to see China be ruled by people who are this mindless.  </P> <P> A ruler who rules a country without heart will never prevail.  </P> <P> TSENG HU  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

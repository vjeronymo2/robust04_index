			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Calling for safeguards against NBA raids on its players, a Yugoslav basketball  team denied center Dino Radja permission to play for the Boston Celtics, who  drafted him earlier this week.  </P> <P> Bozidar Maljkovic, Radja's coach on the Jugoplastika team, said, "It would be a  catastrophe for our basketball" if the Yugoslav federation did not adopt rules  against allowing its best players to leave. He said no players younger than 26  should be allowed to sign with U.S. teams.  </P> <P> The Lakers drafted another Yugoslav, Vlade Divac, and he has been given  permission by his country's government to join them. Also reportedly  negotiating with NBA teams are Yugoslavia's star guard, Drazen Petrovic, and  center Stojko Vrankovic. Petrovic, who currently plays for Real Madrid in  Spain, was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1986, and Vrankovic was  chosen by the Celtics the same year.  </P></p>

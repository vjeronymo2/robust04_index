			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The first news of the morning in Kigali has just  reached us. To sum up, there is no change. The fighting is  continuing in the streets of the Rwandan capital. Press  correspondents on the spot report, I quote, that fighting is  raging and that UN officials fear that Hutu-Tutsi clashes may  spread beyond the capital. There is also confirmation of the  involvement of the Rwandan opposition in these hostilities.  Yesterday the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front left the  location where they were taking cover and are involved in  exchanges of fire with the regular army troops. The toll of the  clashes is particularly high, according to a UN official. In  Kigali, fires are raging at certain points, and hand-to-hand  fighting has been witnessed on the streets of the capital.    In Brussels, a first review of the situation was carried out  yesterday evening and continued into the early hours of the  night. At midday or perhaps early this afternoon, the government  is going to resume its review of the situation in the presence  of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who has returned from  abroad. Foreign Minister Willy Claes will return later today.  Any decision concerning evacuation that might have to be made  will probably be announced in the afternoon. In any case, since  yesterday, paracommando troops have been preparing for every  eventuality. There appears to be a general mobilization this  morning in the Belgian paratroop camp, and the paratroopers of  Flawinne barracks were recalled very early this morning. The  situation is exactly the same at Stokkem barracks, where the  soldiers have also been recalled. [passage omitted]</p>

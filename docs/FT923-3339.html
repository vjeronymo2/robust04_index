			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Major sees prominent Scots to 'take stock' THE PRIME MINISTER held a three-hour meeting in Edinburgh yesterday with 14 distinguished Scots as part of his pre-general election pledge to 'take stock' of Scotland's constitutional place in the UK. Opposition parties condemned the discussions as a sham, claiming that people advocating real political change had not been invited. Some of Mr Major's guests said the underlying presumption of the debate had been that the union between Scotland and England should be strengthened, and that a Scottish assembly - favoured by Labour and the Liberal Democrats - was not the way forward. Sir William Fraser, the principal of Glasgow University and a former Scottish office civil servant, said it had been made clear to the prime minister that in some areas there was a feeling that 'Scotland somehow was different', and policies applied in England did not necessarily have to be applied in Scotland, too. In particular, Sir William said, some guests defended local government in Scotland whose strength, they felt, the government should recognise. He added: 'Some people suggested, and I certainly agree with them, there was further scope for decentralisation of British government departments.' Another guest, Professor Arthur Midwinter, of Strathclyde University's Department of Government, said as he left: 'I suggested the government ought to have a less abrasive style in Scotland and ought to consult more widely.' Mr Major told journalists the 'very good debate' had put a different perspective on some constitutional questions. He confirmed that concern had been expressed about decentralisation, as opposed to devolution, in the private and public sector, but declined to be drawn on what he described as 'rather surprising points' made during the meeting. He said the 14 guests had been selected for their personal capabilities rather than their public positions. 'I'm trying to gauge the instincts of people and what they believe needs to be done to enshrine and secure the distinctiveness of Scotland and its place within the union.' Many Scots, he said, had not fully appreciated the extent to which administrative responsibility had been devolved from Whitehall to the Scottish Secretary in recent years. Asked later who had picked the 14 guests, Mr Major said, to laughter, he had devolved the selection to the Scottish secretary. Guests said the prime minister had been 'in listening mode'. Mr Major indicated his hope to complete his consultations by the end of the year but refused to set a timetable. The guests included Mr Scott Bell, managing director of Standard Life Assurance, Sir Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish and Newcastle, Mr Bruce Pattullo, governor of the Bank of Scotland and his deputy Professor Jack Shaw, chairman of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, Mr Bill Brown, chairman of Scottish Television and Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society, Mr Angus Grossart, managing director of Noble Grossart, Ms Barbara Kelly, chairman of the Rural Forum, Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of PIEDA, the Edinburgh consultants, Mr Magnus Magnusson, broadcaster and chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage, and Mr Allan Massie, author.</p>

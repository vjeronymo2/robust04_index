			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> JUST KIDDING: "I don't care. I'm a good sport," says attorney Stephen G. Corris  of Irvine, portrayed in a front-page Wall Street Journal article as the "butt  of a thousand faxes."  </P> <P> .. . Corris' 1988 letter to Wyoming lawyer Becky Klemt, in which he rejected a  minor case because it was beneath his $1,000-an-hour fee, has been  internationally circulated along the legal grapevine -- along with Klemt's  biting letter in response: "We've all been practicing trying to say we charge  $1,000 an hour with a straight face, but so far, we haven't been able to do  it." . . . But it's all a misunderstanding, Corris says. He says he no longer  practices and thought Klemt's original letter was a gag from a friend in  Wyoming. Corris says his response was a joke intended to sound as pompous as  possible. . . . Regardless, the incident has brought fame, cases and job offers  for Klemt and for Corris a reputation of being, in his words, "a swithering,  blithering idiot." Mark I.

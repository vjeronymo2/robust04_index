			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 24 Jun (EFE) -- The appointment of the  new commissioner for peace and reconciliation in the State of  Chiapas confirms the government's determination to seek  political solutions to the Indian conflict, PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo said  today.    Last Wednesday, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  appointed Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, former president of the  National Human Rights Commission, the new peace commissioner for  Chiapas, replacing Manuel Camacho Solis, who resigned on 16 June.    Zedillo said Madrazo's appointment "confirms the  government's  determination that the dialogue, negotiations, and political  solution must be the options to attain a definitive peace soon,  one with justice."    The presidential candidate of the PRI, which has been in  power since 1929, considered it an obligation to support the  tasks of the government and the new commissioner for peace in  the southeastern Mexican Chiapas State, in which the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN) staged a rebellion on 1 January.    Zedillo's endorsement of the negotiations came after he  strongly criticized Camacho Solis for the EZLN's refusal of the  government offer, which the former commissioner presented as an  official success, according to the PRI candidate.    Camacho Solis resigned because he considered Zedillo's  criticism of his work a discredit. Zedillo had said his  criticism reflected the feelings of numerous Mexican sectors.</p>

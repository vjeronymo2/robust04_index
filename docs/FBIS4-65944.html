			<p>BFN     [Text] Interior Minister Roberto Maroni has illustrated the  government's plan to step up the fight against Mafia-inspired  crime to the Chamber of Deputies. The 10 points are illustrated  for us by Daniela Calastri:    [Calastri] A special group drawn from all the forces of law  and order will collaborate with the Palermo Anti-Mafia  Prosecutor's Office; another interforce group will take charge  of tracking down the most dangerous wanted criminals; the  citizens of Palermo will be able to make use of a toll free  phone number directly linked to the police commissioner's office  in order to give information useful to the investigators;  supervision of the island will be reinforced by 100 men from the  police special operations force and a similar number from the  carabinieri; and the number of financial police will also be  increased. These forces will join the 5,200 soldiers who are  already in Sicily as part of the so-called Sicilian Vespers  operation. The minister envisages that the number of men in  this operation will rise to 7,200. In addition, the financial  police will step up its investigations into illegal assets.    As far as the law on supergrasses is concerned, Minister  Maroni said that the government would try and strike a balance  which reinforces the demands of the judiciary for safeguards  against evidence tampering and manipulation of supergrasses.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F> Francesco Cevasco; place and date not given: "Berlusconi:  `Antifascism Did Not Lose the Elections'"]    [Text] [Cevasco] Have you heard President Scalfaro? The  Resistance is part of history, and history is the truth....    [Berlusconi] (answers very seriously) The head of state  could  not have better expressed the values of the Constitution, whose  guardian he is. His reference to antifascism's historical truth  is sacrosanct. Of course, we must take into account the fact  that history is made of winners and losers, and that the winners  would be well advised not to rewrite history exclusively to  their own advantage, without showing understanding and tolerance  in regard to the losers' reasons. True antifascism can only be  the opposite of any form of fanaticism and historical  integralism.    [Cevasco] You will then agree also with Democratic Party of  the Left's (PDS) constitutional expert professor Augusto  Barbera, who maintains that you should take part in the 25 April  [Liberation Day] great antifascist demonstration. Will you join  in? Personally? In word? In front of a videoscreen? In the  street? Behind the....    [Berlusconi] I welcomed professor Barbera's words. He is  right to say that the "stupid" positions of a certain section of  the Left concerning the Resistance has given rise to blind and  violent ideologies, akin to terrorism. I thank him for his  invitation to take part in the demonstration. On 25 April I  will be, ideally, on the side of all those who celebrate Italy's  liberation, considering also that there will be several  demonstrations organized under a variety of banners. The banner  that I personally favor is that of truth and of the spirit of  national reconciliation.    [Cevasco] However, this 25 April is also being interpreted  by  the Left as a first instance of opposition to the pole for  freedom's electoral victory.    [Berlusconi] The link between 25 April and the left-wing  forces' wish to get their own back, which is a legitimate wish  in itself, is somewhat murky. Everything would be clearer, more  transparent, if the left-wing forces did not jumble together a  national festivity with their grief over their own defeat. It  is not antifascism that lost the elections. Rather, the losers  were the candidates in the lists set up by the old PCI [Italian  Communist Party], reunited for the occasion under the banners of  the PDS and Communist Renewal. This is a very different matter.    [Cevasco] However, this 25 April will still be marked by  division. On whose side will you stand? There are many ways of  interpreting and remembering that date....    [Berlusconi] I have already said on whose side I stand, and  I  do not find it shocking in the least that there should be  different ways of remembering a date which belongs to everybody.  Obligatory parades on 1 May were something which used to take  place on Red Square. There are no more historical balconies and  draft cards now.    [Cevasco] Where were you that day?    [Berlusconi] I was a nine-year old kid, who had been  evacuated to Oltrona Sanmamete, a village in the Como province.    [Cevasco] How did your father describe events, and how did  your family live through that experience?    [Berlusconi] My father never held a fascist party card, and  in fact he was forced to take refuge in Switzerland for some  time. My grandfather was even less fortunate: They forced him  to swallow castor oil, not the "electronic" type either; one  night -- he told me -- he had to hide under a bridge, at the  Navigli [Milan canals system], out of fear of the Fascist action  squads.    [Cevasco] If you had had in your hands the material used for  the "Combat" program broadcast by RAI [State Broadcasting  Corporation], how would you have reacted?    [Berlusconi] I would have broadcast it, just like RAI did.  Perhaps I would have tried to be more sensitive to the feelings  and the memory of the antifascists, but I would have not in the  least censored those images which spoke of violence and  brutality from the other side -- the kind of violence and  brutality witnessed at Piazzale Loreto [site of Mussolini's  execution]. In those times, censorship was carried out by the  Minculpop [Ministry of Popular Culture], but I do not like the  Mintelpop (ministry of popular television) any better.    [Cevasco] However, as a citizen, what is your opinion of  that  program?    [Berlusconi] Essentially -- I repeat -- it was a positive  exercise, a tribute to historical truth.    [Cevasco] What did you feel when you heard [National  Alliance  leader] Gianfranco Fini define Mussolini as the greatest  statesman in the century?    [Berlusconi] Mussolini governed for 20 years against the  rules of democracy and freedom. Finally, he dragged Italy into  a war, and the country was devastated by it. Having said this,  historical truth and interpretation are always more complicated  than the final verdict. I think that there were no elements of  fanaticism, loyalism, or nostalgia in Fini's statement. It  contained, in fact, an historical interpretation -- a legitimate  one, although I do not share it. As for the question who is  this century's greatest statesman -- at the risk of arousing my  friend [Radical leader] Pannella's indignation -- I would  answer: Giolitti, liberal Giovanni Giolitti.    [Cevasco] What, then, do you consider to be fascist today?  The purges that are being threatened -- or what else?    [Berlusconi] The purges are neither fascist nor antifascist  -- they simply do not exist. I do, however, consider the  attacks and personal intimidation aimed at opponents who are  regarded as enemies -- those which, as your Professor Panebianco  wrote, have, oddly enough, become the speciality of one section  of the Italian Left -- as actions of the "fascist school."    [Cevasco] Nevertheless, British and American newspapers  abroad have highlighted the link between Forza Italia's  electoral victory and the concern over a fascist comeback. Why  is this so, in your view?    [Berlusconi] Partly, we in the pole for freedom failed to  make ourselves clear. On the other hand, it is difficult to  describe a situation which, for the first time, is truly new --  one which, to anyone attempting to give an account of it,  presents traits that are completely different from anything  witnessed for the past 50 years. However, the misunderstandings  in the foreign press are also partly due to that syndrome which,  in fact, was very appropriately described in yesterday's  CORRIERE. Often correspondents paraphrase what they find in  local papers, and what they hear in the opinion-making circles  among the elite. If Italian newspapers indulge in emotionality  and overexcitement, correspondents run the risk of contagion.  You should also be giving some thought to this problem. It is  not exactly a great self-image that the country is projecting to  the outside world: It is neither beautiful nor true to life.    [Cevasco] Fini is also speaking, in his own way, of  appeasement, and of overcoming the fascist-antifascist logic.  Do you agree with this, and what do you understand by  appeasement?    [Berlusconi] Appeasement means that each person sticks to  his  own principles and his own truth, without however infringing on  other people's rights, and without bending history and memory in  order to serve political aims -- all of this with the necessary  observance of the republican Constitution, which can be  democratically changed, but not dispensed with.    [Cevasco] By the way, have you read Norberto Bobbio's book  on  the Right and the Left? Where do you place yourself in relation  to his definition of the Right and the Left?    [Berlusconi] I have not read it, but I hope I will have the  time to do so soon. I appreciate Senator Bobbio. If the book  confirms his views on the Right and the Left, as they have been  expounded in many articles of his, I will say that my place is  truly in the center, because I believe that there are vital  values on both sides. However, I do not trust the old political  toponymy, and in any case I am against intolerance and  extremism: If such trends develop on the Left, I lean toward  the Right, and vice versa.    [Cevasco] However, there must be some personality belonging  to the existing or the historical Right, of whom you have a high  opinion...    [Berlusconi] When De Gaulle came into power, the Left spoke  of a fascist coup. Here is an outstanding personality --  classified as an exponent of the Right in a loose and  approximate manner -- in Europe's recent history. The truth is  that I prefer personalities who are difficult to classify.    [Cevasco] And whom do you consider as right-wing today?    [Berlusconi] The extremists on both wings -- those who endow  political action with a ritual and rhetorical meaning, mistaking  ideological beliefs for civil reason.    [Cevasco] Among Fininvest's opinion-makers, whom would you  place more to the Right? Mentana, Liguori, Fede, Sgarbi,  Funari, Ferrara...    [Berlusconi] I have no wish to make some hasty judgment on  people with whom I have worked together in my group. Allow me  this stylistic freedom.    [Cevasco] Granted, but allow me in turn to insist on Ambra:  Some people have compared her to a "Giovane Italia" [Fascist  youth] because of her militant faith in Forza Italia.    [Berlusconi] I will gladly make an exception in Ambra's  case,  because she is a young woman who works hard, amuses herself, and  tries to amuse others. She is a TV personality, and that is  that. It is absurd that she should be attributed so much  significance, and that demonstrations should be called against  her, thus treating a very young person and citizen like some  sort of ideological object or symbol.    [Cevasco] Let us return to more serious things: Where should  Forza Italia's elected deputies sit in parliament: right or  left of the League and National Alliance [AN]?    [Berlusconi] In the center.    [Cevasco] Let us be even more serious: If you had had the  age of discretion at the time of the civil war, which side would  you have taken?    [Berlusconi] These questions are too difficult, because it  is  too easy to decide with hindsight.    [Cevasco] Let us, then, come back to the present. In a  letter to IL MANIFESTO, [progressive candidate] Giuseppe  Giulietti writes that Milan could be the ideal city for the 25  April demonstration "precisely because it was from there that  Berlusconi challenged the Left and is now preparing the ultimate  affront of relegitimizing the fascists." Do you agree, at least  on Milan as a venue?    [Berlusconi] "De minimis non curat praetor" [Latin, the  praetor does not deal with trifling details]. As far as Milan  is concerned, the only challenge I took up in the past was that  of turning it into a more solid, more beautiful, and more  European town.    [Cevasco] Giovanni Gentile, the fascist philosopher who was  killed by GAP [Partisan Action Group] members, is now being  revalued by the Left...    [Berlusconi] This is a subject for historians. His thought  and his cultural action are the proper domain for philosophers  and historians of ideas.    [Cevasco] One of the Left's hobbyhorses -- though not only  of  the Italian Left -- are the antitrust laws. Are you prepared to  commit yourself to undertaking a review of the antitrust law on  TV, thus obviously "harming" both Fininvest and RAI?    [Berlusconi] Antitrust and antifascism have only one thing  in  common: the "anti" prefix. I hope no confusion arises in this  respect, which would be ludicrous. However, I am a champion of  the market, in deed and not in name. Before the appearance of  commercial TV in Italy, we really had a supertrust, the state's  monopoly of TV. As far as the future is concerned, I favor the  emergence of other broadcasting institutions, without however  expropriating those who have invested resources and created  employment, and perhaps I would invite others to run the risk of  investing in the market, by appropriately amending the relevant  legislation. The issue will concern me as a deputy and  politician, but not as a businessman, because there will be a  very clear-cut and transparent division between the two roles in  the forms that we are currently examining.</p>

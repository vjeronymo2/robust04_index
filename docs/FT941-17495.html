			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Dolls make their way to the market: Reforms at east German toy factories Until unification, there were few children in east Germany who did not want a toy made in Sonneberg. The small town, tucked away in southern Thuringia close to the borders of Bavaria and the Czech Republic, was renowned for its craftsmanship and its century-old tradition of making soft dolls and hand-carved wooden toys. But German children only got one in 10 of the toys - 90 per cent of Sonneberg's output was exported to the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and European Union countries. Ms Connie Rudat, a 33-year-old office manager with a nine-year-old son, says when she was a child, she always asked for a Sonneberg doll, or a 'Sonni Puppe' as they were known, for her birthday. 'They had lovely clothes. At the same time, the dolls were simple and old-fashioned,' she says. Until 1990, the clothes of the hand-painted dolls were made by women working at home, on contract. 'Before the Wall came down, almost the entire 30,000 population of Sonneberg was connected with the toy industry,' says Ms Gundrin Hentschel, 40, responsible for production at the Sonni Puppen und Spieltiere factory, the town's largest manufacturer of soft toys and traditional dolls. In those days of a divided Germany, factory managers had little need to think about costs or marketing. The toy industry was state-controlled. Subsidies were plentiful, orders from the east abundant. But like other industries in east Germany, Sonni Puppen could not escape the impact of unification and the collapse of its main buyers, the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Thuringia's dolls were confronted by the market. In late 1990, east Germany's toy industry was placed under the Treuhand privatisation agency, which spent more than two years working on a restructuring strategy for Sonni Puppen and two other factories at Sonneberg. Mr Siegfried Sorgel, employed by the agency for the task, originally planned to amalgamate the factories and privatise them en bloc. There were few takers. 'The toy industry is a tough business. It was impossible to find a buyer for the whole lot,' he says. The Treuhand finally abandoned its plan and sold the factories separately - but not before it had cut the combined workforce of the three from 5,000 to 233 employees, and accumulated losses and provided subsidies totalling DM30m (Pounds 11.7m). Sonni Puppen's own payroll has been reduced from 1,800 to 65, and its output, which before 1989 totalled 10,000 dolls and 5,000 soft toys a day, has been cut to 30,000 items a month. Mr Peter Bieber, who with two partners from Nurnberg last month bought Sonni Puppen from the Treuhand, is determined to make the factory a success. 'My priority is to keep costs down,' he says. To do this, some of the dolls' clothes are being made across the border in the Czech Republic. 'Labour costs are DM4.50 an hour in the Czech Republic compared with DM30 at the factory,' says Mr Bieber. 'I reckon I am cutting costs by about 20 per cent.' Ms Hentschel says: 'If it means we can become competitive, not only in western Germany, but in other European countries by using cheaper labour in the Czech Republic, then so be it.' She knows that the toy market is cut-throat. The turnover of west Germany's toy industry was DM2.1bn last year, while the east German figure was a mere DM122m. Combined east and west German exports totalled DM3.2bn, a slight fall over 1991. However, imports increased by 3.6 per cent to DM3.2bn as south-east Asian penetration of the market gained pace. Ms Corinna Printzen, an official at Germany's Association for Toys, representing the industry, admits manufacturers are under pressure, particularly from electronic and video games being exported by Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. She reckons that German toy exports declined by 15 per cent in the first nine months of 1993. However, 'there is a gradual but nevertheless noticeable shift away from electronic toys to the more traditional, creative models', she says. Back in Sonneberg, the workers have accepted the demands of a market economy stoically. 'I suppose all the changes will have been worth it if Sonni Puppen can succeed as a privatised company under our new owner,' says Ms Hentschel. With luck, a doll from Sonneberg, which Connie Rudat yearned for as a child, might still make a gift for her grandchildren.</p>

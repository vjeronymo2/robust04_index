			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RENAMING OF STREET FOR KING DEFENDED  </P> <P> Lynwood Mayor Pro Tem Paul Richards endeavored Thursday to deflect charges of  racism leveled at black City Council members who approved the renaming of a  major boulevard after Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> Richards insisted that the decision to rename Century Boulevard after the slain  civil rights leader was made according to proper governmental procedure. He  said the five-member City Council, made up of three blacks and two whites, was  unanimous in its decision to honor King by renaming a street.  </P> <P> "It was the thinking of (the City Council) that this Nobel Peace Prize winner  and American hero would be the perfect banner-carrier for unity in our city,"  Richards said at a news conference.  </P> <P> In April, after the council voted 3 to 2 to rename the boulevard, a number of  residents protested the decision. Lynwood, a predominantly black suburb  southeast of Los Angeles, has been accused in the past of discriminating  against whites and others in favor of blacks.  </P></p>

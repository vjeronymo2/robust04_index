The budget will be submitted for  consideration by the State Duma. Speaking about the situation  in the financial sphere, the minister noted a slackening of the  pace of inflation. In December, inflation amounted to 12  percent a month, whereas in February, it was down to 10, and, in  the first half of March, to four percent. According to Dubinin,  since December, the country has been living in the conditions of  positive interest rates, in accordance with the discount rate of  the Central Bank and other credit institutions. Despite the  deepening of the economic crisis, the first two months of the  year were marked by some stabilization, the minister declared.    [Begin Dubinin recording] The financial stabilization which  has been so much talked about is starting to turn into something  real.

[Begin Dubinin recording] Now we are already planning to use  this credit as part of the cover for the federal budget deficit.  [end recording]</p>

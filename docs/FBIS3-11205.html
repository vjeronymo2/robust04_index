I  have taken a break from my activities during my official visit  to Japan to refer to an event that I believe sets a very serious  precedent for the country: the arbitrary decision made by the  Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] to declare the summons to a  referendum inadmissible. Article 79, Paragraph O of the  Constitution unequivocally and precisely establishes the  president's unquestionable right to summon a popular referendum  to decide issues that he believes are of extreme importance to  the state. Removed -- as has always been my case -- from any  sort of political, personal, or party interest, I decided to  call a referendum so we can discuss, for the first time, various  topics of great national importance. My intention was and  continues to be for the Ecuadoran people, all fellow citizens,  to directly and sovereignly express an opinion and decide how  our country should be, how the Ecuador we desire for our  children should be.    Nevertheless, the unconstitutional and surprising TSE  attitude, which cannot legally disqualify my summons, attempts  to hush the people's supreme voice -- our voice -- through an  illegal act.    On what legal precedence does the TSE interpret the  Constitution and state that my summons to a referendum is  unconstitutional? The TSE's decision is absurd, and I denounce  and reject it. The decision dangerously challenges the essence  of democracy. In fact, it keeps the people from directly  participating in the country's political life and from deciding  on its resources and alternatives.    How much longer must our country witness the repeated and  useless power struggles? What dark agreements and last-minute  arrangements will the legislative majorities make to resolve  their fierce disputes for control of the basic institutions that  are required to strengthen and improve our democratic life and  to ensure the thorough development of our people?    The time has come to change and respect the people's right  to  express themselves on significant national issues. Thus, with  great firmness, the president of the Republic and the national  government will not falter in their efforts to carry out this  legitimate referendum. Based on our democratic discipline and  with due respect for the Constitution and the laws of the  country, I have instructed the vice president of the Republic,  as acting president, and my government to resort to legal  measures to see that my constitutional right to consult the  people and the people's inalienable authority to express  themselves on the most important national problems be respected.  Any attempt to negate my and the Ecuadoreans' rights is a  serious mistake that will have a negative effect on the very  nature of our democracy.    I call all of you to join efforts so that we can defend our  rights together. I call on you to join us in defense of the  democracy we want to maintain and protect in our country.</p>

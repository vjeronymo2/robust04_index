The analyst says:    The South side said it had no objection to the proposed  early  exchange of special envoys, yet it took exception to announcing  the agreement on it in a joint communique. It also refused to  accept the North side's reasonable proposal on the mission of  special envoys, including the question of the North and the  South observing the principle of national independence. This is  a mockery of the fellow countrymen and an act utterly lacking  faith as a dialogue partner.    What the South side really seeks is to drag on the  working-level contact for an indefinite period and delay the  exchange of special envoys between the North and the South and  thereby to cast a shadow on the soon-to-be-held third round of  DPRK-USA talks.    It is an unjustifiable anti-national criminal act for the  very one who is blocking an early exchange of special envoys to  create an obstacle in the way of the third round of DPRK-USA  talks by laying the blame for the failure of exchange of special  envoys at the other's door.    The South side must bear in mind that a good opportunity  does  not present itself any time and stop playing tricks to block the  exchange of special envoys. And it must effect a fundamental  switchover so that the agreement may be finalized without fail  at the next contact.    We will watch the South side's attitude hereafter.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Bundesbank monetary policy condemned THE German Bundesbank was yesterday accused of pursuing a misguided and self-defeating tight monetary policy, which threatens to undermine the entire restructuring process in eastern Germany. In the most coherent and outspoken attack so far on the latest Bundesbank move to raise interest rates, the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) accused the central bank of misunderstanding the extraordinary causes of the current expansion in M3 money supply. It warned that far from curbing the growth of money supply, the latest increase in the discount rate - from 8.0 to 8.75 per cent - would actually increase it. The critique was written by Dr Heiner Flassbeck, head of the institute's main economics department, and specifically sanctioned as a policy statement of the institute. Yesterday he described the Bundesbank policy as both astonishing and 'absurd'. Although the discount rate rise in itself might not be significant, its effect as an indication of the central bank's determination to tighten monetary policy yet further was very important, the institute says. In west Germany, 'the tendency towards recession which already exists will be aggravated further in the light of the dwindling hopes of interest rate cuts', it says. In the east of the country, struggling with massive structural adjustment in the wake of unification, the move was likely to slow down essential investments and greatly exacerbate the looming economic crisis. The DIW cites two principal causes for the growth in M3, the broad measure of money supply, at the current rate of 9 per cent a year - well outside the 3.5-5.5 per cent Bundesbank target zone. One reason is rapid growth in bank credits to enterprises and individuals, and the second is a switch into high-interest bearing term deposits. Neither justified a further interest rate rise at the July 16 Bundesbank meeting, it says. The main reason for the expansion of bank credits is the investment need in east Germany, where restructuring is not a factor contributing to overall inflation, it argues. Prices will rise in the east, along with wages, until they reach western levels, and then stabilise. Given the relatively slow growth of western investment in the east, apart from public sector investments in infrastructure, it is possible to argue that the present 11 per cent growth rate in bank credit is actually too slow. The rapid growth in term deposits is actually caused by the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy pushing up short-term rates, at the expense of longer-term money instruments. The latest increase could well simply aggravate that trend, it says. The essence of the DIW argument is that the current rapid growth in money supply which perturbs the Bundesbank is a result of the unique circumstances of unification, and restrictive monetary policy is thus giving all the wrong signals. 'The Bundesbank will become a slave to its own money-supply concept, when it can no longer differentiate which part of money supply leads to inflation, and which to the opposite,' it concludes. Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger yesterday ruled out any cut in German interest rates in the immediate future, according to a report in today's Guardian. Asked if the Bundesbank had room to cut rates, he replied: 'Not for the moment. No, I don't see it,' the newspaper reported.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: BICC strong BICC was the outstanding performer in the heavy electricals/contracting area of the market. Dealers focused on the government's commitment to three new major infrastructure exercises: the Lewisham extension of the Docklands Light Railway, the West Coast electrification project and the construction of a new air traffic control centre in Scotland. 'The removal of budget uncertainties over UK road spending has left the way clear for BICC to hit 450p,' said Mr Mustapha Omar of Williams de Broe, the stockbroker. BICC ended 22 higher at 404p. Selected drinks stocks enjoyed a pre-Budget bounce, with analysts predicting that the decision not to raise excise duties on most drinks will be good for short-term sentiment. Bass, reporting results today, advanced 10 to 503p and Grand Metropolitan, with figures out tomorrow, put on 4 at 413p. Guinness moved forward 9 to 469p and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 12 to 500p. There was a mixture of relief and disappointment among stores analysts. The lack of VAT increase or extension came as a relief to many stocks, although too late to affect yesterday's action. Booksellers such as WH Smith 'A', 5 higher at 490p, and J. Menzies, off a penny at 541p, could be subject to some relief. However, some analysts expressed disappointment that there was not more of a boost to consumer spending. On the other hand, many now believe that the lack of nasty surprises yesterday leaves the way clear for a strong seasonal run-up to Christmas. The clearing banks and the merchant banking sectors staged a smart leap forward ahead of and during the Budget speech, with both areas regarded by analysts as beneficiaries of what was initially viewed as 'a market-boosting Budget'. Barclays, up 14 at 584p, and Lloyds, 13 stronger at 593p, spearheaded the high street banks. A substantial profits upgrade by one broking house drove Kleinwort Benson sharply higher and prompted equally strong performances from other leading merchant banks, which were additionally boosted by another sparkling performance by the equity and gilts markets. Kleinwort shares raced up 15 to 523p, SG Warburg jumped the same amount to 857p and Hambros advanced 17 to 372p. Smith New Court, one of the leading trading houses in the City, climbed 16 to a record 410p ahead of interim figures expected on December 7. The regional electricity companies' interim dividend race got under way, with Eastern Electricity sprinting into a strong lead and surprising all but the most optimistic utilities analysts by posting a 20 per cent rise in its half-year payment. Most analysts' forecasts were bunched around the 6.2p dividend mark, which would have represented a 13 per cent increase, although UBS was bang on in forecasting the 6.6p. Eastern's generous payment saw the shares appreciate 8 to 596p, prompting rises from all the other recs. South Wales, the next of the recs to announce interim figures, on December 7 along with Midlands Electricity, rose 7 to 648p and the latter 5 to 612p. Water stocks, on the other hand, tended to lose ground, partly because of switching operations into the recs. Anglian slipped 4 to 530p. Broadcasting shares continued to be buoyed by bid premiums following Carlton's Pounds 768m agreed offer for Central Television on Monday. The former added 34 at 831p, while the latter surged 73 to 2546p. LWT, strongly rumoured to be the next target, jumped 12 to 591p. Granada Group, the likely predator, put on 10 at 473p. Scottish TV rose 23 to 489p. Poor results from Dawson International sent the shares tumbling 37 to 136p and also hit Coutaulds Textiles, 8 cheaper at 207p. Analysts reported a generally satisfactory meeting with Glaxo and the shares moved up 5 1/2 to 676 1/2 p. There was strong support for Cadbury-Schweppes as the stock benefited from several broker recommendations. The shares surged 14 1/2 to 465 1/2 p. Unilever was also in demand, gaining 16 at 1137p, with NatWest Securities and Strauss Turnbull said to be recommending the shares.

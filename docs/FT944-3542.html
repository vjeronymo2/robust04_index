			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / House sales 'same as last year' House sales in November fell 10.3 per cent compared with October but are virtually unchanged from November last year, according to a survey of 4,000 estate agency offices, Simon London writes. The figures, published by the ombudsman for corporate estate agents and covering about half of all offices, confirm that the housing market recovery of the summer fell away during the autumn, with activity stabilising at about the same level as last year.</p>

At the same time, however, this has also  given rise to a noteworthy "rural disease." In order to deal  with this problem, the State Council's Research Office carried  out a systematic investigation and submitted a special report.  RENMIN RIBAO reporters have summarized the main points of the  report as follows:  <H5>  The Noteworthy "Rural Disease" </H5>   Since the beginning of reform and opening, major changes  have  occurred in the urban and rural economic structures in our  country. In particular, various nonfarming industries, composed  mainly of township and town enterprises, have developed greatly  in the countryside. However, some special phenomena also  appeared in such developments and have been called a "rural  disease" which mainly finds expression in the following facts.    The rural industry is widely scattered. In 1992, there were  20.79 million township and town enterprises throughout the  country, and more than 19 million were located in natural  villages. The advantage of such a scattered distribution was  that the starting costs would be much lower and villagers could  be engaged in both farming and industrial production. However,  there were more disadvantages: First, the enterprises were  operating in a closed condition; second, they were widely  scattered; third, it was hard to control industrial pollution;  and fourth, there was a serious degree of duplicated production  and competition remained at a low level, even causing serious  waste.    The construction of small cities was not well planned and  coordinated. At present, most rural towns with comparatively  developed industry and commerce in the coastal provinces have  been developed into small cities. In some areas, small cities  and towns have been linked up. However, the size of most such  cities is still too small, so the scale of the urban districts  uneconomical. They require huge investment in the construction  of infrastructural facilities but their utilization rate is  rather low and too much land is occupied.    The nonfarming population is now migrating between cities  and  the countryside. They have their native residence in the  countryside and still undertake the land contracts but they work  and live in cities and towns. They possess the means of  production and livelihood both in their native rural areas and  in cities. On the one hand, they have no interest in engaging  in farming production or no longer have the ability to do so; on  the other hand, they cannot gain the same status as urban  residents.    In order to promote the healthy development of the rural  economic communities, we must give guidance to the development  of the nonfarming industries in the countryside and should  combine this with the construction of small cities. In  practice, we should explicitly adopt the following guidelines:  First, remove the constraining factors and create a policy  environment which can naturally effect the "combination."  Second, the "combination" mainly relies on the full use and  proper transformation of existing small cities, and also on the  development of new small cities according to scientific plans,  so that their layout is reasonable and their development is  orderly. Third, the "combination" is not aimed at concentrating  the scattered nonfarming industrial projects, because this is  unrealistic; instead, it is mainly aimed at concentrating new  projects in the future. Fourth, the "combination" should not  only be effected between the nonfarming industries and the small  cities but also between the nonfarming population and the small  cities.  <H5>  Giving Positive Guidance to the Combination </H5>   Giving guidance to the combination between the development  of  the nonfarming industries and the construction of small cities  is of great significance in many aspects:    1. This will quicken the development of the tertiary  industry and will shift more surplus labor force from farming to  other industries. In the last more than 10 years, various  nonfarming industries have made substantial development in the  countryside with the rise of the township and town enterprises.  In 1992, such industries employed 106 million rural working  people. At present, there are about 170 million surplus working  people in the rural areas, equal to the total urban population  of the 517 cities in the whole country. In future, the meaning  of the term "local employment" should be broadened. In the  past, "local" mainly referred to people's native places;  henceforth, "local" should go beyond people's native places.  Facts show that the tertiary industry can absorb a much larger  quantity of the work force than secondary industry; and the main  supporters of the tertiary industry are cities and towns. That  is to say, small cities should have a much stronger capacity to  absorb the surplus labor force in the countryside.    2. This will create more favorable conditions for farming  operations on an appropriate scale and thus make a new leap in  agricultural production. Henceforth, in order to raise our  country's agricultural production, especially grain production,  to a new stage, we shall have to solve the problems caused by an  excessive number of peasants and the small area of farmland in  per capita terms.    3. This will mitigate the pressure caused by the surplus  rural labor force on the large and medium cities. In current  social and economic circumstances, the household registration  system for permanent residence is no longer effective in  restraining peasants from moving into cities. The sole method  is to give more effective guidance to the population movement  and actively encourage the combination between the development  of the nonfarming industries and the construction of small  cities. While developing nonfarming industries, the rural areas  can also develop small cities which will become "huge sponges"  absorbing a large number of surplus working people from  agriculture. This should be the most realistic method suited to  the national conditions.    4. This will promote family planning and reduce the natural  population growth and thereby enhance the quality of the  population. Family planning can be promoted among peasants who  have moved into cities, thus reducing the natural population  growth; on the other hand, through their marriages, peasants can  be connected to the urban population and the higher educational  level and this will promote the enhancement of the population  quality.    5. This will economize on land and construction funds. As  the nonfarming industries in the rural areas are relatively  concentrated and are developed on large stretches of land  according to unified plans, the outlay will become more  reasonable. The enterprises may share the same public  utilities. This will economize on the use of land and save more  funds for the construction of infrastructural facilities.    6. This will enhance civilization and promote social  progress in the rural communities because the development of the  cultural, educational, scientific, technological, and public  health undertakings is all preconditioned by the relatively  concentrated residence of the people.  <H5>  Backup Policies and Measures </H5>   In order to promote the combination between the development  of nonfarming industries and the construction of small cities,  it is proposed that backup reforms and corresponding policies be  gradually adopted mainly in the following aspects:    The household registration and permanent residence policy.  The policy for managing peasants' permanent residence and  resettlement should be made more flexible so that peasants are  allowed to move to small cities after they meet certain  requirements. In general, the scope of such free movement can  be extended to county towns or towns below the county level.  The general principle is to keep large and medium cities stable  and to develop small cities and small towns; the purpose is to  promote common socioeconomic development. Policies in this  regard may be formulated by various provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities according to their conditions under  the guidance of the state's general arrangements.    The land policy. There should be a system for strictly  examining and approving the use of land for the development of  nonfarming districts and for the construction of small cities.  The use of land should be planned by the local governments who  should also requisition, develop, and distribute it. Land  distribution can adopt such forms as signed contracts, invited  tenders, or auctioned. Different prices should be fixed on land  used for different purposes, such as industrial, commercial, and  residential purposes. Favorable land prices may be given to  peasants trying to start industrial and commercial businesses in  the new districts for planned development. Peasants who have  settled down in small cities, and those who have changed their  status into the nonfarming population, should be required to  return the land that was previously contracted to them for  farming production and the land contracts should be terminated.  The farmland should be contracted to other people for  management by the rural collectives. Peasants should be allowed  to freely purchase commercial housing in small cities and towns  without any restrictions. Economic means, such as requisitioning  land, raising land use fees for township and town enterprises,  or exchanging land, can be used to encourage and prompt the  existing township and town enterprises which are scattered  widely to move to certain well-planned districts or small cities  to seek more concentrated development.    The social policy. Mass self-management organizations such  as residents' committees should be set up in small cities, as  should social service organizations providing community services  and job placement services. The management of the permanent and  migrating population should be strengthened. Various social  security networks covering a broad scope of the population  should be set up according to the characteristics of the small  cities. The social security programs in small cities should be  included in their overall socioeconomic development plans and  should be joined by enterprises under all different ownership  systems and by all workers employed under different conditions.    The financial policy. The income from selling the land use  rights and the profits made from the real estate development  projects in small cities should be used for the construction of  small cities. The rate of taxes for maintaining urban utilities  in small cities should be appropriately enhanced and the tax  revenue should be completely used for the construction of  infrastructural facilities in the same cities. Public utilities  should be run as enterprises and those who make investment in  public utilities should gain returns, as the public utilities  are used on a paid basis. Residents moving into small cities  should first pay a certain amount of construction fees and this  money can be refunded in later years. The banks should give  financial support to the construction of small cities by  offering favorable terms.    Measures: Strengthening the planning, management, and  guidance of the county (city) governments. The county-level  (city-level) planning, management, and guidance should achieve  the following ends; First, overcome the narrow-minded parochial  mentality and remove the obstacles of rural administrative  districts to the "combination." Second, make unified planning  for the "combination" in the scope of a county (city), thus  preventing the excessively scattered distribution of township  and town enterprises and also preventing ill-coordinated  "combination," which can lead to the appearance of excessive  small industrial districts and small cities.    Being the upper authorities of the townships and towns, the  unified planning and management by the county (city) governments  can achieve better results.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  on Friday [10 June] reached a set of accords to promote  bilateral cooperation in basic civil industrial technology,  officials said.    The agreements center on development and dissemination of  "precompetitive technologies," said Hiroshi Kashiwagi, the head  of the industrial science and technology agency, an organization  under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.  Kashiwagi briefed reporters on the talks, which were held in  Japan.    Technological cooperation covered under the talks, the  second  of their kind, is part of the agenda set under the trade  "framework" negotiations. The first round of talks were held in  Washington last December.    Mary Good, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for technology,  who headed the U.S. delegation, said, "I believe the agreement  is going to lead to very substantial collaborative efforts in  the areas where we have not cooperated before."    During the three days of high-level sessions -- Tuesday in  Kyoto, and Thursday and Friday in Tokyo -- both parties agreed  to launch a joint government-private sector campaign for  enhancing the technological foundation of the two countries  under the "industrial technology initiative" scheme.    The scheme will include an expanded interchange of  researchers, financial assistance by Japan to major U.S.  universities, and promoting information-sharing on publicly  owned technological data. Under the scheme, Japan and the U.S.  will also conduct joint research and development on about 10  scientific themes that do not involve direct competition between  the two countries, Kashiwagi said.    A research center, called "The Techno-Growth House," will be  constructed in Japan to promote the scheme. The research house  is designed to provide research space and accommodation at  reasonable charges for foreign researchers. It can also be used  for offices and conferences.    Kashiwagi said about 10 areas to be studied jointly will  include database development for chemicals, environmental  technology, know- how on measuring instruments, bioprocessing  studies, ceramics, machinery technology and rare materials.    "We have chosen the areas which are of great interest both  to  Japan and the U.S.," Good said. She said studies on ceramics,  bioprocessing and technical database may be launched by the end  of this year.    Friday's accords will be formally announced in a joint  statement to be made before the July Naples summit of the major  industrial countries by Japanese International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron  Brown.    The accords will be reflected in Japan-U.S. talks to find  ways to promote economic harmonization in other areas of the  trade framework talks, Kashiwagi said. The next round of  high-level talks on civil industrial technology cooperation will  be held in the U.S. in October.</p>

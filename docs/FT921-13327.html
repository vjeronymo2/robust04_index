			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: TransCanada PipeLines rises TRANSCANADA PipeLines, one of North America's largest natural gas pipeline operators, lifted net income by 17 per cent last year, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The Calgary-based company said it had taken another step towards distancing itself from BCE, the Montreal-based telecommunications conglomerate which is its largest shareholder, by naming its chief executive, Mr Gerald Maier, as chairman to replace BCE's Mr Raymond Cyr. TCPL's net earnings rose to CDollars 251.2m (USDollars 218.3m), or CDollars 1.34 a share, in 1991, from CDollars 214.9m, or CDollars 1.23, in 1990.</p>

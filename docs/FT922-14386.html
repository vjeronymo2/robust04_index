			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh sugar crop hopes fuel Indian export drive THE INDIAN government, emboldened by the prospect of another bumper crop during the 1991-92 season (October-September), has authorised the export of 250,000 tonnes of sugar. Last year, India resumed exporting after a gap of six years, with sales totalling 525,000 tonnes. Industry officials believe that, like last year, the government will be making export releases in phases. The Indian Sugar Mills Association and the National Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories have made representation to the government that, in the interest of the sugar economy and also in order to step up foreign exchange earning, permission should be given for a minimum export of 500,000 tonnes. According to Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for ISMA, India now has the capacity to export 1m tonnes of sugar per year, provided that the releases are made uniformly during the year. The capacity of Indian ports to handle sugar is limited and during the monsoon the ports of Bombay, Nav Sheva and Goa cannot handle sugar at all. India has found a good market for sugar in Bangladesh and in Sri Lanka. It has also been able to find buyers in some West Asian and European countries. At current world prices, the loss on export is estimated at Rs100 (Pounds 2.20) a tonne. That is to be equitably shared by all sugar mills in the country. In the first five months until February, India had produced 7.86m tonnes of sugar, compared with 7.23m tonnes in the corresponding period of the previous season. In the current season, 375 sugar factories are in operation, up from 359 last year. In response to the package of incentives for the creation of extra capacity, some new sugar factories have been commissioned this year. According to Mr Dhanuka, India hopes to produce 12.5m tonnes of sugar this season, compared with 12m tonnes last year. Domestic consumption is forecast to be about 11.5m tonnes, up 800,000 tonnes. The present season opened with stocks of 3.33m tonnes, against 2.22m tonnes last year. The opening stock has to take care of internal requirements of the first three months when production is low. In the circumstances, India could easily export up to 1m tonnes.</p>

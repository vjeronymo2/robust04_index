			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] The president's aide Levon Zurabyan has said that  the Armenian-Azeri conflict has reached the stage when it is  impossible to speak about a stable and guaranteed truce without  the use of disengagement force. The aide welcomed Russia's  preparedness to send such force to Nagorno-Karabakh.    Addressing a briefing in Yerevan, Zurabyan said that today  Russia is the only state which is prepared to take such a step  and "it is obvious that Russia shows resoluteness". He also did  not rule out the possibility of the arrival to the region  shortly of Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev to continue  the talks and achieve a truce.    The aide believes the by the moment Azerbaijan exhausted all  its reserves during the recent large-scale offensive at the  Karabakh front which the country launched December 18 [sentence  as received]. Baku, he said, only seized the settlement of  Goradiz at the expense of many casualties.    At the present stage Azerbaijan has sustained another  defeat,  said the aide. He believes this could also be described as a  defeat of the policy to settle the Karabakh conflict by the use  of force.    Zurabyan believes that now there are all prospects for a  peaceful settlement of the conflict. He stressed the importance  of the meeting in Moscow February 18 of the defence ministers of  Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and representatives of  Nagorno-Karabakh.    The protocol signed during the meeting, he said, provides  for  the establishment of truce in Karabakh and the discussion of  further political steps. The concept has always served as a  basis for the Armenia leadership stance, said Zurabyan.    He said the frontline is to be fixed, after which the  conflicting sides are to disengage the troops to 10-15  kilometers of the contact line. Next it is planned to create  joint monitoring groups which will be deployed along the front  perimeter and will act under the control of the joint chiefs of  staff. The agreement does not provide the site for the  withdrawn troops from the occupied territories.    If the mechanism works, said Zurabyan, we shall have a  guaranteed and lasting truce. And then the question could be  raised about a four-partite summit meeting which will discuss  political aspects of the Karabakh problem.    Speaking about the relations between Armenia and Georgia,  Zurabyan said that no matter what, they are normal and both  sides believe that only joint efforts can help them overcome the  crisis. The problem is related to the political situation in  Georgia, he said, which is on the brink of chaos now. The  explosions at the railway on March 2 indicates that the Georgian  leadership does keep the situation under full control.    The plenipotentiary envoy of the Russian president, the head  of the peace mission for settlement in Karabakh Vladimir  Kazimirov who has recently visited Yerevan and Baku, told  Interfax that until the warring sides in Karabakh are not  separated, any agreement on ceasefire "risks to remain just a  paper".    In his opinion, the withdrawal of armed units for distance  inaccessible for artillery fire can be the only guarantee of  ceasefire in the region. He noted that so far this condition  had not yet been met, and "sporadic violations of truce continue  to take place".    The Russian envoy also informed that after the withdrawal 30  flexible groups of the Russian Army observers will be deployed  in the "separation strip". These groups will also include  representatives of the warring sides. "Only in that case it  would be possible to objectively judge which of the sides  committed this or that violation", Kazimirov emphasized.    The Russian Deputy Defense Minister, Colonel-General Georgiy  Kondratyev [name as received] who was also in Yerevan and Baku  told Interfax that on Thursday he had received from the military  command of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh a response  to proposals of the Russian side on the settlement of the  conflict. (The warring sides were offered to proceed with the  ceasefire process, to withdraw to agreed regions heavy weapons  within March 2- 5 and to mutually separate troops in the  Mardakert and Fizuli directions - IF). According to the  general, Armenia and Nagorno- Karabakh agreed to accept these  proposals on the condition that Azerbaijan does the same.  However Azerbaijan, he said, agreed to just continue the  process of ceasefire and considered it unacceptable to withdraw  arms and troops to regions determined beforehand, because  Armenian units are located on the occupied territories of the  republic.    Kondratyev stated that if the warring sides are not  separated, Russian officers will not be sent "under fire". "If  the sides do not fulfil the conditions of the protocol, then let  them fight until the victorious end", he said.</p>

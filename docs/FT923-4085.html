			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Japan fixes size of UN force THE Japanese government yesterday announced it would send more than 1,800 troops to join United Nations peacekeeping operations in Cambodia over the next year, in the first overseas deployment of Japanese ground forces since the second world war. The dispatch of troops from Japan's Self Defense Force, while still controversial, is a centre-piece of Japan's efforts to play a more active role in world affairs. After nearly two years of bitter debate in the Japanese Diet, the government in June succeeded in obtaining passage of a bill authorising overseas dispatch of Japanese troops to join international peace keeping operations, under limited circumstances. One condition is that a ceasefire must be in place. Opposition forces have argued that the refusal of the Khmer Rouge faction in Cambodia to lay down its arms made it impossible for the government to send troops to Cambodia. The government says however that the Khmer Rouge has still not rejected the ceasefire. The decision to dispatch troops followed a formal request last week from Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general. Japan is to send eight soldiers as ceasefire monitors on September 17. They will be followed in mid-October by 600 army engineers, who will repair roads and bridges, and 75 civilian police officers. A total of 1,811 personnel are to be deployed during the year.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Merger plea for Europe's airlines EUROPE'S competition policymakers must allow large European airlines to merge with other carriers to enable them to expand, improve productivity and compete in the global airline market, Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, urged yesterday. Clamping down on large airline mergers and alliances, he warned, 'would condemn European air transport to a rapid, irrevocable decline'. Speaking at a Financial Times aviation conference in Singapore, Mr Attali sharply repudiated recent proposals by Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, to introduce a European competition policy to control airline mergers and protect smaller carriers. Mr Chataway called earlier this month for an airline merger policy to protect consumer interests in Europe. The aim of European air transport liberalisation had to be to increase competition and allow a multiplicity of airlines to survive, he said, arguing for strict controls on large European airline mergers. Mr Attali. however, said these proposals would distort natural market trends by increasing regulation. If European airlines were to compete against the large US and Asian carriers, they had to be able to organise themselves freely. 'Let us be allowed to gather our strength to avoid being hacked to pieces by our competitors,' he said. 'Rather than shelter behind an obsolete set of rules, European carriers will need to speed up their reorganisation and improve their competitiveness.' Competition was forcing airlines to streamline their networks and group together to reduce costs. Mr Attali said the international competitiveness of large European airlines would be undermined if regulators forced them to hand over landing slots, give up routes, and dispose of equity holdings in other companies when they put forward merger proposals.</p>

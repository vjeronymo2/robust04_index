			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> FOXX MADE MILLIONS, LOST MORE  </P> <P> Comedian Red Foxx once made $4 million a year but lost the money in lawsuits  and broken deals and because he failed to heed the IRS, according to voluminous  records in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  </P> <P> The IRS stepped in Tuesday and raided Foxx's home in Las Vegas, seizing his  property -- including furniture, cars and jewelry he was wearing -- for failure  to pay $755,166 in taxes.  </P> <P> Foxx was left with an empty house, which the government says it will sell if he  doesn't settle the tax debt in 30 to 45 days.  </P> <P> Foxx was one of the top-paid performers in the United States in the 1970s. He  currently works as a comedian at the Hacienda Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip,  earning $20,000 a week. He said Tuesday the $20,000 has gone to the IRS the  past several weeks.  </P> <P> His manager, Prince Spencer, said Foxx was paid $500,000 for his role in the  current film "Harlem Nights." Foxx vowed to bounce back from Tuesday's seizure.  </P> <P> "I'll make it," he promised. "I got good friends."  </P> <P> The $755,166 Foxx owes the IRS does not include interest and penalties. Court  records show Foxx also owes state taxes in California and New Jersey.  </P></p>

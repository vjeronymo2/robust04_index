			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Union financially viable and aiming to strengthen organisation Sir, Robert Taylor's apocalyptic vision of my union's finances ('Civil service union in cash crisis', May 17) is misleading and partial in its presentation of the facts. Although there were no factual inaccuracies in the article, it failed to paint the full picture. Far from 'only' a quarter of our members having re-authorised their subscription deductions, it is more appropriate to say that 'already' a quarter have done so. Even though the first forms only went to branches six weeks ago, sign-up rates are already hitting 49 per cent (Scottish Office), 45 per cent (Home Office), 44 per cent (Land Registry) and 38 per cent (Customs). Second, we have not blamed payroll and personnel managers for delays. They have been very helpful and co-operative. Delays in agreeing the mechanics of the operation may or may not be politically inspired, but are certainly the result of decisions taken at a much higher level - Treasury and Department of Employment ministers. Third, no mention is made that we project a surplus of Pounds 100,000 for 1994 and a subscription income of Pounds 10.4m. Fourth, highlighting the response among our members in Employment illustrates little, as the forms were only sent out just before our conference a fortnight ago, and we would not expect any completed returns until 14-21 days after dispatch. The overall response is good and getting better - to such an extent that extra staff are being drafted in to open the post. More than 2,000 forms were processed on one day alone recently. Fifth, a misleading impression is provided by selective quotation from our financial report. We have total assets of Pounds 8.2m, of which Pounds 6m are fixed assets. 'Lack of liquid assets' refers only to cash in hand or in bank accounts. Sixth, reference to conference decisions are irrelevant, as our 1994 estimates are not based on possible savings from conference proposals. Seventh, we are one of the few unions actually to have increased membership over the last year - a very encouraging base for the check-off campaign. Surely this is relevant. Unions are not savings accounts but organisations that collectively represent workers' interests. Our financial health is important and is taken seriously, but it is only a means to an end, and not the end in itself. Our membership increase is a result of campaigning on issues of direct relevance to our members - pay, jobs and quality of services. We are financially viable and will show that, like the political fund ballots, the unions will turn a legislative attack into a means of strength-ening our organisation and increasing our membership. Finally, the article appeared on the day that our proposed partners in a new union, the IRSF, debated merger at their conference. Despite exaggerated reports of our financial demise, they voted to move forward with us towards a powerful new public services union.

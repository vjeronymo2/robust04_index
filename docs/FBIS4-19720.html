			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dehaene by correspondent Anne </F> Quevrain; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Anchorman Lambrechts] The Rwandan ambassador to  Zaire has, in the last few hours, reiterated accusations against  the Belgian blue helmets, saying that three Belgian soldiers  used missiles to shoot down the plane carrying the Rwandan  president. That assassination provoked the current violence in  that country. Today the Belgian Government, through Prime  Minister Dehaene, most firmly denies those allegations.    [Dehaene] Apparently, this anti-Belgian propaganda has not  stopped and it is clear that it is unfounded. It is the policy  of some Rwandan clan which obviously has decided to place the  responsibility on the Belgians.    [Quevrain] Are you not afraid that these allegations will  tarnish the image of Belgium?    [Dehaene] I do not believe that they will be seen as very  credible abroad. I believe that it clearly must be stated that  they are unfounded and that the Belgian troops were in Rwanda to  implement the peace and cooperation agreements and had no role  in domestic affairs.</p>

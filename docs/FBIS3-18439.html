			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Robert Leicht: "The Chancellor's Final </F> Battle"]    [Text] The chancellor in the role of Baron von  Muenchhausen: a politician trying to draw himself out of the mud  by his own hair. That Helmut Kohl is entering his last battle is  certain; he has said often enough that he wanted to know it once  more. It would be more than a miracle in many respects if it  were to become his last victory.    Never before in the history of the FRG has a government  party  entered an election campaign under such miserable conditions.  Since Helmut Kohl came to power, the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU] has lost more and more votes from one election to the next  in western Germany. This is true even for the seemingly  triumphant unity election of 1990; then it was only the  exuberant expectations of eastern Germans that made the result  appear more favorable for the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU].  Yet four years later, Kohl no longer can count on this special  bonus. On the contrary, eastern Germany will have a significant  negative impact on the CDU's 1994 election balance.    Never before in the history of the FRG was a chancellor  given  a full mandate four times in a row. When Konrad Adenauer ran  for the fourth time in 1961 -- which, by the way, was also  preceded by a dramatic miscalculation regarding the election of  the federal president -- the main reason the government alliance  won a majority again was that one of the coalition partners, the  Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], had promised the voters  with great success regarding the subsequent support: with the  CDU, but without Adenauer. Hence, the "old man" had to put up  with a humiliating election capitulation: He was only allowed to  stay in power for another two years.    A look back into tradition shows that the fourth legislative  term requires a particularly compelling justification. Yet  where should it be found? After 12 years in power, what new  things would a government still have to offer? How should a  government head be ready to achieve what he failed to do three  times before -- and all that in view of the enormous effects of  wear and tear of such an office?    In the case of Kohl, one must add that, politically, even a  miraculous victory in the Bundestag election would only lead  into a dead-end street. By then the CDU will, in great  likelihood, have lost its majority in two laender in eastern  Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will  have gained a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag. Thus, Kohl  is entering a battle he cannot win even if he succeeds but, at  the most, he can achieve a nerve-killing blockade. Is it worth  at all to fight for that?    Helmut Kohl -- and this could also be seen from his  appearance at the Hamburg CDU Congress -- responds to this  impossible challenge with a breakneck mixture of cool realism  and sheer loss of reality. In this situation, he is exclusively  banking on the one thing that he never had: the bonus of the  chancellor. This self-entreatment has been so breathtaking that  even his eternal critic, Heiner Geissler -- one of the few who  neither has anything to lose nor can immediately profit -- said  in sarcastic admiration and with a lot of chutzpah: "Only he  who is impressed by himself is able to impress others."    Le parti, c'est moi -- The party, that is I: It was in this  sense that Helmut Kohl so successfully reduced the CDU to his  own person, that now -- so much for his realism -- he is really  only able to rely on himself. The phalanx of secretaries  general whom he personally selected and dropped again is a  symbol for this process: from Biedenkopf to Geissler, Ruehe, and  Peter Hintze, who is absolutely unable to fulfill this task.  Yet the brutal realism of Helmut Kohl also includes the  understanding that none of those who the chancellor and party  chairman dropped, and whose fall he was observing with delight,  has so far had the guts to challenge him openly and efficiently  coordinated at a party congress.    This is why it was all to easy for Kohl to make a cynical  appeal in Hamburg when he said: Those who want can voice their  opposition at the party congress; but after it, you have to  obey. End of the debate! Yet in reality -- so much for his  loss of reality -- Kohl would have to rely on all of them  particularly in this very situation, and particularly in their  plurality and their spirit of contradiction: the Biedenkopfs,  Geisslers, Suessmuths, Albrechts, Spaeths....    Helmut Kohl as Baron von Muenchhausen: It is consistent  and it is pure autosuggestion into which he is fleeing. It is  particularly there where he appears to be so present that he has  become completely detached from reality. He is talking to  spoiled people -- as if it had not been he who spoiled them in  the last dozen years. He preaches the necessity to think along  different lines -- as if it had not been he who gave the voters  the illusion that things could remain the same even after  unification. Whenever he denounces the stubborn voters, the  inhabitants of the "collective leisure park," then it does not  require a lot of psychological understanding to recognize the  projections of a man who himself failed to understand the signs  of the time. This makes one think of Bert Brecht and ask  oneself whether it would not be better for the government to  elect a new people.    Realistically again, the chancellor follows the scent: It is  time for a change. And having lost his sense of reality once  more, he believes that the genuine chancellor of the change is  -- he himself. The whole thing is so absurd that it really  almost becomes impressive.    Reality does not stand a chance against such entreatments  for reality itself. Bad surveys are not taken seriously.  Indeed, they themselves are based on a high number of voters  who are still undecided -- who, in turn, are in their large  majority part of the potential of the CDU. Besides, all the old  parties have lost support. Therefore, they have to mobilize the  voters -- and to play foul. That Rau used to be Kohl's favorite  candidate for succeeding President Weizsaecker -- what does it  matter? It is reason enough to denigrate him now. That in the  Bundestag -- after all, reconciliation was the order of the day  at the time -- Kohl solemnly set out to follow the footsteps of  the Brandt/Scheel and Schmidt/Genscher governments in the  spheres of Ostpolitik and Germany policy -- who cares? Now one  has to divide the voters by using the word treason. Yet, how  does somebody intend to win the future with the wrong battles of  the past?    At the party congress, Kohl once more managed to win the  support of the delegates. Nothing else was to be expected.  Yet, through his strategy of self-entreatment he managed to do  better than expected. Still, to what extent can this rather  internal effect be successful? One senior warrior quoted the  old cliche: Without money it can never be as good as it is bad  with money. Still, as of now it is no longer just the  atmosphere that counts but the votes: Lower Saxony as a test  election in western Germany, the European election, Saxony  Anhalt as test election in eastern Germany -- all that is on the  agenda even before the summer recess.    Helmut Kohl is entering his final battle. Many things are  unique about this campaign. Apart from the temporary  personality of Kiesinger, no chancellor has been unseated in a  Bundestag election. Kohl is throwing himself into this combat  true to the nice slogan of the generation of '68: You do not  have any chance, so use it.</p>

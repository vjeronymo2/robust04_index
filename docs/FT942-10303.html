			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Berlusconi names cabinet to cut economic red tape Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister designate, yesterday announced a 25-member cabinet for the country's 53rd post-war government, which he has committed to deregulate the economy, and shake up and decentralise public administration. The formation of the cabinet took 11 days of difficult negotiations and comes nearly seven weeks after Mr Berlusconi's four-party Freedom Alliance won a landslide victory in the March 27-28 general elections. The presence of five ministers from the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance also marks an historic break with the party's long-standing political isolation. The government, composed of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi, the MSI and the small Christian Democratic Centre, will be sworn in today. However, it is still uncertain whether Mr Berlusconi will go to parliament with his programme to obtain a vote of confidence this week. Mr Berlusconi gave the main economic portfolio, the treasury ministry, to Mr Lamberto Dini, the number two at the Bank of Italy. Mr Dini is well known internationally, having worked with the International Monetary Fund, but he is a political novice and his move to the treasury raises questions about the existing treasury team as well as his replacement at the central bank. Mr Berlusconi decided not to scrap the budget and finance portfolios which have gone respectively to Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, a former accountant and League senator, and to Mr Giulio Tremonti, a tax expert. Mr Berlusconi was obliged to make some important last-minute changes. The most significant involved Mr Cesare Previti, who handles the legal affairs of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest empire. He was switched from the justice ministry to the defence ministry after objections from within the Freedom Alliance as well as from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The presence of Mr Previti in the justice ministry was considered likely to cause a conflict of interest at a time when magistrates are investigating various aspect of Fininvest activities. President Scalfaro himself took the unprecedented step of writing a curt letter to Mr Berlusconi reminding him of his duties in choosing ministers. The president also reminded Mr Berlusconi that foreign policy must take account of Italy's existing international obligations and alliances as well as support for European Union. This was seen as an implicit reference to Mr Berlusconi's choice of Mr Antonio Martino, his economic adviser, as foreign minister. Mr Martino, a Chicago-trained economist, is seen as a 'Euro-sceptic'. Safe economic team, Page 3</p>

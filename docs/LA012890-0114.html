			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKING THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF AIDS ORTHODOXY;  </P> <P> KAPOSI'S SARCOMA: TWO STUDIES OF THIS CONDITION POSE A QUESTION ONCE CONSIDERED  A HERESY: WHAT IF HIV IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE EPIDEMIC?  </P> <P> Last week a medical journal, the Lancet, disclosed in an article and letter to  the editor that Kaposi's sarcoma, the symptom most conspicuously identified  with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, may not in fact be caused by HIV, the  so-called AIDS virus.  </P> <P> The article, from the federal Centers for Disease Control, suggested that  Kaposi's sarcoma -- frequently called a cancer although that designation has  lately come into question -- may rather be caused by an "as yet unidentified  infectious agent transmitted mainly by sexual contact." Although findings  received modest coverage, they shake the foundations of accepted orthodoxy  about AIDS.  </P> <P> "It is the strangest twist in terms of medical news in the epidemic in years,"  says Randy Shilts, author of "And the Band Played On." "It calls into question  everything -- the existing paradigm for the epidemic, the direction of  research, treatment modalities and even the integrity of the blood supply."  </P> <P> Kaposi's sarcoma is said to afflict 15% of all AIDS patients. Yet in a series  of autopsy studies, pathologists report that the condition is almost universal  in those with AIDS, internally if not dermatologically. "We find the lesions  which are generally called KS in about 95% of AIDS patients," says Dr. George  Hensley, professor in the department of pathology at the University of Miami  Medical School, who oversaw the studies. This suggests a remarkably high  prevalence rate of a second unknown agent in AIDS patients. Until the agent is  identified and patients can be tested for it, it is impossible not to wonder  how many AIDS patients may also be infected with the agent -- and how many of  their other symptoms may derive from it rather than HIV.  </P> <P> The studies reported in the Lancet are not the first to suggest that prominent  clinical problems in AIDS may be due to something other than HIV. A lengthy  review last year in the journal Acta Neuropathologica argued that the central  nervous system damage in AIDS cannot currently be explained by HIV infection,  and that indeed "cytopathic infection of neural cells by HIV either does not  occur or is of little clinical significance." The primary neurological damage  may be due to a second unidentified infectious agent. We simply do not know.  </P> <P> The two reports also raise disturbing therapeutic issues. Many patients with  Kaposi's sarcoma are presumptively diagnosed as having AIDS -- without being  administered an HIV test -- and they are then put on AZT, a toxic anti-viral  drug and acknowledged carcinogen. Should this treatment, appropriate only to a  virus, prove irrelevant to Kaposi's sarcoma and perhaps other AIDS symptoms,  interesting liability issues arise. Treatment strategies, of course, will be  reevaluated.  </P> <P> Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta have offered  reassuring explanations for the new findings. Two epidemics must have started  simultaneously in the same populations, they contend, and HIV remains the  underlying culprit for everything except Kaposi's sarcoma. This unwieldy  hypothesis serves as a kind of damage control: Whatever is afflicting Kaposi's  sarcoma patients has nothing to do with AIDS, and everything else that  researchers have said about the role of HIV in the epidemic is still true.  </P> <P> One is driven to wonder whether the researchers might have been correct on the  point they have abandoned -- that Kaposi's sarcoma and all the other dismaying  symptoms of AIDS do indeed have the same cause -- but are wrong in the one that  they still cling to: that HIV is the cause of AIDS. To question this has been  denounced as heresy. But it was also once heresy to question HIV's role in  Kaposi's sarcoma.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The discrepancy in the figure of Mozambique Armed  Forces [FAM] troops is reaching alarming proportions.  Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] Chairman Pier Giorgio Segala feels  the problem can no longer be resolved at the CCF level and he  has submitted it to the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC].    MEDIAFAX has obtained two documents connected with this  matter: A memorandum from Segala to the CSC, dated 25 May 1994,  and a government reaction to this memorandum, dated 26 May 1994  and signed by Brigadier Joao Aleixo Malunga, head of the  government delegation to the CCF.    The issue in question is this: Has the government or has it  not hidden some of its troops? The memorandum from Segala  outlines:    -- On 5 May 1994, Minister Teodato Hunguana told the CSC  that  the government delegation to the CCF informed the CSC on 9  November 1992 that the government had 61,638 troops to be  confined and that it would provide later the number of  government troops in centers for nonconfined troops.    -- On 18 March 1993, Lieutenant Genearal Hama Thai  "presented  to the United Nations figures produced by the Defense Ministry's  Logistical Department" with a view to providing provisions for  the confined 61,638 FAM troops. Hama Thai stressed that the  61,638 troops do not include troops in centers for nonconfined  troops.    -- On 26 April 1993, the government signed "a memorandum of  understanding" with the World Food Program to provide food aid  to 62,000 troops in 29 assembly areas. The memorandum adds: In  November 1993 the government presented to the "CCF the first  figure of government troops in centers for nonconfined troops.  The figure was 14,849 troops.    -- Beginning December 1993, in daily reports, issued by the  Technical Unit of the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz], "it  is repeatedly stressed" that the government will confine 61,638  troops. Thus, until 20 April 1994, the correct figures  presented to Unomoz were: 61,638 troops for assembly areas and  14,849 troops for centers for nonconfined troops. "The  government did not object to these figures".    On 21 April 1994 the government informed the CCF that the  total number of troops in assembly areas and centers for  nonconfined troops is 64,118. Within 24 hours a total of 12,369  troops were missing.    "Since the figure of government troops in centers for  nonconfined troops had changed by only 369 troops, from 14,849  in November 1993 to 14,480 in April 1994, the new figure was  accepted, leaving a total of 12,000 troops missing."    After the issue was submitted to the CSC, it returned to the  CCF on 5 May 1994. Since then the CCF has held four meetings to  discuss the issue. "All these meetings were unfruitful," Segala  says in his letter to the UN's Aldo Ajello.    Segala's memorandum goes on to say:    "At the first CCF meeting on 5 May 1994, the head of the  government delegation explained the discrepancy of 12,000 men,  referring to difficulties in updating the figures of serving  troops during the period of war in a country facing serious  logistical problems. He said the figures of government troops  are being constantly reexamined. He said the specific reasons  for the discrepancy include the time gap between the event on  the field (for example the death of a soldier) and the time the  event is registered in different books kept by the Ministry of  Finance, the Defense Ministry's Logistic Department, and the FAM  Supreme Command; the tendency by camp commanders to inflate the  figures of troops under their command in order to obtain more  provisions for the troops; the tendency of some officers to  inflate the number of troops under their command in order to  pocket the salaries of nonexistent troops; and the practice of  not removing the names of demobilized troops from the salary  list until their military pensions have been fixed."    Segala's memorandum points out that if this discrepancy does  not only appear in relation to confinement and demobilization  processes, then similar discrepancies should be observed in the  total number of troops registered in the Ministries (of Finance  and Defense) in August 1992.    "A well-documented statement by the government that  discrepancies [words indistinct] to the figures presented for  assembly areas and demobilizaation would greatly help to calm  people's concerns that troops are being hidden or kept in  reserve."    Segala says in his memorandum that Brig. Malunga agreed "to  try to find out whether there is an original document proving  the transfer of government troops to the police force."    At the CCF meeting held on 13 May 1994 Malunga said the  issue  could not be resolved because relevant specialists were "out of  Maputo." The CCF met again on 23 May 1994. At that meeting,  Malunga refused the proposal that the government should prepare  a well-documented statement with the discrepancies, pointing out  that the problem was just a mere question of interpretation."    "In conclusion, Malunga said that the issue of whether or  not  the government was hiding troops would come to light at the end  of the demobilization process because it would be known whether  the government left any troops on the field."    The fourth CCF meeting scheduled for 24 May 1994 did not  take  place because of the absence of the Renamo representative.    Segala concludes his memorandum by saying: "I lament to  inform you that the CCF has exhausted all its possibilities for  resolving the matter. I am, therefore, forced to submit it to  the CSC for urgent attention".    On 26 May 1994 Brig. Malunga addressed a written protest to  Segala, demanding that the issue be returned to the CCF.    The government delegation to the CCF said Segala [words  indistinct] true contents of the discussions on the issue. The  protest letter describes the decision by Segala to submit the  issue to the CSC as not a "very dignified" decision.    As far as the government is concerned, Segala's role is  "exclusively" that of a CCF "moderator" and a "trustworthy  reporter" of what is taking place. "In the General Peace Accord  there is no room for unilateral actions and deductions by the  CCF chairman without, at the very least, obtaining a consensus  from the parties".    The government's protest letter says that by transferring  the  issue to the CSC, Segala created "serious doubts" about his  "real intentions." What is more, he did not wait for a reply  from the head of the Renamo delegation. "The real party  interested in this problem is not Renamo as we are constantly  made to understand."    "Segala's role in this particular case should not be to  heighten contradictions between the parties."    The letter goes on to say that the government delegation to  the CCF "is deeply astonished by the pressure, something  strange, applied in unison and concerted manner against the  government over discrepancies in the figure of its troops, as if  this was a problem that only affected the government."    The protest letter reiterates that the government "does not  have and it has never had any intention to hide troops."</p>

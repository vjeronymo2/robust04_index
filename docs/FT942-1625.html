			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / ICI picks outsider as chief executive Imperial Chemical Industries, the bulk chemicals company demerged from the old ICI a year ago, has underlined its break with the past by appointing an outsider as chief executive. Mr Charles Miller Smith, an accountant, will join ICI from the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever. A former finance director, he now runs its food operations in southern Europe. He will take over next April on the retirement of Sir Denys Henderson as chairman. Sir Denys will be succeeded by the present chief executive, Mr Ronnie Hampel. The appointment of an outsider to such a senior post in ICI is thought to be unprecedented. The finance director, Mr Colin Short, was brought in from the US oil company Chevron in 1990. However, Mr Miller Smith will be in day-to-day charge of ICI, as Mr Hampel's job as chairman will be part-time. In the old ICI, the tradition was for the top job to be contested by rival barons from the operating divisions. However, the demerger and retirements have largely swept away the old guard. Besides Sir Denys, Mr Hampel and Mr Short, the members of the slimmed-down executive board are all recent arrivals, and most are under 50. Mr Miller Smith, 54, is thought to have been an unsuccessful candidate last year for the chief executive's job at Barclays Bank, which went to Mr Martin Taylor of Courtaulds. In December he was pipped for the job of chairman elect at Unilever by Mr Niall Fitzgerald. His present job at Unilever involves running a business with a turnover of some Pounds 4bn, about half the size of ICI. ICI described Mr Miller Smith yesterday as 'somebody different' from most other ICI directors. However, there are points in common. He has worked in Unilever's speciality chemicals division and spent time abroad, in India and the Netherlands. Like Sir Denys and other ICI bosses, he is Scottish. He has also been a non-executive member of the ICI board for the past year. Nevertheless, the appointment is seen as signalling the company's desire to shake up its traditional culture. Mr Miller Smith might be expected to succeed Mr Hampel, 62, as chairman on his retirement in about three years' time. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Doron Sharm] </F>   [Excerpts] Yisra'el Peleg, the director general of the  Environment Ministry, met in Tunis with Tunisian Environment  Minister Mohamed Mehdi Mlika who promised to visit Israel in the  near future.    Peleg, who heads the Israeli delegation to the conference of  Mediterranean countries in Tunis, handed the Tunisian minister  an invitation to visit Israel from Environment Minister Yosi  Sarid. Minister Mlika hoped that his visit to Israel would be  possible as soon as Israel wrapped up the last details with the  Palestinians. "God willing, I will come to visit," Mlika said,  sending personal regards to Yosi Sarid. [passage omitted]    At the end of the second day of discussions, there was  disagreement between the Tunisians and the other delegations on  the establishment of a special committee that would promote  development projects independently of the Barcelona Treaty for  Environmental Protection. A proposal initiated by the the  Israeli delegation facilitated a compromise according to which  Tunis' recommendation to establish a Mediterranean committee for  sustainable development was accepted. The date for a discussion  of the proposal's details, however, will be scheduled at the  next conference in 1995.    At the end of the session, the Tunisian representative said  he appreciated Israel's contribution in breaking the impasse.</p>

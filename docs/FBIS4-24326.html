			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the Liberian Peace Council, Dr.  (George Boley), has been ordered to leave the BTC [Barclay  Training Center] Military Barracks which is the home of the  Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL]. The Ministry of National Defense  action comes in the wake of overwhelming citizens' demand to rid  Monrovia of rebel leaders.    In a press briefing yesterday, the assistant minister of  national defense for public affairs, Colonel Alfred D. Dennis,  told Information Minister Honorable Joe Mulbah that the  appropriate instructions for Dr. (Boley) to leave the BTC have  already been issued. Minister Dennis observed that the AFL has  no intention of harboring any rebel leader, a situation which,  he said, could undermine its neutrality as a national Army,    For his part, Information Minister Joe Mulbah said that he  was deeply gratified by Minister Dennis' assurance that the AFL  will remain neutral in the search for peace. He said the  Liberia National Transitional Government will continue to  support ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] in making Monrovia a city free of  arms.</p>

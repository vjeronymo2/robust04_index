Zhou Nan, a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC)  and director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, said  the British side has damaged Sino-british agreements on Hong  Kong and created confrontation, which shows that colonialists do  not change their nature.    Joining the Guangdong delegation in a group discussion  during  the ongoing NPC session, he said, the essence of the dispute on  Hong Kong's political system is whether people should act in  good faith rather than a question of democracy. In a deeper  sense, it is a dispute over sovereignty.    The British side, in the final analysis, intends to use its  power of control over Hong Kong in the next few years to  establish, under the pretext of accelerating democratic process,  its own administrative organization and impose it on the special  administrative region so that it can continue to monopolize the  political situation in Hong Kong and even turn Hong Kong into an  independent or semi-independent political entity.    He also refuted the advocation by some people of turning  Hong  Kong into "an international asset."    He said, China will resume complete exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong after 1997. Though Hong Kong will adopt a  capitalist system within China and continue to develop as an  international financial and trade center, this does not mean  that Hong Kong will become a so-called "international asset" or  something like the "international concession" of old Shanghai.    Zhou noted, the Preliminary Work Committee (PWC) for the  Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region faces "an arduous task and  important duty."    At present, PWC has entered a stage of substantial work. It  must unite with Hong Kong compatriots and make preparations for  the SAR, its first government and legislature so as to live up  to the expectations of the whole nation.    In future, membership of PWC will be further increased. More  Hong Kong public figures will be appointed as advisors on Hong  Kong affairs or on district affairs so as to solicit opinions  and suggestions from Hong Kong compatriots and lay down a sound  foundation for the implementation of the principles of "one  country, two systems" and "administration of Hong Kong by Hong  Kong people," he added.    He also said, most civil servants in Hong Kong have made  important contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.  "We believe the overwhelming majority of them love the country  and Hong Kong and support the Basic Law. We welcome them to  continue serving Hong Kong residents after 1997 and make new  contributions to Hong Kong's future development."    Zhou said that in 1993 the GDP of Hong Kong grew 5.5 percent  over the previous year. This substantial economic development  was attributable to increased ties and economic cooperation  between the mainland and Hong Kong.    He hopes the cooperation will develop to a new stage and  create greater benefits for both Hong Kong and the mainland this  year.</p>

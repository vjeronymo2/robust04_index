			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Life closes in The regulatory grip on the life insurance industry is tightening, and not before time. The Securities and Investments Board investigation into mis-selling of personal pensions should not, by itself, cause shareholders much worry. Even if SIB finds widespread malpractice, the life funds of the companies concerned should bear the bulk of the costs. But the investigation comes at an awkward moment. Full disclosure of commissions and expenses demanded by government threatens to drive investors towards other forms of saving, while the review of taxes on savings promised by the chancellor before the Budget poses an unknown threat. More immediately, the dull outlook for investment returns points to further reductions in bonus rates for policyholders. It might seem strange that bonuses should be cut again after such a strong performance from equities and bonds this year. But many life companies are still making amends for paying over-generous bonuses in the past. Windfall stock market gains in the 1980s are also dropping out of bonus calculations. With long-dated gilts now yielding less than 7 per cent, and UK equities only a shade over 3.5 per cent, the long-term prognosis for investment returns remains poor. Since profits are linked directly to bonuses paid out of the life fund, shareholders will also feel the pain. Companies which keep expenses down and sales rising - despite the new disclosure regime - will prosper even when investment returns are low. The rest will find their ability to raise profits and dividends increasingly constrained. The gulf between winners and losers in life insurance looks set to widen.</p>

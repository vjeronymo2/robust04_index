			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Choe Won-sok] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that the League of South Korean  Socialist Workers [Sanomaeng], which calls itself an independent  [chasaengjok] socialist group and advocates radical  revolutionism, which has caused the detention of many members,  will dissolve of its own volition soon.    According to a high-ranking intelligence official on 24  January, "Sanomaeng has announced it will begin legal activities  through advertisements in daily newspapers and interviews with  magazines. It has been learned that there is a move among those  who advocate the legitimate line to found a legitimate  progressive party."    However, the official said, "Considering the fact that at  the  end of last year over 20 people were arrested for attempting to  rebuild Sanomaeng in Cholla provinces, some remaining forces may  insist on keeping the original Sanomaeng."    Since its foundation in November 1989, Sanomaeng, which  claimed to be "independent Leninist," has evoked controversy in  and outside activist groups by founding a clandestine party and  advocating the line for reforming the political system through  revolution. Its activities were actually suspended after the  arrest of its executive members including Pak No-hae and Paek  Tae-ung.</p>

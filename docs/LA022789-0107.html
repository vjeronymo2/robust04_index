			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'JUSTICE HAS PAID OFF,' BOGGS SAYS OF EX-LOVER  </P> <P> Wade Boggs, almost as confident now in the judicial system as he is at the  plate, said today that "justice has paid off" in a decision throwing out a  major section of his former girlfriend's lawsuit.  </P> <P> "This is a landmark decision for me," Boggs said. "I'm in from the ocean and  headed toward port. . . . It was just a matter of time.  </P> <P> "I did it the right way. I went through the legal system. I've said all along  that it would come out in my favor."  </P> <P> Over the weekend, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana threw out a key  part of Margo Adams' $12-million lawsuit against Boggs, ruling she cannot sue  for emotional distress.  </P> <P> With the decision, Adams, of Costa Mesa, cannot seek $11.5 million for pain she  contended Boggs caused her by allegedly accusing her of extortion in an FBI  interview, Boggs' lawyer, Jennifer King, said.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy with the decision," Boggs said before joining teammates for the  daily practice at Chain O'Lakes Park. "I'm pleased with the way that it's gone  through the judicial system. It shows that there's justice, that the system  works."  </P> <P> Adams filed the $12-million suit for breach of oral contract after her  four-year relationship with Boggs. The Boston Red Sox All-Star third baseman,  who is married with two children, has admitted the affair.  </P> <P> "We are extremely happy with this decision," King said. "The part of the  lawsuit they had hoped to get the most amount of money for is now gone."  </P> <P> In its decision, made public Saturday, the appellate court ruled that the  emotional distress claim was groundless because Boggs' alleged statements to  FBI agents constituted privileged information.  </P></p>

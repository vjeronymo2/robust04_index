			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by U.K: "Textile Exporters Are Losing the Battle </F> With the Competition: Quotas for the Taking"]    [Text] "The competitiveness of our textile products is  falling. Cheaper products from the East Asia--and more and more  frequently from Ukraine, Belarus, and the Balkan countries--are  pushing our products out of the European Union (EU) markets,"  Waldemar Markuszewski, deputy director of the department of  commodity sales and tariff policy regulation in the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Cooperation, said to NOWA EUROPA.    Some types of textile products are included in the so-called  sensitive commodities group. The EC countries, as well as the  United States, Canada, and Norway, limit their export by  employing quotas.    A large part of the quotas allocated to us in an interim  agreement with EC remains unused. The ministry expects that this  year will be better than last year.    The annual reduction in duties on Polish textiles should  help  to make this possible. Furthermore, the size of the quota itself  is being increased 2-3 percent.    Our products are no longer as competitive as they were a  year  or two ago due to increased labor costs, although they are still  lower than in the West. They lose out to the still-cheaper  textiles from East Asia and the products from the Central and  East European countries--e.g., Ukraine, Belarus, and Latvia.    Polish producers do not always know how to meet the  requirements of the Western market, and they lack money for  promotion. The old foreign trade organizations offices were  either bankrupted or underwent transformation, and the companies  were not always able to develop new connections with Western  traders in time. The competition is great, and our firms find it  difficult to meet it, especially because not every company can  fill large orders. But there are Polish factories that have an  established reputation on the foreign markets and steady  customers in the EC countries and the United States.    Textile quotas to the United States, Canada, and Norway are  also being only partially used.    Textiles are an important item in our trade and constitute  almost 13.5 percent of total exports. Most of our exports are to  Germany, indicating that our customers there know the Polish  market well. This export makes up 18 percent of our export to  the EU. We export the least to Spain and Portugal, whose markets  are our competitors in deliveries to EC markets.    Only 18 groups of texile commodities are subject to quotas.  We sell the remainder, such as blankets, woolen fabrics, tents,  ladies' blouses, and work clothes, without limitations.

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (2): A certain confidence - The start of EC entry negotiations and the challenges posed by changes in eastern Europe make this a milestone year for Austria. Prosperity and stability continue, but there are signs of economic slowdown CONFIDENCE may be in rather short supply in most of Europe these days, but Austria is full of it. The country's economy remains relatively robust, its renewed ties with eastern Europe are proving more profitable than expected, its handling of the crisis next door in the Balkans has been sensitive and its creaking political structure looks set for an overhaul. 'Growth has been slowing down,' says Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian National Bank. 'But I do not see even a soft landing. I think we can steer safely away from the peaks and trees.' The country certainly steered clear of last month's turmoil in European currency markets, thanks mainly to its policy of pegging the schilling to the D-mark. And it appears that the economy will grow at 2.5 per cent this year, and about 3 per cent next year, after 3 per cent last year. Perhaps the one significant obstacle is the turmoil over the future of the European Community. Austria, which applied to join the EC three years ago, was hoping that formal negotiations on this would start early next year. In the wake of the debacle over the Maastricht treaty and the breakdown of the European monetary system, it is no longer clear when negotiations can begin or where they will go. A long needed political renewal was signalled in June with the unexpected election of Mr Thomas Klestil, a former diplomat, as the country's new president. The election itself was a welcome milestone, at last bringing to an end the sorry term of Mr Kurt Waldheim, the former United Nations secretary general. Questions about Mr Waldheim's war record made it impossible for him to carry out his largely ceremonial role, and paralysis in the political system made it impossible to get rid of him. But the fact that Mr Klestil - a little known figure with no political experience - was elected confirmed other indications of significant changes in Austrians' political behaviour. In the first ballot in April, Mr Klestil was placed a surprisingly strong second among four candidates. He then romped home in the run-off against the Democratic Socialist favourite, Mr Rudolf Streicher, the former transport minister, selected by Mr Franz Vranitzky, the Chancellor. Austria's political scene in the post-war period has been characterised by a self-serving sharing of power between the conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP) and the Democratic Socialist party (SPO). Voter loyalty was assured by a sharing of patronage, extending throughout the public service - it was supposed to be the socialists' turn this year to pick the president - and the huge nationalised industries. Now, even though the patronage system lives on, voters apparently no longer feel bound by it. 'Austrian voters have become more flexible,' says Mr Jorg Haider, the controversial leader of the Austrian Freedom Party (FPO). 'From now on, any result is possible in an election.' Mr Haider, a self-professed populist who has achieved notoriety both at home and abroad for expressing right wing views, has recognised that the hypocrisy of the so-called black-red coalition is a popular theme with voters, and he jumps on every opportunity to attack it. This year, his main target has been the central bank, long a highly paid retreat for worthies from both main parties. The SPO benefits additionally, by owning 5 per cent of the bank's shares. Mrs Schaumayer, whose own salary of more than ASch5m a year (even after a voluntary 30 per cent cut) has figured prominently in Mr Haider's attacks, grits her teeth at the mention of his name. 'Salary levels are high, and they should be better in line with the banking business,' she admits, but she says that reforms had begun before Mr Haider began shouting. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter, Mr Haider has gained grudging approval, even from those who would never think of voting for him, for bringing attention to this and other examples of privilege. Many people think he will be the one actually to break the red-black mould. His own view is that he could become chancellor after the 1998 election. Mr Haider has also drawn attention to himself for apparently changing his view on Austria's entry into the European Community. From having been an unconditional supporter of entry, he suddenly announced in late August that it was a bad idea. Cornered on this apparent flip-flop, he said he was still in favour but would impose some conditions. Pressed further, he said the problems were on the Austrian side, not the EC side. Critics saw it as a typical attempt by the Freedom Party leader to capitalise on a current trend - in this case, towards increasing doubt about the EC among Austrian voters, and opponents have used this to claim that Mr Haider is an unreliable opportunist. Mr Vranitzky says Mr Haider is becoming 'more and more unpredictable,' and suggests that he may even be losing his hold over his party. The EC has lost credibility in Austria in the past year as a result of its dithering over the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. According to one recent poll, little more than a third of Austrians saw the EC as a good thing. Austrian leaders, on the other hand, believe that the Yugoslav crisis has shown clearly the need for more integration of European foreign policy along the lines proposed in the Maastricht treaty. Austrians are quietly proud of their own handling of the Yugoslav crisis, having taken in far more refugees per capita than any other western European country. To date there has been no sign of the severe social strains that appeared in Germany in recent months. About three quarters of the refugees are staying in private homes, so there is no provocative concentration of them. Austrian diplomats despair of any early settlement of the conflict, although they feel the UN is on the right path following the London conference last month. They are now spending considerable effort trying to discourage hotheads in other neighbouring eastern European countries from resorting to force. Mr Ernst Sucharipa, head of the political section in the foreign ministry, says: 'We point out to them that if they want to join the Council of Europe, then certain standards on minority rights have to be observed.' Austria's rapidly growing trade with eastern Europe remains one of the brightest spots in its remarkably resilient economy. This trade now accounts for 11 per cent of gross domestic product compared with only 8 per cent before Comecon collapsed, and reflects the ease with which Austrian businessmen can move in the countries of the former Austro-Hungarian empire. Still, the economy is slowing down, and with a general election now less than two years away, some of the more politically sensitive items on the government's agenda may fall by the wayside. Some reform of the country's capital markets is on the way, notably to clamp down on insider trading and perhaps to encourage more companies to come to the stock market. But the government's ambitious privatisation programme is in trouble, partly because of the depressed state of the stock market, but also because of huge losses at Austrian Industries, the main candidate for privatisation. It all points to a rather choppy period in Austrian public life in the run-up to the next national elections in 1994 but, as Mrs Schaumayer might say, the country will undoubtedly continue to avoid any really dangerous rocks or trees.</p>

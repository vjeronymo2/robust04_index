			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIVALRIES ARE ALL IN FUN FOR KCRW FUND-RAISER  </P> <P> Usually, the only common ground for Los Angeles Dodger Tim Belcher and  California Angel Kirk McCaskill is the pitcher's mound.  </P> <P> But the two baseball players can be found making a pitch for the same station  in a 60-second spot for Santa Monica's KCRW-FM (89.9) that began airing  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Other traditional rivals will also be speaking in unison for the Santa Monica  College-based station as KCRW culminates a decade-long climb to become the  second most-listened-to public station in the area. The station hopes to raise  $300,000 from its audience with its two-month-long fund-raiser, "Summer Sign  Up."  </P> <P> KCRW's annual budget is about $2.5 million, making it one of the 10 largest  budgets in public radio in the country, according to spokeswoman Sarah A.  Spitz. Audience dollars are key, so fund-raising is an important part of the  station's work, she said. "We're relentless in our fund-raising efforts," Spitz  said.  </P> <P> The station has broken its own fund-raising records for three straight years,  and during its primary annual fund-raiser in February, the station raised a  record $860,000.  </P> <P> The radio station that prides itself on its innovative programming also strives  to be innovative in its fund raising.  </P> <P> KCRW will offer a trip to Puerto Rico this summer, with the winner drawn from  those who pledge and from station members.  </P> <P> Last year, the station offered to all supporters who pledged $85 a limousine  tour of grave sites of the area's famous dead. They were given a 2 1/2-hour  tour of "the stars' last stops," Spitz said. The gimmick, provided by a local  company, helped the station garner $785,000 for the campaign.  </P> <P> In the past, KCRW has also offered classes in beer brewing and tasting,  courtesy of Father's Office pub in Santa Monica, and flight lessons, courtesy  of Gunnell Aviation in Santa Monica. Also, during its winter fund-raisers, the  station receives more than 600 gift certificates from local businesses to pass  on as enticements for donations.  </P> <P> Station officials said this summer's foes-in-agreement pitches were adopted  from KQED public radio in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono and Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane also make a  pitch for the station, despite clashing on the virtues of their respective  cities.  </P> <P> "When you're looking for a vacation spot, there's no place as perfect as Palm  Springs. . . . " Bono says.  </P> <P> Zane begs to differ. "I'll take our ocean breezes over your desert sun any  day," he says.  </P> <P> And then the dialogue gets personal. "Sonny, are you getting paid for this  radio spot?" Zane asks.  </P> <P> "Nope, I'm doing it pro bono."  </P> <P> But the two agree on the virtues of the station's lauded mix of radio news,  drama and alternative music.  </P> <P> Others planning to promote the fund-raiser include Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira  Reiner and Los Angeles County Public Defender Wilbur F. Littlefield, sports  editors from UCLA's Daily Bruin and USC's Daily Trojan newspapers,  representatives of Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream and Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream  ("They melt our hearts," one station official said), representatives of Toyota  and Nissan car distributors and the presidents of Unocal Corp. and Atlantic  Richfield Co.  </P> <P> Station officials say the fund-raising efforts have helped KCRW, whose  listening audience ranks among the top four nationwide in size, become one of  the top audience-supported public radio stations in the country. Listener  dollars contribute to almost 75% of the station's budget. The rest of KCRW's  funding comes from government grants and corporate donations.  </P> <P> At cross-town rival KUSC-FM (91.5), the station with the largest public radio  audience in the country, listener donations make up 55% of its budget, station  officials said. At KQED in San Francisco, whose listening audience ranks in the  top five nationwide, listener donations contribute to one-third of its budget,  a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> One local station that beats KCRW for audience support -- although for fewer  dollars -- is the No. 3 public-radio station in the area, KPFK-FM (90.7). Of  its $850,000 in annual revenue, more than 80% is from listeners. The station  does not accept corporate donations, said KPFK business manager Mary Fowler.  </P> <P> Spitz attributes much of KCRW's fund-raising success to local businesses,  which, in return for giving goods and services, get a short on-air thank you.  "We couldn't do a subscription drive without the businesses that give us stuff  -- no jive," Spitz said.  </P> <P> The station also prides itself on having one of the lowest basic membership  fees in the nation. Membership fees are minimum donations that public radio  outlets ask in return for program guides and other mailings. The basic fee at  KCRW is $25. At KUSC, KQED in San Francisco and WGBH in Boston, the basic fee  is $35.  </P> <P> Ironically, KCRW has the most educated, upscale audience of any station in  Southern California, according to the Florida-based Birch/Scharborough Research  Corp. The research firm's winter demographics report shows that more than half  of KCRW's audience has a family income of more than $50,000 a year. Almost 73%  of the station's audience hold four-year or advanced college degrees.  </P> <P> And, the audience is decidedly baby boomer, with an average age range of 25 to  39, Spitz said. "They are an engaged, intelligent, upscale and involved  audience," she said.  </P> <P> The station's lauded programming doesn't hurt either. Its airing of National  Public Radio's extensive news program, "All Things Considered," gives KCRW one  of the eight-largest audiences of all stations in the area, AM or FM, during  the highly competitive 5 p.m. drive-time hour, according to a  Birch/Scharborough Research Corp. study. And kudos for programming include  1989's best non-commercial radio station award, given by the College Media  Journal, a nationally distributed media trade publication, and 1986's best  radio station award by Los Angeles magazine.  </P> <P> KCRW started in 1946 as a radio-skills training program at Santa Monica High  School for local servicemen returning from World War II. It evolved to serve  the community and moved to the campus of Santa Monica College, where, under the  guidance of general manager Ruth Hirschman in 1978, it expanded to serve much  of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Hirschman, who is credited for much of KCRW's success, has no grand design for  the station's future, but says she sees radio as an experiment.  </P> <P> "We don't know what we'll be like in the 1990s except that we'll change," she  said.  </P> <P> Stay tuned.  </P></p>

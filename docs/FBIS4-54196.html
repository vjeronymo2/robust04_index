			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- The No. 2 opposition party,  the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], adopted a  draft action plan Thursday [26 May] urging the cabinet of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata to resign en masse and to establish a new  coalition government.    The draft follows recent remarks by SDPJ Secretary General  Wataru Kubo, who urged the Hata cabinet to resign immediately  after the fiscal 1994 state budget bills pass the Diet and  hinted that the party may rejoin the ruling coalition if the  premier accepts his request.    The party will officially approve the action plan at its  decision-making central committee session on May 28 and 29, the  officials said.    The action program said if Hata does not step down, and the  administration's policies deviate from the spirit of the  war-renouncing constitution and go against the people's will,  the SDPJ will deal with the situation through a "serious  decision," hinting at tabling a no-confidence motion against the  cabinet.    Defeat on such a motion would leave the premier with a  choice  of either resigning or calling a snap general election for the  House of Representatives.    The plan rules out an alliance with the largest opposition  party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), saying the SDPJ will  not take any actions that may enable the LDP to regain power.    The action program aims at forming a new coalition led by  "social democratic and liberal" forces.    The policy plan was approved by the party's leadership body,  the central executive committee on Thursday.    The action program cites "restoration of faith and trust  among parties" as conditions for the SDPJ to return to the  ruling coalition. The SDPJ quit the coalition late last month  in protest against the establishment of a large parliamentary  group excluding it.    The passage refers to a feud over the new Diet bloc created  by the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party and  the Democratic Socialist Party.    The new bloc angered the SDPJ and resulted in their  secession  from the coalition, leaving Hata with Japan's first minority  government in four decades.    The action plan also says Japan could join United Nations  forces in a future disarmed world, on condition that they stand  independent from control of other nations.    Regarding elections, the plan says the next general election  should be held under a new electoral system, a combination of  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, that  became law in January.    However, the plan does not rule out the possibility that the  current multiseat constituency system could be maintained for  the next election.    The new system requires the enactment of a bill to redraw  the  electoral map, toward which the SDPJ will do its best, the  action program said.</p>

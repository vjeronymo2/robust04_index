			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Books: New life for classic tale - FT Children's Book of the Month BLACK SHIPS BEFORE TROY: THE STORY OF THE ILIAD by Rosemary Sutcliff, illustrated by Alan Lee Frances Lincoln Pounds 12.99, 128 pages ROSEMARY Sutcliff, one of the greatest authors of historical fiction for children in the 20th century, died at the age of 72 in June 1992. The daughter of a naval officer, she had a peripatetic childhood. She suffered throughout her life from a condition known as Still's Disease which confined her to a wheelchair for much of her time. Of her disabilities she once wrote, touchingly: 'There's a great loneliness about having any kind of handicap in a world which in general doesn't, however much you get to the stage where neither you nor anybody else notices. You tend to create somebody on your side of the barrier who will talk your own language.' She had little formal education, but was a voracious reader, being especially fond of history, legend and myth - subject areas that she would make her own in later life. Her first wish was to be an artist, but her disabilities made it impossible for her to work on large canvases and so she took to writing instead, publishing her first book, a rather unsatisfactory prose version of the tales of Robin Hood, in 1950. Many important novels followed: the great Roman cycle, which is seen to its best effect in The Eagle of the Ninth (1954), and many re-tellings of traditional stories in modern versions. Her novels were often prefaced by fascinating 'Historical Notes', which seemed to summarise her rather quirkish approach to historical research. 'So in The Mark of the Horse Lord I have written of Caledanes and Dalriads, and not of Picts and Scots, but it comes to much the same thing in the end.' Earlier this year she published The Minstrel and the Dragon Pup (Walker Books, Pounds 9.99), which marked an unusual development. Set in a rather hazy Middle Ages, it was both a picture book text (her first, in collaboration with the illustrator Emma Chichester Clark) and as much a fantasy as a gobbet of historical narrative. Her last two works to be published, versions of the Iliad and the Odyssey (promised in 1995), are much more characteristic of the general drift of her fictional themes: the testing of the warrior hero; the clash of light and dark; the overriding importance to a culture of the symbolic objects that seem to embody its very reason for existence. As for Dryden and Pope before her, Sutcliff's Iliad was not the culmination of a lifelong passion but an imaginative response to a commission from a publisher. Though tales from classical myths did not figure in the earliest examples of children's literature that have come down to us, there were some sensible abridgements of the Iliad and the Odyssey for children in circulation at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. Since the 1940s, the most widely available translation of the Odyssey in English has been EV Rieu's; and two years ago, Christopher Logue's spirited version of books one to four of the Iliad was published by Faber. Logue gave the Iliad a mighty pummelling. His version, boldly incongruous, packed with movable incidents, audaciously anachronistic, virtually reduced Homer's epic to a sequence of marvellous storyboards. But it also demonstrated just how resilient and concentrated a story the Iliad is - so much more manageable in plot, themes and characterisation than the elegiacally diffuse Odyssey. The Iliad demands not so much imaginative elaboration as ingenious restraint  -and Rosemary Sutcliff has reached much the same conclusion in her version. Like Logue, she shows us a Greek nation which seems to have developed a mighty contempt for anything other than the culture of war - an attitude which includes holding death itself in disdain. Her most memorable achievement has been to disentangle some of the more difficult elements of plot and characterisation so that the individual players in the drama shine through with a stark and bloody clarity. Alan Lee's illustrations, as extravagant in their heroic aggrandisement as any sequence of Victorian narrative paintings, match the text perfectly - the clash of metal on metal; the sweat of heaving bodies; the mists of morning rising serenely over scenes of unimaginable carnage. The book's principal failing is that the dialogue, as often before in Sutcliff, sounds awkward at times, wordily encumbered, unlike even the heightened human speech of those who walked like gods. Perhaps this was the ultimate price that she paid for her own inability to move freely among other human beings. Otherwise, as ever, she remains robust and intellectually challenging, her prose perfectly pitched to the grievous undoing of two fabulously flawed nations.</p>

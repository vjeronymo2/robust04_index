			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buy-back pushes RECs up The regional electricity companies (RECs) saw their share prices spike higher as Seeboard became the first since the recent regulatory review to buy back its own equity. The purchase of 2m shares at 425p in order to distribute part of its cash surplus to shareholders represented less than one per cent of the company's equity. It was a fragment of the stake that Seeboard can reclaim - it has permission to buy back 10 per cent or 25m shares - but served as a timely reminder of what one analyst described as the 'tiny window of opportunity' that the RECs have. Their closed seasons begin at the end of September and when they finally report they will be inhibited by their involvement with the flotation of the National Grid. This will take them through to the next closed season and effectively tie their hands until next summer. Mr Kevin Lapwood, of Smith New Court said: 'This is a dream ticket until the end of September.' He believes prices could rise by 15 per cent in the short term. Hoare Govett take a more cautious stance but still believes share prices could rise by a further 7 per cent. Profit taking towards the end of the day saw some of the more spectacular rises whittled back but Seeboard closed 17 higher at 437p while Southern Electric rose 25 to 792p and Eastern Electricity, which also experienced very active turnover in traded options, added 20 at 822p. The gains are likely to dampen down some of the takeover speculation that has surrounded the sector since Goldman Sachs bought a block of 7.7m shares, some 2.99 per cent stake in Eastern, the sector leader.</p>

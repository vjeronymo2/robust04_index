			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / British Gas set for clash over pricing BRITISH GAS is heading for a row with its regulator over its plan to raise the price it charges rivals to transport gas through its pipeline. The rises are shown in a document published by the company today which suggests changes that would simplify its pricing structure for gas transportation. British Gas is inviting comment before issuing a price list in August. But Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the industry regulator, said yesterday: 'The pipeline business is a low or no-risk business and there is no reason for its rate of return to be higher than the current level, and maybe that's even too high.' British Gas is currently allowed by the regulator to make a 4.5 per cent return on its gas transport business. Prices for transporting gas are likely to rise even if British Gas is prevented from raising its rate of return on the business. That is because British Gas has previously not tried to make a 4.5 per cent return across all of its price bands. The new British Gas structure would simplify pricing by evening out the differences in prices charged across the country and unifying them in a price schedule. Under the present system, shippers must ask for an individual quotation for delivering gas to one particular site. The proposals for a new pricing structure are in response to demands by the Office of Fair Trading that British Gas hive off its transportation unit into a separate subsidiary.</p>

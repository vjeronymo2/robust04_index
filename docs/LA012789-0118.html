			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREMAN WINS AGAIN; DOCTORS TAKE PRYOR OFF CARD BECAUSE OF DAMAGED EYE  </P> <P> Former heavyweight champion George Foreman, 40, stopped Mark Young at 1:47 of  the seventh round Thursday night for his 15th consecutive victory since ending  a 10-year retirement.  </P> <P> Foreman, who weighed 253 pounds, improved his record to 60-2 with 57 knockouts.  </P> <P> Former junior welterweight champion Aaron Pryor, 33, attempting a third  comeback, was taken off the card after doctors determined that his left eye was  too badly damaged to allow him to fight Rick Kaiser. Dr. Robert Vanderlinde  said Pryor has at least a very dense cataract and maybe a detached retina.  </P></p>

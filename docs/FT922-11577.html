			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / ICI and Du Pont to swap nylon and acrylic interests IMPERIAL Chemical Industries of the UK and Du Pont, the US company, yesterday said they were swapping their worldwide nylon and acrylics businesses after two years of negotiations. ICI will also receive an estimated Pounds 250m in cash. A final figure will be agreed once the two companies have examined the businesses in more detail. The deal, which has to be cleared by the European Commission, would make Du Pont the largest manufacturer of nylon in Europe. The group would control 25 per cent of world and European markets, according to Mr David Williamson, Du Pont's European president. The company would also supply about a third of all nylon to the European carpet industry. ICI would become the world's largest producer of acrylics, an area which the company has defined as one of its core businesses. The enlarged unit would have annual sales of more than Pounds 500m a year. Mr Williamson warned: 'Europe must not kill its textile industry by fragmenting and weakening its fibre suppliers. The European industry needs someone who will invest. At the moment all the growth is going to Asia.' Both Mr Williamson and Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, said they were optimistic the deal would be cleared by the regulatory authorities in both Europe and the US. If the move is given the go-ahead it should be completed by the end of the year. Du Pont will acquire a business with sales of about Pounds 600m a year and take responsibility for 6,100 employees in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. The operations incurred a loss last year, but are now breaking even, according to Sir Denys. Mr Williamson was hopeful about the future of the ICI plants. Du Pont planned to invest Dollars 8bn in nylon fibres over the next decade, and the former ICI sites would benefit from that. He said the company had no plans to rationalise the operations and denied there was a problem of over-capacity in Europe. Sir Denys said the deal was positive news for both companies. It played to the strengths of each and would allow them to focus resources on their core businesses. ICI has made two acquisitions in the US acrylics sector during the past three years. The company is doubling capacity in Taiwan and the UK. Du Pont's acrylic businesses, which had a turnover of about Pounds 160m last year, make monomers - raw materials for acrylic - resins and acrylic sheets. The business is almost entirely in the US, where ICI previously had little presence. Du Pont is keeping its Corian acrylic business which supplies materials for kitchen and bathroom fittings. ICI has not sold Du Pont its polyester plant in Zaragoza, Spain. The company said it would like to sell the business. However, if the local authorities and Spanish government helped, the business could be maintained within ICI.

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 10 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Eduardo Sancho,  one of the eight leaders of the former Salvadoran guerrilla  organization Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN),  today rejected the National Council's decision to separate them  from their posts in the organization.    Sancho -- former commander "Ferman Cienfuegos" -- said at a  news conference that "we do not accept the decision of the  National Council to suspend the members of the ERP [People's  Revitalizing Expression] and RN [National Resistance] from the  Political Commission because that is the first step toward a  permanent expulsion."    Shafik Handal, coordinator general of the FMLN, made the  announcement following a prolonged meeting of the FMLN National  Council. Representatives of the ERP and the RN did not attend  the meeting which ended early this morning.    Seven [as received] ERP and RN members voted for deputy  Gloria Salguero -- of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance  (Arena) -- for president of the new Legislative Assembly during  the installation ceremony on 1 May. In return, the ERP's Ana  Guadalupe Martinez and the RN's [Eduardo] Sancho were elected  vice president and secretary, respectively, with the support of  39 deputies of the right wing Arena.    Sancho declared that the other three factions of the FMLN --  the Farabundo Marti People's Liberation Forces (FPL), the  Communist Party of El Salvador (PCES), and the Revolutionary  Party of Central American Workers (PRTC) -- "are not yet  democratic, and that is the honest truth." He added: "We reject  and do not accept this measure, and we do not view it as a  decision," and he stressed "we still belong to the FMLN."    The document prepared this morning by the council points out  that its members decided to "suspend all of these companeros  from posts assigned to them by the National Council," and asks  the RN and the ERP to "correct the behavior that has given rise  to this situation and to propose replacements for approval by  the National Council."    From another quarter, Walter Araujo, deputy of the ruling  ARENA, said that independent of the internal problems of the  FMLN, his party will seek "reconciliation in order to gain the  support of 84 deputies for the bills, initiatives, and  agreements to seek greater unity. The FMLN's problem does not  involve the other political parties: it is very much their own  problem," Araujo declared.</p>

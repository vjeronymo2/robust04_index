			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Not-so-big bang in Tokyo - New broking rules take effect today THE pre-publicity in the late 1980s had heralded today as Japan's 'big bang': the wall between brokers and bankers was to be torn down, and financial deregulation would bring tough competition and rich opportunities. Instead, today's 'bang' in the Japanese financial system will be barely audible - though it is likely eventually to have widespread repercussions. A Financial System Reform Law, applying from today, will slowly dismantle the barriers between different types of financial institution, thereby increasing the pressure on inefficient institutions. The limited changes that take effect today are partly a product of the times. Reform was conceived when Tokyo stock prices were surging and there seemed to be ample profits for all. But legislation has come after three years of falling prices, leaving most brokers with losses and many banks with bad loans. It is also the Japanese way to take change slowly, easing institutions into new areas and attempting to keep existing players content. The legislation may be important, but the ministry of finance never allows itself to be rushed on such matters. Only long-term credit banks, such as the Industrial Bank of Japan, are now allowed in the securities markets, and even then only to underwrite and deal in bonds; they still have no right to handle stocks or even deal in equity-linked bonds. Commercial banks, such as Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Mitsubishi Bank, must wait another year - perhaps longer - for these limited privileges, which may be reviewed, the finance ministry says, in 'two to three years'. Meanwhile, brokers are now allowed into trust banking. The four leading houses - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities, and Yamaichi Securities - have plans for new subsidiaries, which are expected gradually to be given greater freedoms by the ministry. But there will no quick profits for bankers or brokers, though the ministry insists that the new subsidiaries should be making a profit after three years. One banker going through the motions of establishing a new operation said that, given the choice, the company would like to delay the opening of its new subsidiary. 'Now is really not the best time for us to be doing this. We are limited in what we can do, and will not make money, but we can't afford to offend the ministry. If we had said we had decided to wait a year, they could have made life difficult for us,' the banker said. Institutions are expected to make formal applications to the ministry in the next few weeks, providing details of capital, the identity of executives, and branch plans. In May, or perhaps June, the ministry will allow the subsidiaries to open.</p>

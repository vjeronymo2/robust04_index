			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 13. Subsection 942.7004 is revised at paragraph (a) to incorporate the results of the interagency agreements between the Office of Procurement and Assistance Management and DCAA and HHS. References to the DOE IG are deleted. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) are deleted as they describe internal operating procedures that, in large part, are no longer valid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Subsection 951.7000 is revised to delete the reference to outdated General Services Administration (GSA) Bulletin A&hyph;95. The reference to the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMRs) is sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Subsection 951.7001 is revised to delete the reference to outdated GSA Bulletin A&hyph;95 in the introductory paragraph. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are deleted as they duplicate information contained in clause 952.251&hyph;70.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Subsection 952.251&hyph;70 is amended to correct a referenced citation at paragraph (a) from ``Property Management Regulation (FPMR), Temporary Regulation A&hyph;30'' to ``Travel Regulation (FTR), Part 301&hyph;15, Travel Management Programs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. The authority citation for part 970 is restated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Subsection 970.3001&hyph;1 is revised to reflect the relocation of the CAS, within the FAR, from part 30 to appendix B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Subsection 970.3001&hyph;2 is revised to correct the cross reference from ``970.3102&hyph;10'' to ``970.3102&hyph;3.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. Subsection 970.3102&hyph;17 is amended by revising paragraph (c)(2)(i) and adding new paragraphs (c)(6) and (c)(7). In (c)(2)(i), line 1, the letter ``s'' is deleted from the word ``Regulations'' to reflect the new title. New subparagraph (c)(6) is added to reflect changes in FAR 31.205&hyph;46, ``Travel costs'' as a result of FAC 90&hyph;7 which provided for downward adjustments to the maximum per diem rates when no lodging costs are incurred or on partial travel days. A new paragraph (c)(7) is added which refers to the incorporation of the Public Law 100&hyph;679 requirements in 970.5204&hyph;13 and 970.5204&hyph;14. Public Law 100&hyph;679, which amended the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, states that, for State and nonprofit institutions performing federally sponsored research, travel costs shall be considered reasonable and allowable only to the extent that such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the respective institution in its regular operations as a result of an institutional policy. In the absence of institutional policies, rates and amounts shall be determined by either subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code, or by the General Services Administration, or the President, or his designee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. Subsection 970.5204&hyph;13 is amended by revising paragraph (e)(35) to add a ``NOTE'' directing the Contracting Officer to use the alternate clause for contracts with State and nonprofit institutions. The ``NOTE'' reflects that, pursuant to Public Law 100&hyph;679, which amended the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, travel costs of State and nonprofit institutions performing federally sponsored research shall be considered reasonable and allowable only to the extent that such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the respective institution in its regular operations as a result of an institutional policy. In the absence of institutional policies, rates and amounts shall be determined by either subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code, or by the General Services Administration, or the President, or his designee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. Subsection 970.5204&hyph;14 is amended by revising paragraph (e)(33) to add a ``NOTE'' directing the Contracting Officer to use the alternate clause for contracts with State and nonprofit institutions. The ``Note'' reflects that, pursuant to Public Law 100&hyph;679, which amended the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, travel costs of State and nonprofit institutions performing federally sponsored research shall be considered reasonable and allowable only to the extent that such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the respective institution in its regular operations as a result of an institutional policy. In the absence of institutional policies, rates and amounts shall be determined by either subchapter I of Chapter 57 of Title 5, United States Code, or by the General Services Administration, or the President, or his designee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. Subsection 970.7104&hyph;33 is revised to reflect the relocation of the Cost Accounting Standards, within the FAR, from part 30 to appendix B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II.

Three copies of written comments should be submitted to the address indicated in the ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section of this notice. All comments received will be available for public inspection in the DOE Reading Room, Room 1E&hyph;190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, D.C. 20585, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. All written comments received by the date indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section of this notice and all other relevant information in the record will be carefully assessed and fully considered prior to publication of the final rule. Any information considered to be confidential must be so identified and submitted in writing, one copy only. DOE reserves the right to determine the confidential status of the information and to treat it according to our determination (See 10 CFR 1004.11).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and that the proposed rule should not have substantial impact on the nation's economy or a large number of individuals or businesses. Therefore, pursuant to Public Law 95&hyph;91, the DOE Organization Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Procedural Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Review Under Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this action was not subject to review under that Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Review Under Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs agencies to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in Sections 2(a) and (b), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: Specifies clearly any preemptive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. DOE certifies that today's proposal meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

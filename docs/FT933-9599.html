			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Letter: NE and carbon emissions savings Sir, Charlie Kronick's letter (August 5) is rather simplistic, both in his exposition of nuclear costs and his remedies for greenhouse gas emissions. To put the record straight: nuclear power is already part of the UK's policy for reducing CO emission. Nuclear Electric saved the emissions of around 13.5m tonnes of carbon last year, compared with the emission level from the UK fossil fuel mix for the same amount of electricity. If this greenhouse gas saving had been achieved at the cost ratio indicated by the Energy Saving Trust, Pounds 1,000 per tonne of carbon, an investment of Pounds 13.5bn would be required, half of which would come from levies on the price of energy to the customer. Everyone realises that the cleanest way of cutting CO levels is to use less energy - we all can and should do what we can, and any sane person wishes to see the EST succeed. But the realistic question is - how much is likely be saved by all the conservation methods available? The EST has set an objective of 2.5m tonnes of carbon by 2000. Before then, Sizewell B will be saving 2m tonnes of carbon a year. Meanwhile, future nuclear power can produce electricity at 3p/kWh or below, compared with typical large tranche costs for wind power of in excess of 4p. This is on the same capital return basis and includes allowances for all decommissioning costs at the end of a nuclear plant's life. As Charlie Kronick knows, most current NE provisions for decommissioning and waste relate to previous CEGB operations of Magnox and AGRs before Nuclear Electric's creation. It is a pity that he muddled up the Nuclear Electric position with that of the entire industry, thus managing, unintentionally I am sure, to double the figures for NE's liabilities. Our net asset position is, in fact, improving, as would be expected from a growing and successful company. Adrian Ham, chief economist, Nuclear Electric, Barnett Way, Barnwood, Gloucester GL4 7RS</p>

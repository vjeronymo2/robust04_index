			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Top trading houses hit by strong yen and slow sales - Japanese Results The combination of a harsh economic climate at home, and a surging yen abroad produced another difficult year for Japan's five largest trading companies. In the year ended March, four of the five groups saw profits tumble. The trading houses' core activities depend heavily on the flow of goods and services in the domestic and international economy. Continuing weakness at home was reflected in their domestic results. Although some achieved small increases in sales, thanks largely to an improving market in metal products, most companies reported weakness in the large industrial sectors. Sluggish domestic demand also reduced revenues from imports. However, for most companies, the tightest squeeze on sales came from the exchange rate. The yen's sharp appreciation in the last year cut exports, with car sales to the US particularly affected. Sumitomo reported exports down by more than 20 per cent. All five companies continued to suffer the painful consequences of ill-starred ventures into financial products in the late 1980s. The unwinding of these investments reduced profits further last year. The worst performer was Itochu, which saw pre-tax profits fall by 38 per cent. Most of the decline was the result of the liquidation of loss-ridden financial investment schemes, and the disposal of tokkin, or specified money trusts, worth Y110bn (Dollars 1.1bn). These funds have left the trading companies heavily exposed since the stock market began its precipitous decline four years ago. Itochu has now reduced its outstanding tokkin accounts to Y97bn, against Y566bn in 1990. The five big groups managed to maintain the pace of cost-cutting. Despite a fall in turnover, Marubeni reported a slight increase in pre-tax profits as a result of deep cuts in administrative and sales costs. Most companies forecast a rise in current year profits but remained cautious. They expect only a gradual recovery in the Japanese economy, and few are banking on any help from a weakening yen.  -----------------------------------------------------------             JAPANESE TRADING HOUSE RESULTS (Y bn)  -----------------------------------------------------------                    Pre-tax profit               Sales               1993-94         1992-93   1993-94      1992-93  ----------------------------------------------------------- Itochu          30.8            49.8     16,135     19,277.7 Mitsui          46.5            54.6   15,862.8       15,496 Marubeni        37.4            41.1     15,156       16,864 Sumitomo        35.5            41.0     15,033       16,530 Mitsubishi      50.3            74.5     14,123       14,997  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

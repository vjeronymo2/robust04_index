			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Leftward shift in strategy for next election THE shift to the left in Liberal Democrat policy-making was confirmed yesterday as the conference endorsed a paper intended to set the framework for the party's manifesto at the next election. The clear rejection of laissez-faire economics and the emphasis on the need for full employment were highlighted approvingly by representatives yesterday in the debate on the paper, Facing up to the Future. Even though the tone of the paper is already markedly more sceptical about market mechanisms than its precursor, which provoked an angry debate at last year's conference, some representatives who spoke yesterday expressed concern that it was still too rightwing and expressed too much in terms of conventional economics. One speaker said the paper did not address the over-consumption of global resources by the first world, while another demanded a commitment to reform and regulation of City institutions. Yet another said that campaigning on behalf of the lower-paid who were affected by the abolition of wages councils was a vital element in ensuring that the Liberal Democrats did not become 'yet another middle-class party out of touch with some of the real issues'. But the tone of the debate was overwhelmingly favourable towards the document, which was praised for its statement of Liberal Democrats and its analysis of the challenges facing the UK. Some representatives, however, were unhappy that the conference committee had refused to accept for discussion or vote any amendment to the motion approving it. Lord Holme, a leading figure in drawing up the document, said the paper would help the party refute suggestions that it had no policies, and could speedily form the basis of a manifesto if the parliament failed to run its course. The Conservatives yesterday stepped up their offensive against the Liberal Democrats, who they believe pose the main threat to traditional Tory strongholds in the south. Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, said the party was 'notorious for chopping and changing their policies from one moment to the next'. Mr Gerry Malone, Conservative deputy chairman, joined in the attack, saying: 'Their strategy is shameless - to be all things to all men'.</p>

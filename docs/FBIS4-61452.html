			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Mykhaylovich Karasyk, Ukraine's </F> minister of agriculture and food, by Viktor Kozoris; place and  date not given: "Professionalism Must Unite Us"]    [Text] Minister of Agriculture and Food Yuriy Mykhaylovich  Karasyk became the first Supreme Council People's Deputy from  the Cherkassk Oblast. He balloted for the legislature seat in  the Cherkassk constituency No. 427 in which the runoff was held  on 3 April. When the results of all the Ukrainian runoffs were  known, our reporter met with People's Deputy Yuriy Mykhaylovich  Karasyk.    [Kozoris] Yuriy Mykhaylovich, I prepared a traditional  question for you: With what are you going to begin your  deputy's activities?    [Karasyk] I have already met with some deputies-agrarians.  We are drafting a package of documents which will foster the  work of the agricultural sector. First of all, these are  documents on taxation because a value-added tax is a regular  element in the processes of production, processing, and  realization of agricultural products. In fact, taxation in the  agricultural sector should encourage neither production, nor the  budget, but the producer and the consumer. Experience shows  that it should be flexible, and dependent on volumes of  production and sales of products. However, our taxation is  stable, agricultural products are not in demand (because people  cannot buy them), and this triggers a drop in production.    The second block of issues is as follows. People's Deputy  Viktor Martynovych Kalnyk, deputy minister of economy, and I are  drafting a price formulating mechanism. It is closely connected  with taxation. The third package regards our credit policy. I  can say that a single document on taxation, crediting, and price  formation is being drafted. This package also includes  proposals on the banking sector, first and foremost, on the  setting up of a land bank which will service enterprises and  persons representing all forms of ownership in the production  sector.    Now about the work in the new legislature. We know how many  socialists and Rukh members it has. I can only pin hopes on  that -- irrespective of what parties and movements are  represented in the Supreme Council -- their representatives will  be sane enough to unite their efforts on economic issues.  Professionalism must unite us.    [Kozoris] The new legislature will be professional. Will you  drop your ministerial post or unite your ministerial and  legislative work?    [Karasyk] It is up to the Supreme Council. A new government  will also be formed in line with the Supreme Council's  decisions. If I suit the governmental team as minister of  agriculture and food, then I will consult my voters in what post  I will be of more use both to them and to the state.    [Kozoris] Many newly elected deputies said during the  election campaigns that they will come to the legislature with  their teams. Have you your own team in the Supreme Council?    [Karasyk] Our team will be the most numerous among the  ministries in the new legislature. Five newly elected deputies  come from the central state bodies: My three deputy ministers,  the head of the concern "Ukragrotekhservis," and myself.  Therefore, if you ask about a team, we have it. For example,  Oleksandr Borovyk, chairman of the All-Ukrainian Council of  Kolkhozes [KSP], KSP Chairman from Kiev Danilenko, and a range  of other leaders of agricultural enterprises. In my opinion, we  have the proper agrarian team.    [Kozoris] Is newly elected People's Deputy Oleksandr  Tkachenko, former Ukrainian minister of agriculture, also a  member of your team?    [Karasyk] In my opinion, Tkachenko suits our team  professionally. We could have different political standpoints,  however, from the point of view of professionalism, he should be  a member of the agrarian team.    [Kozoris] Why did I ask you this question? Currently, some  politicians issue statements regarding the existence of at least  two groups of agrarians -- Karasyk's and Tkachenko's -- in the  legislature.    [Karasyk] This will be our greatest problem. If agrarians  begin setting up separate groups, this will cause a deadlock.  Then we should lay down the office not to make people laugh.  Given the current situation, we should drop our ambitions and  assess objectively the life, and political and economic  developments. Eventually, legislative deputies should work and  not rally.    [Kozoris] Yuriy Mykhaylovich, you are an expert of, let us  simply put it, the old Supreme Council. It also did not suffer  from a lack of kolkhoz chairmen and experienced agrarians. Why  did their activity not have a positive effect on our  agricultural sector?    [Karasyk] Experience shows that the Supreme Council only  dealt with adopting laws, the executive bodies did not live up  to our expectations, and we missed the mechanism of the  implementation of laws. I believe that the laws should be  adopted together with a mechanism for their implementation, and  they should be economically grounded to avoid the adoption of  populist laws. It is better to tell people the truth, however,  this truth should make people believe in the necessity of  adopting corresponding laws. I do not blame the old Supreme  Council, because, to blame, one should first try to work there.  We aimed to become Supreme Council deputies to work.    [Kozoris] When can we expect real changes in the Ukrainian  agrarian sector?    [Karasyk] I believe that in two or three years, the  situation  in the agrarian sector will become stable.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : THE SINISTER 'TWIN'  </P> <P> Sunday night at 9, ABC trots out its much ballyhooed crapshoot "Twin Peaks."  You can bet your Nielsens that cult director David Lynch's eerie mystery/soap  will be riveting to some viewers, repugnant to others.  </P> <P> Actress Lara Flynn Boyle anxiously awaits America's verdict.  </P> <P> "I think it's designed in a way that is unique and is different but has a lot  of television qualities, like 'China Beach,' " says Boyle.  </P> <P> The perky 19-year-old, already a vet of TV's "Amerika," "The Preppie Murder"  and several big-screen features, is an ardent fan of Lynch and this strangely  sinister project he's conjured up. Twin Peaks is a fictional lumber town  situated in the Northwest whose inhabitants are whipped into a frenzy following  a grisly murder.  </P> <P> "In terms of the pace, the ensemble cast and their different personalities, I  think definitely, (viewers) will like it," predicts Boyle, born in Davenport,  Iowa, but reared in Chicago. "Plus, it's very humorous. It's not one of those  shows where the 'LAUGH' light goes on, like the sitcoms where you pretty much  know when you should laugh and when you should cry."  </P> <P> Some actors do cry when they feel shorted on screen time. With "Twin Peaks"  boasting over a dozen main characters, how does Boyle make her thin slice of  the pie more palatable?  </P> <P> "It's frustrating at times," acknowledges Boyle, "but the show is done so that  each person has a very strong quality . . . so when you work, you really have  to remember what you bring to the show."  </P> <P> Boyle asserts that "Twin Peaks' " unpredictability factor will save it from  being just another prime-time casualty.  </P> <P> "You don't really know if you'll turn on the TV and it's going to be morbid, or  if you're going to laugh the whole hour."

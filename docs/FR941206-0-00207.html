			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) A foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the waste (liquid-mounted seal). A liquid-mounted seal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means a foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in contact with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waste between the wall of the tank and the floating roof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuously around the circumference of the tank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Two seals mounted one above the other so that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms a continuous closure that completely covers the space  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the wall of the tank and the edge of the internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating roof. The lower seal may be vapor-mounted, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both shall be continuous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) A mechanical shoe seal. A mechanical shoe seal is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a metal sheet held vertically against the wall of the tank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by springs or weighted levers and is connected by braces to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the floating roof. A flexible coated fabric (envelope)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating roof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Each opening in a noncontact internal floating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roof except for automatic bleeder vents (vacuum breaker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vents) and the rim space vents is to provide a projection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below the waste surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Each opening in the internal floating roof except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for leg sleeves, automatic bleeder vents, rim space vents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> column wells, ladder wells, sample wells, and stub drains is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be equipped with a cover or lid which is to be maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a closed position at all times (i.e., no visible gap)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except when the device is in actual use. The cover or lid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be equipped with a gasket. Covers on each access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hatch and automatic gauge float well shall be bolted except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when they are in use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Automatic bleeder vents shall be equipped with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasket and are to be closed at all times when the roof is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating except when the roof is being floated off or is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being landed on the roof leg supports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Rim space vents shall be equipped with a gasket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are to be set to open only when the internal floating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roof is not floating or at the manufacturer's recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Each penetration of the internal floating roof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the purpose of sampling shall be a sample well. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample well shall have a slit fabric cover that covers at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least 90 percent of the opening.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Each penetration of the internal floating roof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that allows for passage of a column supporting the fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roof shall have a flexible fabric sleeve seal or a gasketed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sliding cover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) Each penetration of the internal floating roof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that allows for passage of a ladder shall have a gasketed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sliding cover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The owner or operator electing to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;265.1085(b)(3) of this subpart shall design, install,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate, and maintain an external floating roof that meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Each external floating roof shall be equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a closure device between the wall of the tank and the roof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> edge. The closure device is to consist of two seals, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above the other. The lower seal is referred to as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary seal, and the upper seal is referred to as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary seal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The primary seal shall be either a mechanical shoe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seal or a liquid-mounted seal. Except as provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the seal shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completely cover the annular space between the edge of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating roof and tank wall.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The secondary seal shall completely cover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annular space between the external floating roof and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wall of the tank in a continuous fashion except as allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Except for automatic bleeder vents and rim space  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vents, each opening in a noncontact external floating roof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall provide a projection below the waste surface. Except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for automatic bleeder vents, rim space vents, roof drains,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and leg sleeves, each opening in the roof is to be equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a gasketed cover, seal, or lid that is to be maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a closed position at all times (i.e., no visible gap)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except when the device is in actual use. Automatic bleeder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vents are to be closed at all times when the roof is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating except when the roof is being floated off or is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being landed on the roof leg supports. Rim vents are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set to open when the roof is being floated off the roof leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supports or at the manufacturer's recommended setting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Automatic bleeder vents and rim space vents are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasketed. Each emergency roof drain is to be provided with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a slotted membrane fabric cover that covers at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 90 percent of the area of the opening.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The roof shall be floating on the waste at all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times (i.e., off the roof leg supports) except during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial fill until the roof is lifted off leg supports and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the tank is completely emptied and subsequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refilled. The process of filling, emptying, or refilling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the roof is resting on the leg supports shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous and shall be accomplished as rapidly as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The owner or operator may elect to comply with &sect;265.1085(b)(2) or (b)(3) of this subpart using an alternative means of emission limitation for which a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice has been published in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.114b permitting its use as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative means for the purpose of compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 60.112b.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Monitoring and inspection of the control equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) After installation, owners and operators of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal floating roofs shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary seal, and the secondary seal (if one is in service),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to filling the tank with waste. If there are holes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tears, or other openings in the primary seal, the secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seal, or the seal fabric, or defects in the internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating roof, or both, the owner or operator shall repair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the items before filling the tank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For tanks equipped with a liquid-mounted or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanical shoe primary seal, visually inspect the internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floating roof and the primary seal or the secondary seal (if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one is in service) through manholes and roof hatches on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed roof at least once every 12 months after initial fill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the internal floating roof is not resting on the surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the waste inside the tank, or there is liquid accumulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the roof, or the seal is detached, or there are holes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tears in the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the items or empty and remove the tank from service within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 45 days. If a failure that is detected during inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and if the tank cannot be emptied within 45 days, a 30-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension may be requested from the Regional Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such a request for an extension shall document that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternate capacity is unavailable and specify a schedule of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions the owner or operator will take that will assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the control equipment will be repaired or the tank will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be emptied as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For tanks equipped with a double-seal system as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

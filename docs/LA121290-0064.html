Bars, tobacco stores, malls, private  offices, residences and places of worship have been exempted from the law,  which is expected to go into effect in February.  </P> <P> Mayor Randy Bomgaars said the council is concerned about the effects of  secondhand smoke and felt it had to take a drastic step to protect nonsmokers.  </P></p>

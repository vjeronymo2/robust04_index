The basic idea behind the council is for Korean and American  leaders from all walks of life to get together and discuss  bilateral cooperation and resolution of problems to achieve  forward-looking relations in the post-Cold War era, the former  finance minister told reporters.    Sakong, president of the Institute for Global Economics,  represents Korea, while Fred Bergsten and his Institute for  International Economics (IIE) will manage U.S. affairs.    The Korea Foundation and IIE are to sponsor the  non-governmental dialogue channel that will exchange expertise  on a wide range of issues.    With about 30 participants from each side, the council will  meet in Korea and the United States in turn every year behind  closed doors.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will make an opening speech at  the inaugural meeting in Washington. He is among seven senior  government officials invited along with ambassador to Washington  Han Sung-su and Assistant Foreign Minister Son Chun-yong.    The six politicians attending include Rep. Chong Che-mun,  chairman of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and National  Unification Committee, and Cho Son-song of the Democratic Party.    Lucky-Goldstar Group Chairman Ku Pyong-hoe, Ssangyong Group  Chairman Kim Sok-won and six other business leaders, 14 eminent  professors and journalists, plus former Government  Administration Minister Choe Chang-yun will also take part.    Among the participating Americans are Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor,  Laura Tyson, chairman of the Economic Advisers, Robert Fauver,  special assistant to the president for national security and  economic policy at the National Security Council, and Winston  Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific  affairs, as well as business and press leaders.</p>

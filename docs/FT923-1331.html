			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond price drop offsets UK interest rate move Wall Street A SHARP decline in bond prices, lower car shares and a wave of computer sell programs sent US stock prices tumbling across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.98 at 3,280.85, its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 retreated 5 full points to 417.14, while the American SE composite dipped 1.73 to 380.99 and the Nasdaq composite fell 5.58 to 583.00. Turnover on the New York SE came to 187m shares. Although news of a cut in UK interest rates provided the basis for a firm opening to trading - analysts have argued that lower European interest rates will spur growth in the US - a sharp fall in US bond prices more than offset the positive effect of the UK rates move. Long-dated Treasuries fell by more than a point, pushing yields back up towards 7.5 per cent, in reaction to the unexpectedly steep 10.4 per cent rise in August housing starts, calls from the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington DC for the US to lift its interest rates once the recovery picks up, and stronger than expected department and chain store sales Equities were also troubled by computer sell programs, which exacerbated weakness in a market already unsettled by a big decline in car shares. The fall in the motor sector was prompted by securities house Wertheim Schroder, which reduced its 1992 estimates for Ford (from Dollars 2.55 earnings a share to Dollars 1.45) and General Motors (from a 45 cents a share profit to a 30 cents a share loss), and lowered its rating for Chrysler from a 'buy' to a 'hold'. The Wertheim analyst explained his moves by saying that Ford was troubled by weak car sales in Europe, especially in the UK, that GM was losing market share in a sluggish US environment, and that Chrysler's shares were due for a revision in the wake of the stock's recent run-up. Ford finished Dollars 2 3/8 down at Dollars 40 3/8 , GM Dollars 1 1/4 cheaper at Dollars 33 and Chrysler off Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 23 3/8 , all after heavy trading. Fingerhut dropped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 27 after warning that third-quarter earnings would come in below analysts' expectations of between 39 and 42 cents a share. General Mills slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 on news that securities house Goldman Sachs had removed the stock from its recommended list after the company reported weak restaurant business. On the Nasdaq market, leading stocks were mostly lower in a blue chip sell-off. Borland International receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 , Microsoft Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 77 3/4 , Amgen Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 and Sun Microsystems Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 30 1/8 . Canada AFTER losing ground in the morning, the Toronto market moved narrowly in the afternoon around the lower levels, faring better than the Wall Street weak performance. Traders said that in recent days international investors had already grown nervous over Canada's pending October 27 referendum on a constitutional deal to keep the country united. The TSE 300 index closed 17.2 lower at 3,402.8 and declines led rises by 348 to 209 after volume of 26.8m shares. BP Canada withdrew its proposed secondary offering of 5.5m Royal Oak Mines shares, citing last week's explosion at Royal Oak's Giant Mine and resulting uncertainty surrounding Royal Oak. BP Canada lost CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 15 and Royal Oak 4 cents to CDollars 1.96.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / ITN faces ownership shake-up The current takeover battles in ITV will almost certainly lead to another share restructuring at Independent Television News, the commercial television news organisation. Following the takeover earlier this year by a consortium led by Carlton Communications, five companies each hold 18 per cent - Carlton, Central, London Weekend, Granada and Reuters. Scottish Television and Anglia each hold 5 per cent. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act no participant is allowed to hold more than 20 per cent in the Channel 3 news supplier. This week's conditional agreed bid by Carlton for Central means that the enlarged Carlton would hold 36 per cent of ITN and would therefore have to get rid of 16 per cent. Mr David Gordon, chief executive of ITN, said yesterday that it looked as if there would have to be orderly divestments if ITV takeovers were confirmed. The ownership changes at ITN would become more sweeping if, as many expect, Granada launches a takeover bid for LWT. Last week Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, proposed that - subject to parliamentary approval - one ITV company would be able to hold two broadcasting licences, except in London. Both Scottish and Anglia could also be takeover targets. The ITN chief executive said yesterday that he saw 'absolutely no problem' in finding new shareholders for what was now a profitable company. Under broadcasting legislation, a majority stake in ITN is supposed to be held by a non-ITV company by the end of next year. Yesterday ITN also announced that it had been awarded a multi-million pound three-year contract to supply news to NBC Super Channel, the pan-European satellite channel. ITN will provide one and a half hours of programmes a day to the channel. Antonia Sharpe adds: Moody's, the international credit rating agency, yesterday placed the long-term ratings of Carlton Communications under review for possible downgrading following the bid for Central. Moody's said its review would focus on the company's financial structure upon completion of the acquisition, on the earnings and cash flow prospects for the combined operations and on the potential for further acquisitions from Carlton. Around Dollars 390m of long-term debt is affected, made up of senior notes, which have a rating of A2, and convertible subordinated bonds and exchangeable capital securities, which both carry a rating of A3. Carlton's Prime-1 rating for commercial paper is also under review.</p>

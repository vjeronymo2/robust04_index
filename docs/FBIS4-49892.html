			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The Walmart Company, a  leading retailer of the United States, is studying the  possibility of entering the Chinese retail market, according to  the chairman of the board of directors of the company.    Robson Walton, whose company's retail sales volume tops 55  billion U.S. dollars annually, has arrived in Tianjin to  investigate market potential.    He said he is very much interested in China's huge market  potential and is looking for investment possibilities in the  north China port city.    The chairman has inspected several large commercial centers  in the city and conducted in-depth discussions with local  officials.    Tianjin, one of the leading trade and commercial centers in  northern China and one of the few cities that allow foreign  investment in commerce and retail sales, has become the favorite  of many foreign investors.    The Isetan Company of Japan, which leased and opened a large  shopping center in the city last year, is achieving a rising  business volume. Another large store funded by a Hong Kong  company is also being constructed.    Other overseas businessmen eyeing Tianjin market potentials  include the Chia Tai Group company of Thailand and the Nino  Textile Company of Germany, local officials revealed.</p>

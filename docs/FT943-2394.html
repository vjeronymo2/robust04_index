			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Portugal cuts key interest rates Portugal's central bank yesterday cut two important money market rates by half a point in a reversal of the European trend towards higher interest rates. The Bank of Portugal lowered the emergency lending rate for overnight funds from 12 to 11.5 per cent and the liquidity absorption rate from 9.25 to 8.75 per cent. The variable repurchase rate for seven-day funds was cut by 0.25 points to 9.25 per cent. Falling inflation, a lower fiscal deficit and a stable currency have enabled the central bank to cut money market rates gradually since they were reintroduced in early July. They had been suspended two months earlier to help fight speculation on the escudo. The central bank's decision to cut the compulsory cash reserve requirement for banks from 17 per cent of deposits to 2 per cent from November 1 should lead to further rate cuts.</p>

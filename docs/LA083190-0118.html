Soviet Grigory Yegorov was second. Austria's Hermann  Fehringer third.  </P> <P> Bubka cleared only 18-8 1/4. He blamed the loss on a sore back.  </P> <P> "I have to get used to losses after a string of bad results this year," Bubka  said. "Now I'm finally learning that the losses are a part of sports."  </P> <P> "I had problems with injuries which hampered my usual training schedule, but I  will be back. I won't give up that easily."  </P> <P> Peter Elliott of Britain, the favorite for the men's 1,500 meters, fell during  his semifinal in a crowded pack about 600 meters from the finish.  </P> <P> Team spokesman Tony Ward protested that Elliott was pushed. After the tape was  viewed, officials ruled that Elliott's fall was caused by East Germany's Hauke  Fuhlbruegge. Elliott made it to the final, while Fuhlbruegge was disqualified.  </P> <P> East German Katrin Krabbe won the women's 200 meters to become the first double  gold medal winner at the championships, and Britain won two more men's golds.  </P> <P> After four days of competition, East Germany led with eight gold medals.  Britain was second with seven golds.  </P> <P> Krabbe won the 200 meters in 21.95 seconds two days after winning the 100  meters.  </P> <P> "It looks as if I'll pick up three golds here, if things work out as they  should," she said, referring to the upcoming sprint relay. "My win in the 200  was tougher than the 100, but I was confident in both races."  </P> <P> Heike Drechsler of East Germany, a gold medalist in the long jump, was second  and Galina Malchugina of the Soviet Union third.  </P> <P> In another upset, Paivi Alafranti of Finland won the women's javelin with throw  of 222 feet, beating a strong East German team led by world record-holder Petra  Felke. Karen Forkel was second and Felke third.  </P> <P> John Regis won the men's 200 meters in 20.11 seconds and Roger Black the 400 in  45.08 for the two British men's golds.  </P></p>

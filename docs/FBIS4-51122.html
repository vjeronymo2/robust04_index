			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Regional News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] A regional conference attended by leading party  member-cadres of provincial- and prefectural-level departments  took place at the Hall of the Tibetan People on the afternoon of  22 May.    Leading comrades of the regional party committee, the  regional people's congress, the regional government, and the  regional committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference attended the meeting which was chaired  by regional party committee secretary Chen Kuiyuan.    Comrade Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the regional  party committee, gave a speech on the situation regarding  Tibet's fight against splittism and the work to do in  stabilizing the situation. [video shows close-up of Raidi  reading from prepared notes, close-ups of Chen Kuiyuan and other  Tibetan leaders perusing Raidi's report] He said: On the  whole, Tibet's fight against splittism is satisfactory. The  region is politically and socially stable, people of all  nationalities are united, and the defense is strong along border  areas. This has created a social environment good for reform,  opening up, and economic construction; and good for improving  people's livelihood. Owing to their class nature, however,  hostile forces in the world and separatists at home and abroad  will never accept their defeat willingly. They will continue to  do everything they can to intensify their splittist activities.  The antisplittist situation we are now facing is therefore still  a severe one, and the mission we have to carry out is a  formidable one.    Raidi said: All party and government organizations and we,  as leading cadres, must be vigilant in peace time. We must have  a clear understanding of the problems and the acute and complex  antisplittist struggle we are now facing. We must have a clear  idea of the situation, and know our assignments and carry them  out properly. We must take the necessary precautionary measures  against what might occur.    Raidi emphatically pointed out: Leadership is critical for  stabilizing the situation. The regional party committee expects  that top party and government leaders as well as all units will  take personal charge of the work of stabilizing the situation,  regularly study the situation and problems in their respective  areas and units, and come up with plans with which they can lead  the vast number of cadres and worker to fight splittism.  Leading cadres must firmly and unequivocally handle major  issues of principles.    To ensure Tibet's stability and the normal and healthy  development of reform, opening up, and economic construction,  Raidi urged party committees and governments at all levels to  unite all forces that can be united, mobilize the initiative of  all social quarters, and, on the basis of closely relying on the  masses, build a stronger patriotic united front and give full  rein to the special roles played by patriots and religious  leaders of all nationalities in all quarters in fighting  splittism and in stabilizing the situation.    Expressing his views on economic affairs, regional  government  chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: Since the beginning of the year,  government organs at all levels, implementing the guidelines  laid down by the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth  Tibet Regional Party Committee and by the regional economic  conference, have intensified their reform efforts and opened  wider to the outside world, and have achieved preliminary  results in developing the economy. Compared with the same  period last year, growth has been registered in all sectors --  agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, communications and  transportation, capital construction, foreign trade, tourism,  taxation, and banking. We have achieved the expected results.  This year's reform projects require great efforts because the  scope is broad, the standards are high, there are many problems  to be resolved, and the assignments are heavy. To make sure  that all reform projects are carried out successfully, we must  stand firm in launching reform, fully understand what has to be  done, educate the masses about reform, and make genuine efforts  to speed up reform. Gyaincain Norbu also put forward  requirements for accomplishing various production projects,  making adequate arrangements for what the masses' needs in their  daily life, intensifying the preparations for [word indistinct]  construction projects, improving work style, and promoting  planned parenthood.    Those attending the meeting also heard a report given by  Comrade Zi Cheng, member of the regional party committee  standing committee and secretary of its Politics and Law  Committee, on the situation regarding public order and the fight  against splittism.    In conclusion, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan stressed that the  meeting  was significant for Tibet in deepening reform, speeding up  development, and maintaining stability. He said all  prefectures, cities, and departments must earnestly implement  its guidelines.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Apple margins under pressure APPLE Computer's profit margins are expected to continue to decline, following the launch yesterday of several aggressively-priced Macintosh products. Apple is aiming to lift its share of the personal computer market in the face of intense price competition. The new Macintosh PCs include desktop models aimed at business and education customers as well as consumers, and two portable notebook computers. Prices are 20 per cent to 35 per cent lower than existing models and in some instances less expensive than equivalent IBM-compatible products. This represents the sixth round of price cuts by Apple since April. 'We used to have a higher priced, lower volume business model, but people are no longer willing to pay a premium for our technology leadership, so we have had to shift to a lower price, higher volume strategy,' said Mr Ian Diery, executive vice-president. Apple's gross profit margins have fallen over the past year from more than 40 per cent to less than 26 per cent. With further price cuts, profit margins would continue to decline in the current quarter, the company said. In the latest fourth quarter, net profits dropped 97 per cent to just Dollars 2.7m. Apple's inventories rose sharply in the fourth quarter. Mr Diery said the increase, from Dollars 580m in the same quarter last year, to more than Dollars 1.5bn, was partly explained by a build-up of stocks of the new products announced yesterday. In an effort to avoid product shortages that limited Apple's ability to take advantage of strong demand in the fourth quarter, he said they had accumulated two to three times as many of the new products as it did before prior product launches. However, Apple's bloated inventory included a 'significant' quantity of older products, he admitted. If the discounts did not increase sales, Apple may be forced to take a write-off, analysts said.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / White House steps up pressureon Buchanan to withdraw THE White House, smarting from another humiliation at the polls for President George Bush, yesterday increased the pressure on Mr Pat Buchanan, his rightwing challenger, to withdraw from the race. Mr Buchanan, the television commentator and former Nixon speechwriter, won 36 per cent of the vote in Tuesday's Georgia primary, against 64 per cent for Mr Bush. Mr Buchanan's performance almost equalled his 37 per cent in New Hampshire two weeks ago. Mr Buchanan also took 30 per cent of the vote in Maryland and Colorado, confirming that his campaign is not simply going to fade away. The White House fears that Mr Buchanan's success has exposed deep divisions within the Republican party and threatens to weaken Mr Bush when he faces a Democratic challenger in November's presidential election. Some Republican party leaders believe Mr Buchanan's eyes are on the 1996 presidential race, and that he does not entertain any real hope of taking this year's nomination from President Bush. If that is so, they argue, he must sooner or later make peace with the rest of the party. 'We got the message. Now it's time for him to get the message: stop dividing the party,' said a White House official. But Mr Buchanan yesterday insisted he had no intention of pulling out of the race. Instead, he said, he would continue his campaign up to the August convention. 'I think we're now going to go all the way to that Houston convention,' he said. Mr Bush has until now dismissed Mr Buchanan's support as a protest vote. On Tuesday night he chose to interpret his challenger's support as a protest vote directed at politicians in general, not just his own record in office. 'To those who have been with me in the past but did not vote for me today, I hear your concerns and understand your frustration with Washington,' he said in a statement issued from the White House. Yesterday, however, he acknowledged that people were actually voting against him. 'It seems to be that way, yes. I think that's a good way to analyse it. But that will turn round,' Mr Bush said before leaving for Florida and six days of intensive campaigning. 'People will see that I'm the person to lead this country, just as I was in the past.' Republican leaders such as Mr Newt Gingrich, the party's whip in the House of Representatives, acknowledge that Mr Bush's campaign is still in trouble. 'There's no question Bush has got problems. It's obvious in the returns. It's obvious in the economy.' Mr Buchanan has been campaigning heavily in South Carolina, which holds its primary on Saturday, and is also expected to win support in the conservative southern states which dominate next week's 11-state Super Tuesday contest. In the Democratic race, Tuesday's voting in seven states confirmed the emergence of two clear frontrunners: Mr Paul Tsongas, the lugubrious former senator from Massachusetts, who won in Maryland, Utah and Washington state, and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who won heavily in Georgia. Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, won a surprising victory in Colorado. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa kept his faltering campaign alive by winning at party caucuses in Minnesota and Idaho. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska failed to win anywhere and yesterday cancelled his scheduled appearances in Florida. He is considering the future of his candidacy.

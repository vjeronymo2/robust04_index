			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Attali likely to be given Pounds 147,000 payoff by EBRD MR Jacques Attali, who is resigning as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is likely to receive a tax-free payoff of more than Pounds 147,000. Mrs Anne Wibble, chairman of the bank's governors who was in London yesterday to discuss Mr Attali's compensation arrangements and procedures for finding his successor, said she expected Mr Attali to receive a year's salary as an allowance for termination of employment. Mr Attali's letter of appointment, signed by one of Mrs Wibble's predecessors, Mr Wim Kok, says his 'annual net base salary' is Pounds 147,000. Mr Attali has had a pay rise since then. 'It seems clear it (the payoff) will be paid', she said. Mr Attali resigned on June 25, following months of criticism of expenditure by the bank. On the morning of his resignation, the Financial Times had disclosed that he had been reimbursed twice for a first class return flight to Tokyo and received Dollars 30,000 for giving a speech there. Mr Attali's letter of appointment says he is entitled to 'a termination allowance equivalent to one year's net base salary' unless the bank's governors terminate his contract 'for cause'. Mrs Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, said a decision on whether to pay Mr Attali the termination allowance would therefore depend on the outcome of the investigation into alleged overspending at the bank by the EBRD's audit committee, due to be completed by mid-July. She said Mr Attali would remain at the bank until a new president arrived, which she hoped could be in September. Governors, representing the governments of 54 countries and agencies which own the bank, have until July 21 to nominate candidates and the election period lasts 21 days from then. Mrs Wibble ruled out the idea of an interim president being chosen to run the bank before a successor arrives, although a number of the bank's executives have been campaigning internally for an interim appointment. Bank executives and directors believe that Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Banque de France, will succeed Mr Attali, because he has the support of a number of the governments from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. In a speech she made to the bank's staff, Mrs Wibble singled out Mr de Larosiere and Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC economics commissioner, as having been mentioned in the press as candidates: 'I hope that a consensus will gradually emerge among the shareholders (the 54 governments and agencies).' The successful candidate needs to command the majority support of governors, who must also own a majority of the shares. The G7 countries, which own more than half the bank's shares, will therefore have the greatest influence on the outcome.</p>

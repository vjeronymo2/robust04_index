			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Ministers review London bus plans CONTROVERSIAL proposals for the deregulation and privatisation of the London bus network appear to be undergoing a review by the fresh ministerial team at the Department of Transport. The department yesterday announced that a working party comprising a range of interests in the capital had been set up 'to advise on the practical aspects of implementing deregulation.' Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said the government remained committed to extending bus de-regulation to the capital. However, the creation of the working party follows last week's surprise omission from the Queen's Speech of legislative proposals for London bus deregulation, which previous transport minsters had consistently promised early in the next parliament. Transport ministers seem unlikely to drop deregulation altogether, but some Conservative MPs in the capital are believed to be deeply concerned about the proposals in their present form.</p>

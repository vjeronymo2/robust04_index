In his report, Ma Zhongchen briefly talked  about Henan's economic development in 1993 and gave a detailed  description of the main objectives and reform policies for 1994.    Ma Zhongchen said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee set the objective of establishing a socialist  market economy system in China. The establishment of this  system makes new and increased demands on higher education. For  some time to come, the central tasks of our province's higher  education are to deepen the reform and to improve the quality of  teaching and efficiency of operation. It is necessary to  emancipate the mind, change the current state of closed  operation, gradually open universities up, and achieve a higher  gains-to-scale ratio. [passage omitted]    Ma Zhongchen called on party committees and governments at  various levels to conscientiously act in accordance with the  "Teachers' Law" and the "Program for the Reform and Development  of Comprehensive Education," truly put education in a strategic  position for priority development, and further foster a fine  social atmosphere of respecting teachers and valuing education.    With regard to the problem of teachers' salary arrears in  some places in the province, Ma Zhongchen demanded that the  principal leaders of party committees and governments in those  localities attend to this matter personally and adopt all  necessary measures to ensure that teachers get their salary  arrears before the Spring Festival, so that they can have a good  holiday.

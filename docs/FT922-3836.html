			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Warning on size of merchant fleet BRITAIN'S merchant fleet has shrunk to the point where it can no longer play a full part in the defence of the realm, a report commissioned by the shipping industry claims, Richard Tomkins writes. It warns that a national operation such as the Falklands campaign would now be 'at best on the margins of practicality and at worst impossible'. Although the Gulf war had involved Britain in a large-scale deployment of its armed forces, the sea lift was achieved almost entirely through the use of foreign-flag vessels on charter. The report was sponsored by the Chamber of Shipping, the trade association for British shipowners, which has unsuccessfully campaigned over several years for government help to stem the industry's decline. The State of British Merchant Shipping. Chamber of Shipping, 13-14 West Smithfield, London EC1A 9JL.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TICKET HIKES AT IRVINE MEADOWS WILL PAY FOR POLICE  </P> <P> The cost of a concert ticket at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre has gone up 50  cents due to a new tax levied by the Irvine City Council to pay for police  protection and traffic control at performances.  </P> <P> The fee will raise an estimated $205,000 this year, according to Paul Brady  Jr., Irvine's assistant city manager. The tax applies to entertainment  facilities with a capacity greater than 1,500. Aside from UC Irvine facilities,  which are exempt, the 15,000-capacity Irvine Meadows is the only entertainment  operation in Irvine large enough to be subject to the fee.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody doesn't have a problem with a tax, but we recognize why  it has to be," Bob Geddes, Irvine Meadows' managing partner, said Wednesday.  "The last thing we want to do is (make the city pay for costs) that are  rightfully ours. We tried to do some lobbying to perhaps reconfigure (the tax)  or reduce it, or at least put a lid on it but we were OK with it in the end."  </P> <P> Irvine Meadows already adds a $1.50 "surcharge" of its own to the face price of  tickets -- with the surcharge money kept by the amphitheater to cover its own  costs. Geddes said that ticket buyers will now see a $2 "surcharge/tax" listed  on their tickets.  </P> <P> Since it opened in 1981, Irvine Meadows has reimbursed the city of Irvine for  the salaries paid to police officers assigned to concert details. The new tax  will cover salaries as well as the cost of equipment needed to police the  concerts. That includes 2 paddy wagons, 5 patrol cars and 19 radio sets.  </P> <P> The Police Department assigns 15 to 23 officers to Irvine Meadows on sold-out  concert nights, Brady said. The cost -- time-and-a-half under the police  officers' contract -- is $37 per hour (including benefits) for regular  officers, and $42 for supervisors, for an estimated annual total of $153,000.  </P></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Lamont launches charm offensive AFTER the bad blood of the past week it was all sweetness and light between Britain and Germany in Washington this weekend. At Saturday's meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers, Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, went out of his way to mend fences with Mr Theo Waigel, his German counterpart. An indication of the looming charm offensive came early in the meeting when a UK Treasury spokesman briefed journalists, with a completely straight face, to the effect that Mr Lamont 'was not in the business of telling Germany to cut its interest rates'. Later, in a post-G7 briefing, the chancellor said several times that his observations about the economic effects of German unification or the need for the UK and German economies to be better synchronised were not meant as a criticism of Germany. For their part, Mr Waigel and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, took the more conciliatory line with good grace. Mr Waigel disclosed that he and Mr Lamont had talked on several occasions over the day and agreed that their 'good personal and political contacts' would be continued. Before the meeting began Mr Waigel had commented on Britain's complaints of the past week. One-sided blame for what had happened did not help matters, Mr Waigel observed. He maintained that Germany had always taken a constructive approach to the problems of exchange markets and stuck to the rules of the European Monetary System. Mr Schlesinger let slip the background to his recent fraught relations with the chancellor. He recalled that at the informal meeting of EC finance ministers in Bath earlier this month, Mr Lamont had pressed him four times to say he would cut rates. He had been obliged to answer four times that he could make no such commitment, when only once should have done.</p>

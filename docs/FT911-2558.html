			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Yeltsin seeks to persuade miners to end pit strikes MR BORIS Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, will today seek to persuade miners to end their strikes, after agreeing the basis of a settlement in talks with their leaders in Moscow at the weekend. Aides said he would pledge that control of their pits would pass to the Russian from the Soviet central authorities. On a visit to the Kuzbas, the main coal basin in the Russion Federation and the most politically militant area, he is also expected to tell the miners that he has won for them the right to sell some coal on world markets for hard currency. The Russian leader had committed himself to trying to persuade the miners to go back to work when he signed a statement with President Mikhail Gorbachev and leaders of eight Soviet republics last Tuesday. Mr Yeltsin's calculation to agree to call for an end to the strikes in part proceeds from a sense that they are anyway falling off. All pits in the Vorkuta area returned to work after the authorities agreed to hand them over to Russian control, and strike leaders said five pits in the Mezhdurechensk field had also returned to work as the miners talked of strike fatigue. Mr Yeltsin won the backing of the Russian Parliament to his agreement with Mr Gorbachev yesterday, when it voted by 152 to seven for a resolution which noted 'the importance of the document for the destiny of Russia's peoples'. Mr Yeltsin will remain in the coalfields until Wednesday - May Day - when official representatives of Soviet power will take the traditional parade in Red Square, a feature of which will be a march-past by the official unions. The contrast between the two events marks the opening round in the Russian leader's campaign for his election as president of the Russian Republic by popular vote, to take place on June 12 - the first such election in Russia's history. He faces continued criticism from his allies for signing an agreement which, as well as calling for an end to strikes, commits him to support the Soviet government's anti-crisis economic programme, and to back an undefined 'special regime' in key industrial and transport sectors. Deputies have said that they believed this 'special regime' would involve the firing of workers for absenteeism and other breaches of discipline. US rethinks policy, Page 4</p>

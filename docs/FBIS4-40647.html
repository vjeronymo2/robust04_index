			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Rostikov: "Zenon Pozniak's </F> Anti-Russian Accent"]    [Text] Minsk -- The people of Belarus, whose diligence,  composure, and tolerance are legendary, are not changing  character as they approach their first presidential elections.  They are well aware that, out of the six registered candidates,  only incumbent Prime Minister V. Kebich and A. Lukashenko, a  former state farm director and former chairman of the Supreme  Soviet Anticorruption Commission, have the best chance of  success.    Clearly pressuring them, Z. Pozniak, leader of the  Belorussian [Belarusian] People's Front [BPF], has been making  great advances recently. Head of a rural club, a professional  photographer, theater expert, and archaeologist, he entered the  political scene in the late eighties on the wave of revelations  about Stalin's crimes. He became well known throughout the  region for discovering and publicizing the site at Kuropaty near  Minsk where NKVD prisoners were gunned down.    Pozniak has irrevocably chosen the path of nationalism. This  method has already worked well on the territory of certain  republics of the former USSR and has yielded its adherents good  dividends. Nationalism is the last phase of communism, the last  attempt by an obsolete ideology to rid itself of responsibility  for the past. It is always foreigners who are to blame -- that  is every nationalist's conviction. Nor does it take long to  work out who those foreigners are -- the Russians.    In Belarus, which has always lived in the closest union with  Russia -- the two peoples were united by the deepest ties of  kinship -- this niche naturally remained unfilled. Pozniak  filled it and tirelessly set about exposing "imperial Russia"  and the "imperial Russian people" who brought to Belarus nothing  but an "anticulture, boorishness, dissoluteness, drunkenness,  Russian foul language, idleness, hatred, and lies."    Who forms the basis of the support of the BPF and its leader  Pozniak? There is the community of dilettantes in various  spheres of intellectual activity, first and foremost in science  and art. As a rule, these people are from an urban background  and their knowledge of life comes from the communal kitchens and  from narrow gatherings of like-minded people who are alienated  from the profundity of a world culture which seems hostile to  them and who assert their national culture at the level of  amateur folk events. There is another force on which the BPF  leader is undoubtedly counting -- the steadily growing stratum  of society's dregs, whose only occupation since the very  beginning of perestroyka has been to huddle together at rallies  and processions and, with raucous cries, voice the "people's"  indignation. This is not just the lumpen proletariat, but a  special variety of it -- the lumpen intelligentsia. From their  midst emerged a belligerent and fairly well organized detachment  -- the Belorusian Association of Servicemen -- which donned  uniforms and was not averse to a little saber rattling. Small  businessmen have been infiltrating this circle, making money  from the rampant rise in prices and the customs barriers which  operated until recently in the east. The national card is also  keenly played by the men of letters, who want to preserve the  privileges that they enjoyed in the communist era -- the  enormous print runs which no one ever bought, the royalties,  and, most importantly, the attention lavished on them by the  authorities. It is typical that the culture minister in  Pozniak's "shadow" government has been publicly stating that the  Russian language should be excluded from school syllabuses and  could be "temporarily banned" altogether, that the publication  and study of Russian writers should be stopped, and that such an  "anti-Belarusian" work as Glinka's opera "Ivan Susanin" should  be removed from the stage. And, of course, the "foreigners"  should be thrown out. To these people a foreigner is anyone who  uses Russian. "There is no place for them on Belarusian soil.  These people should be sent back to Russia. The Russians and  Belarusians are different people." Yet it is Russian that the  bulk of the Republic's population speaks!    Just who are these foreigners who have filled our land?  For a long time now the Vietnamese have only been seen trading  in the market places and the Chinese have not reached Belarus  yet. The Americans and other Western "staffers" are only to be  seen at the BPF's headquarters and hardly constitute a "foreign  work force." It is more likely that they provide work for  others. So the logical question to put to the zealous  presidential contender is this: If the inscription  "nationality" is to be removed from Belarusians' passports, will  he not introduce the inscription "native language" so as to  immediately determine who is a citizen of Belarus and who is a  foreigner? And will this paragraph not be ratified by the law  barring certain people from certain professions, which is  already tacitly operating in some parts of our country now?    Five years ago no one could even have conceived that many of  the newspapers and magazines in Belarus would be filled with  anti-Russian articles or that an entire congress of writers  would stand to greet with rapturous applause a presidential  contender who insulted a fraternal Slav people with these words:  "This is a rag-bag of a people without a clearly defined  national territory, alternating with Finno-Ugric, Turkic, Mongol  and other enclaves, and scattered among colonies in Siberia and  Asia. Its dominant consciousness is not national but imperial  in essence...." And the presidential contender's special wrath  is aroused by a Russian minister's statement that "they intend  to defend the rights not just of the ethnic Russians but of the  Russian speakers...."    It goes without saying that Pozniak calls the existence of  the Russian state itself into question. Indeed, in the  presidential contender's mind it no longer exists. "Siberia,  Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Far East, Ukraine, Moldova, and  Belarus must find their own paths.... The creation of a Russian  national state is not ruled out," Pozniak graciously adds.    His hatred of Russia and the Russians knows no bounds. But  is it only the Russians?    Pozniak's ideas extend even further: "...The question of the  return of the east Belarusian lands will be raised again. Along  with the questions of compensation for the Chernobyl disaster,  the USSR gold reserve, property abroad, and so forth. Further  efforts will be made to...create a Baltic-Black Sea association  of states and, in the long term, of all the states of East and  Central Europe -- the former `socialist camp' -- apart from  Russia."    He is categorically opposed to any unification of the  currency system between Russia and Belarus and promises that "a  stable Belarusian currency will be introduced. That will stop  inflation and the rise in prices. It will fill the stores with  high-quality goods."    Pozniak has been intimidating the voters by saying that  "Russia will wage an economic war aimed at destroying the  republic's economy."    Recently some Moscow newspapers have begun claiming that Z.  Pozniak had a drastic change of attitude toward Russia on the  eve of the presidential elections. Would that it were so. Here  is his statement to a correspondent from SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA  (9 June 1994): "Your view is wrong. Russian policy toward  Belarus has not changed for centuries. Therefore, my attitude  toward that country is unchanged, too. Russia, as a vast  Eurasian state with an imperial history and ideology, still  exists, no matter how it is dressed up -- it was, is, and will  remain the enemy of our Belarusian independence and our freedom.  We must proceed from this incontrovertible truth and it alone  when building our real state relations with the East."    Pozniak has mounted his favorite hobby horse and, spurring  it  on with nationalist and anti-Russian ideas, is clearly setting  his sights at the presidency.    But is he not overestimating his own chances of success?</p>

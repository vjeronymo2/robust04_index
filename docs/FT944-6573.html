			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Life raft for parties A referendum on Britain's continued membership of the European Union will be promised by all three national political parties at the next general election. Sure it will. Their respective leaders might deny any such intention, for the 'in or out' question has not been tabled by any of them, not in so many words. It need not be. Circumstances will decide that. The Maastricht treaty allowed specific opt-outs for Britain (and indeed Denmark), but there is no guarantee that such jiggery-pokery will be possible when - if - there is a Maastricht II. If the rest of the EU moves towards further integration and Britain stands back, that will be as good as an 'out' vote. It would certainly be seen as such during the campaign. Support for a plebiscite based on an overtly more innocuous question than 'stay or go' is accumulating. The latest platoon to arrive was heralded in an interview with Sir James Goldsmith on BBC Breakfast with Frost on Sunday. Sir James offered to fund a new British political party 'the purpose of which is only one item, to have a referendum'. Our European Perotista need have no fear. He will not be called upon to lavish millions on a lost cause, as was Mr Ross Perot in the 1992 US presidential election. He should not go to the trouble of writing a cheque to a 30-day-wonder party that does not yet exist. He may not be a serious political figure, but he will have his referendum, gratis. We can count the reasons on three fingers. The Liberal Democrats have promised to consult the people if the intergovernmental conference of 1996 agrees on significant changes to the constitution of the EU. The Labour party has formally left the matter open, but its leader has placed himself in a position to promise a popular vote in much the same circumstances. This would not be expediency, you understand. It would be an expression of democracy, a means of educating the British about where their government is taking them. Meanwhile the Conservatives have moved from the prime minister's original flat rejection of extra-parliamentary decision-making towards Mr Douglas Hurd's expedient 'never say never' of recent days. Goodness me. What tricks the mind does play. Two long years ago, during the tense summer when the passage of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty seemed to be in question, the proposition was put, here as elsewhere, that a promise of a referendum on melding sterling into a single European currency would not only be constitutionally correct, it might even reunite the Conservatives. Did I see the foreign secretary slipping that card up his sleeve, mumbling the while that he would note its usefulness? Surely not. It must be my fevered imagination. Let us move away from such phantasmagoria. It has been objected that a vote on the single currency would destabilise the currency markets for the duration of the campaign. The value of the pound would fluctuate. Titch. Sterling moves every which way, every day. Contemporary markets are destabilised by everything and anything. They were pretty jumpy over the 'join or not' question recently posed in Finland, Austria, Sweden and, on Sunday and Monday, Norway. The planet survived. Without such a popular vote the British polity might not survive - not if our Parliament, from which we feel ever more remote, took us into a single European currency before first asking our permission. As matters stand, the EU is a club in which its members, all sovereign states, sit in constant negotiating session. It has the characteristics of a Gaullist union of nations rather than those of a sapling superstate. Create a single currency and the balance tips sharply the other way. That would be a constitutional leap in the dark for everyone. It is not only the British people who would demand a referendum first. The trouble with 'do you want to defend the pound?' is that most people's emotional response would be that they do. Believe me, Britain will eventually join a European currency, if there is one. Business will see to that. But it might be necessary to hold two referendums about it, the first to say no, the second, yes. Like the business community, the mainstream political establishment knows it can more easily win the overarching 'stay or go' type of question, as it has everywhere in western Europe nearly every time it has been put. When the Danes made the mistake of voting no, they were asked again. This type of question is the 'rubber life raft into which we may all have to climb', as the then Mr James Callaghan remarked when what became the British plebiscite of 1975 was first discussed. Use of this life-saving dinghy is increasing everywhere, we are informed by Referendums around the world, an invaluable reference work published by Macmillan and edited by David Butler and Austin Ranney. Referendums facilitated the overthrow of autocratic regimes in Chile and South Africa. In New Zealand, Ireland and Italy, the voters chose electoral systems that the political leaders of the time asked them to reject. In the US, statewide voter initiatives are becoming as commonplace as national referendums have long been in Switzerland. For the most part electorates are pretty conservative. They tend to go with the established consensus, usually by a decisive majority. That is why Britain voted two to one for membership of the then Common Market in 1975. Whatever type of question is chosen, a referendum on Europe in 1996 might split the Conservative party. Well, yes, in a way, sort of. You cannot properly divide what is already in smithereens. True, a promise of a popular consultation might not heal the wounds evident in yesterday's debate on Britain's contribution to the EU budget. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, mercilessly thumped the sceptics behind him, leaving none unbruised. But we are talking of a mere handful of Tory bitter-enders here. Surely most of the party would come together on a promise to consult the people. As in 1975, cabinet solidarity might have to be suspended so that ministers could campaign on opposite sides. So what? They do that, covertly, now. In sum, a properly managed referendum is a useful, if risky, last-ditch device for getting parties out of trouble and persuading us to vote the way the elite of the day thinks best. My case rests.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- In order to meet the  requirements of Hungarian electoral law, the 15 parties which  qualified to put forth national lists published their electoral  appeals on Wednesday, March 4, urging every eligible voter to  turn out for the first round of elections on May 8. The parties  also called for ensuring fairness in the elections.    The statement issued by the Hungarian Democratic Forum  (MDF),  the leading party of the current governing coalition, emphasized  that "The responsibility for Hungary's future is a burden to be  shared by each of us, now, at the time of the elections, without  any exceptions. In a democracy, this responsibility is also an  opportunity for people outside politics to determine their  country's future policy."    "The coming elections are just as decisive in determining  Hungary's future as were the 1990 general elections, when the  majority of the population voted the socialist system out, to  replace it with democracy and national ascendancy," the MDF  document says.    The MDF has asked everybody to notice the early signs of  economic recovery, even in the midst of everyday worries, and  cast their ballots in awareness of who are those responsible for  the country's past, and which party can ensure a peaceful  future, success and stability for Hungary.    Whether there will be any remarkable change in Hungary will  be the main issue in the elections, the Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ), the biggest opposition party, says in its  election appeal. The Free Democrats give priority to boosting  economic growth, promoting prosperity in agriculture, reducing  unemployment, and guaranteeing social security. "For Hungary,  neither the road followed in the past four decades, nor the one  covered in the past four years, is feasible," the SZDSZ states.    The opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) statement  says, "Voters have become disappointed with the present cabinet,  and obviously want to see a new parliament and a new  cabinet...What is at stake is no longer a change in regime but a  change in government. The country wants to have competent and  honest leaders. This is what the MSZP offers for its voters."    The Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), a member of  the governing coalition, states, "It is easy to criticize the  work done by others, but critics forget that the slow pace of  progress was due not only to the inherited ideological, economic  and political burdens, but also to persistent rebuke by the  opposition." The party offers itself for the voters' attention  as follows, "The Christian Democratic People's Party, which has  increased its membership tenfold over the past four years,  remains a consistent force for Christian national ideals."    According to the appeal of the opposition Federation of  Young  Democrats (Fidesz), Hungarians are dissatisfied with the current  government. "This government should go! We are aware that  voters do not wish to continue the long downward march of the  past four years, involving a decline in production, the  tightening of belts, and a decrease in consumption and living  standards. The Young Democrats say: no more of that! A better  future can begin now, with the next four years," the Fidesz's  states.</p>

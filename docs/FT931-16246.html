			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Burton cuts 2,000 full-time jobs in switch to part-time working BURTON, the retail group, is cutting 2,000 full-time jobs, but creating up to 3,000 part-time ones, in the latest evidence of a growing trend towards part-time employment in retailing. Some 933 head office jobs will be lost, roughly one in four, together with about 1,000 jobs in the group's shops, which include Debenhams, Burtons, Top Shop, Principles and Dorothy Perkins. Mr John Hoerner, who took over as chief executive last February, said yesterday the wide-ranging changes in organisation and management would cost between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m, but would save a similar amount on staff and management costs this year. He said the move towards greater part-time working would enable savings to be made as staff could be targeted to work at the busiest periods. He hoped that many full-time staff would remain as part-time workers. 'There is no question about the fact that as social trends change, and more and more people work and so want to shop outside traditional shopping hours, there will be more part-time workers required', he said. Burton now employs about 36,000 staff, about 17,900 of them part-time. In the retailing sector as a whole, more than a third of workers are part-time, with the proportion expected to increase to 50 per cent. Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said it was alarmed at the prospect of such heavy job losses at a time of high unemployment. 'We are equally worried about this further move away from full-time into part-time employment, which is bound to harm career prospects for our members,' said Mr Frank Murphy, Usdaw's national officer at Burton, who is to meet the management for talks today. Burton, one of the most successful retailers of the 1980s, slipped into an annual loss of Pounds 13.4m in 1990, before recovering to a profit of Pounds 9.4m last year. During that time it saw the departure of two chief executives. Analysts expect profits to top Pounds 30m this year.

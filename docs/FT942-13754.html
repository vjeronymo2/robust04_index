			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Rwanda peace talks offer a ray of hope: George Graham cites the example of Uganda's successful demobilisation programme In bloodied and war-torn Rwanda, a down-payment of Dollars 30m (Pounds 20m) that offered a chance of some demilitarisation, and at least a hope of heading off the last month's descent into chaos, seems like the most tantalising of missed bargains. But with peace talks now scheduled again for today there may, perhaps, be a second chance for a programme prepared by the World Bank and United Nations agencies to demobilise soldiers from both sides of the Rwandan conflict and return them to civilian life. 'The World Bank and its partners were that far away from preventing all that has happened from happening,' says Mr Nat Colletta, a social scientist in the World Bank's poverty and human resources division who designed the programme. If the claim seems ambitious when set against Rwanda's implacable ethnic conflicts, it must be measured against the success already achieved with a similar programme in Uganda - a country also no stranger to strife. At a cost of Dollars 24m, the Bank provided cash payments of just over Dollars 700 a person to resettle some 23,000 discharged soldiers, along with about 50,000 dependents, from Uganda's National Resistance Army. Although the payments were unusual for the Bank, they fitted into the desire of the international financial institutions to reduce the developing countries' level of military spending, which in Uganda's case amounted to 38 per cent of total government spending. While Bank byelaws prevent it from getting involved directly with the army, it was able to step in at the point of discharge with assistance to the demobilised soldiers. While some officials argued within the Bank against singling out veterans to benefit from the payments, the programme's designers were able to argue successfully that the former soldiers and their dependants were, in fact, a vulnerable population group suffering from the effects of economic transition. The programme provided for veterans to be transported back to their home districts, with some supervision from district veterans officers and the provision of social services, including medical care. More than two thirds of the demobilised soldiers chose to go back to farming  -relatively feasible in land-rich Uganda - and the programme is so far showing considerable success. Mr Colletta notes that only 50 cases of crime have been reported among discharged soldiers, far less than the overall crime rate in Uganda. Rwanda, however, presents much more intractable problems - beginning with the political will necessary to implement a demobilisation programme. In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Movement was the clear victor after years of conflict, and expressly asked the World Bank for help with demobilisation. In Rwanda, by contrast, rival factions are still vying for power; at the same time as the Bank was negotiating with the finance ministry on the demobilisation of the army, Rwanda's president was arming the youth militia. Even if the will were there, the implementation of an accord would be more difficult in Rwanda, which has the highest density of population in sub-Saharan Africa. A return of soldiers to farming would have been difficult, so the Bank was seeking to design a largely urban resettlement programme. In addition, local administrative structures are far more deficient than in Uganda, so the programme would have had to depend much more on non-governmental organisations for implementation and supervision. Nevertheless, Mr Colletta believes the potential is there for imaginatively designed transitional programmes to lessen the tinder that sparks so easily into conflict. 'We overestimate how much it would take to get these soldiers to put down their arms. We also underestimate how bloody tired some of these soldiers are of fighting,' he concludes.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Air Liquide confident Air Liquide, the French industrial gases group, should achieve net profits for 1993 similar to the FFr2.2bn (Dollars 372m) recorded in 1992, according to Mr Edouard de Royere, the company's chairman. In a French press interview yesterday, Mr de Royere said he was unable to give any forecasts for next year as the company's subsidiaries have not yet set their targets. But he said that steps had been taken to ensure profitability. Mr de Royere said the group was in a position to expand and was ready 'to seize the opportunities of acquisitions'. He added that the group has the financial resources to be aggressive and the experience to take 'controlled risks'. At the end of last year it had net debts of about FFr4bn and a debt to equity ratio of 20 per cent. The company said that gearing had been reduced during the current year. Mr de Royere cited China as an area of geographical expansion.</p>

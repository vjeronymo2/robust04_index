			<p>BFN     [Text] There was a debate on Bosnia at the National  Assembly this afternoon. France may submit a resolution on  Gorazde to the Security Council, according to Alain Juppe, the  minister of foreign affairs.    Francois Leotard also addressed the Assembly. The minister  of defense justified the intervention by allied planes against  the Serbs in Gorazde. Francois Leotard:    [Begin Leotard recording] We could not allow the attacks on  Gorazde to continue, especially those of these last few days.  We will not permit Gorazde to become another Vukovar.    The events in Gorazde doubtless mark another turning point  in  the Balkan crisis. Either the determination of the  international community will be understood by all the factions,  then the road will be open for fighting to be suspended, and  negotiations to start again. Or the opposite will happen: The  obstinacy of some people, perhaps too the orders of some  military factions, will make the use of force necessary again,  with the increase in military might that this would imply and  the risks that one can imagine would result.    Ladies and gentlemen, I have repeated several times that  there can be no military solution to the Bosnian conflict. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Solvay warns profits will be lower than last year SOLVAY, Belgium's largest chemical group, yesterday downgraded its profits forecast, warning that its net profits would be lower than the BFr11.69bn (Dollars 356m) last year. The group said the general slowdown in European economic activity was to blame for the profits warning. In July, the company had said full-year results would be broadly comparable with 1991. The profits warning follows a series of poor results by German chemical groups, reflecting the slowdown in the German economy. Solvay is the second-largest European manufacturer of PVC, but prices have been hit by overcapacity and imports from former eastern bloc countries. Operating earnings last year from plastics fell 81 per cent to BFr1.7m. The interim dividend is unchanged at BFr100 per share.</p>

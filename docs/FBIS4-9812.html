			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 30 Mar (EFE) -- Official sources reported  here today that the Brazilian Government has ordered an increase  in import duties for wheat over a period of four and a half  months. The sources added, however, that Argentina -- Brazil's  main trade partner in the Common Market of the South (Mercosur)  -- will not be affected by the increase.    The wheat surcharge -- which ranges from 10 to 17 percent --  will be enforced from 15 September 1994 to 31 January 1995, the  period for marketing Brazilian wheat. The measure will  particularly affect U.S., Canadian, and German wheat.    An Agriculture Ministry spokesman told EFE that the decision  is designed to expand trade with Argentina and to promote  Brazilian wheat production.    Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazelli is also studying a  proposal to impose a surcharge on grounds of unfair competition  on any wheat purchased by Brazilian mills from countries that  are subsidizing agricultural production.    The proposal, which is part of a package that would go into  effect until 1997, seeks to make the surcharge match the value  of the subsidies granted by the producing country.    In light of the process of eliminating customs duties within  Mercosur, under which member countries are entitled to an 82  percent tax reduction, the import duties to be paid on Argentine  wheat sold to Brazil amounts to 1.8 percent.    Additionally, a bilateral agreement guarantees the annual  purchase by Brazil of 2 million tonnes of Argentine wheat.  Actual purchases have, however, often been higher than this  minimum figure.    In 1994, Argentina will export between 3 and 3.5 million  tonnes of wheat to Brazil, but the Brazilian imports will total  some 5.5 million tonnes.    Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has described the  purchase of Argentine wheat as a "strategic" decision linked to  integration within Mercosur and has said that Brazilian mills  have acknowledged the advantages of purchasing Argentine wheat  because of the low import duties and lower freight costs  involved.    The Argentine Government has expressed its displeasure over  the U.S. offer to sell 500,000 tonnes of wheat to Brazil at  subsidized prices.    According to official sources in Brasilia, a U.S. Government  delegation has made the offer to Brazilian officials.    Argentine-Brazilian trade, which has markedly increased  since  1990, is negative for Argentina, whose deficit in 1993 amounted  to $1,074,200,000.    According to the Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat, in  1993  Brazilian sales to Argentina totaled $3.7 billion, while its  imports from Argentina totaled $2,625,700,000.</p>

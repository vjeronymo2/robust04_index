			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CHENEY QUERIES AF ON PANAMA  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has asked the Air Force to explain why it  incorrectly told him that both 2,000-pound bombs dropped on Panama by F-117A  Stealth fighters had hit their targets, the Pentagon said today.  </P> <P> Cheney learned that one of the two bombs dropped in the Dec. 20 invasion fell  "way off target" only after making inquiries to the Air Force based on a  reporter's photographs of the bomb craters, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams  said.  </P> <P> "I think the secretary was initially told (by the Air Force) in a good-faith  manner that both bombs had hit their targets," Williams said when asked at the  Pentagon briefing whether the Air Force had deliberately lied to Cheney.  </P> <P> "I don't believe there was any -- as far as I can tell -- any intent to mislead  the secretary," Williams said.  </P> <P> Immediately after the U.S. invasion, Cheney had defended the use of the  high-technology F-117As Stealth fighters in the attack, saying the pinpoint  bombing accuracy of the $106-million planes probably saved both American and  Panamanian lives.  </P> <P> Two F-117As were assigned to drop a 2,000-pound bomb each near the military  barracks at Rio Hato to stun the Panamanian Defense Forces before a parachute  drop by U.S. Army Rangers.  </P> <P> Williams said one of the bombs was on target, hitting about 55 yards from the  barracks, but the other was "way off target" and the miss, "as far as we can  tell, is (due to) pilot error."  </P></p>

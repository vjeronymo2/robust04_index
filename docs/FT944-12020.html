			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Observer: Dialling Dahling Hard to get the measure of Jennifer D'Abo, whose resignation from the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board has caused such a stir. Some regard her as a female Bertie Wooster who wears heart-shaped glasses and calls everybody 'Dahling'. Others regard this as a disguise for an extremely astute businesswoman who is quick to spot money-making opportunities but tends to flit around, the sort who sparks larger-than-life stories. One of Observer's favourites involves a visitor to her house on the Duke of Marlborough's Blenheim estate, who found his way blocked by giant gates. Luckily, he had a mobile phone and was able to contact D'Abo - who jumped into Miss Mink, as she called her black Mercedes, and raced down the two-mile long drive to let in her dinner guest.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Barry docklands scheme launched A Pounds 20m scheme to redevelop derelict docklands at Barry, south Wales, was launched yesterday in an attempt to regenerate what was once the world's busiest coal port, Roland Adburgham writes. Planning consent is being sought for housing, shops, business premises and leisure facilities on 180 acres of land which was formerly rail marshalling yards. The scheme is a joint initiative by Associated British Ports and the Welsh Development Agency. The photograph above - taken in 1936 - shows holidaymakers watching steamers passing through Barry Docks. Site clearance has already started, and an access road linking the docks with the town is being built by Vale of Glamorgan District Council. Next month a separate initiative to regenerate the town itself will be launched by the council, South Glamorgan County Council and the WDA. The deepwater port opened in 1889 with a railway line connecting it to the Rhondda coal mines. Within a decade a town of nearly 30,000 people had grown up, only 10,000 fewer than the present population.</p>

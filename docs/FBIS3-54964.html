			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS string correspondent Semyon Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, January 5 (TASS) -- Forty eight carrier  rockets blasted off the launching pads of Baykonur (Kazakhstan)  and Plesetsk (Russia) during 1993. The rockets launched 59  different space apparatuses into orbit. The share of Plesetsk  northern "space harbour" -- amounted to 26 carrier rockets and  36 space apparatuses.    A two-thirds of the space apparatus launchings were carried  out for the Russian Defence Ministry, and the rest were for  other ministries and departments. The most often used rockets  were the R-7a -- three-stage "Soyuz" carrier rockets (18  launchings) and the "Molnia" four-stage -- (8). Sixty-five per  cent of all space apparatuses were put into orbit during the  first half of 1993. The second quarter of 1993 turned out to be  the busiest period, with 24 Russian satellite launchings.    Such a tight launching schedule of launchings became  possible  only thanks to the hard work put in by the personnel of space  military forces of Russia, three of whom, officers Aleksey  Metelkin, Andrey Nesytov and Vladimir Dubovik (all from  Plesetsk) were decorated with military awards on orders of the  president of the Russian Federation for displaying courage in  conditions which endangered their lives.    But the number of launches in 1993 was less than that  carried  out in 1992, when 55 carrier rockets put 75 space apparatuses  into orbit. This was, firstly, due to the introduction of a new  generation of space systems with long-term functioning periods  in space. For example, the global navigational satellite system  was inducted in 1993. Secondly, due to inadequate state  financing, 1993 was the first year not a single carrier rocket  complex for scientific purposes was launched.    Besides this, the "Proton" carrier rocket disaster of May  27,  1993 delayed carrier rocket launchings for four months. As a  result, only three "Proton" launchings could take place by the  end of 1993.    Nevertheless, the new year promises to be sufficiently busy.  This year's programme will begin with the launching of the  "Soyuz TM-18" manned space ship which is scheduled to be put  into orbit on January 8.</p>

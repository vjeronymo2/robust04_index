			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Management: How to stay in control when your staff is revolting - Lucy Kellaway offers managers a practical guide to coping with difficult colleagues How many difficult people do you have to deal with at work? There is the one who moans incessantly; the paranoid one who will not stop talking; and one who cannot take decisions. There is a prima-donna, a bully and the nervous one who clicks his finger-joints. If only we could find a way of coping with these people, our working lives would be a lot easier. According to Barry Woolf, an expert in anti-social behaviour at work, the first mistake is to confuse difficult people with difficult behaviour. Genuinely difficult people are apparently rare, while nearly everyone is capable of behaving in a difficult way. Quoting recent US research, he says that only 6 per cent of people suffer from the 'real jerk syndrome'. The other 94 per cent 'just want to get along'. Treated properly, they should pose no problems. The whole question is subjective, Woolf told a packed conference organised by IIR Seminar Centre. Everyone is likely to object to behaviour that is the opposite of their own. If you are very efficient, it may be hard to work with someone who is in a permanent muddle and cannot get anything done. They may find your neat lists and schedules equally maddening. The aim, says Woolf (whose modulated voice and unruffleable behaviour might annoy some people), is not to change the 'difficult people', but to change the way they behave towards us and the way we respond to them. We must be more flexible and more tolerant. We must understand and be able to predict the sort of things that are likely to get on our nerves. The idea is to defuse conflict before it arises. Woolf suggests 'pacing' the difficult person, which means copying their body language and even breathing at the same rate, to create the impression of harmony and agreement. However, there is a danger that your colleague may notice you are breathing in an unnatural way and scratching you head each time they scratch theirs: that would surely spoil everything. In most situations, it is going to take more than rhythmic breathing to sort out the problem. Never mind talk about subjectivity, many sorts of behaviour are plain difficult, whichever way you look at it. Some of the most common are: Exploders, who blow up over trivial details. Wet blankets, who contribute nothing, then say: 'I told you so'. Moaners who complain constantly. Gossip-mongers who spread rumours. Backsliders who always say that it's not their fault. Stubborn people who will only do things their way. What makes this sort of behaviour difficult is that it provokes a response in you: you snap back in anger, work yourself up into a private rage, or say something you regret later. The ideal is to recognise the hook and refuse to respond. Say to yourself: 'I am not going to let this get on my nerves'. But sometimes, the behaviour is so obstreperous that something needs to be done. A talk may be a good idea, but according to Woolf, this needs to be handled with great care. He suggests you should: Listen to what is being said. Humour colleagues. Acknowledge what they have to say. Replay the offending event or behaviour to them. Tell them what you feel about it, and note the unfortunate consequences of their behaviour. Explain the changes in a firm, non-challenging way, offering as carrots any positive benefits to the organisation. Woolf's advice may be good, although it rather assumes that the person is already pretty reasonable. Really difficult people are likely to go into orbit if they suspect you are humouring them. Behaving like a saint may help in some cases. Of more practical assistance are his crisis measures to deal with particularly nasty behaviour. BULLIES Let colleagues vent their anger, but try not to take it personally. Separate the emotion from what they are trying to say. Stand up for yourself: explain the benefits of your point of view, and express your disagreement in factual terms. Above all, make sure you have your facts right. Allow them to save face. If all this fails, get help. BLAMERS AND MOANERS If someone is seeking to avoid blame, you should: Make sure that the facts are in the open and point them out. Don't sympathise and, above all, if they are trying to blame you, don't rise to it. If colleagues complain constantly, you should: Make a list of the complaints, and present it to them. Discuss the matter with them surrounded by positive people. Ask: 'What are you going to do to fix the problem?' PROCRASTINATORS Set a system or diary, and make sure they know what they are supposed to be doing and by when. Be supportive of their efforts. Follow up, keeping close tabs. These stereotypes may be of no help with your difficult people. In general, Woolf recommends a six-step written Master Plan that will deal with everyone. It involves writing down: Details of your difficult people and their particularly annoying characteristics. Why you are vulnerable to them. What specifically the person does to trap you Your typical response. A plan to deal with the problem, and a list of expected advantages. Later, monitor your progress. If you can make this list without getting into a fury at the very thought of your difficult person, you may be on the way to cracking the problem.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An officer in the Defense Force says it is nonsense  for officials in the Defense Force and the Police to say they  have no knowledge of the maneuvers of Operation Sunrise and the  SACP [South African Communist Party] document in which the  procedure for a takeover has been detailed.    He said the document was distributed among various Defense  Force elements, police and government officials at the end of  last year. According to his evidence, the document had also been  discussed in Parliament, and it is therefore unimaginable that  the authenticity or existence of the document should in the  least be doubted. He said if the document was false, then it is  coincidental that the communist onslaught spelled out in the  document should coincide with recent events throughout the  country, and with those that have already taken place.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Life's a beach when the water's dirty: Bronwen Maddox on a row over EC standards Angry Blackpool hotel managers this week accused Brussels of double standards, following the ruling by the European Court of Justice that the resort's beach fell below EC standards. 'They have far bigger problems abroad, where they have sewers running into the streets, but we always get the brunt of it,' said Mr John Donovan, secretary of the 1,300-strong Blackpool Hotel and Guest House Association. The ruling has touched a nerve in Britain, against a background of national unease about the extent of Brussels' influence. It has also inflamed a simmering row about whether EC water standards are unnecessarily high. The day before the Blackpool judgment, Ofwat, the UK water industry regulator, argued that the UK should ask for more time to meet EC rules to slow down the rise in customers' bills. The controversy is likely to be long and emotive because the EC directives on bathing and drinking water and on the treatment of waste water from towns have been among the Commission's most popular measures  - until the costs of compliance began to be clear. They stipulate the maximum permissible levels of bacteria, chemicals and minerals that can be present in drinking water and at designated bathing beaches, and standards of sewage treatment. Among other changes, they have forced Britain to agree to stop piping untreated sewage into the sea by 1998. But the investment needed is high. The UK water industry has embarked on an investment programme that could top Pounds 45bn this decade. The consequence, Mr Byatt points out, is that customers' bills will rise much faster than the rate of inflation. The UK government, responding to public concern about bills, has complained that many other EC countries are not making the same effort. It points out that court actions on beach standards are pending against all other member countries except Denmark, and that the UK's vigorous pressure groups precipitate more legal actions than those in other countries. However, the European Commission this week rejected Mr Byatt's call for more time. It said the EC directive on urban waste water had been agreed by all EC countries, and that some of the poorest had started implementing it. The Commission also joined with environmentalists in telling the UK government to make water polluters pay more. Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, said: 'Mr Byatt poses a false choice - allowing pollution on welfare grounds. If you want to meet a social objective, such as helping poorer households with high water bills, you should do it through welfare not environmental policy.' The Commission acknowledges one element of the UK's complaint: the lack of comprehensive and comparable data. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said: 'There is no way to compare the excellent quality of our drinking water with other countries.' The Department of the Environment argues that no other member country has the equivalent of the Drinking Water Inspectorate, set up in 1990 to ensure that water companies meet regulations. The inspectorate, which will produce its third report at the end of the month, found last year that 98.7 per cent of companies complied with national legal standards that are the same or higher than EC rules. Water companies and environmentalists alike have found it frustrating that comparable figures are not available for most other EC countries. Data on beach quality are slightly better, partly because public demand for information has been greater. The EC compiles a league table, according to which the UK is the second dirtiest country, with 79 per cent of beaches complying, better only than Germany with 76 per cent. But the data are supplied by the member countries and the Commission warns that sampling and testing methods differ. The EC-wide Blue Flag scheme, the best known of the European beach guides, suffers the same handicap. The UK and Germany have complained that the Blue Flag tests are applied unevenly, with dispensations given to Ireland, Denmark, Netherlands and France. The Tidy Britain Group, a charity part-funded by the DoE, which administers the UK contribution to the Blue Flag scheme, said last month that it was considering withdrawing because of unfairness. Grumbles with European-wide league tables have spawned a plethora of national ranking tables. The Tidy Britain Group has launched its own Seaside Award scheme, and jousted last month with the Marine Conservation Society's Good Beach Guide about which was the more thorough. The Commission has increasingly shown itself sensitive to complaints about uneven enforcement, and officials argue that the information about compliance will gradually improve. However, the Commission's awareness of the problem gives little comfort to those about to set off on a holiday somewhere in the EC. We are still a long way from knowing what is in the tap water, and whether you can safely swim in the sea.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Picking up the pieces: Orange County's bankruptcy will have far-reaching repercussions Viewed from the waterfront at Newport Beach, the notion of Orange County being hard-up seems preposterous. The scene is simply too opulent: the big houses among the palm trees, the yachts at their jetties. Pelicans flap over the blue water and the Californian sun shines down relentlessly. Orange County, surely, should be the last place in the world to go under. This, of course, is just the point. When the county filed for bankruptcy six days ago, it did so because it had borrowed Dollars 12bn (Pounds 8bn) to play the financial markets and had lost upwards of Dollars 1.5bn in the process. Even in Wall Street terms, Dollars 12bn is a lot of money. The banks that lent it did so because they thought Orange County could afford it. The county's treasurer, Mr Robert Citron, who resigned 10 days ago, had borrowed the money to buy investments that pay a higher return as interest rates fall. The banks held these securities as collateral for their loans, and when rises in interest rates forced Mr Citron to default, several of the banks, led by CS First Boston, cancelled the agreements and sold the securities, precipitating the crisis. According to Mr John Moorlach, who stood unsuccessfully against Mr Citron in the election for treasurer in the spring, it will be 'a miracle' if the losses end up less than Dollars 2bn. They could, he says, be as high as Dollars 3bn. Whatever the name suggests, Orange County is in no sense quaint or rural. It is part of the suburban sprawl of southern California, an up-market extension of Los Angeles. On the direct flight from New York to the county's John Wayne airport - a large, imposing affair of glass and near-marble - every other passenger seems to be an investment banker or lawyer, with laptop on knee and suit hanging wrinkle-free in its leather case. Not all of Orange County is as wealthy as Newport Beach, however. The Vietnamese quarter in the town of Westminster is scarcely flashy; in the county seat of Santa Ana, some of the Hispanic areas look almost impoverished. Disneyland, in the town of Anaheim, is surrounded by streets that in a less benign climate might seem positively dreary. And indeed, all is not well with the Orange County economy. Like the rest of southern California, it is unhealthily dependent on defence and real estate. Its biggest employers are McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell and Hughes Aircraft, all of which have been badly hit by cuts in defence spending. Even Disneyland - another big employer - has been suffering poor attendances lately. Orange County house prices have fallen every year since 1991 and are still falling. According to economists at the local Chapman University, real estate values have dropped by Dollars 22.5bn since 1991. The county lost 29,000 jobs in 1991, then another 28,000 in 1992-94. At 6 per cent, the local unemployment rate is a touch above the national average. Given that the rest of southern California has been worse hit by the same problems, the county could never expect help from outside. The average house price in Orange County is still almost Dollars 250,000, the median family income Dollars 54,000. Internally, too, the county administration has been constrained in what it could do to raise cash. Ever since 1978, California's Proposition 13 has restricted the freedom of local authorities to put up taxes. When Mr Citron sought a high return on Orange County's investments, he was not simply being irresponsible. The county needed the money to balance its books. The other way of raising cash was through the municipal bond market. The county did so with a vengeance. The Los Angeles Times calculates that last year alone, Orange County municipalities and various public agencies raised Dollars 4.9bn in a total of 121 bond issues. The county's calamitous losses on its investment portfolio are therefore doubly damaging. The losses could severely limit the county's future access to the municipal bond market, where buyers are typically, risk-averse small investors. They are unlikely to see Orange County as a prudent investment after the past week's torrent of publicity. The reaction of Orange County's inhabitants to all this is still slightly dazed. Judging by the letters and calls to the local newspaper, the Orange County Register, the growing tide of anger is directed less against Mr Citron, and more against the county's board of supervisors. Like Mr Citron, these are elected officials. If they had done their job of supervision, they ask, how could Mr Citron have invested some Dollars 8bn of borrowed money in the course of the past year alone? There is also growing resentment over the role of Wall Street and the big broking houses that profited handsomely by financing Mr Citron's speculations and then pulled the rug out from under the county. The bankruptcy, desperate measure as it was, represented an attempt to stop holders of Dollars 10bn of Orange County investments from selling them after CS First Boston sold some Dollars 2bn of securities it held as collateral on a loan to the county. Most of them went ahead anyway, despite the county's insistence that they were breaking the law. Owing to the unprecedented nature of Orange County's bankruptcy, the point has yet to be tested in the courts. A prominent bankruptcy lawyer quoted in the Los Angeles Times last week could scarcely conceal his relish. 'There are kids running around in Orange County in junior high (school) today', he said, 'who will be joining this case once they get through law school.' The liquidation of these investments means that the county's losses, previously on paper, are being realised. In Orange County, this seems like a classic case of Wall Street taking it out on California. In New York, however, there is a different perception. The scale of events is such that even hardened investment bankers are shaken. The dumping of billions of dollars of investments in the space of a few hours is not to be taken lightly, especially if there is a lingering suspicion that they belong to someone else. More generally, there is the feeling that the Orange County affair is the high-water mark of a certain type of speculation. Under the benign eye of the US Federal Reserve, the early 1990s were a time when betting on falling interest rates was money for old rope. The damage when rates rose, as they did in the spring, was inevitable. Most of the cases already publicised have attracted less sympathy than that of Orange County. A company such as Procter &amp; Gamble is a commercial organisation, and seen as able to take care of itself if it chooses to become involved with highly complex derivatives. As the embittered taxpayers of Orange County point out, however, the money in their fund was not there to gamble with. It was to build roads and schools and pay the wages of the county's workers. Now that Orange County is left to pick up the pieces, it has made a promising start in the choice last Thursday of Mr Thomas Hayes to take over the financial reins. Mr Hayes, aged 48, was auditor-general for the state of California for 10 years. Then, for two years, he did Mr Citron's job on a bigger scale, as California's elected treasurer in charge of the state's Dollars 20bn investment fund. A cautious, conservative financial specialist, Mr Hayes did a decent and cautious job, by all accounts, achieving a reasonable but not spectacular return. When he stood unsuccessfully for re-election in 1990, his caution was turned against him. Look how meagre his results were, his opponent is reported to have argued, compared with Orange County. If the voters of California had known where Orange County might end up, the result might have been rather different. For now, however, Mr Hayes must do the best he can to protect the citizens of Newport Beach and the rest of the county from the consequences of the losses incurred by Mr Citron's investment strategy.</p>

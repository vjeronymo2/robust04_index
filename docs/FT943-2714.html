			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / German move boosts Brussels efforts to control trade policy The European Commission has been given a boost in its efforts to control the European Union's international trade policy, under a proposed compromise drawn up by the German presidency of the Council of Ministers. The draft compromise is intended to help resolve a complex legal battle between the Commission and member states. The dispute threatens to delay EU ratification of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round world trade deal, due to come into effect at the start of 1995. However, the proposal is still likely to be resisted by some of the 12 member states, particularly the UK and France, which must approve it unanimously if the row is to be defused. Most EU governments object that the Commission is over-stepping its authority by insisting the round can be ratified by giving the Commission sole power to negotiate trade agreements. The governments argue that this authority does not cover agreements in areas such as services and intellectual property. They say ratification of these aspects, and the Commission's authority to negotiate on them in the planned World Trade Organisation, requires additional legislation. However, a draft of the German presidency's proposed compromise goes a long way to satisfying the Commission's demands. It says: 'The commission will speak and negotiate on behalf of the community and the member states in the WTO.' The draft adds that member states' freedom to speak out individually in the WTO would be subject to a code of conduct which would leave them little scope for action. The code of conduct is also likely to anger the European Parliament. The parliament says it has a right of consultation on the procedure that the code - which makes no reference to the parliament whatsoever - tries to circumvent. Positions taken in trade matters should 'result from a common decision arrived at wherever possible on the basis of a Commission proposal', the code states. When that proves impossible, it may be decided 'at an appropriate level by consensus that each member state will be free to present its own position'. Santer's challenge, Page 9</p>

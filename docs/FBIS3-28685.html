			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- A government panel on  Wednesday [9 February] called for a tax system reform and  further spending cuts in order to rebuild Japan's fiscal  standing.    The Fiscal System Council, an advisory body to the Finance  Minister, endorsed bond issuance for the government's new  stimulus package as "an exceptional and inevitable option" under  the current economic and fiscal conditions. But ways of  repaying such bonds should be ensured in a tax system reform the  government promised to make by the end of this year, the panel  said in a report.    The report was presented to Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii  on Wednesday so that recommendations can be reflected in the  fiscal 1994 budget, to be formulated shortly.    Speaking before a press conference, Eiji Suzuki, the head of  the panel, voiced concern over the government's failure to  secure a specific way of financing the 5.85 trillion yen tax cut  envisioned in the latest pump-priming package. The government  coffers would be eroded further without funds to cover the tax  cuts, the report said, citing a call for the government to carry  out its pledged tax system reform "in a responsible manner."    The report noted Japan's tax revenues, which dropped in  fiscal 1991 and 1992, are expected to slip substantially in  fiscal 1993.    As a way to strengthen Japan's fiscal base, the panel, in a  separate report, urged all-out government efforts to slash  spending. The report called for a drastic review of spending  allocations for public projects, budget areas widely viewed as  rigid due to turf battles among ministries.    In order to get rid of this rigidity, the panel recommended  setting priority areas based on actual spending needs.    Required spending cuts cited by the report also include  social security, education, defense, agriculture and  transportation.</p>

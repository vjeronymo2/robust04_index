			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: How to minimise your obligations to the taxman Paulo has arrived from Italy to set up a business in Britain through a UK company. He is UK resident but not domiciled. What should he do to minimise his tax obligations? Capital gains tax To escape CGT, it is better for him not to own the shares personally but through an offshore trust. Any gain made on selling the company would then be free of CGT. Inheritance tax Since Paulo is not domiciled in the UK, he is liable to pay IHT only on assets owned there, such as his company. Paulo would, therefore, be well advised to own this company through an offshore company since he would not then own the UK assets directly. This advantage would stop once he had been resident in the UK for 17 of the previous 20 years. But if he had placed his offshore company into a trust before the 17 years, the arrangement could continue indefinitely. It might, however, backfire for income tax purposes. If the income was brought back to the UK, it could be taxed without any allowance for the tax credit on the UK dividend.</p>

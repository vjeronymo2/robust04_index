			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service believes that recent survey results provide the most accurate estimate of the number of pairs that will nest along the Colville River when the population is in a normal, healthy condition. Furthermore, the Service's post-delisting monitoring plan for arctic peregrine falcons is designed to detect a change in the status of the subspecies. The Service believes that a significant (25 percent or more) change in population size will indicate that some factor or factors is affecting either reproductive performance or survival within the population. A change in productivity or survival will be more quickly detected and accurately measured if recent population estimates are used as baseline levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The monitoring plan should be expanded to include one nesting area in the Canadian arctic, one nesting area in Greenland, and migration data from Assateague Island, Maryland, and Cedar Grove, Wisconsin. Cooperative agreements should be pursued with the governments of Canada and Greenland to ensure the continuation of projects in those nations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In formulating the monitoring plan, the Service emphasized breeding surveys conducted in Alaska because surveys in northern Alaska were designed to measure the criteria listed in the Peregrine Falcon Recovery Plan, specifically, population size, reproductive performance, and contaminant levels. These factors are the most important in monitoring the status, trends, and threats to the subspecies, and they are not consistently measured in any other study area in North America. Additionally, the Service has greater influence over the funding and implementation of monitoring efforts conducted in the United States, and in particular, those conducted by the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service agrees that continuation of on-going research on arctic peregrine falcons will contribute greatly to monitoring the subspecies following delisting. In particular, three nesting surveys in the NWT, Canada, and one in Greenland, and counts of migrants conducted at a number of different sites have provided data substantiating the recovery of the subspecies. The delisting criteria have been modified to consider information on breeding pairs gathered in Canada and Greenland. In addition, the Service intends to utilize all available information when reviewing the overall status of the subspecies, and will encourage the continuation of all research efforts wherever possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The monitoring plan should be extended to 10 years to allow adequate measurement of the impacts of resumed falconry harvest, to compensate for short-term variability in productivity due to weather and other variables, and to measure long-term changes in organochlorine contamination and eggshell thickness. This is particularly important because the Service reevaluated criteria concerning organochlorine concentrations in eggs and eggshell thickness in the recovery plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although two of the recovery criteria in the original recovery plan were reevaluated to reflect current information, the Service feels that the subspecies has recovered sufficiently to warrant delisting without reservation. At the end of the minimum 5-year monitoring period, the Service will review all available information, including organochlorine contamination and eggshell thickness, to decide if continuation of monitoring is warranted for any reason. The Service believes that this evaluation process allows for adequate consideration of all pertinent factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of the comments received on the draft monitoring plan, the Service has produced the following monitoring plan. This plan will be revised, as appropriate, to incorporate new knowledge of threats to the subspecies, research techniques, or other applicable information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Monitoring plan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, exposure to organochlorines, particularly DDT, was the primary factor causing the decline of arctic peregrine falcons. Organochlorines affected populations by reducing reproductive success, although the mortality rate of adults and juveniles may have increased as well. As productivity and recruitment declined to levels insufficient to replace mortality, populations dwindled. This monitoring plan, therefore, is designed to detect changes in the status of arctic peregrine falcons by monitoring population size, reproductive performance, and contamination with organochlorine pesticides and other pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reviewing the status of arctic peregrine falcons and preparing the proposal to delist the subspecies, the Service relied heavily on data provided by Service biologists. However, information from research projects conducted by non-governmental organizations and Canadian provincial agencies was also used extensively. The Service is hopeful that research efforts will continue and that investigators will continue to share data with the Service for management purposes. Monitoring efforts, therefore, will utilize to the fullest extent possible information collected at a number of sites by a variety of organizations and agencies. However, information on each of the parameters to be measured is not collected in every research project. A discussion of each parameter, how the parameter is measured or evaluated, and likely sources of data on the parameter follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Number of Breeding Pairs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To detect changes in population size, the Service will rely on counts of the number of breeding pairs in selected areas in North America. In order to detect a change in population size in a given area, surveys must be conducted for several years, and the survey area, methods, and timing must be consistent among years. Surveys in four areas have met these criteria. These areas are the Colville River in Alaska and Hope Bay, Coppermine, and Rankin Inlet in the NWT, Canada. Results from surveys in other areas that meet these criteria will be included in future status reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reproductive Performance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To assess reproductive performance, the Service will rely on counts of the number of young produced per territorial pair. Such data are currently available only from the Colville River, Rankin Inlet, and western Greenland study areas; however, pre-DDT era data on reproductive performance are only available for the Colville River study area. In reviewing data on reproductive performance, the Service will utilize information from all study areas where appropriate data are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contaminant Exposure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service will analyze arctic peregrine falcon blood and eggs in Service-contracted laboratories to monitor exposure to organochlorine pesticides and other environmental contaminants. The Service will collect addled eggs along the Colville River, Alaska, as feasible, during 1995&hyph;1999. In addition, the Service will continue its ongoing long-term study on contamination levels by collecting at least 10 eggs in a given year (repeated at approximately 5-year intervals), so that residues at the end of the minimum 5-year monitoring period can be compared with residues found in earlier periods. Additionally, the Service will encourage the collection of eggs from Rankin Inlet, NWT, and western Greenland, near or at the end the minimum 5-year monitoring period for comparison to earlier collections in those areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

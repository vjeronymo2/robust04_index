			<p>BFN     [Text] President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija  Izetbegovic today received U.S. President Clinton's special  envoy Charles Redman regarding the most dramatic situation in  Gorazde. The talks were also attended by Bosnia-Herzegovina  Premier Haris Silajdzic and U.S. Ambassador to  Bosnia-Herzegovina Victor Jakovich.    The situation in Gorazde is critical indeed. We are  examining the problem very seriously, and I hope the necessary  steps will be taken. This is all I can tell you, Redman said  following the meeting.    Asked by reporters whether the ferocity of the fighting has  subsided following the threat of air strikes unless an end is  put to the offensive, Redman says: This was in the morning [as  heard]. Since noon the situation has changed and become very  serious due to Serb advances.    Turkish President Demirel talked over the phone with  Izetbegovic late this afternoon. President Demirel called  President Izetbegovic to tell him that Turkey would do its best  to initiate actions that would provide protection for the  citizens of Gorazde.</p>

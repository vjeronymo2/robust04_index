			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan: "Libyan Mediation Between </F> Afghan Factions"]    [Text] Peshawar -- A nine-member Libyan committee headed by  Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Dayrah, dean of the Da'wah and Religious  Principles College, has arrived in Peshawar to mediate between  the warring Afghan factions. Dayrah told AL-HAYAH yesterday  that the committee stemmed from a conference called for by the  ulema and mosque preachers in Libya during the month of Ramadan.  During that conference, four committees were formed to go to  Islamic hotbeds of tension to help put an end to Muslim  tragedies. "One committee proceeded to Somalia, a second  committee went to Bosnia-Herzegovina, a third to the Kurds, and  a fourth to Afghanistan."    On the reasons for the committee's late arrival, he said  that  "the U.S. blockade against Libya and visa procedures and  complications contributed to the delay."    The committee chairman denied the existence of any  preconceived plan. He said: "We are judges and we must hear  the views of all parties and then give our opinion as to how the  problem could be solved." He urged all the factions "not to  waste the gains of 14 years of jihad." He added: "We have  long-standing relations with the mujahidin. We do not object to  mediation by any country for the desired peace. Libya is not a  state neighboring Afghanistan. We have no interests there and we  do not covet its wealth. All we want is to see peace  established there."    Informed Afghan sources told AL-HAYAH yesterday that Afghan  President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin  Hekmatyar have accepted the Libyan mediation which coincides  with the work of other Afghan and non-Afghan committees.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'MATLOCK' HATED THE LAUGHTER  </P> <P> Andy Griffith credits a grammar school performance and his hatred of being  laughed at as the impetus for his acting career.  </P> <P> "I was laughed at all the time" as a child, the 63-year-old actor said in an  interview in Parade magazine for next Sunday.  </P> <P> He recalled an instance during a third-grade play that made him realize that he  could make people laugh with him, instead of at him.  </P> <P> "I discovered that I could control why they laughed by doing something overt to  make them laugh," Griffith said. "I was being laughed at, I hated it, so I made  an adjustment to control the situation. All comics learn that."  </P> <P> The result was a successful career that included eight years as Mayberry's  lovable sheriff on "The Andy Griffith Show," a host of specials and most  recently "Matlock," a series in which he plays a lawyer who always gets his  clients off the hook.  </P></p>

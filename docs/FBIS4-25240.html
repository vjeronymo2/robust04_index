			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shi Qingbin (2457 3237 1755)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 1 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Li Yonggui,  deputy director of the State General Administration of Taxation,  has indicated that real estate transferred in the period before  the implementation of the land value-added tax regulations will  be exempted from tax, adding that exemptions will be provided  under two conditions after the enforcement of the land  value-added tax regulations. First, standard apartments built  by tax payers will be exempted from value-added tax as long as  their value added does not exceed 20 percent of the amount of  items for deduction. Second, real estate requisitioned or  recovered for state construction projects will be exempted from  value-added tax.    While attending a recent seminar in Hong Kong, Li Yonggui  said that the basis for calculating value-added tax is the  amount deducted from real estate sales income. Items for  deduction include the following:    --The amount paid for the acquisition of land utility  rights.    --The cost and expense of land reclamation.    --The cost and expense for the construction of new houses  and  facilities, or the appraisal prices of old houses and buildings.    --The tax amount related to real estate transfers.    --Other items for deduction listed by the Ministry of  Finance.    He pointed out that these are the principles of the  regulations and that the details will be clarified in the  implementation rules.    In Li Yonggui's opinion, it is reasonable to say that  inflation and risk-bearing factors should be included in the  items for deduction and that this will be taken into account  when working out the implementation rules, according to the  regulations on "items for deduction listed by the Ministry of  Finance."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In his interview with the agency Interfax-Ukraine  Nikolay Mikhalchenko, leader of the Ukrainian president's  domestic policy service, said that a corresponding decree of the  republic determines the functions of the Ukrainian president's  envoy in the Crimea and Valeriy Gorbatov who was recently  appointed to this post is to be guided by this decree. In  Mikhalchenko's words, Kravchuk's corresponding decree just fixes  Gorbatov's appointment.    While explaining the functions of the Ukrainian president's  envoy in the Crimea at the request of Interfax-Ukraine agency,  leader of the presidential juridical service Ivan Timchenko said  that "he (the envoy) will primarily fulfill control functions  providing for the observance of the Ukrainian legislature and  Ukraine's Constitution by the Crimean president." Timchenko  added that the presidential envoy would maintain constant  contacts between the central power bodies in Kiev and Simferopol.    Mikhalchenko explained that the question concerns the  control  over the decree On Division of Authorities between Ukraine and  the Crimea both on the part of the Crimea and Ukraine. "This  decree should be fulfilled both by the autonomy and the central  government," underlined Mikhalchenko.    In his words, the presidential envoy in the Crimea will not  be in charge for the Black Sea Fleet problem because this issue  is to be considered at an inter-state level. "The leadership of  the Crimean autonomy has only consultative functions in this  sphere," emphasized Mikhalchenko.</p>

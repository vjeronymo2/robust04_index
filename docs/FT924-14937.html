			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Personal View: The consumer is sold short - again Over the next few months hundreds of thousands of savers will learn whether they will continue to be sold life assurance policies they do not need. The UK's Office of Fair Trading is studying a report by the Securities and Investments Board (Sib), the industry regulator, and Lautro, the insurance sector watchdog, which lays down new rules on the sale of savings products. These rules are the result of a two-year review of sales practices - the so-called retail regulation review. The review provided a golden opportunity to improve the way savings schemes are sold to an increasingly savings-conscious nation. Yet these self-regulatory watchdogs have proposed little more than recommendations which largely justify existing rules. So has the consumer benefited from the self-regulation of the past few years? The evidence suggests not. Consider the following: Figures from Sib show that between 25-33 per cent of insurance policies will be surrendered within the first two years of their life. The investors concerned will lose part or all of their money; The continued growth in sales of endowment policies - a form of savings scheme which lost its competitive edge when income tax relief on premiums was abolished in 1984. Endowment policies do not match the returns from personal equity plans. Yet in 1991 nearly four in every five mortgages was backed by an endowment policy. These are not the signs of a competitive market offering consumers choice and value. Since the Financial Services Act of 1986, which introduced regulation into the industry, the situation has deteriorated. Commissions and expenses - ultimately paid for by the consumer - have risen. Before 1988, an appointed representative earned Pounds 396 in commission for selling a 25-year endowment policy with a monthly premium of Pounds 50. Now, the average commission is Pounds 570. And competition, too, has declined. Most of the real competition takes place through the better independent financial advisers (IFAs). But regulation has forced many IFAs to become tied agents, selling only one company's products. Tied agents need not declare the commission they receive for selling a savings scheme; with an IFA, the consumer has a right to this information. The IFA has become an endangered species, particularly at the lower end of the market where consumers are most vulnerable. The number of independent advisers has dropped sharply and all but one of Britain's 10 largest building societies are now tied to one company's products. The regulatory system has failed for two main reasons. First, it is based on an unrealistic model of competition. Second, existing rules are weak and their enforcement timid. The competition model assumes that if consumers are given enough information at the point of sale, they will select the right product. This ignores the complexity of many savings and pension products and the difficulty of comparing one with another. Consumers, even the financially literate, will usually rely on the sales-person. The model also misconceives the sales process. For example, anyone thinking of buying a savings product is supposed to receive a 'buyer's guide' which states whether the sales-person is a tied agent or an IFA. Often, the sales-person does not hand over the guide. More important, most consumers do not read the material in the presence of the sales-person; they rely on what they are told. Furthermore, the majority of people have little appreciation of the significance of the IFA/tied agent distinction. Enforcement is so timid that many life companies just pay lip service to the rules. It is little surprise that many consumers still fall victim to the life assurance industry's aggressive selling techniques. The Sib/Lautro proposals will, at best, make only a modest difference. For instance, the proposals stop short of insisting that the amount taken out of a scheme's returns by charges and commissions is expressed as a simple cash sum - the figure which the regulator's own research suggests people find easiest to grasp. And there is no suggestion to remedy the imbalance between IFAs and tied agents in terms of their disclosure on commissions, which so threatens the future of the independents. The regulators' staff are committed to consumer protection, but, too often, their proposals are so diluted by industry pressure as to be ineffectual. Self-regulation raises conflicts of interest: the principal loyalty of the industry representatives on the boards of the self-regulatory organisations will inevitably be to their companies, not consumers. The contrast with the regulation of the privatised industries is stark. If the directors of British Telecom had dominated Oftel, the industry watchdog, we would surely not have had the recently-announced price cuts. There is much that a bold regulator could do to protect the consumer and promote real competition. The SIB/Lautro proposals will not achieve this. They are the grudging concessions of an industry trying to preserve the status quo. We will not see real competition or better value for the consumer until the regulators are controlled by members representing the public.

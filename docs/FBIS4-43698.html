			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Democratic Party of the Left: A </F> Battle Is Raging Over D'Alema"]    [Text] Rome -- A race against the clock has started for  [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Deputy Secretary] Massimo  D'Alema, who so far is the only "visible" and accredited  candidate nominated to succeed Achille Occhetto as secretary of  the PDS. PDS officials responsible for political coordination  are to call a meeting of the National Council -- the  miniparliament entrusted with the task of electing the secretary  -- on 28 and 29 June. It will not be easy for D'Alema to take  over the party's leadership, however. In order to do so, he  will need to obtain a majority plus one in the National Council,  comprising approximately 500 members -- but Occhetto intends to  stand in the way. [Venice Mayor] Cacciari has invited the PDS  to postpone the election until November and constitute an  interim "directory" which will guide the transition process and  enable the party to work out its position in relation to the  progressive coalition as a whole. However, D'Alema cannot  afford to wait: [L'UNITA editor] Veltroni might become a  dangerous opponent.</p>

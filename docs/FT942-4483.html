			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / People: Bob Fisher promoted at TI Bob Fisher, 55, chief executive of John Crane, one of TI's three core businesses, has been appointed managing director, operations, of the TI Group. Fisher's new job as TI's effective chief operating officer is part of a board reshuffle which still leaves unclear who is the front-runner to take over as chief executive when chairman Sir Christopher Lewinton, 62, eventually splits his role. The chief executives of Crane and Bundy, two of TI's three main businesses, will now report to Fisher, who will be based at TI's London office. He has been given the task of 'leveraging the resources' of the group across all its core businesses and will also be responsible for developing TI's regional strategy for Asia Pacific. One city analyst suggested that Fisher's appointment indicated that he was the chief executive designate. However, other analysts disagreed, noting that Tony Edwards, 49, chief executive of TI's recently acquired Dowty aerospace business, will continue to report to the chairman. Meanwhile, Brian Walsh, 50, GKN's former finance director who joined TI just over a year ago, has been promoted to the new post of vice chairman. Walsh adds responsibility for the operations of the group's headquarters to his finance director's role. Bundy chief executive John Potter, 51, takes over from Fisher as chief executive of Crane and will move to Crane's Chicago headquarters. Bill Laule, 45, president of Bundy North America, is moving to the UK to take over as chief executive of Bundy. James Roe, 49, director of strategic development for six years, also joins the TI board, He adds global responsibility for human resources and communications to his current job.</p>

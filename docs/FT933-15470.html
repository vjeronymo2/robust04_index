			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ferfin owes top Italian banks L15,000bn FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the diversified industrial group which is in financial difficulties, owes about L15,000bn (Dollars 9.7bn) to Italy's 10 biggest banks. Mr Vincenzo Desario, the deputy director general of the Bank of Italy, who revealed the information to a parliamentary committee yesterday, did not specify how much individual banks had lent. Ferfin, which has total borrowings of about L31,000bn, is being guided by a committee of its five principal bank creditors, led by Mediobanca. The other banks involved, Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Credito Italiano, Banca di Roma and Banca Commerciale Italiana, have not all revealed their exposures. However, Credito Italiano lent L1,300bn, while BCI lent about L700bn. Mr Desario said the 10 biggest domestic banks had lent in aggregate about 21 per cent of their capital to Ferfin. However, he said the figure was within the 25 per cent limit set by the European Community. About L6,500bn in Ferfin's total borrowings came from about 110 foreign banks. Mr Desario said San Paolo, believed to be the biggest creditor, had lent about 31 per cent of its shareholders' funds. That was in line with the current 40 per cent limit, due to fall to 25 per cent in 1998. Six other banks had lent more than L1,000bn, while seven had lent between L500bn and L1,000bn and 14 more than L100bn. Mr Desario said the Ferruzzi family should not shirk its responsibilities in the crisis affecting the group. The family, which owns about 48 per cent of the group, should be the first to 'pay' as a 'minimum condition for the restructuring plan to go ahead'. A long-awaited shareholders' meeting of Serafino Ferruzzi, the family holding company which owns the Ferfin stake, has not yet taken place, amid signs of possible division between the family and Mediobanca.</p>

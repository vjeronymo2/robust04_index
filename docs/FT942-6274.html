			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop (8): A serious challenge from the US / Japan's computer companies become more vulnerable to aggressive outside forces The city of Mino, to the north of Osaka, may seem an unlikely site for a progressive policy on technology. But the educational council in Mino broke with widespread practice in Japan and chose Apple's Macintosh personal computers for its 13 primary and seven junior high schools. Japan's leading computer makers are being confronted with a serious challenge from US companies like Apple to their own dominance in the home market where they once ruled supreme. Last year, Apple Computer won a 13.9 per cent share of Japan's personal computer market, overtaking Fujitsu as the second largest PC vendor in Japan after NEC, according to Dataquest, industry analysts. US computer makers as a whole increased their share of the Japanese market in 1993 to 24 per cent, up from 15 per cent in 1992, Dataquest notes. At the same time, many Japanese computer makers themselves have started to market IBM-compatible machines, completely reversing their previous strategy of selling only their own proprietary systems in Japan. Last October, Fujitsu, which had previously sold only PCs based on its own architecture in the home market, began selling IBM-compatible computers. Earlier this year, Seiko Epson, which had long stuck faithfully to NEC's standard, also began marketing IBM-compatible machines in Japan for the first time. Apple's success in Japan and the growing trend among Japanese computer makers to come out with IBM-compatible machines, point to a fundamental change in the Japanese PC market that is forcing the country's computer makers to confront difficult strategic decisions. The hitherto protected Japanese market, which allowed Japanese companies to set the standards and price levels, is becoming more vulnerable to outside forces as a result of the aggressive entry into the market of US manufacturers. To be sure, NEC, the undisputed market leader, was able to maintain a market share of just under 53 per cent last year despite fierce price pressures. However, the presence of US makers in Japan has meant that Japanese companies, including NEC, can no longer set the standards of price and performance in their own market but must meet the more demanding standards of the US, where competition has been more cut-throat than in Japan. The consequence is that Japanese computer makers, which have not been particularly competitive except in certain areas such as notebooks, have had their weaknesses exposed in their own home market. One such weakness has been in terms of cost. Competition from US companies such as IBM, Compaq and Dell, which launched low-price models into the Japanese market, has led to the collapse of the high prices which Japanese computer makers enjoyed at home and has forced Japanese companies to tackle their high cost structures. Due to increased competition from US makers, and as familiarity among Japanese consumers with computers has increased, PCs have increasingly come to be regarded as commodity items and Japanese consumers have become much more sensitive to the prices of PCs. At the same time, Japanese companies have been struggling to continue to come up with higher value-added products which can compensate for the falling profitability of mass-volume PCs. Steps are being taken on both fronts. In order to raise cost-competitiveness, Japanese computer makers are shifting a greater proportion of their manufacturing outside of Japan, where the yen's rise and high labour costs have made manufacturing a relatively expensive activity, and procuring more parts from low cost overseas sources. NEC, for example, has launched an aggressive cost-cutting programme and has introduced models since the beginning of last year with a price-performance ratio of one-third to half the price-performance ratios of previous models. The company plans to reduce costs by more than half over the next few years. As part of its cost-cutting programme, it has this year started importing motherboards from Taiwan for some of its PCs - a significant move since the costs of motherboards accounts for a big proportion of the total cost of the PC. Companies with less of a presence in the PC market are resorting to OEM arrangements to procure PCs at lower costs than they would be able to manufacture them. Hitachi, for example, is buying IBM's PS/V series which it will sell in Japan under its own brand while Sharp will buy IBM-compatible machines from Taiwanese and Korean makers to sell under its own brand name both overseas and in the home market. But while such cost-cutting measures will have a beneficial effect on their bottom line, Japanese computer makers also realise that they need to move aggressively into more value-added products in order to boost profitability. Here, some of the leading companies such as Toshiba and NEC, have an advantage in their liquid crystal display operations which have provided them with a leap over competitors in the notebook market. Last year, NEC agreed to provide NCR, the US company, with notebook computers under an OEM deal. NEC is increasing its investment in thin-film transistor liquid crystal displays which provide the high resolution screens that have made Japanese notebooks so popular. Other Japanese companies including Fujitsu and Toshiba are also boosting investment in TFT-LCDs. Their early investments in LCD are already paying off handsomely as notebook PCs made by Japanese manufacturers have been highly popular in the buoyant US market. Japanese computer makers are also making further leaps into multimedia with the introduction of PCs capable of displaying still photos, video and CD sound. However, as the multimedia industry develops, pulling in more elements of the audio-visual and broadcasting industries into the world of the computer, Japan's computer industry faces increasing competition not only from fellow computer makers in the US, but from Japanese consumer electronics makers as well.</p>

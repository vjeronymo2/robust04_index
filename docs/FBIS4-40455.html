			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Aid Program"] </F>   [Text] Russian President Yeltsin is apparently to  promulgate, before the end of June, a program of aid to Russians  living in the states of "near-abroad." This is expected to take  place during an official meeting in the Kremlin with  representatives of power structures and public associations,  Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the commission on questions of  citizenship under the Russian Federation president, has  announced. The program, he said, would incorporate three edicts  already drafted by the commission he heads. The principal edict  is entitled "On the Concept of Russian Federation Policy in  Regard to Fellow Countrymen Living Abroad." Mr. Mikitayev  pointed out that a package of documents on a mechanism of  putting the edicts into effect will be up for approval. The  government is completing work on this package. The draft law  "On the Concept," according to A. Mikitayev, proclaims Russia's  initiative to formalize at an interstate level measures that  would guarantee the observance of the rights of nonindigenous  populations permanently resident in new independent states. The  two other draft edicts envisage specific aid to retired  servicemen resident in the Baltic states.</p>

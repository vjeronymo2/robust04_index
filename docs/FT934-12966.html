			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Easing the pain of extractions - Bethan Hutton explains the advantages of dental plans that provide affordable private treatment NEXT TIME you need a filling, your dentist might start to extol the merits of joining a dental plan. The idea is that all routine treatment is covered for a small monthly premium. Adults - apart from those on low incomes or state benefits, who are exempt from charges - are obliged to pay 80 per cent of the NHS charge for all dental treatment, up to a maximum of Pounds 250. The state pays the rest, but standard NHS charges are far lower than the normal fees charged by dentists in private practice. Last July, payment to dentists for NHS work was cut by 7 per cent. A growing number have responded by opting out of providing NHS cover for adult patients. A survey by the British Dental Association in April found that only 57 per cent of dentists were taking on new adult NHS patients. In June 1992, the figure was 88 per cent. There is considerable regional variation, with dentists in London and the south being least likely to take on new NHS patients although the majority will still accept children and charge-exempt adults. A smaller number, about 20 per cent, are not continuing to offer NHS treatment to patients registered with them. Accordingly, there is a rapidly expanding market for dental plans which allow patients to pay a regular, affordable amount for private treatment, rather than being faced with a big bill when the dentist does the work. They also give dentists a regular, reliable income and make it cost-effective for them to concentrate on preventive treatment rather than relying on expensive repair and cosmetic work to make a living - or even being tempted to carry out unnecessary work. Although such schemes sometimes are referred to as 'dental insurance,' the core element of most is not insurance but capitation - a charge per patient for providing services which, effectively, spreads costs across time and a group of patients. Most, but not all, schemes also include an element of insurance, which covers emergency treatment abroad and at home. Unlike private medical insurance, these plans do not tend to be sold through advertising campaigns. Instead, patients are usually recruited by their own dentist when they go for a check-up or treatment. Most schemes require that you should be in 'good dental health' when you join, which means that you have to finish and pay for any treatment in progress. Some plans vary their charges according to your dentist's view of your dental history and the state of your teeth, while others have standard fees. The cost might also vary depending on where you live - dentists in London and other big cities generally charge more. The broad range of costs is from Pounds 5 to Pounds 20 a month, with the majority of people paying less than Pounds 12. Some companies have a one-off registration fee when you join the scheme. As with any insurance, you should make sure you know exactly what is covered before you sign up or you could end up having to find more money for unexpected treatment or extras. For example, some schemes ask you to pay all or part of the laboratory costs involved in making crowns and so on, or exclude wisdom tooth extraction or other more complicated procedures. Some providers offer a range of plans from basic (covering just check-ups and general maintenance) to comprehensive (covering crowns, root canal work, wisdom teeth etc). For those seeking such a scheme, here is a selection. Denplan, the oldest and largest, has been going since 1986 and now has several hundred thousand subscribers. The standard plan covers normal treatment, with insurance for emergencies. Bupa, the UK's largest private medical insurer, has just launched DentalCover in Bristol, Cardiff and Nottingham. It hopes to have enough registered dentists to cover the whole country by the end of 1994. The plan covers crowns, bridges, dentures and root treatment in addition to routine work, including the extraction of wisdom teeth under local anaesthetic. Patients can opt out of cover for major restorative work if they want to reduce premiums. Complete Direct Care (CDC) has about 700 dentists around the UK and 40,000 patients signed up. It has three schemes: NHS Care, which reimburses NHS charges; Emergency Care, covering only accidents and emergencies; and Cost Care, the main scheme, which covers private treatment and accident and emergency insurance and is underwritten at Lloyd's. Densure started with one dentist in 1986 but has been expanding rapidly for the past 18 months and now has 50 dentists signed up. It offers a choice of levels of cover, but no insurance element. MIDA, an American company, has been operating in the UK since June last year. It offers three levels of cover, all including world-wide emergency cover. There are many other schemes along similar lines involving small groups of dentists. Companies can also arrange cover for their employees. Corporate schemes are available from Cigna, CDC, Denplan and National Dental Plan, among others. A handful of private medical insurance schemes also cover dental treatment. If you are happy with your dentist, you might just have to settle for whatever scheme he is offering, but practices can usually register with more than one scheme if they think it is worth-while. If your dentist is not offering a scheme, but you are interested in the idea, mention it at your next appointment.</p>

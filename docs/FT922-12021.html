			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / NatWest adopts business-led charities policy NATIONAL Westminster Bank, Britain's biggest corporate supporter of charity, has recast its community involvement policy to reflect the bank's business priorities more closely. The shift in emphasis follows a review of community support at NatWest, which last year gave Pounds 13.7m in cash and other forms of support. A number of large companies are reviewing the basis on which they support the voluntary sector, and the business-led approach of NatWest is likely to be adopted elsewhere. NatWest has adopted the promotion of financial effectiveness and enterprise as the central objective of its community investment policy. Requests for money and other support will be assessed on whether they meet this objective. Many companies have until recently supported charity on a largely haphazard basis, reflecting the enthusiasms of individual directors or the eye-catching nature of charitable appeals. The shift towards a more planned approach shows a growing recognition that the private sector's now familiar involvement in the community must be handled as seriously as any other business activity. Ms Amanda Jordan, NatWest's head of community relations, said that in the past the bank tended to support good ideas rather than focus on objectives. 'By focusing on those activities which we understand as a bank we hope that we will be able to integrate the skills of our staff into the assistance we offer, enabling us to give more than money,' she said. In one of NatWest's special interest areas - education - the new focus will be represented through support for schemes that promote financial literacy in schools, mini-enterprise programmes and a 'Your Money Matters' teaching package. Another of the bank's schemes helps the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux provide financial counselling, while plans are being developed to help voluntary organisations improve their financial management. All applicants for NatWest's support will be sent leaflets explaining that the bank's aim of helping to develop a more financially informed society and encourage enterprise skills in the community will be the 'guiding principle' for its involvement. Ms Jordan accepted that the change of policy would lead to some requests for support being turned down because they did not meet the new criteria - although NatWest will meet existing commitments. 'But there are losers under any system,' she said. 'Like all large companies, we receive far more appeals for help than we can meet. We hope that a more structured approach will enhance the value of the support we are able to give.' Cuts in local-authority funding are leading an increasing number of voluntary organisations to look to the private sector for support. NatWest was one of about 40 companies which gave more than Pounds 1m in financial and other support to charities last year, but growth in private-sector charitable activity is being hit by the recession.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo </F> Crvenkovski by Hajri Shaqiri; date and place not given: "A Good  Year for Macedonia"]    [Text] [Shaqiri] It is the end of the year. How is  Macedonia ending this year, in the area of foreign policy?    [Crvenkovski] During 1993, there have been basic changes in  the international position of Macedonia. At the beginning of the  year, we did not belong to international organizations and very  few states recognized Macedonia. We had diplomatic relations  with only a few states. At the present time, the Republic of  Macedonia is a member of more than 30 international  organizations , including some of the largest organizations such  as the United Nations, and, in particular, agencies which are of  special importance such as the organization for  telecommunications, UNESCO, the Food and Agriculture  Organization, and the IMF. Problems with the World Bank are  expected to be resolved. As of now, we have diplomatic relations  with 21 states and this number is increasing each day. I do not  know what the number will be when this interview is published in  the newspaper. I think that it can be said that this has been a  successful year for Macedonia in the area of foreign policy.    [Shaqiri] Despite the progress which Macedonia has achieved  so far, the problem with Greece continues to be a great, and,  one might say, unsolvable, problem. Is this true?    [Crvenkovski] During past years, a number of problems have  been created in relations between the two countries. Most of  these problems seem irrational to a normal world. However, I  believe that it is becoming more and more clear that obligatory  mutual relations between Greece and Macedonia are necessary. I  believe that the Greeks are increasingly coming to the  conclusion that there is a need for good relations between the  two countries. However, it is a very complex and emotional  problem and it is hard to find a quick solution. Nevertheless, I  believe that, because of its irrational roots, the problem can  be resolved.    [Shaqiri] A large number of states have recognized  Macedonia.  However, there is a problem with the name. Will it win or lose  the battle about the name?    [Crvenkovski] I believe that there are misinterpretations in  regard to this problem as a result of lack of knowledge of the  matter. The name is what it is and we never gave up on this name  or accepted any document with any other name.    [Shaqiri] There is the impression that neither one of the  parties in the conflict is making any concessions. In the  meantime, it is said that the two parties are ready for  compromise. If this is true, what kind of compromise are they  talking about?    [Crvenkovski] If we dwell on this aspect of the problem, it  is difficult to find any solution, so, for all practical  purposes, it is impossible to resolve this problem. It must be  understood that the problems are not symbolic in nature but are  problems of relations between two countries. If things are seen  in this light, a solution can be found. The dialog on real  problems can result in a solution.    [Shaqiri] However, recently, hasn't Greece been basing its  entire strategy on the problem with the name?    [Crvenkovski] This was characteristic of the past period but  now I think that it has understood that the essence of the  problem is relations between the two countries.    [Shaqiri] During your visit to Washington, you met with  [Secretary of State] Warren Christopher. There are indications  that the Americans are insisting on a compromise with Greece.  Did you discuss any such thing with Christopher?    [Crvenkovski] I think that we should not give much credence  to interpretations in the foreign press, in this case, the Greek  press. The attitude of the United States from the beginning up  to acceptance has been constant. During this time, we have had  its support for the territorial integrity and stability of  Macedonia. In regard to the dispute with Greece, the U.S.  attitude is clear and it says that no one has the right to  interfere in a country's internal affairs. At the same time, the  Americans stress that this problem should be solved by dialog.    [Shaqiri] How do you explain the fact that the Americans  have  not recognized Macedonia yet?    [Crvenkovski] The recognition of a country and the  establishment of diplomatic relations is a process which takes  time, sometimes more and sometimes less.    [Shaqiri] Why has this process taken a long time for the  Americans?    [Crvenkovski] It has taken a long time for rational reasons  and we will see how long it will take. At this time, I cannot  give any analysis of this delay. I think that the causes are  well-known to our people. The support which we have from the  Americans is also known.    [Shaqiri] Speaking of the Americans, a while back it was  said  that they have set up military bases in Krivolak but, recently,  according to the Greek press, they have set up military bases in  Kriva Pallanke, with several thousand soldiers. What is the  truth in regard to these statements?    [Crvenkovski] The truth is that the Americans are  participating in a United Nations operation in the framework of  the mission sent by the UN. It is true that this is the first  time that the Americans have participated in such a mission. It  is also the first time that the UN has taken part in a mission  of a preventive nature. This action has been evaluated by all  the international forums as one of the most successful actions.  It is clear that anyone who is thwarted by the operation would  weave various tales to deny the sucess of such an action.    [Shaqiri] Let us try to characterize relations with  neighboring states. Let us begin with the East: Bulgaria accepts  Macedonia as a state but does not accept the Macedonian nation.  What does this mean, in your opinion?    [Crvenkovski] Macedonia has established diplomatic relations  with Bulgaria at the ambassadorial level. The idea of the  nonacceptance of a nation is ridiculous to many well-informed  people. The acceptance of a nation is something which does not  depend on the political acts of any state. I think that this is  an idea in which no basis for discussions can be found. The  existence of a Macedonian nation and language is a fact which is  accepted by world opinion.    [Shaqiri] In your opinion, Mr. Minister, what is the  northern  neighbor of Macedonia?    [Crvenkovski] At this time, there is an undefined situation  in the international sphere and we, as UN members, respect the  positions of this organization. Thus, we will go along with the  development of events and the positions of the UN.    [Shaqiri] I have the impression that Macedonia does not have  a clear position in regard to the issue of Kosovo. Are you  satisfied with this statement?    [Crvenkovski] I would not be satisfied with this statement  because Macedonia has a clear position in regard to all the  neighboring states. This means that the foreign policy of the  Republic of Macedonia is based on noninterference in the  internal affairs of every state. No position could be any  clearer than this.    [Shaqiri] In the recent elections in Serbia, the socialists  won again. Is this good or bad for Macedonia and the Balkans?    [Crvenkovski] For Macedonia, it does not matter who wins the  election in any state. We took this position during the Greek  elections. The most important thing for us is for citizens of a  state to elect the government they want.    [Shaqiri] It is said that Macedonia still has close ties  with  Serbia. Serbia is under an embargo, but various products, such  as newspapers, come into Macedonia from this state. Can these be  considered to be goods?    [Crvenkovski] We do not have any sort of ties with Serbia.  We  do not have any official relations. But, naturally, this is not  good because it is in our interest to have good relations with  all our neighbors. As for the press and literature, I think that  a democratic state such as Macedonia is and must always be open  to all the information media and to all ideas.    [Shaqiri] How would you define relations with Albania?    [Crvenkovski] I think that relations with Albania are  following a positive course and this is illustrated by the early  establishment of diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial  level. This would mean that relations between the two countries  are normal. Of course, here, just as everywhere in the Balkans,  there is a collection of inherited problems and I think that  there is no lack of willingness on the part of both sides to  solve existing problems.    [Shaqiri] Albania has shown its willingness to eliminate  visas but Macedonia has not agreed to this. Why?    [Crvenkovski] The visa issue is being resolved by the two  countries. A number of problems have been raised, some of them  in the form of recommendations which have been given to the  Albanian side for signing. I think that many issues in the area  of relations between the two countries will be resolved and  settled.    [Shaqiri] In addition to the problems which Macedonia has in  the area of foreign affairs, it has not completely resolved  domestic ethnic problems. In your opinion. what would be the  proper status of Albanians in Macedonia?    [Crvenkovski] I cannot respond to this question in my  capacity as foreign minister, but I can give you my personal  opinion. In my opinion, the only solution for problems in  Macedonia is the strict observance of the foundation laid by the  Constitution of Macedonia. This means that Macedonia, first of  all, is a citizens' state and, in a citizens' state, the rights  of all citizens are equal.    [Shaqiri] But what happens when it is a matter of ethnic  groups, like the Albanians in Macedonia, who consider themselves  to be a nation and insist on equal rights with the Macedonians?    [Crvenkovski] I am a member of a liberal party and I was a  liberal even before the formation of parties in Macedonia. The  philosophy of every liberal party in the world is based on the  fact that the individual is more important than any sort of  grouping and that the rights of the individual are essential to  the profile of a state.    [Shaqiri] Can it be said that Macedonia has been spared,  once  and for all, from war?    [Crvenkovski] It would be hard to say this is we consider  the  wars which have developed in the region. The danger of the  expansion of the war is always present. I would say that  Macedonia has not yet escaped this danger but, at the same time,  it has done a lot to lessen this danger.    [Shaqiri] What do you have to say about Zhirinovskiy's  recent  statement in Sofia that Macedonia should be united with  Bulgaria?    [Crvenkovski] Zhirinovskiy has recentlyn made a number of  such statements. He is still excited after the recent elections  in Russia and one might say that he has not yet begun to think  like a real politician.    [Shaqiri] Does his victory present any real danger for  Macedonia and the Balkans?    [Crvenkovski] I do not think that it presents any danger for  Macedonia but, nevertheless, it brings up some topics for  examination.</p>

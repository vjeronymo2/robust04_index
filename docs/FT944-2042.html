			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Managers who miscalculate - Serious Money Financial sophisticates tend to prefer investment trusts to unit trusts. One reason is that it is far easier for a fund manager to run a fixed pool of investments (as with an investment trust) than one which rises and falls according to demand (as with a unit trust). A second reason is that the financial structure of an investment trust can be far more complex than that of a unit trust. The argument is that these two characteristics help investment trust managers to do a better job. If market conditions are turbulent, unit trust managers are on a hiding to nothing: either they keep a large cash safety margin or they risk being forced to dump their best holdings in a falling market. Investment trust managers can concentrate on creating a portfolio designed to enhance shareholder value over the long term. They can also create complicated financial structures which alter the flows of money through the trust to investors. Such structures can be used either to back the managers' view of the market or to tailor different securities to different investor objectives: for example, gearing up by borrowing money in a bull market helps magnify the return to shareholders. Giving different securities in the same trust different rights, as in split capital trusts, allows one trust to appeal to both income investors and growth investors. And yet, being human, even investment trust managers run into problems. For the same reason they sometimes aggravate those problems by their attempts to solve them. Take British Assets Trust. Like many money managers, it has run into trouble by pandering to its shareholders' unrealistic desire for income. Originally, it set out to give them real (inflation-adjusted) dividend growth from an international portfolio. In recent years, this has been hard to achieve without harming capital growth prospects. The cost to British Assets (and so to its shareholders) of this misplaced indulgence was a double one: the managers altered the balance of the investment portfolio in ways which boosted short-term yield at the expense of longer term growth; and they paid short-earned dividends. There is no good way out of this corner. The worry is that British Assets is using financial engineering to push the problem into the future. Shareholders have been given the choice of keeping their income at its existing level or agreeing to a cut in income for the next seven years in return for a larger share of both assets and income at the end of that period. It is a neat way for the managers to buy time in which to re-organise the investment portfolio. But a stay of execution is not the same as a pardon. At the end of the seven years, shareholders who have swapped income today for more capital and income tomorrow will be knocking on the door. It is conceivable that, in the interim, the investment portfolio will have been re-organised so successfully that both sets of investors do well. But there is no guarantee, and clever financial instruments have a nasty habit of exploding in the faces of their inventors. Problem number two is that only hindsight will tell if jam tomorrow was a more profitable choice than jam today. Interestingly, different stockbrokers' analysts recommended different choices. This is partly because their valuations of the securities on offer differ. Fair enough. But if professional analysts cannot agree on what is likely to happen, how could any ordinary investor be expected to make an intelligent choice? Many seem to have decided that, if they cannot use their heads, they will vote with their feet. Since the re-organisation proposals were announced late last month, BA's shares' discount to the underlying asset value has widened from 6 to 11 per cent. The message for fund managers is: think hard before you get out the Meccano set. For investors: if any investment looks too good to be true, it probably is. Private investors buying gilts should normally buy them directly rather than through a unit trust. For even though charges on gilt unit trusts are lower than on most others, they still eat into your returns. But some of the financial advisers offering to run portfolios of gilts for private clients charge even more than unit trusts. Bristol-based Whitechurch Securities, for instance, has an initial charge of 6 per cent and an annual charge of 2 per cent on small gilt portfolios. That compares with an initial charge of 4 per cent and running charge of 1 per cent or less from most gilt unit trusts. Even Whitechurch agrees that the only thing which could justify its charges is sizzling outperformance.</p>

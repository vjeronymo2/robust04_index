			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television The most controversial programme of the evening is certainly Viewpoint 93 (ITV, 10.40) which investigates serial killers. Producer Mike Morley was given easy access in the US and interviewed Bob Berdella, who tortured and killed six men in Kansas, and filmed the case records of the 'Rostov Ripper', responsible for over 50 murders in Russia. In the UK the Home Office permitted an interview with Dennis Nilsen, who lured young men back to his Muswell Hill flat for tea and strangulation, but then refused permission for the footage to be screened. For Love or Money (Channel 4, 9.00) is the first programme to cover the art market in depth, and the fact that it does so in a jokey, ironic, style adds to its appeal. Three incredibly successful and popular art films clutter the schedule tonight. BBC 1 celebrates 25 years of Omnibus at 10.20 with another screening of Ken Russell's celebration of the life and music of Frederick Delius. This is followed by the uncut version of Don't Look Now, the ultimate Venetian ghost story. Channel 4 hits back with the Merchant-Ivory adaptation of EM Forster's Florentine idyll, A Room with a View. (10.00).</p>

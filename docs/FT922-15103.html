			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Signs of US recovery help Dow to rebound Wall Street US EQUITIES initially reacted to the latest fall in the Nikkei average but came off early declines with help from economic news and a strong bond market, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator bounced off a morning low of 3,215.34 to close a net 13.86 up at 3,249.33, but declining issues still led rises by 1,036 to 667 after New York SE volume of 186.4m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished a slight 0.54 ahead at 404.23, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks lost 1.68 at 602.09. The market opened on a weak note in sympathy with Japan, but started to recoup its losses after the release of the US National Purchasing Manager's report for March, which showed the most rapid rate of growth in the economy since last September. The March index rose to 54.1 per cent from the 52.4 recorded in February. Any reading above 50 per cent is seen as a sign of economic expansion. In addition, the new orders index climbed to its highest level since June 1988. The employment component, however, had a dampening effect on the stock market ahead of tomorrow's release of employment figures for March. Employment in the manufacturing sector fell at a sharper rate last month than in February, with the employment index dropping to 42.8 per cent from 44.5 per cent. Chemical Waste Management slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18 1/4 in active trading. The hazardous-waste subsidiary of Waste Management, the biggest US waste management company, yesterday disclosed that it is facing a criminal invest-igation for work it performed for the US army corps of engineers. Details of the government investigation came out in Chemical Waste Management's 10-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Trading was less active in Waste Management's shares, which shed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 37 7/8 . Browning Ferris, the country's second largest waste management concern, retreated Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 21 1/4 . Shares in WR Grace also saw heavy trading, tumbling Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 37 5/8 after the specialty chemicals company said its first-quarter results would probably decline from the 36 cents a share in the comparable period of 1991. The company, however, expects full-year earnings to rise more than 10 per cent from the Dollars 2.50 earned in 1991. Grace attributed the first-quarter erosion to timing and continuing weakness in the energy sector. Among active blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 3/8 , IBM dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 82 7/8 and Citicorp receded Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 16. Bristol-Myers Squibb recovered Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 77 5/8 after falling Dollars 2 on Tuesday when several analysts downgraded their ratings on the issue. The big pharmaceutical company disappointed Wall Street by saying that its first-quarter sales would be below expectations. High-technology shares dominated Nasdaq trading, with Intel rising Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 55 3/4 , Microsoft appreciating Dollars 2 to Dollars 120 1/2 and Apple Computer firming Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 59. Canada TORONTO was finally little changed in moderate trading after the market picked up late in the session in response to the improvement in New York. The composite index, down 24 points at one stage, lost just 0.3 on balance at 3,411.9, although declines retained a lead over advances of 291 to 220. Volume was 23.2m shares. The financial services and energy groups had the day's biggest gains, up 1 per cent apiece. The gold group was slightly firmer. Nova, down CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 7 5/8 , said it will issue about CDollars 300m of new common equity through a public offering.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Sharp drop in subsidised trade finance The use of subsidised trade finance by the industrialised countries fell sharply last year, but preliminary figures suggest that export competition may once again drive up levels of tied aid financing. According to a report from the US Export-Import Bank to Congress, the total volume of tied aid credit offers last year fell to Dollars 6.9bn (Pounds 4.5bn) from Dollars 15.5bn in 1992. The drop followed a 1992 agreement among the industrialised countries, pushed by the US, designed to slow the pace of export credit subsidised by governments in the form of soft loans or grants. But the trend could be reversing. According to the report, countries reported making Dollars 3.1bn in tied aid offers during the first four months of 1994. If the trend continues, tied aid offers could total Dollars 9.4bn for this year. In most recent years, France and Japan have been the most active tied aid promoters. Last year France provided Dollars 1.23bn, Germany Dollars 950m, the US, Dollars 900m, and the UK Dollars 830m. This year the Germans have been the most active, offering Dollars 1.5bn. About two-thirds of these offers were highly concessional. France and Spain each offered tied aid credits worth about Dollars 400m. The US this year has a Dollars 150m 'war chest' with which to subsidise loans. Mr Kenneth Brody, Eximbank chairman, has vowed to match the subsidised offers of US company competitors to eliminate financing as the basis for making a deal. As of early June Eximbank had three tied-aid preliminary loan commitments outstanding and was preparing another. China, which has just opened the doors of its own trade finance bank, has been the biggest beneficiary of subsidised export finance. During the first four months of this year it received about Dollars 600m in tied aid offers. Last year it received Dollars 2.3bn. 'In large part, the continuing heavy volume of tied aid offers to China was owed to the Chinese central government's continuing efforts to use commercial pressure to obtain aid financing which would have otherwise been committed to other countries,' the report says. 'To pursue this end, the central government continues to impose a stiff duty in imports financed by credits bearing a note rate of greater than 5 per cent. 'To avoid paying this tax, Chinese purchasing enterprises must seek the cheapest possible foreign financing, even if it means playing foreign contractors and OECD credit agencies off one another.' The US has grown increasingly concerned about the use of 'untied' financing, mostly offered by Japan. This practice in principle makes concessional credits available to foreign suppliers but in practice, most of the subsidised lending backs the sale of Japanese products.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Greece to sell 35% of telecoms monopoly GREECE is to sell 35 per cent of OTE, the state telecommunications monopoly, and will seek bids from international telecommunications groups later this month. The sale is part of the second stage of a privatisation programme which calls for the transfer of up to 49 per cent of state shareholdings in utilities and transport companies to the private sector. The government aims to complete the OTE sale, which is expected to raise at least Dr218bn (Dollars 1bn), by next spring. The buyer will also take over management of OTE, according to the government's privatisation unit. The sale will be followed immediately by a flotation of a further 8-12 per cent of OTE on the Athens Stock Exchange. Details have not yet been worked out, but the company's 28,000 employees are expected to be offered shares on a priority basis. The government has dropped its plan to raise additional funds through an international flotation of OTE, but foreign investors would be able to buy shares in the company on the Athens bourse, a privatisation official said. Coopers and Lybrand, the international accountants, have already completed an evaluation of OTE, funded by the European Community. Several European telecoms companies have shown interest in OTE, the most profitable Greek state enterprise with earnings last year of Dr55bn. Credit Suisse First Boston is acting as the government's adviser on the sale.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The issue of North Korea's suspected development  of nuclear weapons was addressed in the House of  Representatives' Budget Committee session today. Speaking at  the committee session, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reiterated  his hope that China will use its power of influence over North  Korea to resolve the problem.    [Begin Hata recording] China is a country with very close  friendly relations with North Korea, and their economic ties are  very strong too. That being the case, China holds a lot of  influence over that country. In addition, China is a permanent  member of the UN Security Council. And while we would like to  learn more about China's views, we would certainly like it to  use its power of influence. [end recording]    Prime Minister Hata added that although Japan wanted a  solution through dialogue, government offices were, of course,  exchanging information among themselves about contingencies that  might arise. He said the government would take appropriate  action to fulfill its role in the international community.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also spoke at the session. He  is due to visit South Korea and China on 11 and 12 June  respectively. He said that in Seoul he wanted an exchange of  views so that South Korea and Japan could cooperate in taking  efficient action.    In China, he said, he wanted to ask that Beijing make  efforts  to persuade North Korea to accept inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency. [passage omitted]</p>

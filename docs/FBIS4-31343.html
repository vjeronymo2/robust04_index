			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Summary" in English: "Program Declaration of the Slovak </F> Government"]    [Text] In 1994, the government wants to  achieve zero growth of GDP, to keep inflation between 10 and 13  percent, unemployment under 17 percent and maintain budget  obligations. An increase in pure foreign exchange reserves is  presumed so that the internal convertibility of the currency and  positive payment balance would be maintained. The government  will try to obtain a stand-by loan from the International  Monetary Fund to enhance macroeconomic stability. The government  also plans to create conditions that will facilitate the wider  use of foreign sources toward developmental aims.    In 1993, the GDP in Slovakia dropped by 4.1 percent compared  to the previous year. The state budget deficit grew to Sk23  billion ($697 million), representing 6.8 percent of GDP.  Compared to 1992, exports have fallen by 11.5 percent and  imports have risen by 15.4 percent, despite the devaluation of  the Slovak crown. This leaves Slovakia with a passive balance of  trade valued at Sk26.7 billion ($809 million).    The clearing exchange with the Czech Republic accounted for  Sk5.8 billion ($176 million) of the passive foreign trade  balance. Unresolved financial obligations in the public sector  including health care, transport and education were not included  in the state budget deficit in 1993, thus adding Sk6 billion  ($182 million) to the 1994 budget.    In 1993, the increase of prices climbed to 23.2 percent  which  in comparison to price increases of 1992 is more than double.  Unemployment rose to 14.4 percent by the end of 1993.    The previous government did not take definite steps for  stabilization and support in small business development,  resulting in 57.5 percent companies in the red at the end of  1993 with a total loss of Sk42.5 billion ($1.29 billion). The  previous government also is responsible for weakening foreign  investment, particularly by not securing the necessary economic  stability. At the end of 1993, the amount of foreign investment  was Sk10.8 billion ($327 million), which was Sk4.2 billion ($127  million) more than in 1992. But excluding the capital of Czech  investors, the increase was only Sk3 billion ($90 million).    During the six-month mandate period, the government wants to  speed up the process of economic transformation, especially  regarding ownership matters. Privatization will be renewed with  the previously successful voucher privatization process, which  has earned the trust of citizens.    The government considers the renewal of trust in the  privatization process to be of utmost importance for both  citizens and foreign investors. By the end of the second wave of  voucher privatization, more than half of all properties under  state ownership should be in private hands.    The government will provide for the fairness of  privatization  methods among the participants and make the process clear for  all. As opposed to the previous government, which considered the  voucher privatization a residual method and delayed its  preparation, the current government will approach it as an equal  to other privatization methods. All branches of the economy will  participate in voucher privatization, including many attractive  investment opportunities.    The government will try to hasten the sale of shares held in  the portfolio of the National Assets Fund (FNM). The FNM should  only passively execute ownership functions in companies which  have major private shareholders.    The government released this declaration with full knowledge  that it has only a six-month mandate.</p>

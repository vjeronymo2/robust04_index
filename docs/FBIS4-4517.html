			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Japanese Government  reacted calmly Friday to a U.S. report naming Japan as guilty of  unfair trade practices and renewed a call for a breakthrough in  the stalled bilateral trade negotiations.    "As a whole, the report is harsh on us, but it does not mean  it automatically leads to a unilateral action from Washington,"  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference. "We do not have to swing from joy to sorrow on each  item listed as a trade barrier," the top government spokesman  added.    On Thursday, the U.S. Government issued an annual report  accusing Japan and scores of other countries of maintaining  trade barriers against U.S. goods and services. The thrust of  this year's report on foreign trade barriers centers on  obstacles the U.S. says Japan has erected against foreign goods.    The report, which serves as the basis for possible  unilateral  action by the U.S. Government against its trade partners, lists  43 trade barriers in Japan under seven industry categories.    Takemura also reiterated hopes for an early resumption of  the  deadlocked "framework" trade talks, with Tokyo taking necessary  steps to further open its markets to foreign competition as  pledged earlier this week.    The bilateral trade negotiations collapsed at the summit  between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill  Clinton on February 11 due to a gulf over a U.S. demand for  setting numerical targets to gauge the openness of Japan's  markets.    The United States posted a record 59.3 billion dollar trade  deficit with Japan in 1993, according to U.S. Commerce  Department figures.    Japanese Finance Ministry figures put Japan's 1993 surplus  in  trade with the U.S. at 50.19 billion dollars.    Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kishichiro Amae criticized  the U.S. trade document at a press conference later in the day.    Amae said he thinks the U.S. trade document was published  before the U.S. studied the outline of Japan's external economic  reform measures hammered out earlier this week.    "For example, all the items concerning government  procurement  of telecommunications and medical devices can be added in that  list. A sufficient response to the contents of those items has  already been described in the outline," he said.    He also touched on a reference in the U.S. document which  said "it is apparent that Japanese barriers form a heavy burden  on the world trade system and that the Japanese economy is more  highly controlled and regulated than any other."    "Any such approach using `Japan as unique theory' is  fundamentally unfounded and is a major problem in terms of the  important relations of trust between Japan and the United  States," Amae said. He said Japan considers it important to  "make steady progress" on what needs to be done by June and seek  a breakthrough in the framework talks.</p>

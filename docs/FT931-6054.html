			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Personal View: Ten-point plan for credibility The erosion of British manufacturing, which has been going on for much of this century, is now a critical concern. In several sectors Britain no longer has a credible presence. The goal must be to achieve world-class levels of performance in design, engineering, manufacturing quality and cost in sectors critical to the economy in the future. Nothing less will sustain improvement over the long term. That will mean focusing on the problem by sector and drawing in best-practice experience from all of them. The way forward must also involve a change in our national culture. Anti-industrial and manufacturing attitudes are still prevalent in many quarters; innovation and success in manufacturing are not rewarded. Too few of our best brains choose industry for a career. The government must demonstrate vision and leadership by providing a clear, broadly based national industrial strategy to embrace relevant aspects of economic policy, education, infrastructure, energy, and investment. That requires sectoral focus and the establishment of priorities and quantified objectives for the short, medium and long term. In the short term, during the next year, we must concentrate on creating the best 'playing field' for our companies. The concept of Britain as the 'Hong Kong of Europe' is compelling. That means continued deregulation, low taxation and the removal of unnecessary constraints. In this way we also eliminate many 'non-value-adding' elements in company cost bases. The role of government should be to understand how it contributes to 'non-value-added' and to seek constantly to eliminate non-productive processes and elements. In the medium term, we must emulate the technological and manufacturing superiority of our principal competitor nations, notably Germany and Japan. Worldwide best practice must take root in the UK. We must, as a matter of urgency, lay the foundations. An action plan now would include: Encourage investment with a return to 100 per cent first-year tax allowances and provide relief based on investment for those companies with an ACT burden. Identify priority sectors in a national technology plan and target with investment stimuli such as further tax incentives, R&amp;D funding and other grants and concessions. Improve export credit arrangements to put British manufacturers at least on a level playing field with foreign competition and preferably ahead of the game. Devise new export incentives. Mount a visible campaign to identity and eliminate official bureaucracy stifling our businesses. Commence the culture change needed by giving more publicity, reward and acclaim to innovation and manufacturing success stories. Reform the honours system to recognise science and engineering more widely. Set up craft training schools (fachhochschule) in main manufacturing centres to focus on skills and technologies in demand and train more young people. Work with engineering representative bodies to raise the prestige of engineers and ensure training for graduate engineers is improved to compare with the best of other professions. Encourage a longer-term view of investment in manufacturing, and particularly in advanced manufacturing technology, for example, by providing special tax incentives for equity investment in targeted priority sectors (if investment retained for specified periods) and by setting up a national manufacturing investment fund to make available low fixed interest, long-term funds for investment in priority sector projects (funds to be bid for with assessment criteria linked to a national technology plan). Reform school curricula on science and technology and setting national priorities for R&amp;D at universities. In the long term, society must recognise that science and technology are the principal instigators of progress for prosperity. We need a vision of an elitist, technology-based society and a bold, innovative national technology plan with nat-ional goals to realise this potential.

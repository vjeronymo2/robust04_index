			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Small-town tales - Cinema ONE FALSE MOVE (18) Carl Franklin LEAP OF FAITH (PG) Richard Pearce THE OX (12) Sven Nykvist BEST OF THE BEST 2 (18) Robert Radler PARIS IS BURNING Jennie Livingston Star City, Arkansas, and Rustwater, Kansas, are both small towns near the middle of America. But look closely - is there a big difference? Exactly. One is in Jim Thompson country, the other is in Sinclair Lewis country. Star City is the small town as rural spittoon. In the irresistibly grimy, downbeat thriller One False Move - scripted by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson but surely ghost-dictated by that master of elevated pulp J. Thompson - the town plays host to fugitive gangsters, dimwitted lawmen and a climactic carnage that Aeschylus would be proud of. Up the road a little - go north and bend left - is Rust-water in wheatbelt Kansas. For displaced urban crime read agriculture under stress. There is a drought here and the farms are dying; and if one pastoral crisis is not enough, here comes another. Revivalist preacher Jonas Nightengale (Steve Martin), comedy-cloned by screenwriter Janus Cercone from Sinclair Lewis's Elmer Gantry, passes through town with his all-singing, all-praying tent show. He gives the rain-starved farmers hope; he raiseth the lame and sick (the language is catching); he thumps his Bible; and he is a frightful, pearly-teethed fraud made winning by the charismatic Mr Martin. When films venture outside Los Angeles they usually end up in Cutesville, USA. See ET, Back To The Future and Co. To Hollywood any place without smog, faxes and power breakfasts must seem strange and innocent. But One False Move, by a mile the better of the week's rural twosome, makes a rich dark joke of this (faux)-navete. At the centre: a young Southern sheriff (Bill Paxton) intent on proving his mettle to two visiting lawmen (one white, one black) from Los Angeles. All the Angelenos want to do is to round up a pair of cocaine-dealing killers (also one black, one white) who massacred a roomful of people back in LA and then fled with their guns, their drugs and their girl (Cynthia Williams). Will they come to ground in the girl's home town of Star City, Ark.? Not yet. First the movie, directed with sizzling grace by ex-actor Carl Franklin, travels all over the south-western states as the getaway trio make for Houston (to sell their drugs) before being harried by police pursuit into doubling back north for Arkansas. Back here the film's other character grouping has been in mocking parallel action. For two black/white crooks with a brown-skinned girl read two black/white city cops with a redneck sheriff. The racial patch-quilting, though teasingly displayed, is never deployed for facile tension. Indeed Southern values are almost respected for their loony matter-of-factness. Paxton's pinbrained lawman is a creation so ridiculous it is sublime. He boasts, he bumbles, he preens. And he obliviously throws out the word 'nigger' while his black colleague pretends polite deafness. Even the sheriff's wife shakes her head at his intellect, while simultaneously advertising her own. ('He watches TV, I read non-fiction'.) And when her man goes off to do what a man's gotta do, the film moves into a High Noon climax re-staged - brilliantly - as nihilist farce. One False Move is a rural tragicomedy with the deadly grace of a sidewinder. Leap Of Faith is more like a stoned python. It folds itself round its subject's neck, makes some promising hissing noises - and then falls asleep on the job. We love the sight of Martin dancing into town with his big-band show of dubious miracles: orchestrated by Debra Winger at the backstage computer, feeding audience information into Martin's on-stage earpiece. 'Man in white shirt, hard of hearing', 'Woman in pink with arthritis'. Then the slapping-on of hands, the customer's fainting fall, the lordy-lordy paroxysms of ersatz joy. Unfortunately, something else in the movie soon reveals itself as ersatz. It is the subplot. Make that two subplots: for while Winger romances the improbably saintly town sheriff Liam Neeson - so handsome, so gentle, so liberal (no redneckery in this burg) - Martin makes a play for diner waitress Lolita Davidovitch. She has a crippled, chess-playing little brother (Lukas Haas of Witness) who will surely, if Cliff Eidelman's music has not done the job by then, end by melting his and our hearts. Can a real miracle happen? Yes indeed. For lo, the cinema exit doors finally open before we have all passed out with terminal queasiness. Director Richard Pearce (Heartland, No Mercy) delivers the razzle-dazzle in the revivalist set pieces, with Martin exploding all over stage. But no star-director team can keep their anti-twaddle guns firing in the face of both the appointed target - high-sleaze evangelism - and a whole lot of late, unscheduled fire from Hollywood inspirationalism. * You cannot escape small-town life even, or especially, in Sweden. Sven Nykvist's The Ox is about pastoral bigotry and brutalism. A terrible fate befalls Helge Roos (Stellan Skarsgard) when he kills a neighbour's ox to feed himself and his family during Sweden's 1860s famine. Flogged and life-sentenced to hard labour, he is then betrayed by his starving wife for the sake of their starving child. Nor, gentle reader, does the horror stop there . . . This truth-based tragedy of errors makes Thomas Hardy seem like Louisa May Alcott. It also makes for spellbinding cinema. Writer-director Nykvist is best-known as a cameraman to the great and famous, having lensed 22 Ingmar Bergmans, three (serious) Woody Allens and a Tarkovsky. After a training like that, manic depression or emergent movie mastery can be the only outcome. Nykvist here makes images that burn the eye. The early winter scenes are inspired crayon-and-charcoal sketches, all ashy clouds, ember-yellow sunsets and crispy, silhouetted blacks. They are followed by the desaturated, mold-grey prison scenes, resembling a mortuarist's photo album. And even when the film bounces back briefly to May-time, the colours are caustic, garish, mocking. Assembling his cast from the Ingmar Bergman Who's Who of Acting - Liv Ullman, Max Von Sydow, Erland Josephson and Fanny And Alexander's Ewa Frohling as the wife - Nykvist kneads the faces with light and shadow as a baker kneads dough. There is no flicker of false emotion as he shapes the story into a picture of provincial life both cruelly plausible and sumptuously satirical. Von Sydow's dithery priest and Ullman's lady of the manor, specialising in milky-eyed looks and arm's-length kindness, show the tattered raiment of charity in times of social despair. And Stellan Skarsgard, an actor whose flayed looks and sleep-robbed eyes haunt the mind, finds Dostoevskian depth in the hapless ox-killer. In sum: a triumph. Is there anything else? Yes, but if you have a bus to catch I can run through them quickly. Best Of The Best 2 is the sequel to a film no one seems to have seen. Reportedly it starred Eric Roberts (Julia's brother) and Chris Penn (Sean's brother), now re-teamed for 90 minutes of cheerful drivel as two kickboxers trying to kick an evil wall of muscle called Brakus (Ralph Moeller). Place: Las Vegas. Toupee'd Wayne Newton, looking mature enough to be Isaac's brother, steals the show as the sleazy emcee. You can always see the three-year-old drag documentary Paris Is Burning at the ICA. Director Jennie Livingston shows us round New York's 'vogueing' couples, as the entire black and Hispanic poulations of Brooklyn and Harlem seem to have spent 1990 coming out and loudly refusing to go back in again. Bold, if rather old, stuff.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / City gains limited concessions over insider trading legislation THE GOVERNMENT is to proceed with planned legislation on insider dealing in spite of strong opposition in the City of London, although it announced some concessions yesterday. An earlier version of the draft legislation had worried bankers and brokers who claimed it would outlaw many accepted market practices. Listed companies feared they would find it difficult to talk to analysts or large investors without falling foul of the new law. The latest draft provisions, published in the Criminal Justice Bill, have been amended to take account of some of these concerns. An exemption has been added, for instance, for companies which secretly build up stakes in others in preparation for a full takeover bid. Under the original draft, this would have amounted to insider dealing. However, the Treasury, which is responsible for the legislation, has not changed other provisions which have aroused concern. The definition of 'insider information' in the Bill is as broadly worded as in the previous draft. Analysts have said this would make their job almost impossible. Officials indicated yesterday that the City was wrong to fear that this represented an extension of the law, since all the offences covered in the Bill are covered by the existing law. The Treasury said it would issue guidance notes on how the new law would be interpreted. Although the guidance will not have the force of law, it is intended to make City professionals feel more confident that some practices will not lead to insider dealing prosecutions. Yesterday's Bill drew a lukewarm initial response in the City. The London Stock Exchange said: 'Certainly some of our concerns would appear to have been looked at. But what they haven't done is take the opportunity to take more a radical review.' The Bill is also intended to make it easier to prosecute international fraud cases in the UK and will extend the offence of laundering money from drug-related offences to cover laundering of proceeds from any crime. Officials said an average of 17 cases of fraud a year cannot be prosecuted in the UK because existing law only allows a case to be tried there if the final part of the fraud is committed in the country. The change in the law would catch frauds similar to that alleged to have occurred at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.</p>

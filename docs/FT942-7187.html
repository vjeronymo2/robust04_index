			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal rises 9% in second quarter Bank of Montreal opened the second-quarter reporting season of Canada's Big Six banks yesterday by posting a 9 per cent rise in earnings. The improvement was attributed largely to higher volumes and a drop in loan-loss provisions. However, it was partly offset by slimmer margins, especially in money market operations, and a 6 per cent rise in non-interest expenses. Net income grew to CDollars 188m (USDollars 136.2m), or 69 cents a share, in the three months to April 30, from CDollars 173m, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Return on common equity fell slightly to 14 per cent from 14.2 per cent, while return on assets rose to 0.66 per cent from 0.62 per cent. Loan-loss provisions fell to CDollars 157m from CDollars 163m. Non-performing loans, totalling CDollars 247m, were 11 per cent down on the previous three months. Assets grew 14.5 per cent over the past year, to CDollars 124.8bn on April 30. The bank, whose interests include Harris Bankcorp of Chicago, said the strongest growth during the quarter came from Nesbitt Thomson, its securities arm, and Canadian residential mortgages and mid-market commercial loans.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World News in Brief: Two boys found guilty of James Bulger murder Two 11-year-old boys were found guilty of murdering James Bulger, the two-year-old who was abducted from his mother, and then stoned, kicked and battered to death on a railway track at Walton, Liverpool in February. Robert Thompson - referred to during the trial as Child A - and Jon Venables  -Child B - were ordered to be detained for 'very, very many years'. The jury at Preston crown court was unanimous that the boys abducted and murdered James, but failed to agree on whether they tried to abduct another two year old. That charge will lie on the file.</p>

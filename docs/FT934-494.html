			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: ABN Amro acquires French bank ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, is to expand in France through the acquisition, from Swiss Volksbank, of Banque Odier Bungener Courvoisier (OBC), a Paris-based bank specialising in private and corporate banking, The Dutch bank said the takeover price would be around FFr500m (Dollars 85m), though an exact sum has not yet been fixed with Swiss Volksbank, a subsidiary of Credit Suisse Holding. OBC, which has a staff of 250 and a balance sheet total of about FFr5.8bn, will continue to operate under existing management. It will retain its own identity and independence within the ABN Amro group. Vendex International, the privately-held Dutch retail group, plans to sell its 79 per cent stake in Staal Bankiers, the Dutch bank, to the country's fourth-largest insurance group, AVCB. The proposed deal brings to an end Vendex's long search for a buyer.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Coal Investments Shares in Coal Investments, formerly Geevor, rose 8p to 84p on their return to the market yesterday following a seven week suspension. The shares have been one of the market's most outstanding performers since Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, took over as chairman last September. They were relisted last October at 10p. Last month's suspension was to allow the company to undertake a programme to raise Pounds 11.5m, partly through a rights issue.</p>

He said that, in the 75-minute conversation, he had  primarily  described how the new moderately conservative political grouping  had been created and what had been done to draw lists of  candidates with a good chance of beating the progressives.    Berlusconi also admitted that he had talked to Scalfaro  about  his brother Paolo's judicial problems thanks to allegations that  he paid kickbacks to sell real estate. "I informed him of my  assessment of the fact and the situation," said Berlusconi.    Berlusconi also said that moderate conservatives such as the  ex-Christian Democrats of the People's Party and Pact for Italy  would create "uncertainty" in the voters by claiming to stand  for the bloc of moderate opinion known as the Centre in the old  political system.    "They are putting themselves in a position that is difficult  to explain to the people," he said adding that they face defeat  unless they say which side they are on. He also defended his  electoral alliance with the Northern League and the extreme  rightists of the Italian Social Movement.    In other remarks, Berlusconi maintained his potential  candidacy as prime minister.</p>

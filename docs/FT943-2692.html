			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Lenders take flight - Interest rate rise hits fixed mortgages Fixed-rate mortgage offers were withdrawn by the score this week as lenders reacted to the 0.5 per cent increase to the base rate announced on Monday by Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The new base rate is 5.75 per cent. Fixed mortgages guarantee that rates will not go up or down for a specified period and are, therefore, particularly attractive for borrowers who need to keep careful control over the family budget. Independent mortgage advisers say borrowers should act quickly to take advantage of the remaining good deals. 'But watch out for the small print,' warns Ian McKenna, a consultant with mortgage and pensions adviser Blyth McKenna. 'Some of the cheapest fixed rates are offered on the condition the borrower takes out expensive buildings and contents insurance.' Borrowers considering a fixed rate should treat with caution any scheme that imposes a deadline by which the deal must go through. McKenna says: 'Several of the largest building societies do this, and it creates severe problems for borrowers stuck in a chain who are not able to complete in time.' You should bear in mind, also, the early redemption penalties associated with fixed rates - usually worth three to six months' payments. But Ian Darby, marketing director at mortgage adviser John Charcol, points out that redemption penalties are a standard feature of most mortgage products - with the exception of variable rates. 'The main reason for getting out of a fixed rate would be if rates fell dramatically,' he says. 'We believe that the mortgage market has bottomed out and that rates will rise, not fall.' Owners who want to sell should not delay in the hope of price rises. Darby says: 'House prices will remain static apart from a few pockets of movement where demand outstrips supply. 'Now is a good time to move - mortgage rates are very competitive, and the ratio of income to house prices is at an all-time low.' Fixed rates in detail. The Royal Bank of Scotland has put up all of its fixed rate schemes. Its three-year fixed has gone from 7.95 per cent to 8.49, and the five-year fixed from 8.89 per cent to 9.24 per cent, according to Moneyfacts. National &amp; Provincial has put up some of its fixed-rate offers by 0.4 per cent to 0.6 per cent but has cut its one-year fixed rate for first-time buyers by 0.1 per cent to 1.75 per cent. The lender says this reduction is not at the expense of any changes in the mortgage's terms and conditions. N&amp;P also announced a new four-year fixed at 8.45 per cent for borrowers who have a minimum deposit of 10 per cent. Meanwhile, ScotLife Home Loans and the West Bromwich have launched jointly a 6.99 per cent fixed available through independent advisers. Providers to withdraw their fixed-rate offers include First Direct, Confederation Bank, Ipswich building society, First National building society, Mansfield building society, Household Mortgage Corporation, Bank of Ireland (Northern Ireland), Bank of Scotland and Centre Bank. TSB has withdrawn some - but not all - of its offers. Few lenders announced changes to their variable-rate mortgages - most are sitting on the fence until the Halifax rates come out next week. Of the providers that did, the average rise was 0.4 per cent, taking the typical figure to 8.14 per cent (see table 2). In practice, advisers tend to regard these rates purely as a benchmark. With so many good fixed-rate and discount schemes remaining on offer, borrowers who shop around see little attraction in an undiscounted variable rate. Elsewhere in the savings and investment market, there were few signs of movement. Banks and building societies said they would wait for Abbey National and the Halifax to go public on savings accounts before adjusting their own rates. The exceptions included Barclays and Northern Rock, which increased interest rates by between 0.1 and 0.35 per cent.  ------------------------------------------------------ TABLE 1: FIXED RATE MORTGAGES STILL AVAILABLE  ------------------------------------------------------ Provider       Rate %     Until    Fee*    RP**  Ins***                                 (Pounds)  ------------------------------------------------------ Britannia        5.50    1.9.96     195   3mths     Yes Britannia        6.99   1.10.97     225   6mths     Yes Britannia        8.15    1.9.99     275   6mths     Yes John Charcol     4.95    1.7.96     295   3mths      No John Charcol     6.49    1.7.97     Nil   3mths      No Lambeth          8.15    1.9.99     250   6mths     Yes Leeds &amp; Hol.     9.25    10 yrs     295   6mths      No N &amp; P            8.45    1.8.98     250   6mths      No N &amp; P            8.75    1.8.99     250   6mths      No Nthrn Rock       5.49    1.6.96     250   4mths     Yes Yorkshire        1.90    1.5.95     250   3mths     Yes  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: John Charcol. * Lender's fee ** Redemption penalty ***Compulsory bdgs &amp; cont ins  ------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------ TABLE 2: STANDARD VARIABLE MORTGAGE RATES UP  ------------------------------------------------------ Provider      Old rate  New rate         New   Existing                                    borrowers  borrowers  ------------------------------------------------------ Abbey National*   7.74      8.09   Immediate  Early Oct BNP Mortgages     7.59      7.97       4 Oct      3 Nov Nationwide        7.74      8.14     16 Sept      1 Oct Northern Rock     7.74      8.14     14 Sept      1 Oct Northern Bank     7.64      8.14     13 Sept    13 Sept  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Moneyfacts * February 1995 for borrowers in annual review scheme.  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

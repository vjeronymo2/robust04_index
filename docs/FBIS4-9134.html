			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Josef Maraczi: "Some 18,000 Soldiers Were </F> Persecuted"]    [Text] On Saturday [16 April], a declaration was issued at  the nationwide conference of the Military Association of the  Rehabilitated (VSR), whose members are soldiers persecuted for  political reasons between 1948 to 1989. In the declaration,  there is a statement that care for the rehabilitated soldiers,  retired soldiers, and widows of professional soldiers, plus  assistance in building a modern army of our democratic and  sovereign state, are the goals of this social organization.    The number of soldiers and civilian employees of the  Military  Administration who were persecuted for political reasons between  25 February 1948 and 1989 is about 18,000. They are officers,  warrant officers, and others. Some of them were even executed  or emigrated from the country. After November 1989, some 11,000  applications for rehabilitation were submitted. The Central  Rehabilitation Commission found 2,000 cases to be unfounded. A  total of 9,000 people were rehabilitated.    The VSR associates 3,826 members in 81 organizations. Josef  Svab, commander of the Military Hospital in Olomouc, was elected  new chairman of the association at a conference on Saturday. In  his speech, he said that, in view of his profession and the age  of the members of the association, he considers his main task to  be solving the social and health problems of the rehabilitated  soldiers. In the social sphere, the association wants to push  for the completion of the rehabilitation of people persecuted  for political reasons in the 1950's and 1970's.    The association also wants to put legal responsibility on  the  officers who participated in the preparation of repressive  actions of the communist regime, such as "Norbert", "Vlna", and  "Zasah" [cover names for actions conducted by former State  Security], and the suppression of the 1969 demonstration  commemorating 21 August [anniversary of the Soviet-led  invasion]. In cooperation with parliamentary deputies and the  Defense and Security Committee, the association is interested in  drafting new legal documents applicable to the Army, and a  consistent implementation of democratic changes in the Army.    Some participants in the meeting have shown dissatisfaction  over the absence of Defense Minister Baudys, who did not excuse  himself. Jiri Nekvasil, General Staff commander of the Czech  Army, was also criticized, mainly because of the letter he had  sent to the meeting and that was described as offensive by the  participants. This applies mainly to the passage in his letter  in which he said that he would not participate in the meeting  because "our ideas about the activity of your civilian  association with respect to the Army of the Czech Republic  differ." Commander Nekvasil also said in the letter that "he  cannot accept the idea that some members of the association are  trying to establish a separate group of soldiers within the  Army." However, he appreciated the activity of those who  contribute, using their experience, to the fulfillment of the  current tasks of the Czech Army.    The participants in Saturday's meeting are writing a letter  to Nekvasil in which they express surprise at the fact that no  representative from the Defense Ministry or the General Staff  took part in the conference, despite the fact that the  association is interested in cooperating with both bodies. "A  difference of opinion alone should not be a reason for a  negative stance of the Army command toward our association and  activity," the letter by people who were persecuted by the  communist regime and rehabilitated after November 1989 states.</p>

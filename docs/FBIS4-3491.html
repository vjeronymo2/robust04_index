			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- Eight to ten people,  including several soldiers, were involved in the murders of 24  Taiwan tourists and eight mainlanders at Lake Qiandao,  Director-General Yin Tsung-wen of the National Security Bureau  was quoted as saying Wednesday [20 April].    At a closed-door Legislative Yuan session, Yin said Beijing  was still trying to cover up the incident, Legislators Ting  Shou-chung and Chen Shui-pien said after the meeting.    Beijing originally claimed the tourists were killed in an  accident, but on Sunday admitted that it had arrested three  suspects in what it said was a "heinous robbery, arson and  murder case," although it fell short of details.    "The three detained by Beijing are just scapegoats," Yin was  quoted by ting and shen as saying. "There are others connected  with the incident who are not ordinary citizens."    Yin said his bureau from the start believed the victims were  robbed and murdered, based on information gathered by informants  in Mainland China. He said the informants reported that  mainland President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary  Jiang Zemin had set a two-week deadline for mainland police to  complete an inquiry into the incident. The report was confirmed  by the WEN WEI PAO, a Beijing-supported newspaper in Hong Kong,  on Tuesday.    Yin said his bureau will publish the information it has  obtained before Beijing begins its trial of the three suspects  as a way of pressing Beijing to be more forthcoming.    The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  (ARATS), Mainland China's intermediary body with Taiwan, in a  letter to its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) Wednesday reconfirmed the detention of the  three.    ARATS said the three had been planning a tour-boat robbery  on  the lake since last year. It said the robbers used explosives,  hunting rifles, and gasoline in their attack on the boat, using  jetskis to make their getaway.    Belongings of the victims, including money, watches, and  cameras, were later found at the homes of relatives of the three  robbers, ARATS said.    Meanwhile, in related news, President Li Teng-hui, while  receiving SEF President Ku Chen-fu on Wednesday morning, said  that Beijing "is moving in the right direction on the case."</p>

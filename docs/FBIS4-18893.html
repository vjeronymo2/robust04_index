			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Country's Catholic Bishops </F> Back New Government"]    [Text] (ANSA) Vatican City, April 11 -- Rwandan Catholic  bishops have thrown their support behind the new Kigali  government and called on the nation's catholics, 44 percent of  Rwanda's total population, to help the new leadership. The  country's four bishops were to have taken part in the African  Synod which has opened here.    In a statement released here by the Vatican press office,  Rwanda's bishops praised the armed forces for how they were able  to restore security and called on the authorities to "continue  to protect all, regardless of ethnic origin, party or region"  and to "neutralize those who block peace."    The bishops went on to strongly condemn those who initiated  the civil strife between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes, sparked by  the death of that nation's president, shot down in a plane  together with the president of neighboring Burundi.    In particular, the Rwanda bishops struck out against the  "spirit of vengeance" and the looting, massacres of innocent  civilians and religious workers "which has even taken place  inside churches... which is unprecedented."    The statement also underscored how the new government had  pledged a "return to peace and security, a fight against hunger  and negotiations with the Rwanda Patriotic Front."    "The Catholic Bishops of Rwanda" the statement to the press  read, "favor dialogue and sincere and efficient negotiations.  It is for this reason that they call on the government and the  Rwanda Patriotic Front to avoid the logic of war to resolve  their conflicts."    "They call on all Rwandans, and Christians in particular"  the  noted continued, "to show themselves to be the makers of peace,  protecting, in particular, those seeking refuge and giving aid  to the needy."    The Rwandan church officials added how they had been shocked  by the murders of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi and for  the successive bloodshed. "In these difficult and critical  times" the statement concluded, "each and all must avoid  reacting under the influence of rage."</p>

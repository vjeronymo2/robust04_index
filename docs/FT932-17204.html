			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (8): Private sector's patience tested to the limit - Monetary policy has run out of control over the past year THE EARLY months of 1993 have been a trying period for Nigeria's industrial and banking community. The confusion over exchange rate policy is testing the private sector's patience to the limit. Nigeria's monetary policy has run out of control over the past year, demonstrated by the growing gap between the parallel market and official exchange rates. This gap was closed in March 1992 by an 80 per cent depreciation of the naira which the central bank governor describes as 'a very courageous decision'. 'Other things being equal,' he says,'it could have stabilised the exchange rate and the economy.' But other things were not equal. Net credit to the federal government has continued to rise, by 130 per cent last year, while broad money rose by 55 per cent and inflation accelerated to an annual rate in excess of 50 per cent, in spite of the compulsory sale of N32bn in stabilisation securities to mop up excess liquidity. Not surprisingly, the demand for dollars grew as investors tried to reduce their naira balances. By December it was clear that the central bank was running out of foreign exchange reserves and could not continue to supply unlimited amounts of dollars at the official rate of N20 per dollar. The parallel market spread widened to 20 per cent from 5 per cent in mid-year. But rather than allow the official rate to depreciate, the central bank responded first by cancelling auctions and then switching to a Dutch auction system which only fuelled the depreciation. The nadir was reached in mid-February when the central bank cancelled an auction in the face of bids in excess of N30 from dollar- starved banks. The confusion is explained by divisions within the government. Finance secretary Chief Dele Olashore wants to stabilise the rate around N20 while the central bank wants to depreciate the rate and close the parallel market spread. In recent weeks the rate has been fixed at N24.99 to the dollar and the exchange allocated on a pro rata basis. But with less than 20 per cent of demand satisfied, the parallel market spread has continued to grow and the business community remains frustrated. The dispute has come at the wrong time for the central bank which had been hoping to shift from direct credit controls to an indirect policy based on open market operations. It has already abolished credit ceilings for financially sound banks and granted licences to four new discount houses. But it does not now expect to establish a liquid treasury bill market in time for an April start. The problem is partly that the current unstable envir-onment makes identifying stable relationships between interest rates, money supply and inflation very difficult. More fundamentally, the bank cannot hope to establish a credible TB market until the fiscal deficit is reduced and inflation is brought under control. Open market operations, the IMF argues, can only work if the bank can enforce the statutory limit on the the federal government's access to monetary finance, at present 12.5 per cent of federal revenues. But, as one banker pointedly asks, 'Who will bounce a cheque from the presidency?'</p>

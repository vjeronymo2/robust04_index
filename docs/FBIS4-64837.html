			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "France and Japan Reaffirm Firmness </F> Toward Pyongyang"]    [Text] France and Japan intend to stand firm on the  "nuclear" crisis between North Korea and the United Nations.  However, Japan wishes that "the door be left open for  negotiations." The risks created by North Korea's nuclear  policy were among the main topics addressed on Wednesday, 4 May  by Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in his successive  meetings with Francois Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac, and Edouard  Balladur.    Mr. Hata reiterated that his country agrees with the  statement issued last month by the Security Council, which  threatened with economic sanctions against North Korea should it  persist in refusing international inspectors access to its  nuclear facilities. According to Mr. Hata, Japan has asked China  to use its influence to get North Korea to come to terms.    Mr. Hata raised the issue of Japan becoming a permanent  member of the UN Security Council. He reminded his hosts that  France has been in favor of this notion and, more generally,  would like Japan to play a more prominent role in world affairs.    The Japanese prime minister also agreed that "it is not a  healthy state of affairs when a single country" (like Japan)  "has a trade surplus," adding that Tokyo "is attempting to open  its market to the world." In office since 25 April, Mr. Hata is  currently completing a European tour that already took him to  Rome and will take him next to Germany and Belgium, where he  will meet with Jacques Delors on Friday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Informed diplomatic and political sources in Aden  are certain that Iran's vigorous pursuit of the question of the  islands and its threats against the United Arab Emirates [UAE]  come within the framework of the total coordination, alliance,  and solidarity between this state, known for its stern  fundamentalist system, and the military ruling regime in Sanaa,  which is backed by the tribal fundamentalist and extremist  Reform Party. This party is known for its close links with the  jihad movement and fundamentalist groups in the Arab states and  elsewhere in the world. These sources express the view that  constant and intense contacts are being maintained between the  governments in Iran and Sanaa within a period of less than a  week.    In this respect the two foreign ministers have met while  officials in Sanaa, the last of whom was 'Abd-al-Wahhab  al-Anisi, the secretary general of the Reform Party, have met  the Iranian ambassador more than three times. The sources  stress that the pressure brought to bear on the UAE is an  attempt to shift it away from the clear stances it has adopted  towards the destructive war launched by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  against the people in the south of Yemen. The sources are  surprised by this alliance now formed between Iran and Sanaa,  recalling that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih stood strongly on the side  of Iraq during its war with Iran and sent to Iraq over 10  brigades to fight on Iraq's side against Iran.</p>

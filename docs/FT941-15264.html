			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Taking the year's pulse At this time of the year it is pointless asking restaurateurs for their predictions. Like jockeys and their mounts at the end of the National Hunt season they are exhausted. Over Christmas and new year they have packed the equivalent of six weeks trading into three, put tables and chairs into corners normally reserved for coatstands and served too many drinks to those who should have known better. Only the fresh air on the way to the bank has kept them going. To discover what sort of year 1994 would be for the restaurant industry, I turned to Champagne Charlie and Potato Pete, merchants who supply restaurants with their daily needs. These two characters, I have come to appreciate, have their finger on the pulse of the restaurant world. I took the necessary precautions, in dealing with Charlie and Pete, of avoiding straight questions. Both are entirely honest and trustworthy but they are salesmen. Such an approach would have produced a straight but premeditated response - the last thing I wanted. My first encounter was with Champagne Charlie, a London wine merchant who has carved a lucrative niche supplying the restaurant trade. He is a born optimist, a man for whom the wine glass is never half empty but rather always half full. At around 2.30pm he can be spotted around London's restaurants sitting down to a late lunch with the chef, the restaurant manager and the restaurant's wine buyer. Under the table will be a black, square briefcase which contains wines which, he believes, are indispensable for any good list. 'Bloody difficult for the next two years,' was his verdict on the restaurant trade. He said it with a smile, conscious of the pleasure he derives from his job, aware that for as long as restaurant-goers' wallets are being squeezed, his job has had to change. He is no longer sniffing, sampling and selling champagne - as he did so pleasurably during the 1980s - but spending more time searching for good value bottles which can be sold in a restaurant for Pounds 12 to Pounds 15. Of course, he will also be doing the job he dislikes most: monitoring his customers' accounts and making sure they pay on time. Potato Pete, naturally, shares the same concern about money but he has never known anything different. He started in the 1970s by buying in the old Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market and selling directly to restaurants from the back of a van. His business grew and, in the mid-1980s, he cleverly merged with a big wholesaler. Now he buys Pounds 20m worth of produce a year and watches others load the vans. But his working day is no more enviable. Up at 1am, at work until midday and then home for a short sleep, some time with the family and the opportunity to sample London's newest restaurants. Whatever the future may hold for Potato Pete, he believes that it is never going to be as good commercially as it was in the mid-1980s. Part of the problem is psychological. Everybody in the restaurant trade is so looking forward to the pre-Christmas boost that when it comes it never lives up to expectations. And there is one very specific reason why the mid-1980s' boom is unlikely to return. While all the restaurants in London may be fully booked for the last three weeks of December, real turnover, for the likes of Pete, lies in the hotel dining rooms which host corporate dinners, office Christmas parties and new year festivities. But company treasurers have been closely scrutinising corporate entertainment. Charlie and Pete do agree on one point that unites them with everyone else fortunate enough to have held their job: that whatever the financial outcome, they have never had to work so hard. This is not something which will surprise restaurateurs. With unsocial, long hours and an average net return of no more than 10 per cent, this has never been a business for the idle. However, the situation is unlikely to ease. Those restaurateurs adept enough to survive and prosper over the past three years will still struggle to answer the bookings line quickly enough. Their competitors, in less favourable sites with less appetising wares, will be less fortunate. Yet the prospects for restaurant-goers are good. Competition, a low inflation rate and increased demand will stop prices rising. And, as restaurateurs realise the importance of marketing, we should all benefit. Seth Lewis, a New Yorker trying to instil New York know-how into his job as food and beverage manager of the Grosvenor House, in central London, puts it succinctly: 'Business is good. The trouble is it is only good 40 weeks a year. We have got to make it 52.'</p>

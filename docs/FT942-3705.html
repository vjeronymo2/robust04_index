			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / BIS wary of direct curbs on derivatives: A look at the bank's reports as its annual meeting gets under way in Basle Central banks should be wary of direct control of the growth of new financial instruments such as derivatives, the Bank for International Settlements argues in its 1993-94 report, published to coincide with its annual meeting in Basle yesterday. But Mr Andrew Crockett, BIS general manager, writing in the report's conclusion, says: 'There is no inherent reason why the greater freedom to transact in capital markets should, in general, make prices more volatile. If anything, more depth and liquidity in markets, and a greater ability to disaggregate exposures and hedge unwelcome risks should reinforce the stabilising properties of markets.' While the BIS does not want to see direct controls on these markets, it does believe - as Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, argued last week - that they should be carefully monitored. 'Any official action should be directed at improving the ability of market participants to exploit the advantages of new instruments without jeopardising their own financial soundness or the stability of the financial system more widely,' the report says. Mr Crockett said yesterday: 'I don't think that administrative or restrictive controls are the right way in which to reduce the potential volatility that, it has been alleged, can be introduced by derivatives markets.' Mr Wim Duisenberg, BIS president, said financial markets must be strengthened. 'Positions or trading strategies which may appear reasonable from the perspective (of an individual firm) can be a source of difficulties when aggregated across agents.' In the case of derivatives, Mr Duisenberg said clearing house arrangements which guard against risk for exchange traded instruments have proved extremely difficult to extend to the over-the-counter markets. Furthermore, Mr Duisenberg said, further work is needed to improve settlement systems, particularly those relating to international transactions. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, for which the BIS is the secretariat, is working on a guidance paper for bank supervisors on the control of the risks arising from derivatives activities. The committee is also studying the models used by individual banks to monitor risk. Mr Crockett warned banks should be careful when dealing with non-financial groups. Referring to recent problems at companies such as Metallgesellschaft, he said: 'Banks must be very careful in selling products to unsophisticated large users. They must also take fully into account the credit risk of dealing with non-bank users.' The BIS also calls for further study into the way that the growth of derivative instruments may have affected the response of the economy to policy changes by the monetary authorities, such as movements in interest rates. 'The extent to which such changes in behavioural response call for adaptations in how central banks implement policy is unclear, but it is a question that deserves, and is the subject of, further investigation as these markets continue to grow.' In essence, however, the BIS believes instability is more likely to arise from failures in government and central bank policy, than from new financial instruments. 'What capital market innovations demonstrate is the need for stable monetary policies, implemented in a medium term framework,' says the report. 'If market participants have confidence in the medium-term environment for investment decisions, then these decisions are more likely to contribute to stability and less likely to have disruptive consequences.'</p>

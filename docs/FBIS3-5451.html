			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At present, foreign investors have more confidence  in investing in Thailand. Japan has now categorized Thailand as  the world's fourth most favorable country for investments. Mr.  Suphachai Phanitchaphak, deputy prime minister, said that  because of this sense of confidence, Japan is planning to move  automobile spare parts and computer parts production bases to  Thailand. This is because it is predicted that the trend of  Thailand's economic growth rate this year will be even higher  due to the expansion of investment in both the public and  private sectors.    [Begin Suphachai recording] While the rate of our economic  development growth is, in my opinion, rather good this year --  at least eight percent -- the inflation rate here is between  three and four percent, which is lower than the world's average  inflation rate. Therefore, we should not worry about our  financial stability. The same is true with the stability of our  exchange rates. This is because at this point our monetary  reserves amount to U.S. $26 billion so far, thus making our  country rank one among the world's top ten for most favorable  places for investment. With such a large volume of monetary  reserves on hand, we should not have any concern about the  natural flow of our cash. [end recording]    The deputy prime minister, however, admitted that Thailand  still encounters problems in agricultural production. The  government has paid special attention to this development and  has encouraged farmers to switch from planting low-priced crops  to growing other alternative crops which fetch better prices.  The government has already provided low interest rate loans to  farmers who wish to do so. In addition, the government is now  keeping a close watch on the approved investment projects in  Zone 3 to see whether the trend of investment has expanded from  the zone's center to its sub regions or not so that a cross  border link-up can be set up with the economies of some  neighboring countries. In the meantime, the government is  speeding up the implementation of a project to link the eastern  region with the northeast. This project has already been  approved and its construction designs laid out.    [Begin Suphachai recording] At the beginning of last year,  applications for government approval to invest in Zone 3  increased five fold or 500 percent. We are now waiting to see  how much money these investors, who received approval from the  government, will spend on their initial investment and in which  direction these investments will expand. Since the investment  has been targeted for the center of Zone 3, we have yet to see  whether it will be expanded to the zone's sub regions,  especially border areas with neighboring countries. This trend  will pave the way for our economy to spread out from the center  to remote regions, especially border areas. There is a bright  prospect of success in this direction because the Asian  Development Bank and other countries have rendered support to  such endeavors. I believe that problems in the remote border  areas will be resolved more smoothly. [end recording]</p>

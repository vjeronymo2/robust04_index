			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / This Week: Young's comeback - Music Kurt Cobain's suicide note - 'It's better to burn out than to fade away' was a quotation from Neil Young's bracing Rust Never Sleeps album, an unhappy citation which seems to have unsettled the grizzly veteran; Sleeps with Angels (Reprise) is his most troubled and intense album for more than a decade, as far from the comforting homilies of his former partners in harmony as you can get. The album's stand-out track, 'Change Your Mind', is a return to his very best form. Prince makes another stab at the Madonna Award for Sexual Subtlety with his disappointing Come (Warner Brothers). Plenty of bumping and grunting fails to compensate for a distinct shortage of ideas, while even the musical groove is sounding a little dated. Best to switch off after 'Orgasm' and settle down with the lattest in a bewildering series of 'theme' compilations, Classic Sleepies (Teldec), a motley collection of adagios and serenades. If you hear the final track you have wasted your money, in theory you should have fallen asleep by then. After giving highly-acclaimed performances of Handel's Messiah all over France for the past three years, William Christie and Les Arts Florissants have finally committed the work to disc (harmonia mundi) with fine results. Andreas Scholl's clear, pure alto stands out among an excellent young cast of singers which includes Barbara Schlick and Mark Padmore. Treasures from the past continue to be unearthed, digitally re-mastered and released for a public which seems to have an infinite thirst to listen and compare; recommended by no less than Wilhelm Furtwangler, Dimitri Mitropoulos made his own considerable impact on the Salzburg Festival when he took over the great man's Don Giovanni in the summer of 1956. The live recording of that performance, re-mastered directly from Austrian Radio tapes, is issued for the first time by Sony, and features the young Cesare Siepi, Elisabeth Grummer and Lisa della Casa, ably backed by the Vienna Philarmonic. At budget price, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Karl Bohm, is the conductor's 1967 Bayreuth Festival recording of the complete Ring cycle (Philips)on 14 cds, featuring Birgit Nilsson, Wolfgang Windgassen, Theo Adam and James King.</p>

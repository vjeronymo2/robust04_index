			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: A short-sighted policy At first glance the US Treasury's decision to switch its borrowings from long-dated bonds to short-term bills and notes appears sensible enough. Currently two-year money at 3.75 per cent looks much cheaper than 30-year bonds at over 6.75 per cent. The US Treasury estimates that the change will save Dollars 1.6bn in 1994 and a total of around Dollars 16bn by 1998. Short-term rates are, however, volatile and once recovery gathers pace the administration could see its cost of funds rising rapidly. As bond yields would also start to rise the government is in danger of missing its opportunity to fund the deficit at the lowest long-term rates available for a generation. This policy switch also puts the Federal Reserve in an invidious position, since as soon as it feels the need to tighten monetary policy it will worsen the government's fiscal plight. The bind would be all the tighter because, as loan demand picks up, banks will start to liquidate their substantial holdings of short-term government debt. Treasury yields may thus rise faster than general interest rates. In theory borrowing short-term money imposes an extra discipline on the government by making inflation - and therefore short-term rates - more punitive. Politicians, however, rarely respond to such pressures. Meanwhile long-term bonds will become less liquid. The market's focus will shift towards 10-year maturities as a benchmark, upsetting the stripped coupon market. The loss of seven-year issues could cause ructions in the interest rate swap, while the bond futures tail may also increasingly wag the cash market dog. The market's response was thus understandably cautious  -all the more so because the administration's action smacks of displacement activity to avoid tackling the underlying budget deficit.</p>

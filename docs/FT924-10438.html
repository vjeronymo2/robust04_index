			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Rao tries to defuse farm protests: Reformers fear challenge to economic liberalisation programme MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, yesterday pledged to increase state subsidies for farmers in an attempt to defuse a serious challenge to his government's economic reform programme. The move is a response to protests from farmers over cuts in fertiliser subsidies, a key element of the reforms. The promise of cash for small farmers highlights the increasing difficulties the government faces in implementing reforms which hurt special interest groups favoured by India's complex network of state support. Some economists fear that Mr Rao's programme could grind to a halt if he pays too much attention to complaints from such groups. As well as the farmers, there has been criticism of the economic liberalisation from state-owned financial and industrial corporations, groups of civil servants and trade union leaders. Moreover, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a leading opposition party which is orchestrating protests against Mr Rao's economic policies, has called for a nationwide strike on Tuesday. However, finance ministry officials denied yesterday's promise to small farmers represented any departure from the reform programme. Rather, it reflected an admission that the fertiliser cuts may have been implemented too hastily. Also small farmers, many of whom can barely afford to feed their families, are widely recognised as needing support. The farmers' anger was first roused last year when the government launched its reforms and raised the state-controlled prices of fertilisers by 30 per cent, the first increase in a decade. This summer, ministers ordered the complete decontrol of the prices of two types of fertiliser - phosphate and potash products, prompting increases of up to 300 per cent. The price of nitrogen-based fertilisers, the most widely used, was cut by 10 per cent to soften the blow, but it was not enough. Demonstrations broke out, including one in the town of Ramkola, northern India, in which four people were killed. Mr Rao has tried to appease the farmers through the promise of a Rs5bn rural infrastructure loan and a Rs3.4bn subsidy for the purchase of potash fertilisers. Yesterday, at a meeting with farmers, he promised to increase grants for small farmers from Rs3.5bn last year to Rs5bn. However, encouraged by opposition parties, farmers may demand more. Acknowledging this danger, Mr Rao yesterday urged a farmers' delegation to work in their fields and avoid politics. The Reserve Bank of India has asked a judge to arbitrate in a Rs5.06bn dispute arising from the securities market scandal between ANZ Grindlays, the Australian-owned bank, and National Housing Bank, a Reserve Bank subsidiary. If Grindlays were to lose the dispute, it would become the second foreign-owned bank to suffer a substantial scandal-linked loss, following Standard Chartered Bank of the UK which has admitted losing Rs8.9bn.</p>

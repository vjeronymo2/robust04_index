The criminal murderer Baruch  Goldstein, who committed the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, belonged  to one of these organizations.    In fact, this measure will not convince anyone. The Zionist  settlers are still in the heart of Hebron provoking Arab  citizens. They were joined a few days ago by more extremists.  Rabin has refused to evacuate them from the city despite  demands made by some Israeli ministers. He also refused to  touch the settlements or discuss their future within the  framework of the self-rule talks. What is even more serious is  the fact that Rabin is still holding contacts with the Zionist  extremist movement, Tzomet, to make it join the government. The  leader of that movement, former General Rafa'el Etan, is well  known for his racist tendencies, hatred against the Arabs, and  calls for expelling them by force from their homes and annexing  the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Israel.    Rabin's government should have taken measures to restore  confidence to the Washington talks, such as announcing its  readiness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories in  return for peace and taking decisive deterrent measures against  the settlers. Israel has done nothing of the sort. The Israeli  Government has only disarmed two settlers and has not uttered  one word on the future of the occupied territories.    If we review recent events we can see the extent of the  Israeli officials' deception. In only one month, more than 30  people were killed by Israeli Army fire in the occupied  territories. South Lebanon was the target of the most severe  and savage land and air bombardment. As for the two Zionist  organizations, Kakh and Kahana, whose activities were banned by  Rabin, they have committed several crimes in the occupied  territories in the past years. Rabin's ban is not different  from his pledge not to use the U.S. loans for settlement  activities. He allocated a large share of these loans -- some  $500 million, according to the U.S. State Department -- to  expand the settlements and arm the settlers and attract them  with money and free housing to live in the occupied territories  and terrorize the Arab citizens.    Restoring confidence to the Arab-Israeli talks can only be  achieved through a public announcement by Rabin of his readiness  to withdraw from the occupied territories and implement UN  Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. Syria has  always spoken about its readiness for a complete peace in return  for a comprehensive withdrawal. Has Rabin, or any other Israeli  official, uttered the words "complete peace?" The Arabs have  not heard this yet. What they heard from the Israelis in  Washington and outside Washington was an endless series of  security pretexts, as if Israel's security can only be realized  by murdering and humiliating Arabs, confiscating their land and  property, and expelling them from their homes.    The Middle East peace has its basic prerequisites which  cannot be tampered with or avoided, foremost of which is  recognition of the Arab rights and withdrawal from the occupied  territories. The Palestinian people have the right to enjoy  freedom and dignity like all others peoples in the world.  Lebanon also has the right to regain its southern part and its  citizens in the south have the right to live a tranquil and  peaceful life free from the daily Israeli bombardment. Syria  has the right to regain the Golan Heights and the evacuees have  the right to return to their homes and property. These are the  conditions for peace. Certainly, there can be no peace without  meeting these conditions.    Syria, along with all Arabs, is yearning for a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East that would allow regional  states to develop their economic and developmental resources and  provide prosperity and well-being to their peoples. Such a  peace cannot be built while the Israeli threat is still  standing, while the Israeli aggression continues, and while the  Israeli expansionism drags out as a daily fact and a criminal  practice. Peace runs counter to aggression, expansionism, and  settlement activities. Aggression, expansionism, and settlement  activities run counter to the principles of the world community.</p>

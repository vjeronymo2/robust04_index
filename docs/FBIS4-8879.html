			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic received  today Veljko Knezevic, head of the Zagreb-based Bureau of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, who delivered a letter of  introduction from Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic.    Valentic stressed that the Croatian Government was aware of  its historic responsibility, stressing that all problems in  former Yugoslavia could be solved only through negotiations.  Valentic stressed that there is no alternative to negotiations,  through which a settlement in the interest of both Croatia and  Yugoslavia and of the Croatian and the Serb nations ought to be  attained. He added that the return of refugees was of  particular importance to Croatia.    We should proceed step by step in negotiations. A final  settlement cannot be reached immediately, Valentic said,  recalling that Croatia would never agree to ceding any part of  its territory. The Croatian prime minister also stressed that  his government would help the work of the Bureau of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb to a maximum degree.    Knezevic said that the opening of the Bureau of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb and the Office of the Republic  of Croatia in Belgrade was an initial step in the normalization  of relations. He also expressed the hope that Croatian Foreign  Minister Mate Granic and his Yugoslav counterpart Zeljko Simic  would meet soon.    In response, Valentic said that certain conditions would  have  to be created first, one of which was the reopening of the  Zagreb-Belgrade highway. Granic would travel to Belgrade on  this highway. He asked Knezevic to use his influence through the  Yugoslav Government so that the Serbs in Knin would continue  talks with Croatian Government representatives. The Croatian  prime minister reiterated a firm view that negotiations could be  held only on the territory of the Republic of Croatia and  nowhere else.    The head of the Bureau of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  in Croatia expressed his pleasure over the way he was received  in Zagreb and over the working conditions, adding that the  public in his country was very interested in the gradual  normalization of relations with Croatia. Knezevic relayed his  government's stance that Yugoslavia had no territorial claims to  any part of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,  outside the present-day Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He also  added that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would agree with  all the solutions achieved in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia on  the basis of negotiations and in a peaceful way.</p>

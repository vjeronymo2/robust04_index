			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Tory election win fails to lift retail spending SALES on Britain's high streets were virtually flat last month, suggesting that the Conservative general election victory failed to prompt a spending boom. The volume of retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in May, compared with April's 0.8 per cent month-on-month rise, when sales were boosted because of Easter falling late. Although last month's increase was the second consecutive monthly rise, the three-monthly trends suggest that British consumers are still reluctant to spend. In the three months to May, sales fell by 0.1 per cent on the previous three months and were down 0.3 per cent on the same period a year previously. The figures from the Central Statistical Office add to evidence that retail sales have yet to show a sustained recovery. Last week the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey painted a similar picture of sluggish sales. Most recent figures from the CSO show that sales by food retailers rose by 0.4 per cent in the latest three months, and sales by department stores by 0.6 per cent. Sales of non-food items - including clothing, footwear and household goods - were less encouraging, falling by 0.6 per cent in the three months to May compared with the previous three-month period. The British Retail Consortium, a trade group that claims to represent 90 per cent of the retail industry, said May was a month in which sectors reacting favourably to good weather did best. The Treasury welcomed the figures, pointing out that sales in May were at the highest level since November 1991. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade spokesman, said: 'Today's figures showing flat retail sales confirm that the British economy is yet to experience the promised Tory post-election boom.'</p>

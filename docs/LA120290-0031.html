			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PERFORMANCE ART OF JOHN FLECK: WORDS FROM THE ARTIST AND ONE OF HIS  CRITICS;  </P> <P> BELOW IS A LETTER FROM PERFORMANCE ARTIST AND ACTOR JOHN FLECK, THE SUBJECT OF  A NOV. 18 ARTICLE BY JAN BRESLAUER.  </P> <P> Regarding the quotes from critic-director Charles Marowitz in Breslauer's  article, I am curious whether Marowitz actually saw "Blessed Are All the Little  Fishes." My work deals with being human.  </P> <P> Perhaps what has caused trouble for some is that I see sexuality, and its many  variances, as part of this experience.  </P> <P> I know the work I've done has reached a wide audience, because I discuss  religious issues, masculine/feminine behavior, dysfunctional families,  addiction, environmental issues, politics, etc.  </P> <P> Marowitz is incorrect in his assumption that my performance is "circumscribed  within gay experience." Marowitz has chosen to fixate on the word gay,  mentioning it six times. I find it queer that the monologue he refers to never  once uses the word.  </P> <P> I am fed up with this labeling of my work. Marowitz is labeling rather than  being aware of his own emotional reactions to difficult material. (This is the  kind of logic that perpetuates stereotypes -- and, for that matter, fuels the  NEA controversy.)  </P> <P> The rise in fundamentalist thought points to people searching for simple  answers. I don't propose to give them. Marowitz does the disservice of limiting  my audience by his inability to deal with complex issues.  </P> <P> JOHN FLECK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

But he did not deny that an indication to that effect might  have been given to Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein at an  unauthorised meeting. The government has acknowledged that two  unauthorised meetings did take place.    Sir Patrick's comments came before a BBC TV programme last  night which claimed a government representative had told Mr  McGuinness at a meeting three days after last year's Warrington  bombing that Britain's long-term intention was to pull out.    Speaking in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick said: "Nobody has  ever been authorised to say on behalf of the British government  that the British government intends to withdraw from Northern  Ireland."    A previously released Sinn Fein account of the meeting --  said to have taken place on March 23 last year -- made no  reference to a signal from the British representative that  Britain might withdraw.    Sinn Fein's account does refer to remarks by the  representative to the effect that "the final solution is union."    The representative said that Sir Patrick wanted Sinn Fein to  play a part in achieving a settlement for the province "not  because he likes Sinn Fein but because it cannot work without  them."    "Any settlement not involving all of the people North and  South won't work," Sinn Fein's note added.</p>

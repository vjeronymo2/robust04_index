			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The mainly Afar FRUD [Front for the Restoration of  Unity and Democracy] rebels in Djibouti might have taken a  beating in last year's big government offensive, but it seems  the fighting is not over. The rebels are pinned down in the  northern Tadjoura area, where they claim to be giving the  government a lot of problems by launching hit-and-run raids on a  wide range of targets including military convoys, and there are  reports of a sizable clash in the region on Wednesday [26  January] this week. Raggi Omar asked FRUD's Europe  representative in Paris, Ismael Ahmed, what information he had  about this week's fighting.    [Begin recording] [Ahmed] Yes, we have made lots of action  in  the Tadjoura and Obock area against governmental positions and  against even convoys, and the FRUD fighters had success in all  those actions.    [Omar] And how many convoys have you hit, and what kind of  convoys were they?    [Ahmed] They were military convoys. We had a lot of them,  approximately 16 or 17 in this month and a lot of positions of  government.    [Omar] Is this fighting still going on?    [Ahmed] It is, yes. In some areas, it is still going on,  but we are moving guerrillas, and we cannot say when and how we  will wage future actions.    [Omar] So let me get this straight. Your military tactic is  to effectively make large parts of northern Djibouti  ungovernable by the Djiboutian forces that are there.    [Ahmed] No, our objective is to withdraw the Gouled  government. We are convinced that the fundamental problem of  Djibouti cannot get a solution other than a political solution,  so we are doing everything in our possibility to withdraw that  government.    [Omar] It sounds like--from what you are saying--FRUD has  been pinned down in that northern Tadjoura area and that all you  are able to do effectively is to launch these hit-and-run  attacks and that there is not much more than you can do apart  from that.    [Ahmed] No, because we have done other actions. We have  liberated, you know, at the beginning of the armed struggle,  two-thirds of the territory, but we have faced a lot of  logistical problems because we are not the state and we are not  helped by another state. So now, we are doing--with our own  means--the armed struggle, and we have adapted ourselves  according to our means. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Smart price for nave painting: Saleroom A SMALL landscape by the French nave artist Dominique-Paul Peyronnet sold for Pounds 89,100 at Sotheby's auction of Impressionist and Modern art yesterday. It had carried an estimate of Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 1,500. Two bidders competed for 'La Source', an imaginative view of a stream, and it was eventually sold to Dina Vierny, who is opening a gallery devoted to nave art in Paris later this year. Works by Peyronnet, who died in 1943, rarely appear on the market, which accounts for Sotheby's cautious estimate. The auction totalled Pounds 2m, with just over 25 per cent unsold. A view of Venice by Albert Marquet did well at Pounds 82,500 and two works by Utrillo found buyers at Pounds 68,200 and Pounds 59,400. There was good demand for ceramics by Picasso, and 'Les Chats' by Leonora Carrington almost doubled its estimate at Pounds 41,800. In an attempt to stimulate the weakest sector of the art market Sotheby's reduced estimates and reserves and was selective in what it accepted for sale. Dealers are still thin on the ground and most of the buyers were private collectors, mainly American and British. The main disappointment was the failure of 'Monument aux Oiseaux' by Max Ernst to find a buyer. In 1989 a similar work by Ernst made Pounds 220,000, but this time there were few bids even though Sotheby's was looking for only Pounds 60,000.</p>

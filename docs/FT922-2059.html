			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: AMR expects second-quarter loss AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, yesterday underscored the impact of a price-cutting war on US airline profits when it warned it would almost certainly make a second-quarter loss. American blamed the red ink on fare price-cutting and a significant increase in fuel costs. American has traditionally led pricing in the industry and sparked off the current war last April when it announced a new, simpler domestic fare structure which sharply cut the price of its most expensive tickets. The airline said at the time that the initiative was likely to take as much as Dollars 100m off first-quarter revenue but could eventually raise revenue by as much as Dollars 350m annually. However, the new fare structure for business passengers was quickly undercut by rivals desperate for customers, while in late May the industry temporarily slashed tourist fares in an effort to drum up summer business. Northwest Airlines led that round, but American then seized the initiative with even deeper cuts. Northwest announced this week it would raise domestic fares 10 per cent from June 26 in what was seen by the industry as an attempt to regain lost revenue and encourage its rivals to push up fares as well. However, none of the big three US carriers - American, United and Delta - made any immediate move to follow Northwest's lead. AMR reported net income of Dollars 20m, or 28 cents a share, in the first quarter of this year, on revenues of Dollars 3.51bn. In the second quarter of last year the company made Dollars 10.3m, or 15 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 3.19bn. The company's shares dipped yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing down Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 62 5/8.</p>

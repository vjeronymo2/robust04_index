			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (6): Creature from outer space - Profile of SCI of Huntsville, Alabama ONE of the fruits of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) programme in the 1960s was that it spawned a new generation of innovative electronics companies. One is SCI, founded in Alabama by Olin B King, a former Nasa engineer who began a three-man business manufacturing flight simulators for the moon shots in his basement in 1961. King realised, however, that there was not much volume in 18 moon shots. So he diversified the company, initially called Space Craft Inc., into building a wide range of electronic systems under contract. By 1969, when the Apollo launch vehicle left the Kennedy Space centre launch pad, it was carrying more than 400 SCI-built sub-systems providing vital instrumentation, communication and computer functions, including some in the lunar lander. Eight years later, in August 1977, SCI built the plated-wire memories for the highly successful Voyager 2 spacecraft whose systems were still operating flawlessly more than a decade later. When the original IBM PC made its appearance in 1981 it came with a SCI-manufactured motherboard. SCI also manufactured the Sinclair-designed Z88 computer. By the mid 1980s SCI had become a Fortune 500 company in its own right. Today it is one of the biggest and oldest contract electronics manufacturers employing about 9,500 people in 19 manufacturing plants worldwide, and serving mainly multinational customers in North America, Western Europe and South East Asia where it has plants in Singapore and Thailand. Last year, the publicly-quoted group, which is still based at Huntsville, reported net income of Dollars 3.83m on revenues of Dollars 1.05bn despite the recession. SCI's major worldwide IT customers in the year to June 30 last year included IBM, Seagate Technology and Conner Peripherals, which together accounted for almost half its total revenues. However, SCI is now a major diversified manufacturer for both the Government and commercial markets. It designs, manufactures, markets and services electronic products for OEM (original equipment manufacturers) customers in many industries including the aerospace, telecommunications, medical and banking sectors. Its investment in electronics manufacturing technology is enormous. Overall the group, which began to install surface mount technology (SMT) production lines in 1985, had 75 fully automated SMT assembly lines in operation by mid 1992 together with 34 traditional lines using the older PTH (plated-through-hole) technology. The group is divided into five geographic regions each with multiple plants manufacturing components, sub-assemblies and finished products for customers, but also increasingly offering a full 'turnkey' option including design, engineering, purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and support services if required. The growth of SCI's international operations, including those in Europe, directly reflects the increasing globalisation of the world electronics industry. SCI followed its OEM customers overseas in order to maintain its global manufacturing relationships. For example, SCI's European region comprises two manufacturing facilities, one in Irvine, Scotland, and the other in Fermoy, County Cork,in the Irish Republic. Both sites reflect the establishment of significant offshore manufacturing bases by global OEMs over the past decade. In Scotland, SCI followed customers such as IBM, Sun Micro systems and Mitsubishi which needed to establish operations in Europe and were attracted to the region by a range of incentives. Similarly the Fermoy plant, which employs 300 people, was set up in 1989 to provide electronic assemblies to Irish manufacturing operations of multinational OEMs such as Dell Computer which set up operations in Ireland as part of their global manufacturing strategies. 'They all want to manufacture close to the market because it gives flexibility,' says Mr Bruce Armstrong, SCI senior vice president in charge of the European division. SCI's size and dispersed operations are a significant advantage when dealing with large multinational OEMs because it can offer customers considerable flexibility. If a customer's market or manufacturing need changes by location or demand, production can be switched to any SCI plant in a matter of days. For example, a complete new SMT line can be flown in from Huntsville and, says Armstrong, 'be up and running within two weeks'. Because modern contract manufacturing is capital intensive the cost differential between different regions is not usually significant. 'These days the cost is a given, but it is flexibility that counts,' when it comes to holding on to customers, he says. Nevertheless he accepts that the European plants have to be able to match the Far East on the basis of 'landed' or total contract price - including those costs which are often overlooked such as transport, inventory and other less tangible items such as delays and inflexibility. It is a measure of the success at Irvine in controlling overheads and other costs while providing flexibility that it has recently succeeded in winning some contracts back from the Far East. The 120,000 sq ft Scottish plant was set up in 1984, mainly to supply IBM's Greenock PC operations. Today it employs about 800 people although, like most other large contract electronics manufacturers, SCI also uses a pool of casual labour and the workforce is expanded by several hundred temporary workers at busy times. Equipment at Irvine includes 12 Fuji SMT lines, each costing about Dollars 1m, four Universal PTH lines and three system configuration lines. Currently 80 per cent of output is SMT, 15 per cent PTH and 5 per cent even newer technologies such as COB (chip on board). But by the turn of the century Mr Armstrong expects the proportions to be 75 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. The product mix is also changing. Five years ago 90 per cent of production was for the IT industry. However the plant has broadened its customer base. IT now represents about 70 per cent, telecommunications 20 per cent and automotive 10 per cent with telecoms and the automotive sectors growing rapidly. SCI has also expanded its range of services and increasingly sees itself as being in a beneficial partnership with its customers. Some customers still only require a consignment manufacturing service - they supply all the materials. However, Mr Armstrong says the 'more enlightened' OEMs have long since moved towards much broader 'turnkey' contracts where services can range from product engineering and design for manufacturing, through procurement, manufacturing and testing to distribution. SCI designs and manufactures some products completely. For example, it designs and builds its own PCs, which are then badged by two big computer companies. Mr Armstrong acknowledges that there is some temptation for SCI to widen its business and sell products under its own name. However, he adds, 'in the end it's about doing what you are good at'. And for SCI that is being expert at capital intensive, high technology, flexible contract manufacturing. In order to maximise flexibility while minimising costs SCI uses automated manufacturing systems and electronic data interchange (EDI) to provide sophisticated links with its customers and suppliers and to interconnect its own plants. 'The reason we are efficient is that each plant is a profit and loss centre. They have to make a profit,' says Mr Armstrong. The two European plants export 50 per cent of their production to continental Europe, and the percentage is rising so SCI is likely to build a new plant in Europe soon, probably in France. When any of its plants reaches full capacity SCI builds another rather than expanding existing facilities. This is because it believes that overheads increase quickly when a plant becomes too large. 'Otherwise you become an OEM,' says Mr Armstrong. 'In our business small and medium is beautiful.'</p>

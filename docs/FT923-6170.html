			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / 'Sea ape' theory finds friends: British Association for the Advancement of Science THE AQUATIC ape theory that many of the features distinguishing humans from primates were acquired 5m years ago when our species was living in the Afar Sea, off the east coast of Africa, found few dissenters at the meeting. Ms Elaine Morgan, who says she has been cold-shouldered by the scientific community because she has no formal scientific qualifications, gave a presentation on the theory published by the late Professor Alister Hardy in 1960. She was drawn to the idea after it was featured in Dr Desmond Morris's 1967 book The Naked Ape. Since then she has fought to get Prof Hardy's ideas accepted by anthropologists after advocating them in her controversial book, Descent of Woman, published in 1972. According to the sea ape theory, humans learned to stand on legs simply to keep their heads above water. It holds that babies can swim at birth because this reflex is natural to a species that has at some time lived in the sea and that thick body hair was lost because storing fat under the skin is a better way to keep warm - and afloat. Mr Chris Knight, a paleo-anthropologist at the University of East London, said: 'If Elaine is right, 90 per cent of anthropologists are wrong, and they certainly aren't going to admit it. In my view, they have no choice but to concede, and that will happen within the next five to 10 years at most.'</p>

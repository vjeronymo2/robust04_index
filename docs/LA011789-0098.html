			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The European Community Commission has begun an inquiry into imports of  Asian-made audio cassette tapes, which are allegedly being sold in the  12-nation trade bloc at below market prices. The commission opened the probe  after receiving a complaint from the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers  Federations on behalf of European producers of audio tapes. The complaint  alleges that imports from Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong rose 23% between  1984 and 1987 and that the three countries' share of the European market had  climbed to 71%. The complaint also alleges that the Asian tapes were  undercutting prices charged by European producers by up to 28.5%.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Denis Molchanov: "View From the Regions"] </F>   [Text] "Reforms in Russia--View From the Regions"--this is  the title of the latest report from the All-Russian Center for  Study of Public Opinion [VTsIOM] prepared with assistance from  the Friedrich Ebert Fund (Germany).    Specialists of the VTsIOM and the Ebert Fund polled about  400  business leaders in 12 regional centers of Russia: chiefs of  administrations, mayors of cities, directors of enterprises,  merchants, bankers, and stock brokers. These people's views on  the problems of separation of power, the development of Russian  federalism, and the division of authority between the center and  the provinces were the subject of the sociologists' study. It is  customary to think that the opinion of the oblast leader carries  weight only after it makes its way to Moscow--over seven decades  it has become so firmly set in our brains that we frequently  overlook statements from "provincials." And we take notice only  when the justifiably offended region proclaims itself to be the  "center."    Scholars are supposed to be intelligent in that they are the  first to recognize the tendencies in the development of society.  Clearly aware of who will be the main force in the forthcoming  extra or regular presidential elections, sociologists have  decided to insure themselves ahead of time against surprises  like the one that occurred on 12 December of last year. And it  seems that they have achieved a certain amount of success. I am  thinking of the information that    --as a country that could serve as an example for Russia in  economic development, China was named in first place, then came  Western Europe and Japan, and the United States came only after  that,    --two-thirds of those questioned think that Russia's economy  should be a unified organism,    --85 percent of businessmen think that all regions of the  country must have the same degree of independence and autonomy,  and only 11 percent think that the regions densely populated by  non-Russian nationalities should have a special national status,    --when evaluating the attempt at the putsch in Moscow during  3-4 October 1993, 40 percent of those questioned think what  happened was a "predictable outcome of the resistance of the  Supreme Soviet to the democratic transformations and market  reforms." One-third think that the putsch was organized by  political and military adventurists and the legislative and  executive powers were drawn into it. And 27 percent think that  this was an "authoritarian coup of the Yeltsin government which  eliminated the parliamentary branch of power and established a  dictatorship,"    --on the whole almost half of the businessmen in Russia  assess the political situation in Russia as a loss of order,  growth of anarchy, etc.    What do you think of the course of the political reforms in  the country?    [Following are converted from bar graphs]    The reforms should be continued, but gradually, without  shock  measures and increasing the social protection of the  population--66 percent.    The reforms should be continued using more radical measures  than at present--23.7 percent.    Which of our society's domestic problems are bothering you  most now?    the weakness and helplessness of state power--45.2 percent    the growth of the number of crimes--45 percent    the growth of prices--33.2 percent    the crisis of ethics, culture, and morality--31.9 percent    the disintegration of economic ties among the republics of  the former Union--31.7 percent    the threat of mass unemployment--20.4 percent    the corruption of representatives of the state  apparatus--20.4 percent    the aggravation of national conflicts--10.8 percent    the threat of a dictatorship--8.5 percent    the deterioration of the condition of the environment--7.8  percent    the shortage of food products and necessities--3.5 percent    the abandonment of the ideals of socialism--2 percent.    Tell us, please, which economic system seems to you to be  the  most correct for Russia?    the one based on private property and market relations--72.2  percent    difficult to answer--15.2 percent    the one based on state planning and distribution--12.7  percent.    In your opinion, which of the business leaders and  economists  have the correct idea of how to lead Russia out of the economic  crisis?    Yavlinskiy--42.7 percent    Gaydar--19.1 percent    Volskiy--13.3 percent    Travkin--8 percent    Chernomyrdin--7.8 percent    Shakhray--6.5 percent    B. Fedorov--6.3 percent    Abalkin--5.3 percent    Ryzhkov--5.3 percent    Borovoy--3.5 percent    Shatalin--3.5 percent</p>

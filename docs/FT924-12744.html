			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Letter: Challenge to become competitive Sir, Ms Rebecca Breeze (Letter, October 12) is right in saying that by adopting the right attitudes to our current problems we have the power to influence Britain's economic future. The Confederation of British Industry believes a strong UK manufacturing industry of adequate size is the only solution to the wealth generation, investment and employment needed to give us a sustainable standard of living. Manufacturers recognise that with a more competitive value for sterling they now have an opportunity to sell more products both at home and overseas. British consumers will buy British goods when these are clearly shown to be superior in price, design, performance, delivery, and after-sales service. Those who buy foreign goods presumably think the British goods are not competitive. Therein lies the challenge. That challenge is already being addressed by the CBI's national manufacturing council, set up at the beginning of this year with representatives of 50 leading British firms, to explore how the standards of average UK firms can be brought up to those of the very best. The council will be producing its recommendations in a report to be published at the CBI's national conference on November 8. It will set out what needs to be done to ensure that we invent, design, make and sell more products that are better than, or at least as good as, those of our best overseas competitors. Increasing globalisation of business means that to be fully competitive we must achieve world class standards. That requires a partnership - not just between manufacturers, financiers and government, but involving everyone in the UK if we are to achieve true success.

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Business seen to dominate Tecs THE employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) have become more dominated by private-sector chief executives than the government originally envisaged, according to one of the first detailed analyses of their membership. The Apex Trust says three quarters of Tec board members have been drawn from the private sector. The government said at least two thirds of Tec boards should be drawn from the private sector. The trust, which runs training schemes for ex-offenders, said yesterday that Department of Employment figures for 79 of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales showed that 722 of the 945 board members were from the private sector. Only 210 members (22.2 per cent) were from the public sector and from unions while 13 members (1.4 per cent) came from the voluntary sector. The figures do not include the chairmen of Tec boards or their chief executives. There has been controversy among unions about their low representation on Tec boards. The Scottish Trades Union Congress last month voted to consider boycotting their Scottish equivalents if union representation did not rise. The Department of Employment said it believed that 675 of the 1,006 board members, including chairmen, from the first 74 Tecs were from the private sector. But Apex Trust said it had examined the background of each Tec member. Although there was some discontent among unions about participation in Tecs when they were set up, the TUC has encouraged unions to participate. The TUC said it wanted Tecs to be reformed to represent their local areas more accurately. It said that if employer representation had increased beyond the original proportion, it would be a matter for concern. Mr Bill Mather, chairman of the Apex Trust, said the low representation of voluntary- sector bodies was very disturbing.</p>

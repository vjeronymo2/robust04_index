Six Members of Ukrainian Air Force Military Council Have Come  Out Against the President's Edict"]    [Text] Kiev -- Something unprecedented has occurred in the  Ukrainian Army. President Leonid Kravchuk issued an edict  appointing Lieutenant General Volodymyr Antonets commander of  the Air Force. As soon as this became known, all six members of  the Air Force Military Council (with the exception, naturally,  of Antonets himself) signed the Military Council's decision on  their collective resignation.    What, then, is the essence of the generals' "conspiracy"? In  the past, at the instigation of former Ukrainian Defense  Minister Konstantin Morozov, Gen. Antonets was appointed by the  president as commander of the Air Defense Troops, whose creation  by means of merging Air Defense and the Air Force he himself had  initiated. This led not only to the formation of a new staff  structure with 250 generals and colonels but also to... the  further breakdown of the Air Defense and the Air Force.    This was precisely why Leonid Kravchuk was forced to repeal  his edict creating the Air Defense Troops. Antonets became  commander of the Air Force.    But why are the generals categorically opposed to Volodymyr  Antonets? There are several reasons. One of them is that it  was with the support of Antonets that a right-wing organization,  which is essentially a political party -- the Ukrainian Officers  Union -- was active in the Air Force. With his assistance  members of the UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense]  organization wounded in Georgia were treated in military  hospitals. Generals V. Vasilyev and G. Kolodiy, who fought in  Afghanistan and have rich experience in troop control, have  declared their reluctance, so the newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI  writes, to serve under the command of someone who does not have  the necessary knowledge to lead the Air Force and whose main  character trait is arrogance.</p>

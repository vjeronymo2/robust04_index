			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Flexibility broadens appeal of customised options deals WITH London and New York stock markets scoring historic highs, big-time money managers are seeking hedges to protect their profits and risk management specialists are finding ready buyers for their customised options strategies. While sophisticated small investors generally use exchange-traded options to protect share value or add to a speculative position, institutions with billions of dollars under management turn to the over-the-counter market, where deep-pocketed private dealers write them customised options. Exchange-traded options typically lock a user into fixed terms and strike prices and lack the flexibility required by institutions. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, in a bid to capture some of Wall Street's private business, launched its own version of customised options six months ago. The CBOE's 'Flex Options', as they are called, allow institutions to buy or sell options on the benchmark Standard and Poor's 100 and 500 indices with four different customised features. This month, the CBOE added the Russell Index, a basket of 2,000 small-capitalisation US stocks, to its Flex options product line. Flex users can select their own strike prices, pick expiration dates up to five years into the future, and choose their preferred method of settlement and the style of options exercise. The exercise choices are American style, where the option can be exercised anytime before expiration, and European style, where the option can be exercised only on the last business day of the contract. Much bigger than the CBOE's standard index options, Flex options contracts have a minimum face value of Dollars 10m. Since the CBOE listed Flex options on February 26 there have been 168,477 trades for a notional face value of Dollars 7.5bn. The exchange products are far from eclipsing the estimated Dollars 50bn in customised equity options traded over the counter each year. How-ever, Flex options use is expected to grow as customers learn more about the product. 'Flex offers customised structuring of exposures. There is a great need for this by smaller- and medium-sized money managers,' says Mr Jack Hanson, partner in Clifton Group, the Minneapolis-based investment management company. While the Flex options do not offer the compete freedom of over-the-counter contracts, they are suitable for many 'plain vanilla' options hedges used by institutions. And, unlike their private counterparts, their pricing is public and easily accessible. Also, for corporations concerned about credit quality, the CBOE's new products are backed by the exchange's top-rated options clearing house. 'We're trying to complement the over-the-counter market,' said Mr David Hall, CBOE vice-president for international marketing. 'There are still a lot of exotic options that we can't accommodate at the exchange.' The Flex concept has proved so successful that the exchange plans to give it an international dimension. 'Our next phase is to list some foreign indices, including Flex options on a US-dollar-denominated FT-SE 100 index,' said Mr Hall. The exchange holds rights to trade dollar-settled versions of FT-SE instruments, and trades standard options on the FT-SE index now. In another bid for international business, the exchange will soon add another customised aspect to the product: users will be able to choose the currency in which they would like their options settled. The CBOE's bid for international customers could be pre-empted by copy-cat products at European exchanges. Officials at Liffe, London's futures and options exchange, say they are seriously considering listing sterling-settled flexible options on the FT-SE 100 index. CBOE officials say they have also received queries about the product from Matif, France's futures exchange, as well as from the Tokyo stock exchange. The CBOE's domestic rival, the American Stock Exchange in New York, plans to roll out its own customised index options product later this year.</p>

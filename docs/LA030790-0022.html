			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WHOLE GENERATION IS BEING LOST;  </P> <P> CRIME: DO WE REALLY WANT TO LOCK UP AND MAKE CRIMINALS OUT OF HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEIR DRUG OF CHOICE IS NOT OURS?  </P> <P> Seated in the rear of a Superior Court room in downtown Los Angeles, Derrick  Beckwith's mother eyes me suspiciously, another white man asking questions that  can only bring more problems to a son already waist-deep into trouble with the  law. But Derrick, 25, dark-skinned, Jheri-curled and modestly dressed for his  court appearance, nervously agrees to talk with me anyway.  </P> <P> In between whispered snatches of conversation, we watch the steady stream of  mostly black young men being brought in for their three-to-five minutes of  fast-food justice. Each wears a blue or orange L.A. County Jail jump suit,  handcuffs and an expression of studied cool, the only vestige of dignity that  can be mustered in a situation where one doesn't make the slightest move  without the direction of a keeper.  </P> <P> Derrick, however, isn't feeling cool, facing, as he is, five years for a parole  violation. "They trying to say," he tells me, "that I was a witness to someone  selling drugs. But I don't know nothing about it, but they're charging me with  a violation 'cause I was around the guy." And what, I ask, was he on parole  for? "Drugs, man. Possession and sale. That's all it's ever been. Period."  That, of course, is his story.  </P> <P> The cop's story is that Beckwith was a lookout on a $20 sale of a rock of  cocaine to an undercover officer. The girl who led the officer to the dealer  and the dealer also have been arrested. Three people are thus facing felony  charges over the sale of one $20 rock. Later in the day Beckwith will cop a  plea and be sentenced to three years in state prison. There he'll join about  90,000 other inmates, up from the 25,000 incarcerated in California prisons in  1980. About one-third of those are black males.  </P> <P> I'd gone to court to try to understand those and several other startling  statistics I'd read just days before: One in four black men in their 20s in the  United States is currently either in prison, in jail, on probation or on  parole. One in four. And that number, as Alvin Poussaint, the black Harvard  psychologist had pointed out to me earlier, is even worse than it sounds. When  you exclude the vast portion of the black middle class who are in college or  the Army, says Poussaint, what you're really talking about is 50% of the young  black male inner-city underclass.  </P> <P> Some of those arrests, of course, were for serious crimes like murder,  manslaughter, rape and assault. Some were for violence among youth such as  gang-banging; others were for drunk driving, a crime now vigorously enforced,  and some were for robbery and theft. (The latter are crimes that young black  males, about 30% of whom come from families living below the poverty line and  30% to 40% of whom are unemployed, commit in vastly disproportionate numbers.  Blacks comprise about 12% of the population.)  </P> <P> But it is small-time drug crimes like Beckwith's that are increasingly  responsible for the huge numbers of young black men that are now overwhelming  the criminal justice system in California and nationwide.  </P> <P> Out of 26 cases on Judge J.D. Smith's calendar on this day, for example, 19 are  for what public defender Forrest Latiner calls "chicken drug cases" -- that is,  the sale or possession of drugs, or the "testing dirty" for drugs once on  probation or parole. "Our President," he tells me disgustedly, "would be very  excited over these cases." Latiner puts the percentage of cases he defends in  this category at between 50% and 70%. "It's frightening," says Judge Smith, a  former LAPD motorcycle cop, "to think we're losing a whole generation. You  don't even feel good when you sentence these guys." In 1983, according to  Smith, the Central Division of L.A. Superior Court handled about 5,000 cases.  In 1989 they processed about 17,000, an increase in large measure because of  the get-tough priorities of our war on drugs.  </P> <P> "We're on an incarceration binge," says Joan Petersilia, the director of the  RAND Corp. criminal justice program. "We're putting more people in prison, but  because of overcrowding, they're doing less time. That includes violent  offenders too." And when they get out, she adds, they are ex-cons, with all the  problems to themselves and society that that entails. "We're making this  tremendous effort, but for what?" she asks. "Robbery, rape, aggravated assaults  are all up and more dangerous in California, and we've tripled the prison  population."  </P> <P> There are, of course, no easy answers, but at the very least we should ask  ourselves a few hard questions. Do we really want to continue to lock up and  make criminals out of hundreds of thousands of young people because their drug  of choice is not ours? When will we as a society stop thinking in the same way  as Sal's bigoted son in "Do the Right Thing," who sees Eddie Murphy and Bill  Cosby as heroes and the black underclass as subhumans? And lastly, how can we  get George Bush to realize that coming to Los Angeles specifically to dedicate  yet another new prison on the day before Derrick Beckwith is sentenced might  not be the best way to symbolize a kinder, gentler America?  </P></p>

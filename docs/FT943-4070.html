			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Art market Art may not be a perfect indicator of where the world economy is heading, but it is better than many. When people believe they have more disposable income, they spend it on inconsequentials, such as antique toys and pretty pictures. The art market is experiencing a recovery of sorts, but, as in the broader economy, confidence remains fragile. Although Christies' auction sales were up 19 per cent year on year during the first six months, they were marginally down on the previous half year. Consumer confidence had been hit by the collapse in the bond market, accounting for disappointing sales of Impressionist and modern painting during May and June. While Asprey complains that heads of state are spending less, Japanese corporate buyers and Australian entrepreneurs also remain absent from the art market. North American buyers have given few signs of purchasing works as hedges against inflation. As an indicator of global shifts in wealth, the art market is an even better guide. Buyers are increasingly from the rapidly expanding far eastern economies. The Asian region now accounts for 10 per cent of Christies' auction sales. Although such buyers are purchasing local works - Christies' sales of oriental works were up 25 per cent - they are also picking up easy-on-the-eye Impressionist pictures. Whether they can drive prices to the absurd levels of 1990 is highly unlikely.</p>

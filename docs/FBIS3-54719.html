It is probably on the basis of  this memo that the president said recently that Rukh simply does  not exist in Ukraine as a mass public political movement. We  turned to Vyachslav Chornovil, a deputy of the Ukrainian Supreme  Soviet, for an explanation.    [Chornovil] This document, which classifies parties  according to one principle -- their loyalty to the president --  said: Rukh's potential is not above zero, except for some of  the republic's western oblasts. The president was given false  information. Our party is the largest democratic organization  in Ukraine: We have 51,000 members and 2 million supporters,  plus another 50,000 from "Memorial," the Ukrainian Students  Union, and other associated organizations. The number of our  supporters is steadily growing. We should give the powers that  be their due, however: They help Rukh increase its influence in  people's minds. The republic ranks second in the inflationary  race of sorts. Yugoslavia is first, but there is war there. As  for us, we may go to a situation that was characteristic of the  Weimar Republic: They sat down for lunch at a restaurant at one  price, but had to pay at another.    [Romm] Do you see the woes of independent Ukraine as  ineluctable?    [Chornovil] No, but only under a different leadership. Our  state was proclaimed independent by a communist majority in  parliament, which feared retaliation for its support for the  State of Emergency Committee. At present that same party  nomenklatura is still in power. It adopted our slogans about  statehood, although it did not want any statehood. It talks  about democracy, although it had put us in jail for those same  words. It keeps discussing reform, although it does not pursue  it.    [Romm] Monetary reform is also a possibility. They say that  the grivna will be introduced next January.    [Chornovil] I have also heard these rumors. God forbid that  they should actually introduce it. The grivna with zeros  deleted will be able to hold out for some time, to show some  stability to the voters before the elections. Then it will  slide downward, like the karbovanets. The grivna should not be  introduced before carrying out broad privatization, selling  land, and doing many other things that will back up the money.  We could leave inflation behind in a couple of months, reverse  the slump in production within 12 to 18 months, and reach more  or less decent living standards in 5 to 10 years. Rukh has a  clear-cut program to that effect.    [Romm] Ukrainian Supreme Council Deputy Larisa Skorik, your  former associate in Rukh, said to the parliament that Rukh lives  on money from "Gurvits, a Jew."    [Chornovil] I know Eduard Gurvits, chairman of Odessa's  Zhovtnevyy district soviet, from the latest presidential  elections. He campaigned for me. But he has not given us a  single kopeck either then or now. At the same time,  entrepreneurs in various cities give us their backing in the  hope of seeing actual reform. At our latest congress, an  organization called Economic Rukh was born.    [Romm] How do you assess Rukh's chances in the March  elections for the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet?    [Chornovil] They are not great on account of the current  election law. If the law were similar to the Russian one, Rukh,  as the most significant party, could have won up to 30 percent  of seats.    [Romm] The Russian law cleared the path for Zhirinovskiy,  though.    [Chornovil] Ukraine does not have its own Zhirinovskiy,  although his embryos have emerged in the Ukrainian National  Assembly. It is well known that Ukrainian National Self-Defense  (UNSD) fighters fought in the Dniester Region and Georgia. It  is mostly unexceptional persons who will become Ukraine's  parliamentarians. The law allows workers collectives to  nominate candidates. State ownership accounts for 95 percent of  the total in Ukraine. This means that it is directors who will  win deputy seats.    [Romm] But Leonid Kravchuk is not sitting on his hands  either, is he?    [Chornovil] I know that he is hand-picking his own  candidates in 200 electoral districts through his  administration. The president needs them so that they will vote  for canceling early presidential elections. The Central  Electoral Commission is acting according to calls from  Bankovskaya Street, where the president has his residence.  Hence its decisions.</p>

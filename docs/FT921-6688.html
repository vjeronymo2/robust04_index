			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Italian move for Bank of Scotland BANK OF Scotland is investing Pounds 6m in a 45 per cent stake in Finanziaria Italiana Mutui, which operates in the Italian residential mortgage market, writes James Buxton. The move represents the Edinburgh-based bank's first move into mortgage lending in continental Europe. FIM is an arm of Sopaf, the Milan-based investment holding company run by Mr Jody Vender. Sopaf intends to sell a further 10 per cent of FIM to a large Italian insurance company, believed to be SAI, a company controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Italian entrepreneur. Bank of Scotland sees the move as part of its policy of finding joint ventures in Europe where it can add its technological and mangement skills to local knowledge. Two Bank of Scotland staff will join FIM and the bank will have three boardroom seats.</p>

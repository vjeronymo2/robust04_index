			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pressure grows over NY Daily News future THE future of the New York Daily News, the cash-strapped tabloid newspaper, could become clearer this week as the intricate negotiations over its future ownership come to a head. Last week, the judge overseeing the paper's bankruptcy proceedings, set a deadline of August 17 as the time by which the paper must submit a reorganisation plan. In reality, however, this means there is intense pressure on management and unions to select one of three suitors in the next few days and move to close a deal next week. Over the weekend, there were unconfirmed reports that the bidders were asked to have final offers on the table by this afternoon, an extension from Saturday night. The bidders include Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of US News and World Report magazine, Mr Conrad Black, publisher of the Daily Telegraph in London, and a so-called 'stand-alone' plan under which Silver Screen, a group of film financiers would join forces with the management. The Daily News filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in November, following the sudden death of Mr Robert Maxwell, the British publisher and its owner.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank tumbles A roller coaster ride in Rank Organisation saw the shares move through a 45-point spread, ending the day 20 lower at 747p. Turnover was a hefty 5.1m. The stock had opened with a healthy 20p advance as investors seemed to welcome the leisure group's plans to bring the final dividend payment forward to the half-year stage and to make an enhanced scrip issue. However, a dull analysts' meeting with the group's management set the tone for a steep slide in the shares. Disappointment that trading was showing few signs of improvement was allied with a lack of news on Rank's disposal programme. Analysts returned to largely downgrade the group, moving from the Pounds 270m to Pounds 280m range to Pounds 255m to Pounds 265m. The negative market tone was fuelled by the feeling of some large shareholders - in particular income funds - that the new dividend arrangements would mean a gap in payment of 12 months.</p>

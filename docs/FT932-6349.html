			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks increase loan provisions by 70% LEADING Japanese banks yesterday increased their provisions for bad loans by an average 70 per cent for the year ended March, but made it clear that it will take them several years to clear away the financial debris from the lending excesses of the late 1980s. For the first time, the 11 leading commercial banks, known as city banks in Japan, announced non-performing loan estimates, ranging from 1.58 per cent of outstanding loans at Mitsubishi Bank to 4.8 per cent at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, and that they have a collective Y8,435.1bn (Dollars 77.67bn) in problem loans. However, the amounts do not reflect all the damage done by the domestic property market collapse, while a 478 per cent year-on-year increase in write-offs indicates more the low level of previous write-offs than a push to fully account for problem lending. Pre-tax profits fell by an average 32.4 per cent, the fourth year of decline, although a fall in interest rates, a widening of lending spreads, and a revived bond market enabled the 11 banks to record an average 30.9 per cent increase in business profits. The banks' reluctance to write off their bad debts is likely to be matched by a hesitance to lend in the next few years, meaning that international companies will face more difficulty in securing Japanese funds and that the recovery of the domestic economy could be hindered. Sumitomo Bank, entangled in the collapse of the trading house Itoman, was the most aggressive in providing for non-performing loans, writing off Y104.3bn and providing Y97.8bn in fresh reserves, behind an 87.2 per cent plunge in net profit. Sumitomo, usually the most profitable Japanese institution, fell to tenth on the net earnings ladder. But all 11 were able to celebrate capital adequacy ratios comfortably above the 8 per cent threshold as defined by the Bank for International Settlements. The ratios of capital to assets ranged from 8.96 per cent at Sakura Bank to 9.61 per cent at the Bank of Tokyo, after most institutions took on subordinated debt and trim-med assets to bolster ratios. Apart from increasing their provisions, bank profits were hit by appraisal losses on securities holdings, which would have been greater but for a surge in stock prices in the final weeks of the year. The banks admit that the favourable conditions from falling interest rates are passing, and with non-performing loans likely to rise, they will have difficulty in making provisions without pushing net profits to embarrassingly low levels.

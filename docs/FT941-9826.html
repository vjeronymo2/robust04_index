			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Shoot-out in the DC corral US president Bill Clinton believes that Japan is the bad guy of world trade. It must change its ways, or else. Asked about the possibility of US trade retaliation against Japan, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers announced that US trade representative Mickey Kantor 'is not ruling anything out. We want a good agreement or no agreement. We won't settle for anything less.' The pity is that the agreement the Americans want is such a bad one. True, US pressure has often been helpful to Japanese reformers. But the quantitative indicators of market opening sought by the US are another matter. They will be helpful to the Japanese only to the extent that refusal to accede should increase Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's prestige back home. But the price of this fight will be a high one. The Japanese prime minister must choose between being shot by Mr Clinton in the front or, should he accept US demands, by his compatriots in the back. Either way, he would lose. So, more significantly, would the relationship. What makes these conflicts over the Japanese external surpluses surprising is that they have proved so enduring. In the second half of the 1980s, when the political force of complaints about Japan started building to a crescendo, the US economy, albeit growing steadily, was burdened by the alleged calamity of its twin fiscal and current account deficits. Meanwhile, Japanese gross domestic product grew by more than 4 per cent every year between 1984 and 1991, except one. How very different the 1990s have been. The Japanese economy has stagnated since the last quarter of 1991, with little prospect of a strong recovery this year, notwithstanding announcement of the fourth in a series of emergency fiscal packages. Meanwhile, the US economy, after a shallow recession in 1990 and 1991, has outperformed Japan in 1992 and 1993. It is confidently expected to do the same again in 1994. Melted away Those twin US deficits have also melted away, partly because of the successful efforts of the Clinton administration. In last December's Economic Outlook, the OECD Secretariat estimated that the overall US structural fiscal deficit peaked in 1992 at 4 per cent of GDP, but should fall to only 2.7 per cent this year. How happy Mr Kenneth Clarke would be to have such a prospect. Meanwhile, the federal deficit was forecast in Mr Clinton's budget proposals this week, if on somewhat optimistic assumptions about future spending, to fall further, from Dollars 234.5bn (3.5 per cent of GDP) in fiscal 1994 to a trough of 2.3 per cent of GDP in fiscal 1996. As a percentage of GDP the US current account deficit peaked at 3.7 per cent in 1987. It disappeared in the early 1990s, but is still expected to be only about 2 per cent this year, despite the recovery. Given that recovery and given also the low overall US savings rate, this inflow of capital should be welcomed as a benign boost to a confident US economy. Why then are complaints about Japan so persistent? The short answer must be sheer obstinacy. The long answer is that the overall Japanese current account surplus, after falling from a peak of 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1986 to a trough of 1.2 per cent in 1990, is once more over 3 per cent. More politically significant perhaps is the fact that Japan's bilateral surplus with the US, at close to Dollars 60bn in 1993, is at nominal levels last seen in 1986 and 1987. But this is misleading. As a share of gross domestic product, the Japanese bilateral surplus was 1.4 per cent of US GDP in 1986, but only 0.9 per cent of GDP last year. Home truths Instead of pandering to domestic pressure, Mr Clinton should be telling his compatriots some home truths: that the US economy is performing well and the Japanese economy badly; that the US external position has improved; that the bilateral deficit with Japan has shrunk as a share of US GDP, even though US demand has been growing, while Japanese demand has not; and, last but not least, he could ask why any sensible person should care about a bilateral balance. The president should also be telling the Japanese what they need to hear: that recalcitrance over radical deregulation is damaging to themselves and intolerable for everyone else; and that the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan are making a mess of fiscal and monetary policies. The Japanese finance ministry has already asked the government to follow the record Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn) pump-priming package announced this week with an austere budget for the coming year. The question Mr Clinton must ask is why. Japan has by far the strongest fiscal position of any major OECD country. It makes no sense to deflate its still stagnant economy. What with the US focusing on an unimportant bilateral trade deficit and the Japanese determined to stick to outmoded regulations and inappropriate fiscal and monetary stringency, these two giants deserve each other. But the world deserves neither bit of folly. It would be better for everyone if commonsense were to break out, on both sides.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia sees pots of profit in coca cuppa - Christopher Philipsborn on hopes for a legal export trade in the notorious leaf BOLIVIA HAS begun an international campaign to legalise coca leaf exports in the form of herbal tea, in a bid to replace the leaf's better known derivative - cocaine. The government believes coca leaf exports could become more profitable than cocaine. The leaf has traditionally been chewed to ward off hunger and discomfort. But is also makes a pleasant tea-like infusion called 'mate de coca' which is distributed mainly in tea-bag form throughout Bolivia and much of Peru. Coca leaf is also used in a number of herbal remedies. Mr Jaime Paz Zamora, the Bolivian president said recently: 'I am convinced that the coca leaf has a legal use, and should not be under 'house arrest' by being restricted to Bolivia'. Mr Ronald MacLean, the foreign minister, made a formal statement at the 22nd assembly of the Organisation of American States in Nassau calling for 'the legitimate industrialisation and commercialisation of the sub-products derived from the innocent coca leaf and its protein-rich and medicinal qualities'. Coca and its derivatives are classified as intoxicants by the Vienna Convention as it takes only a relatively simple chemical process to turn the leaf into the highly profitable drug cocaine hydrochloride. Mate de coca, however, is a harmless and widely drunk herbal tea in the Andean countries. Indeed the Bolivian government believes that exports of coca tea-bags, would bring in substantial export revenues. President Paz claims exports of tea to 5 per cent of the world market would generate greater revenue than the country's gas exports to Argentina, last year worth Dollars 215m. The potential price for legally processed coca is estimated at Dollars 100 a kg. While the government is sincere in its aim to legalise certain coca exports, the issue is partly political. Bolivia sent substantial quantities of coca leaf to Spain last month with the intention of demonstrating its tea-making and other properties to visitors to the Bolivian stand at Expo 92 in Seville. But Spanish customs caused a storm in a tea-cup by impounding the entire shipment. The action caused outrage in Bolivia and prompted a hurried visit by Queen Sophia of Spain, who valiantly drank gallons of coca tea at every available opportunity in an effort to patch up relations. Nevertheless, the issue remains a serious one. While Bolivia is being pushed by the US to reduce the amount of coca it cultivates, the country has no obvious alternative cash crops or other exports to take its place at present. Bolivia is South America's poorest country, with little effective infrastructure. Coca is easy to transport and continues to fetch better prices than any other potential substitute. Legalising the exportation of the harmless tea it produces would be a small but significant step towards weaning the country away from economic dependence on cocaine.</p>

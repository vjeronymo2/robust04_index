			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Letter: Cadbury should concentrate on working capital not profit Sir, I was disappointed, but not entirely surprised, to read that implementation of the 'going concern' requirement of the Cadbury Code is to be deferred ('Cadbury guidelines face delay', July 5). Perhaps the reason may be seen in the approach of the working party which produced the draft guidelines. In a worthy endeavour to make them comprehensive, it has fallen into the trap of making them over-prescriptive, introducing a number of factors which are either obvious or irrelevant. The result is a suggested procedure which is far more complicated than, in the majority of cases, it need be. The working party rejected the normal approach to profit forecasts, on the grounds that the work involved was excessive and it was not part of the reporting accountant's brief to comment on the assumptions. Both objections could be surmounted if it could be agreed that the objective is for the directors to be able to say, and the auditors to confirm, that 'the company has adequate working capital for its needs, and the accounts have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis'. Such a statement could be incorporated in the statement of directors' responsibilities. The advantage of a working capital statement is that the procedures are well understood by most boards and practitioners, and are less onerous than those relating to a profit forecast. It should normally be possible to obtain from bankers a statement to the effect that they see no reason why the company's committed facilities should not be extended beyond the review date, thus allowing the board to look to a date 18 months beyond the balance sheet date. It is then a matter of judgment whether the requirement can be satisfied by a relatively simple desk job, or whether a more rigorous 'bottom-up' exercise is needed. Such a task, which my company has carried out in recent years, to the satisfaction of the board and the auditors, has not proved unduly onerous or expensive. Of course, where the exercise shows a company is operating near the margin, it will need to be followed up by a more rigorous examination. However, the majority of companies do not operate close to the margin and, given a proper exercise of judgment by the auditors, attention could be concentrated on the smaller percentage of companies which have given rise to the concerns addressed by the Cadbury report.

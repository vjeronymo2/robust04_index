			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / General Motors' output up 23.1% GENERAL Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, increased output in the UK by 23.1 per cent last year to 350,914 from 285,129 in 1991. Ford of the US remained the leading producer despite a 2.2 per cent fall to 474,123 from 484,639 in 1991 (including commercial vehicles, Jaguar and Aston Martin), according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Ford's UK car output (excluding Jaguar) fell 10.9 per cent to 302,416 under the impact of extensive short-time working in the second half of last year. But overall production was boosted by a 24 per cent jump in commercial vehicle output, helped by the first full year of production of the Fiesta Courier van at its plant at Dagenham, east London. Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, suffered a 4.8 per cent fall in output to 399,661 from 419,907 a year earlier, although it was narrowly the leading carmaker in the UK ahead of the Ford group. GM's UK vehicle output was boosted by the first full year of production of the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera, a four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicle made by IBC Vehicles, its 60/40 joint venture with Isuzu, the US group's Japanese affiliate. Total UK car output rose by 4.4 per cent last year to 1,219,880. Lower production by Rover, Ford and Peugeot was offset by the rapid build-up of production by Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, which raised output at its Sunderland plant by 44 per cent to 179,009. The presence of Japanese carmakers was marked by the first UK output from Honda's plant near Swindon.

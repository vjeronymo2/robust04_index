			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (8): Performance slumps - Financial Services THE financial services sector was unable to sustain its reliable performance of the previous years. Its growth in 1991 slumped to 2.9 per cent against 19 per cent in 1990. The worldwide consolidation in international banking activities and financial risk management business had affected Singapore-based foreign institutions' offshore lending activities and foreign exchange business. There were mixed signals about business expectations for the second and third quarters, with commercial banks and finance companies pessimistic while stock and bond brokers were more optimistic. A recovery and rise of the financial futures market has been the silver lining. Despite their gloom, the so-called Big Four local banks are meeting and beating analysts' forecasts of record profits for 1991 despite slower loan growth and interbank rates dipping below fixed deposit rates. So far, state-linked DBS Bank's earnings have leapt 19.4 per cent to SDollars 278.4m in 1991, Overseas Union Bank's net after-tax profits expanded 14.3 per cent to SDollars 70.7m, while OCBC Bank forged 20.2 per cent to SDollars 168.3m. OUB attributed its results to better interest margins while DBS Bank disclosed net interest earnings at a record SDollars 264m in the second half-year. Interest spreads have widened since January to 2.75 points, say analysts. Brokers Hoare Govette note that the contraction of Asian Currency Unit assets, a big factor in the slowdown, had little effect on local banks' profits. It added that if the stock market volume continued to pick up, non-banking services such as securities trading should grow. And, with their capital adequacy ratios exceeding 12 per cent, the banks can enlarge their international lending. Simex, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, had its best start this year with January's all-time high of 965,692 contracts traded vaulting 25.9 per cent above the previous record of 767,143 contracts in March 1989. January's daily average volume of 43,895 contracts was also the highest level since Simex started trading in 1984. The exchange's total volume in 1991 resumed an up trend of 6.1m contracts after faltering in 1990 to 5.7m, due to lower price volatility in the first half. The daily average also moved up from 22,791 contracts in 1990 to 24,175. Interest rate volatility and increasing international participation accounted for the massive leap in volume. Recognising the increased interest, especially from its European customers, the exchange extended trading hours for interest rate and energy contracts from February. Interest rate contracts were again the mainstays with 82.6 per cent of the total volume, ahead of the Nikkei 225 Stock Average with 11.9 per cent. To diversify, Simex has launched an options contract based on the Nikkei 225, which was the first contract written on the Japanese stock index. As Mr Pierre Essig, chief executive officer of Fimat Futures Asia saw it: 'There should be a strong demand for the new contract. The sheer size of the underlying Nikkei futures clearly suggests the market has a good appetite for an options contract written on the futures. Furthermore, the American-styled options, coupled with extended back months, are added attractions. Simex offers 15 contracts and the most active Eurodollar futures outside of Chicago. It was another story on the Stock Exchange of Singapore, where turnover fell to SDollars 30.5bn in 1991 from SDollars 36.8bn in 1990. The pick-up in activity after the Gulf war was not sustainable as other external factors in the US, European and Japanese economies had a dampening effect. Against the SDollars 3.5bn raised through the market in 1990, last year saw only SDollars 1.3bn raised, with SDollars 279m from the flotation of 10 new companies, many of them government-linked. Two more serious cases of multiple share applications are being taken to court. The SES has worked towards raising the standard of accountability and disclosure to shareholders by directors. For example, companies' equity-raising exercises must fully disclose their intended use. Such ever-tightening controls may provide comfort to investors, say industry members, but it also scares business elsewhere, such as Hong Kong. The tightening-up measures are not unlike those taken in the banking and insurance industries. The authorities do not apologise for their prudential supervision or make secret their preference for supervising a smaller number of strong institutions rather than a larger number of weaker firms. A large number of foreign institutions have been granted international membership. For a comparatively pricey SDollars 30m in view of the current low trading volume, Credit Lyonnais, Baring Securities, Smith New Court, Daiwa, Nikko, Nomura, and Yamaichi Securities can deal for non-resident clients but are restricted to trades above SDollars 5m for Singapore residents. In line with its more liberal approach to opening up the market to foreign brokers, the invitation to banks and foreign brokerages to apply for seats could spell mergers and acquisitions of the smaller-capitalised local firms unwilling or unable to raise their share capital to a possible adjusted net capital target of SDollars 20m There has been disappointment that the listing of Singapore Telecom, with a potential market capitalisation of SDollars 10bn, has been put off till next year. However, the success of a steady stream of initial public offerings to date will maintain interest in listing candidates such as garment manufacturer Heshe Holdings and Keppel Corporation subsidiaries Keppel Integrated Engineering and Keppel Bank.</p>

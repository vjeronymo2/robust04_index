			<p>BFN     [Text] The news that has leaked from the self-proclaimed  Yugoslavia has caused enormous dissatisfaction and protests  among Velika Kladusa residents. Fikret Abdic has gone so far  with his collaboration with Serbia and Milosevic that he has  reached -- course, well away from the eyes of the people of the  Cazin Krajina -- agreement on the training of Kladusa young men  in the famous barracks of the army of the so-called Yugoslavia  in Nis, where the special units of the Serbian aggressor army  are trained. This was stated by the Information Service of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Instead of being in the units of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the young men from Velika Kladusa are  learning together with Perisic's and Mladic's special units all  the techniques of killing the Bosniaks. This has caused disgust  and open disagreements of ordinary people in Velika Kladusa with  Babo [Fikret Abdic].    According to initial reports, Abdic has sent a group of  policemen of the self-proclaimed Autonomous Province of Western  Bosnia for training in Nis. Some men refused to go to Nis. The  most disobedient were liquidated. Their murder was concealed  with claims that they were killed in clashes with the 5th Army  Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The agreement on training is only part of a much wider  agreement between Fikret Abdic and the chetniks. They agreed  that Abdic's paramilitary should attack the left and the  chetniks, via Grabez, the right bank of the Una River. This was  stated by the Information Service of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

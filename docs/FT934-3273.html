			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Countryside bounces back into the black Countryside Properties, one of south-east England's biggest housebuilders, bounced back into the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.74m for the 12 months to September 30. During the previous year the group incurred an Pounds 11.7m pre-tax loss, after making exceptional provisions of Pounds 14.8m to compensate for falling property values. Mr Alan Cherry, chairman, said the improvement in house buyers' confidence had been sustained following the Pounds 16.8m rights issue in May. The profits increase, however, was lower than analysts had expected and the shares slipped by 8p yesterday to 141p. This compared with the rights issue price of 106p. As expected the final dividend is maintained at 2.7p, making an unchanged total of 4.11p, covered by earnings per share of 5.9p (losses of 16.6p). The number of homes built by Countryside in the period jumped from 751 to 1,295. Almost 70 per cent of production was sold to housing associations or similar social housing organisations. Government finance for grants to housing associations is to be reduced in 1994-95. Associations would seek to maintain building programmes by pursuing better value for money from experienced builders, Mr Cherry said. Housing had made a Pounds 6m profit, compared with a Pounds 4.7m loss. The number of private sector sales had risen from 282 to 393. Sales by value had risen by 49 per cent. Lower interest rates had made the initial cost of buying a home the cheapest 'for almost 20 years.' The decision to phase out mortgage tax relief, also announced in the budget, had been anticipated and was unlikely to have an adverse effect on the gradual recovery in the housing market, said Mr Cherry. The company was launching a range of low-cost houses to meet growing demand from first time buyers. The commercial property division also returned to the black, with profits of Pounds 55,000 (Pounds 861,000 deficit). Property investment reduced its annual loss from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 1.3m. COMMENT Feelings among analysts were very mixed following Countryside's results. Disappointment that profits were not higher was seized on by critics as further confirmation that the company never quite delivers all that it promises. There was also concern at the extent of Countryside's housing association sales in an increasingly competitive market. On the other hand the group's large landbank will stand it in good stead as the private housing market recovers. Profits from private house sales could easily double this year. The sale of the group's property investment portfolio would also dramatically improve the balance sheet, where gearing is currently 100 per cent. Profits of Pounds 9.5m would put the group on a prospective p/e of 13, which still looks cheap given the quality of the landbank; but there are doubters.</p>

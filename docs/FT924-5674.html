			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (5): The shake-out continues - Industrial development DERBYSHIRE'S economy has diversified sharply from its traditional base of coal mining, engineering, quarrying and textiles, but over the past decade there has not been such marked growth in the service industries as elsewhere in the UK. Despite the large tracts of rural land, the local economy remains firmly embedded in manufacturing variety. Successive censuses of employment throughout the 1980s showed that the proportion of those employed in the service industries grew from 47 per cent to 55 per cent. At a national level, however, the growth was from 62 per cent to 69 per cent. Although the shifting proportions denote an expansion of the services sector, they also reflect the rationalisation of traditional industries during the 1980s recession. Underlying this shift is a change in the composition of the workforce, as more women move into service industries jobs. The second recession in 10 years has meant that the economy has again moved into a period of flux, the manufacturing future of which is uncertain. Job prospects are increasingly conditioned by higher technological demands as the county's industrial base shifts away from traditional industries with their demand for semi-skilled labour. Over the past decade especially, Derbyshire has expanded into the paper and packaging industries, into general metal manufacture, chemicals, timber and furniture. But it has not been immune from general economic conditions and there are few areas untouched by the ferocity of the recession. The seemingly inexorable rise in unemployment, as companies seek both to strengthen their balance sheets and to raise productivity as a protection of their margins, is a manifestation of this uncertainty. From Rolls-Royce, Brel, the railways equipment manufacturer, and Courtaulds, longstanding mainstays of the Derby economy in the engineering and chemicals sectors, through medium-sized companies from the Chesterfield area such as Robinson, Bryan Donkin and Biwater, respectively in the healthcare and packaging, engineering and water equipment sectors, to small groups going into receivership, the shake-out continues. Size makes no difference. The cumulative effect is to pose a question for which there is yet no answer, either in Derbyshire or any other county with a strong manufacturing base. It is how to secure expansion on a scale which will absorb those thrust onto the labour market. 'It is a job just to tread water,' acknowledged Mr Nick Hodgson, the County Council's deputy director. Arguably, the problem is more severe in the industrial north-east of the county based on Chesterfield than it is in the south, where the Toyota plant can act as a long-term stimulus to growth and where there is the prospect of expansion in the fortunes of groups such as Rolls-Royce once recession has ended. The problems of the south are more related to downturns in orders than to structural change. In the north-east, however, the shadow of closure hangs over the collieries of Bolsover, Markham and Shirebrook. It is true that collieries have have been closing steadily in Derbyshire since the 1950s. Indeed, 50 years ago, the county coal mines employed 60,000. The three collieries whose future is now in question employ less than 3,000. But their closure, apart from the knock-on effects on local suppliers and the withdrawal of funds from local communities, will accelerate the gradual change from an economy based on coal and steel. The difficulty is that, with the wider economy depressed, there is no immediate means to effect that change. By contrast with Derby and the south of the county, in the Chesterfield area, noted Mr Philip Robinson, president of the North Derbyshire Chamber of Commerce, 'The larger proportion of people are employed by large companies - at a higher rate than the national average.' The larger companies have been reducing their numbers significantly, he added, but it is the smaller companies which create the jobs. With sluggishness in the international economy, there is little immediate hope of any large-scale inward investment. 'I don't know where the jobs are going to come from,' said Mr Robinson, observing that the average age of the miners likely to be laid off was 33. For all that, the county economy is not grinding to a halt. Mr Robinson's eponymous company pushed up its 1992 first-half pre-tax profits to Pounds 714,000 from Pounds 495,000 in the 1991 first half. Rolls-Royce is still receiving orders for aero engines. Birch, the Derby construction company, has doubled turnover in the year to last September. LB Plastics continues to invest at its Nether Heage plant. Likewise, despite all the problems of the textile industry, exemplified by the closure of a Tootal mill, Peak Textiles of Ashbourne wanted to extend its plant. Similarly Charnos was expanding its clothing and lingerie operations. In other sectors, Denby Pottery reported plans to increase its workforce. For the medium term, at any rate, the future prosperity of the county looks increasingly tied to light manufacturing, with a services sector dependent on the growth of industry. Independent expansion of the services sector looks unlikely given the proximity of older-established centres such as Birmingham and Nottingham. There has not been a great effort by the county to attract back operations from financial services companies, no attempt to establish an insurance sector like, for example, Bristol.  -------------------------------------------------------------          NORTH DERBYSHIRE COLLIERY MANPOWER 1981-92  ------------------------------------------------------------- Colliery                         1981             1992 Arkwright                         977      closed 1988 Bolsover                         1040              494 Creswell                         1109      closed 1991 Ireland                           780      closed 1986 Markham                          2332             1296 Pleasley                          715      closed 1983 Renishaw Park                     587      closed 1989 Shirebrook                       1902             1005 Westthorpe                        704      closed 1984 Whitwell                          857      closed 1986 High Moor*                        566              187  ------------------------------------------------------------- *Note: High Moor merged with Kiveton Park in December 1989.

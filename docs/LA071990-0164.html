			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SCOTT FINDS OLD STUFF AND BEATS METS, 1-0  </P> <P> Mike Scott, coming off his first 20-victory season, was looking forward to  bigger things in 1990.  </P> <P> But the first half of this season was most forgettable for the Houston  right-hander. There were few good things that happened. He could remember the  game early in June in which he struck out 15 batters, but that was one of the  few pleasant memories.  </P> <P> He was pitching so poorly, with an earned-run average about 5.00, that teams  even stopped complaining that he was doctoring the baseball.  </P> <P> From the time the New York Mets complained after he beat them twice in the 1986  championship series, Scott was frequently checked for illegal substances.  </P> <P> So, when he finally regained the form of a year ago Wednesday night at Houston,  it was satisfying to him that he beat the Mets.  </P> <P> Scott won, 1-0, giving up four hits, striking out four and walking none. The  loss dropped the Mets two games behind Pittsburgh in the NL East.  </P> <P> Scott (7-9) opposed 13-game winner Frank Viola in a scoreless battle through  seven innings, but with former Dodger Alejandro Pena pitching in the eighth,  the Astros pushed across a run.  </P> <P> Scott played a part in the winning rally. After Dave Rohde singled, Scott  walked. An infield hit loaded the bases. After a strikeout, rookie Javier Ortiz  singled in the winning run.  </P> <P> The last hit off Scott may have cost the Mets the game. It was a two-out double  by Todd Hundley in the eighth. Manager Bud Harrelson sent Mackey Sasser to bat  for Viola, who gave up only three hits in seven innings. But Sasser didn't come  through.  </P> <P> "This is the type of game you wish you were back in the American League," Viola  said. "They wouldn't have to make the decision because pitchers don't bat  anyhow. But, what can you do? I'm never going to like being hit for. I guess  it'll always be that way in this league."  </P> <P> Houston Manager Art Howe was glad Harrelson had to make the decision. "We got  the best pitcher on their club out of the game. It was probably a blessing."  </P> <P> Cincinnati 8, Montreal 7 -- Even though the Reds increased their lead over San  Francisco in the West to 8 1/2 games with the victory at Cincinnati, it will  not go down as one of Manager Lou Piniella's better days.  </P> <P> It began with him having to deny that he was involved in gambling or was part  of the reason for Yankee owner George Steinbrenner's problems.  </P> <P> Before the night was done, Piniella was ejected, then sat in the clubhouse  while the Reds' blew a 7-3 lead on a grand slam by Andres Galarraga with two  out in the ninth.  </P> <P> But, in the bottom of the 11th, Barry Larkin tripled and Paul O'Neill singled  him home for the Reds' fourth win in a row.  </P> <P> "It was the cheapest, luckiest hit," O'Neill said. "But I'll take it."  </P> <P> What made blowing the lead so exasperating for Piniella was that Randy Myers,  as effective a relief pitcher as there has been in the league this season,  failed to hold the four-run lead.  </P> <P> Galarraga's slam was his second homer of the game. The first one came with a  man on and put the Expos in front, 3-2, in the sixth.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 11, San Francisco 2 -- Manager Jim Leyland was hoping his top  pitcher, Doug Drabek, could put an end to the Pirates' three-game losing streak  at home. But it was an unexpected bonus when the right-hander helped the  Pirates break out of their hitting slump.  </P> <P> Drabek, a .140 hitter against the rest of the league, thrives on Giant  pitching. He went two for four, scored a run and drove in another. Against the  Giants, he is five for 11, including a home run.  </P> <P> With Jeff King hitting a home run and driving in five runs, it was easy for  Drabek (11-4). He went eight innings, giving up seven hits, and the performance  enabled the Pirates to take a two-game lead over the Mets in the East.  </P> <P> "He's a good pitcher, he has good control and he knows how to pitch," Giant  Manager Roger Craig said.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, San Diego 2 -- Cub Manager Don Zimmer couldn't keep his promise. He  vowed that if Greg Maddux would win a game, he would swim Lake Michigan.  </P> <P> Maddux (5-9), had not won since May 5, losing eight in a row with five no  decisions in 13 previous starts while compiling a 6.15 ERA. The victory was  Maddux's 50th major league win.  </P> <P> In lieu of the big swim, Zimmer showed up at the postgame interview wearing  royal blue sun glasses, a life jacket and had a buoy strapped over his legs.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure I could do it with this stuff on," Zimmer said.  </P> <P> Dennis Rasmussen (7-7), gave up eight hits in six innings, losing his third in  a row and the fifth in his last six starts. He was hurt by third baseman Eddie  Williams' fifth inning throwing error, which allowed two runs to score with two  out and the bases loaded.  </P> <P> The Cubs have won four in a row and the Padres have lost 16 of their last 19.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 4, Atlanta 3 -- Ricky Jordan's two-run double highlighted a  three-run eighth inning at Atlanta to bring the Phillies from behind.  </P> <P> John Smoltz (6-7) had a 3-1 lead and had yielded only four hits before the  Phillies erupted.  </P> <P> There were two out and two on when Smoltz walked Carmelo Martinez and John Kruk  to force in a run. Jordan followed with his two-run double to put the Phillies  in front. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

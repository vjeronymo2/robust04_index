			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: India's Tata Chemicals gains 94% Tata Chemicals, one of India's largest chemicals makers and a member of the Tata industrial group, has reported a 94 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March to Rs2.2bn (Dollars 70.9m), due to higher demand and gains from investments, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. The company made Rs682.6m profit from investments, mainly the sale of a stake in Tata Oil Mills, another Tata group member, which was sold to Hindustan Lever, the Indian affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine. Without the investments gains, pre-tax profits rose 35 per cent to Rs1.5bn on a 31 per cent increase in sales to Rs6.4bn. Net profits rose almost threefold to Rs2.15bn. Tata Chemicals said the results did not yet include contributions from new detergent, cement and fertilisers plants or from a recent expansion of soda ash capacity. These would all start contributing in the current financial year.</p>

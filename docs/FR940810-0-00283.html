			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The enclosure shall be sealed tightly and thoroughly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspected for leaks before work begins on brake and clutch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The enclosure shall be such that the worker can clearly see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operation and shall provide impermeable sleeves through which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the worker can handle the brake and clutch inspection,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disassembly, repair and assembly. The integrity of the sleeves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and ports shall be examined before work begins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A HEPA-filtered vacuum shall be employed to maintain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enclosure under negative pressure throughout the operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compressed-air may be used to remove asbestos fibers or particles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the enclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The HEPA vacuum shall be used first to loosen the asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing residue from the brake and clutch parts and then to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evacuate the loosened asbestos containing material from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enclosure and capture the material in the vacuum filter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The vacuum's filter, when full, shall be first wetted with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fine mist of water, then removed and placed immediately in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impermeable container, labeled according to paragraph (j)(2)(ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section and disposed of according to paragraph (k) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Any spills or releases of asbestos containing waste material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from inside of the enclosure or vacuum hose or vacuum filter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be immediately cleaned up and disposed of according to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (k) of the section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> [B] Low Pressure/Wet Cleaning Method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A catch basin shall be placed under the brake assembly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positioned to avoid splashes and spills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The reservoir shall contain water containing an organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent or wetting agent. The flow of liquid shall be controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such that the brake assembly is gently flooded to prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos-containing brake dust from becoming airborne.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The aqueous solution shall be allowed to flow between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake drum and brake support before the drum is removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) After removing the brake drum, the wheel hub and back of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake assembly shall be thoroughly wetted to suppress dust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The brake support plate, brake shoes and brake components  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to attach the brake shoes shall be thoroughly washed before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing the old shoes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) In systems using filters, the filters, when full, shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first wetted with a fine mist of water, then removed and placed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately in an impermeable container, labeled according to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section and disposed of according to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (k) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Any spills of asbestos-containing aqueous solution or any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos-containing waste material shall be cleaned up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately and disposed of according to paragraph (k) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) The use of dry brushing during low pressure/wet cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> [C] Equivalent Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An equivalent method is one which has sufficient written detail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so that it can be reproduced and has been demonstrated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures resulting from the equivalent method are equal to or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than the exposures which would result from the use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method described in paragraph [A] of this appendix. For purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of making this comparison, the employer shall assume that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures resulting from the use of the method described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph [A] of this appendix shall not exceed 0.004 f/cc, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured by the OSHA reference method and as averaged over at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least 18 personal samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> [D] Wet Method <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A spray bottle, hose nozzle, or other implement capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivering a fine mist of water or amended water or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery system capable of delivering water at low pressure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be used to first thoroughly wet the brake and clutch parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brake and clutch components shall then be wiped clean with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cloth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The cloth shall be placed in an impermeable container,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labelled according to paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then disposed of according to paragraph (k) of this section, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cloth shall be laundered in a way to prevent the release of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos fibers in excess of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Any spills of solvent or any asbestos containing waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material shall be cleaned up immediately according to paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The use of dry brushing during the wet method operations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

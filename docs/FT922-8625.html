			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / New company broadens gas supply contest THE COMPETITION to break down British Gas's monopoly of industrial gas supply was broadened yesterday when a new company, claiming to be the first truly independent supplier, entered the market. North Sea Gas, based in Bristol, will compete for a share when British Gas auctions some of its gas later this year. It is also close to reaching agreement with two other gas producers. The company, which is backed by private and institutional capital, aims to serve small commercial and industrial customers in south and south-west England and south Wales. Five of the 14 existing competitors to British Gas are joint ventures between regional electricity companies and Utilicorp, the second-largest gas-marketing company in the US. The other nine are owned by oil or gas production companies. North Sea Gas is the first independent supplier with no links to a producer. Its announcement came only days after Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, indicated that this year he would reduce the threshold for consumption under which rivals to British Gas are allowed into the market from 25,000 therms a year to 2,500 therms. North Sea Gas has received authorisation to operate from Ofgas, the industry regulator, and so is guaranteed receipt of at least the minimum allocation of 10m therms when British Gas sells 500m therms of its gas to competitors in October. It will deliver gas through existing pipes and meters by renting use of the mains system from British Gas. Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council, said he had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of companies such as North Sea Gas. 'This is the first example of true competition in terms of purity of operation,' he said. 'They are only going to be in business if they can get gas at a decent price and sell it on at a decent price.' Mr John Dorken, deputy director-general of Ofgas, also welcomed the company.</p>

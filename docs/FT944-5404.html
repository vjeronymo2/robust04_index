			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (8): Yields are high, but tread warily - Gilts This has been a difficult year for the UK government bond market. Its reputation as a 'safe' choice for private investors has taken a battering as bond prices have plummeted by more than 16 per cent since January, and gilt yields have risen by more than 2.4 percentage points to 8.6 per cent currently. However, there are now some encouraging signs of a recovery in the gilt-edged market, and some fund managers and financial advisers are recommending a return to gilts. Buying bonds at such low prices may be too good a chance to miss. And with yields of more than 8 1/2 per cent on the 10-year gilt, the returns for the long-term investor can be extremely attractive. However, the private investor should continue to tread warily. After 1993's bull market, investor confidence suddenly vanished at the beginning of 1994. The watershed was the rise in US interest rates on February 4, which sent shockwaves through the world's bond markets. Prices fell on the fear that economic recovery in the US and Europe would be inflationary and lead to sharply higher interest rates worldwide. The gilts market was particularly badly hit by these fears, partly because its recovery was further advanced than that of its fellow European countries, and partly because of the UK authorities' poor record in controlling inflation. The UK did not help its cause by making a badly-timed cut in base rates just four days after the Fed's first increase. The size of the UK government budget deficit also weighed heavily on the gilts market. Almost 10 months later, however, the fundamentals are looking increasingly favourable for gilts. Inflation remains subdued, and Britain's finances are looking a lot healthier than those of other European countries. UK short-term interest rates have risen, from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent, but this increase was generally welcomed as well-timed step to head off future inflation. 'The gilt market's bad year is now over,' said Mr David Kauders, a portfolio manager based in the West of England with about Pounds 22m under management for private clients. He expects the bull market to resume within the next six months as investors realise that inflation and interest rates are set to remain low. He says there are 'some big hints out there for the personal investor' - yields of 8 1/2 per cent, compared with a 4 per cent gross yield on equities, and the likelihood of legislation forcing pension funds to hold more gilts. His advice is: buy medium-dated gilts at par and sit tight. Mr Robert McHenry, an investment director at Lombard Odier, which has Dollars 4.5bn under management in fixed interest, is currently favouring two-year gilts. 'We remain cautious about gilts, but there is a lot of bad news already priced into the market, particularly in the two-year area of the yield curve. There is room for improvement there,' he said. He also thinks the yields, of around 3.9 per cent, currently available on index-linked gilts are quite generous. Many City analysts agree that the revival in gilts is likely to continue, at least until early next year. In the longer term, however, many analysts think that growing inflationary pressures will once again undermine bond prices. It will take some time yet for the gilt-edged market to rescue its tarnished reputation.</p>

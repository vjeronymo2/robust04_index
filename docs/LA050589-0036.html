			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A federal judge in Madison, Wis., refused to prohibit the Lac du Flambeau band  of Chippewa Indians from spearing all of its allowable fish catch on some  Wisconsin lakes. An agreement to cut the fish take was reached at a meeting  more than two weeks ago between Gov. Tommy G. Thompson and leaders of the six  Chippewa bands. But after increasing harassment by sport fishermen who are  opposed to the Indians' off-reservation spearing, the tribal chief said that  the band might begin taking 100% of the fish that biologists consider safe to  take from a lake. Meanwhile, Wisconsin's congressional delegation introduced  legislation that would revise the terms of Indian treaties to allow more sport  fishing in the Chippewa area of the state.  </P></p>

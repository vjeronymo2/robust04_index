			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (5): Slough points the way out of despond - The growing view is that this recovery is more durable than previous ones / The industrial market THE STOCK market, at least, believes the industrial property sector is well on the way to recovery. The shares of Slough Estates, the UK's biggest industrial property company, have more than tripled since the UK quit the exchange rate mechanism. This sudden upsurge of confidence is rather surprising, given the historical pattern of property revivals. After previous recessions, the industrial property market lagged the general improvement in the economy. But there is a widespread view this time round that demand for industrial property is picking up more strongly and more quickly than could be expected at this stage of the economic cycle. Part of the explanation could simply be that the recession of the early 1980s was particularly severe on the manufacturing sector while this recession has primarily hit service companies. The optimists suggest that industrial property may continue to perform relatively strongly, with the government seemingly committed to developing the manufacturing sector and with service companies still shaking out labour, depressing demand for office space. Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates, says: 'Generally, things are improving, but there is still a fragility about the market. It varies from region to region, depending on local levels of supply and demand and the strength of the underlying economies.' The company has seen a steady pick-up in demand throughout this year. Enquiries are currently running at double the level of 1992. Lettings, too, have picked up strongly, starting in the Thames Valley and west Midlands markets and spreading to the north-west England, west London, Docklands, the west country, the south coast and Kent. In the past year, Slough has completed lettings for 77 industrial and warehouse units and four retail warehouse units to such tenants as Daewoo, Sketchley and Motorola. Slough Estates is even confident enough of the market's strength to begin some selective speculative development. A few investment institutions, such as Equity &amp; Law and AMP Asset Management, have also been prepared to dip their toe in the water and test the market for speculative industrial sites. Although the building companies, which flooded into the speculative industrial property market in the 1980s, are unlikely to return as quickly given the banking restraints under which many now operate. Others in the industry, too, report that there is a firmer feel to the underlying industrial and warehouse market, as tenants sense the market may have bottomed and begin searching for good deals while they are still available. Company head offices appear more willing to authorise operating units totake on new space. There is particularly strong interest in freehold property - largely as a result of the historically low cost of borrowing. Guy Douetil, an industrial agency surveyor at Healey &amp; Baker, suggests: 'Perhaps one in 10 serious enquiries that comes through will now convert into a letting, whereas it was a lot rarer than that before.' Fund managers, who have traditionally concentrated their investment in the commercial office sector, now appear eager to increase their exposure to industrial property as yields begin to fall sharply. Double-digit yields were widely available in the sector last year. But since the beginning of 1993 they have dropped by perhaps 200 basis points to about 7 1/2 per cent. Richard Harrold, head of property investment at fund managers Postel, which has about 20 per cent of its Pounds 2.5bn property portfolio in the industrial sector, says: 'Three months ago, we took the view that the industrial market would recover quicker this time than in previous recessions. We had more confidence that there was a higher level of industrial activity than previously when industrial property had been among the last sectors to respond. 'We have been trying to invest in the industrial property market over the past 18 months, and have found it quite difficult.' As in other sectors of the property market, investment has chiefly been driven by relative yield considerations. Even at current yields, industrial property appears attractive when set against the returns available on bonds, equities or cash. The critical question now is whether yields are likely to fall any further. 'I think yields may nudge down a bit more. But you cannot yet put your hand on your heart and be confident about the prospects for rental growth. One has still to be nervous about the economic recovery,' says Mr Harrold. During the recession, rents dropped sharply, particularly in the south-east, and there appears little prospect that they will recover quickly. Healey &amp; Baker estimates there has been an 11.6 per cent fall in rents on industrial property over the past year. Since 1990, there has been a large number of tenant failures as companies ran into financial difficulties. In many cases, landlords were confronted with the painful choice of either cutting or deferring rents or seeing their tenants go out of business and losing all income. Even though the level of liquidations has dropped in the past six months, it will take time for tenant demand to pick up sufficiently to absorb the rental slack in the market. Sir Nigel Mobbs is optimistic that there may be some resumption of rental growth towards the end of next year. But he believes the overall figures may mask an increasing polarisation between the performance of modern high quality industrial property, which remains in short supply, and older secondary space, of which there is a glut.</p>

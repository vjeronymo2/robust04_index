			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia  have in principle agreed to mutually cooperate in the area of  weapons system and military technology, a government official  said on Wednesday.    He said Foreign and Defense Ministries are having close  talks  with their respective Russian counterparts based on the  agreement.    "As part of cooperation in the military area, the two  countries are currently studying the possible joint production  of Russia's ultra-modern weapons," the official said.    He elaborated that in joint production, Russia will furnish  expertise and South Korea necessary capital and marketing.    The official added, however, that such cooperation would  hardly be endorsed by a formal agreement.    He reasoned that Russia's defense industry is different from  Korea's in technological style and therefore their weapons and  knowhow in some areas cannot be transferred to South Korea as  they are.    "It also is almost impossible at this stage for Korea to  introduce Russia's military expertise in return for the debts  Russia owes to South Korea in economic cooperation credits," he  said.</p>

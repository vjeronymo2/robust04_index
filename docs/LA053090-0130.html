			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION TENNIS PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> WOODBRIDGE NEEDS TO GO DEEP INTO LINEUP TO WIN  </P> <P> Members of the Woodbridge High School tennis team, the Southern Section's  top-ranked 3-A squad, ran off their bus cheering and shouting before a big  match earlier this season.  </P> <P> That's normal rah-rah stuff for football or basketball teams, but rare in the  staid world of tennis, even high school team tennis.  </P> <P> But then the Warriors are not your normal team. Their top doubles team plays in  the No. 2 spot, even though it beat the No. 1 team, won the league championship  and advanced to the round of 16 in the Southern Section doubles tournament last  week.  </P> <P> And it's rarer still for a team to be as deep as Woodbridge. Normally, one or  two top-ranked players dominate, but, as one rival coach says, their top seven  players are almost interchangeable.  </P> <P> "A real concerted team effort," is how Woodbridge assistant coach Joan Willett  describes the Warriors, who face San Marino for the 3-A championship at 2 today  at the Racquet Club of Irvine.  </P> <P> Depth, a team spirit and a budding championship tradition are on the Warriors'  side as they seek a second consecutive title.  </P> <P> Last year, Woodbridge edged Sunny Hills, 10-8, to win its first championship.  </P> <P> This season, Woodbridge is 21-3 and has been the 3-A's top-ranked team most of  the season. San Marino (21-0 and the third-seeded team) knocked off Laguna  Beach Thursday to advance to the title match.  </P> <P> "Woodbridge could win," said Laguna Beach Coach Bob Walton, whose team lost to  Woodbridge twice this season. "They're deeper . . . they're capable of  winning."  </P> <P> Unlike last season, when Woodbridge could count on three victories from Randy  Ivey, its burly No. 1 singles player, and at least two from Alex Steinhardt,  its No. 2 player, the Warriors don't have one or two standouts.  </P> <P> Ivey and Steinhardt have graduated, leaving a balanced lineup with only  marginal differences between the top nine players.  </P> <P> "They know they all have to pull together, to contribute, or there's no way  we'll win," Willett said.  </P> <P> On most days, barring upsets in practice, the Woodbridge lineup stacks up this  way:  </P> <P>  -- In singles, Chris Emery, a senior, plays at No. 1; Rajan Saggar, a senior,  is No. 2, and sophomore Erik Berg No. 3.  </P> <P>  -- In doubles, juniors Darren Isaacman and Victor Ro play at No. 1, seniors  Brett Isaacman and Reza Nilforoushan are at No. 2, and sophomores Steve Shevel  and Rajeev Saggar are the No. 3 team.  </P> <P> Brett Isaacman and Nilforoushan were the surprise winners of the Pacific Coast  League doubles title and advanced to the round of 16 in the Southern Section  tournament before falling to Sean McKenna and Derek Shinden of Thousand Oaks,  6-1, 6-0. McKenna and Shinden reached the final, but lost.  </P> <P> The 4-A final features two unbeaten teams. Dana Hills (22-0 and second-seeded)  plays host to top-seeded Santa Barbara (23-0) at 3 today at El Niguel Racquet  Club.  </P> <P> Dana Hills is led by Ben Stevens, its No. 1 singles player. Peter Jeschke,  Santa Barbara's No. 1 singles player, was a semifinalist in the Southern  Section individual tournament last week.  </P></p>

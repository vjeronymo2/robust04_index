			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Clinton tops in the team spirit stakes THE Democratic party convention has not needed more than a single ballot to choose its presidential nominee since 1956, and this year's convention in New York will be no exception. But Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the winning candidate, appears to have done a better job than his predecessors of quelling any dissonant voices that could have upset a show of Democratic unity behind his candidacy. Mr Clinton, with the backing of 2,565 of the 4,288 convention delegates, has had to make remarkably few concessions to his opponents, either on the content of the party platform or on the roster of speakers for the four-day gala at Madison Square Garden. 'This will be more unified than any convention I've been to in recent years. . . This is going to be Bill Clinton's convention,' says one Democratic party activist now working for the Clinton campaign. Some of the Arkansas governor's critics within the party have been strong-armed into a display of team spirit - such as Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, who has agreed, at the urgent behest of Mr Ron Brown, the party chairman, to make the formal nominat ion speech on Wednesday night. Mr Paul Tsongas, Mr Clinton's strongest challenger during the primaries, has agreed to endorse his rival in exchange for a chance to speak to the convention on behalf of his pro-business economic policies. Others have been kept off the speaking list altogether, notably former Governor Jerry Brown of California, whose rebellious primary campaign won him 613 delegates. Mr Brown's supporters hope to raise a challenge with a procedural vote on the convention rules, but Clinton supporters are dismissive. Mr Jesse Jackson, who has endorsed Mr Clinton but has spent the last week sulking on television because no-one will treat him with the respect he feels he deserves, could pose more of a problem. His convention speech has, however, been relegated to Tuesday night, when it seems likely to receive less attention than the simultaneously broadcast All Star baseball game. Perhaps the biggest challenge for Mr Clinton will be to come up with an acceptance speech on Thursday that is not eclipsed by the oratory that has gone before. The Democrats have lined up all their most talented speakers: from the acerbic wisecracks of Governor Ann Richards of Texas and the intense eloquence of former Representative Barbara Jordan, to the emotional uplift of Mr Cuomo. Mr Clinton's last convention speech, nominating Governor Michael Dukakis in 1988, has gone down in the Democratic party annals as one of the dullest of all time, but he can be more exciting. The party platform, meanwhile, shows the marks of Mr Clinton's moderate supporters, many of them drawn from the Democratic Leadership Council, a mostly southern grouping that has set about drawing the party towards the centre. Calling for 'a New Covenant to repair the damaged bond between the American people and their government', the platform includes many traditional liberal Democratic themes, such as urban investment, abortion rights, affirmative action in favour of minorities, public support for the arts, and a limited amount of gun control. However it also marks a shift away from government interventionism in its rhetoric on economic policy - although not as far as Mr Tsongas would have liked. 'An expanding, entrepreneurial economy of high-skill, high-wage jobs is the most important family policy, urban policy, labour policy, minority policy and foreign policy America can have,' the platform states. 'We reject both the do-nothing government of the last 12 years and the big government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and spend our way to prosperity.' Perhaps as important, it contains a significantly tougher anti-crime plank than recent Democratic platforms, remedying a weakness that the Republicans have gleefully exploited for decades. Democratic leaders hope the party platform and the selection of Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee - a southerner very similar to Mr Clinton in age, views and style - will help to signal to voters that the Democrats are now a moderate party representing middle-class Americans, not left-wing interest groups. Even some of Mr Clinton's opponents acknowledge that this is likely to be a more winning electoral recipe than the left wing coalition of recent elections. Mr Clinton's campaign has already broken out of the doldrums that becalmed it this spring, when every step and every statement seemed to strengthen his image as another slithery politician. Yet he has not succeeded in putting these doubts about his character wholly behind him, and is still no better in opinion polls than level pegging with President George Bush and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire. A united convention and an inspired acceptance speech could lift Mr Clinton by 10 percentage points in the opinion polls, according to one of his campaign advisers. While this lead would clearly dwindle in August, they say, it does not have to disappear entirely - as Mr Dukakis's even larger edge did in 1988.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                THE GHOSTS OF DEMOCRATIC CONVENTIONS PAST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HUBERT HUMPHREY 1968 Chicago With battle raging in Vietnam and outside the convention hall, Vice- President Humphrey won the nomination from Senators Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern. He lost the general election to Richard Nixon.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GEORGE McGOVERN 1972 Miami Beach After drafting extensive changes in the Democratic party's selection rules, McGovern won the nomination but lost in a Nixon landslide.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JIMMY CARTER 1976 New York In the wake of Watergate, Carter, then a little known Southern governor, won the nomination and went on to beat President Gerald Ford.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JIMMY CARTER 1980 New York After a tough primary campaign, President Carter won the nomination but had to give way to his challenger, Senator Edward Kennedy, on much of the party's election platform. Carter lost to Ronald Reagan.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WALTER MONDALE 1984 San Francisco Former vice-president Mondale won the nomination from Jesse Jackson and Senator Gary Hart, and picked Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate. The Democratic team was again no match for Reagan.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MICHAEL DUKAKIS 1988 Atlanta The convention gave Governor Dukakis a big lead over Vice-President George Bush in opinion polls, but by November it had evaporated.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

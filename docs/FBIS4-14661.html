			<p>BFN     [Text] The meeting of a group of experts from North Ossetia  and Ingushetia held under the mediation of the head of the  interim administration in the zone of the state of emergency  Vladimir Lozovoy was concluded with the signing of a working  protocol on Friday.    The parties agreed to hold a meeting between North Ossetian  and Ingush presidents Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev on  April 2 in Nalchik, the capital of Kabardino Balkaria.    The issue relating to the implementation of the Russian  president's decree on the return of Ingush refugees to North  Ossetia's Prigorodny region is to become the central one at  forthcoming negotiations between the leaders of two neighboring  republics.    Meanwhile, during the meeting the experts demonstrated  different approaches of the Ossetian and Ingush parties towards  this problem. As a result, two drafts of the agenda of Galazov's  and Aushev's meeting were fixed in the final document.    The first draft presented by North Ossetia says that the  meeting in Nalchik should consider the issues on principles and  measures to implement Boris Yeltsin's decree stipulating the  order of refugees and forced settlers return from North Ossetia  and Ingushetia to the places of their permanent residence.    The second draft which was presented by the Ingush party  stipulates that the meeting should consider the issue related to  the fulfillment of the Russian president's decree and the  complete return of refugees and all settlers from North Ossetia  to the places of their permanent residence.    On April 2 Galazov and Aushev are to choose what draft will  become the subject of their discussion.    In his interview with Interfax Lozovoy expressed hopes that  the negotiations of the working groups held April 1 have given  an impulse to the implementation of Russian president's decree  on the return of refugees and forced settlers.    Leader of the Russian president's administration Sergey  Filatov and Kabardino Balkarian President Valeriy Kokov are  expected to attend the meeting in Nalchik.</p>

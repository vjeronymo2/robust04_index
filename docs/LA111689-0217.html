			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RIEGLE ACKNOWLEDGES CLOSER CONNECTION TO LINCOLN S&amp;L  </P> <P> Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), who has sought to minimize his ties to the  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal, has acknowledged a deeper involvement with  Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr.  </P> <P> Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and four other senators are  the subject of preliminary reviews by the Senate Ethics Committee and the FBI  because of their connections to Keating and their actions on his behalf.  </P> <P> Riegle was one of five senators who intervened with regulators on Keating's  behalf at an April 9, 1987, meeting about Irvine-based Lincoln.  </P> <P> That meeting, and a meeting a week earlier that Riegle did not attend, have  become important to a congressional probe of Lincoln's collapse. Their  intervention has been blamed by some for the delay in taking regulatory action  against Lincoln, which was seized in April amid charges of fraud and misuse of  depositor money.  </P> <P> The Michigan Democrat has insisted that he attended the April 9 meeting about  Irvine-based Lincoln only at the request of Senate colleagues who sought his  presence as "a banking resource person." Riegle has contended that he was  basically a bystander at the meeting.  </P> <P> But Karolyn Wallace, Riegle's press secretary, disclosed Tuesday that nearly a  month earlier, Riegle toured the firm's parent company in Phoenix. Two weeks  later, on March 23, 1987, Keating sponsored a Detroit fund-raising luncheon for  Riegle, she said.  </P> <P> Executives of Lincoln and its parent firm, Phoenix-based American Continental  Corp., gave Riegle $78,250 in campaign donations at the fund-raiser.  </P> <P> Riegle returned Keating's donations after it was disclosed by the Detroit News  last year, saying he wanted to avoid "an appearance of a conflict of interest."  </P> <P> The previously undisclosed meeting between Riegle and Keating plus other recent  revelations show that Riegle's relationship with Keating were closer than  Riegle has publicly indicated.  </P> <P> In addition to the newly revealed Arizona visit, Riegle did not advise the  ethics committee of two other Lincoln-related contacts in the weeks before the  April, 1987, meeting with regulators.  </P> <P> The other senators under scrutiny for their involvement in the Lincoln case are  Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and  John Glenn (D-Ohio).  </P></p>

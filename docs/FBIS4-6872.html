			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Is U.S. Pressure Behind Anti-SDPJ </F> Encirclement?"]    [Text] With policy debate among the ruling coalition  parties deadlocked over tax reform and the DPRK's (North Korea)  policies, on 20 April the parties continued difficult  negotiations all day.    In the morning, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] told reporters, "It is  important to carefully review and settle all points of dispute."  In the interparty negotiations on a new policy accord, the SDPJ  was in a difficult position coping with "anti-SDPJ encirclement"  by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. The SDPJ  believes the anti-SDPJ encirclement was created by "U.S.  pressure."    In the SDPJ Central Executive Committee meeting on 20 April,  deputy secretary general Hideyuki Maejima expressed strong  frustration with the coalition's preparatory work for policy  accord. He said: "If `close tie-ups with the United States and  the ROK' are incorporated in the coalition's policy accord,  Japan may have to comply with U.S. requests even before the  official UN decision (on sanctions against North Korea)."    After Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's return home from  Morocco on 18 April, "U.S. pressure" became the focal point of  the "post-Hosokawa" political scene. A senior Komeito official  said "It appears, in Marrakech, Hata received very difficult  requests from (U.S. Vice President) Al Gore over the North Korea  issue." Similarly, a source in Shinseito said "Hata has become  prudent about his succession of the premiership since he noticed  the rigid U.S. stance on North Korea and economic issues."    In an 18 April news conference, Democratic Socialist Party  secretary general Takashi Yonezawa stressed: "Nobody will  become prime minister unless the coalition parties adopt a clear  stance toward the North Korea issue."    Former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal  Democratic Party recently decided to form a new party to win the  premiership, and the coalition was shaken by this move. Some  coalition parties are stressing that Hata is an indispensable  political figure to maintain the framework of the coalition  government, and that, to achieve the objective, the coalition  must work out concessions on the North Korea and tax reform  policies. This opinion is obviously targeting the SDPJ.    The collapse of the Hosokawa administration was accelerated  by the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit talks in February.  Hosokawa's successor should overcome the chilly relations with  the United States as a top priority issue. Under such  circumstances, Shinseito secretary general Ichiro Ozawa  reportedly intends to remove all possible obstacles before the  inauguration of the new administration. Commenting on Ozawa's  strategy, a senior Sakigake [Harbinger] official said, "that is  why they expelled Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura as  the `principal offender' in ruining the proposal for the public  welfare tax."    Also, SDPJ Diet Administration Committee chairman Koken  Nosaka said immediately before the 20 April negotiation of the  coalition parties: "They do not want to make the Hata  administration a stopgap government. So, they are urging us to  accept difficult conditions." It appeared Nosaka was trying to  say the United States is the behind-the-scenes player in the  political controversy.</p>

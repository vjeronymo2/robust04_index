			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rea Brothers more than doubled to Pounds 2m Rea Brothers, the private banking group, announced pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 805,000 to Pounds 2.05m in 1993, helped by a turnround from its fund management operations. Net interest income fell marginally to Pounds 3.98m (Pounds 4.2m) because of lower interest rates and the company's conservative lending policy. Customer accounts grew to Pounds 239m (Pounds 238m), while loans and advances to customers fell by Pounds 2m to Pounds 27m. Fee income, however, increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 9.44m, boosting overall operating income to Pounds 14.1m, compared with Pounds 11.7m. The company's corporate finance and trust administration businesses, both had record years. Rea Brothers' fund management operation, however, was the main source of growth. Mr Roger Parsons, managing director, said the company had increased funds under management more than threefold in the past three and a half years. The fund management business made a pre-tax contribution of Pounds 647,000 compared with a small loss in 1992, with funds increasing by 22 per cent during the year. Rea Brothers made a Pounds 300,000 provision for legal costs related to proceedings against the company over a now defunct pension scheme. The directors have recommended a final dividend of 0.45p, making a total of 0.75p, a 50 per cent increase. Earnings per share increased more substantially to 4.05p (0.82p) because of a marginal fall in tax payments.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: CARL THORNTON PARK  </P> <P> "Build it, and they will come."  </P> <P>  -- The voice to Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) in "Field of Dreams."  </P> <P> The voice could just as well be referring to the lake at Carl Thornton Park,  for since it was built five years ago, the birds -- hundreds of them -- have  been coming.  </P> <P> They fight, they squawk, they frolic, they beg for French fries. And the people  who visit the park -- a popular spot for workers looking for a nature break  during their lunch hour -- are more than willing to share their meals with the  birds.  </P> <P> The park, at 35 acres, is the second largest in Santa Ana (Centennial Park has  100 acres), according to Allen Doby, executive director for the Santa Ana  Recreation and Community Services Agency. The park's namesake was a longtime  Santa Ana city manager, who served the city from 1952 to the mid-1960s. It  first opened in 1979, but the three-acre lake -- the park's focal point -- was  not built until 1985.  </P> <P> Doby said he had no idea how many birds call the lake home, but he does know  the city hasn't contributed to the population.  </P> <P> "We've never put any ducks there," Doby said. "The whole area of Santa Ana is a  bird refuge, and when they spot water they land."  </P> <P> He said the bird population increases in the winter, and the ducks and other  birds have begun to breed in the park. However, he added, not all the birds are  entirely welcome.  </P> <P> "We'd like to get rid of" the mud hens," Doby said. "They eat up the vegetation  and really peck away at the grass."  </P> <P> The city may not add to the bird population, but it does stock the lake twice a  year with fresh-water fish, much to the delight of the children who cast their  lines.  </P> <P> The park also includes a jogging trail and two softball fields, available for  rental. The city is installing lights for the field, and night softball should  be available in six months.  </P> <P> However, the park's lure will continue to be the lake and the birds. And for  the people who feed the birds, Doby has some advice: "Don't be disappointed if  they don't eat what you give them right away; they might be overfed."  </P> <P> Judging by the number of people at the park throwing bread crumbs and French  fries on any given day, he may have a point.  </P> <P> Hours: 5:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily  </P> <P> Address: 1801 Segerstrom Ave., Santa Ana  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 647-5301 for softball diamond reservations  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Berger article: "Chernomyrdin Government Has </F> Prepared Small Economic Revolution"]    [Text] The Russian Government has prepared a package of  documents (eight presidential edicts and one government decree),  the signing of which could accomplish a small-scale revolution  in the country's economy.    Viktor Chernomyrdin's government has probably decided to  answer in one go the charges which have been repeatedly leveled  against it throughout the 18 months of its existence.    The package of prepared edicts holds out the promise of a  great revival in economic life, which some people have been  patiently awaiting while others have been hitherto hoping to  avoid.    Some of the drafts are relatively uncontroversial in nature,  developing already known topics: a package of measures  introducing taxes into the budget, measures to normalize  settlements and tighten up payment discipline, and certain  questions of tax policy. But the package also contains  documents which are bound to produce certain upheavals. These  include draft edicts "On the Sale of Debtor-Enterprises," "On  the Reform of State Enterprises," and "On the Abolition of the  Issuing of Quotas and Licenses for Supplies of Goods and  Services for Export.    One of the edicts will enable a sigh of relief to be  breathed  by those frightened by the Labor Ministry's promises to limit  wages in drastic fashion. The Labor Ministry was indulging in  wishful thinking when it issued via news agencies last week its  own version of measures to limit incomes. It in no way follows  from the draft edict "On the Regulation of Resources Used for  Consumption" that a wage in excess of 240,000 rubles [R] per  month will be liable to draconian taxation, as the Labor  Ministry proposes. And the idea that earnings of  R400,000-700,000 per month are "out of this world" will remain  the labor minister's personal opinion.    There was virtually only one restriction in the draft edict  on this topic as it existed at the end of Sunday: An increase  in the wages fund which exceeds the level of the growth in  prices by more than 70 percent will be liable to a fine.    The edict "On Certain Questions of Taxation Policy" will  prove even more agreeable to many people. Under this edict the  government is required to make proposals on improving the tax  system by 15 September. The areas of improvement are as  follows: reducing the total number of taxes and reducing the  level of profit tax and value-added tax [VAT] by 10-20 percent.    Foreign investors -- provided, of course, they are bona fide  investors -- can obtain substantial concessions. Joint ventures  registered since 1 January this year which have a foreign  capital stake of at least 30 percent and investments of at least  $10 million are exempt from all payment of profit tax into the  federal budget for three years. During the fourth year of their  existence they will pay one-quarter of the tax due, and in their  fifth year one-half. But if a joint venture is wound up before  it has been in existence six years it will have to repay all the  concessions received to the federal budget.    By all accounts, the government intends to follow the route  of drastically tightening up control over tax receipts rather  than increasing tax rates. The draft of the relevant edict  envisages the mandatory registration of all kinds of accounts  (hard currency, deposit, loan accounts, and so forth) with the  tax bodies. If, however, a bank does open an account for an  enterprise without a certificate from the tax inspectorate, the  bank chief will be fined 100 times the minimum wage.    If an enterprise goes three months without paying taxes a  decision may be made to deem it insolvent.    And another pretty tough measure, affecting individuals this  time too, is that banks must inform the tax bodies of all  transactions exceeding $10,000.    But it is the edicts on the reform of state enterprises and  the sale of enterprises in debt which could have the most  serious consequences. The idea of the reform is to eliminate in  practice such a socialist vestige as the "right of full economic  authority." This right has allowed the directors of state  enterprises to be in complete charge of state property while  being in no way accountable.    The edict on the sale of debtor-enterprises confirms the  statute on this procedure. The Federal Administration for  Insolvency Affairs, the debtor-enterprise itself or its  creditors, the prosecutor's office or the State Committee for  the Management of State Property can act as the initiator of  this procedure. Liability for bogus bankruptcy is laid down.  Sales are effected purely on the basis of commercial bids  without restriction on the makeup of the parties involved  (including individuals and foreign buyers).    The package of documents also contains a statute on the  criteria governing the provision of state financial assistance,  which is constantly being demanded from the exchequer by many  directors. The criteria and the terms for the provision of  assistance are plain and clear. If events develop in a certain  way, the question of declaring an enterprise bankrupt may be  raised.    The issue of these edicts has so agitated the public that  Aleksandr Livshits, leader of the president's group of experts,  held a press conference on Monday, 23 May. He explained the  reason for President Yeltsin's slip of the tongue when he  described the economy as being "on the verge of collapse."  Livshits observed that the economy is not suffering from any  catastrophe -- there is a problem of falling output. He also  spoke about the package of edicts discussed in our article.    All the edicts come into force from the moment they are  signed and will operate until the Duma passes the relevant laws.</p>

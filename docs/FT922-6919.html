			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late fall in futures causes Nikkei to change course LATE afternoon profit-taking and arbitrage-related selling erased initial gains, and share prices lost ground in tandem with the futures market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average was down 79.18 at 18,674.93 after a high of 18,927.64 in the morning and a low of 18,635.89 in the afternoon. Investors were encouraged at the start by the overnight high on Wall Street, and sought issues with favourable earnings prospects. However, share prices receded in the afternoon as a fall in the futures market prompted arbitrage selling. Volume declined to 300m shares from 340m. Rises retained a narrow lead over falls by 497 to 488, with 155 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 1.20 to 1,394.51, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended just 0.66 up at 1,107.10. Traders said that, in the short term, the market looked vulnerable because of the high margin activity recently, especially in speculative or 'theme' stocks. In the longer term, however, fears of a loss of support at the 18,000 level seem to have subsided. Corporate results have had a substantial effect on some stocks. Surprises on the negative side stem from losses on securities investments and real estate development. Investors have been discouraged by losses at companies which had been known for their profitable business operations. Shares in Sekisui Chemical, which reported a 17 per cent fall in pre-tax profits due to losses at its financing affiliate, have dropped 21 per cent since the results were announced two weeks ago. It closed Y29 down at Y871 yesterday. Sato Kogyo, the civil engineering group, slipped Y70 to Y1,080. The company suffered an extraordinary loss of Y2.3bn in its last fiscal year due to loan guarantee payments to a resort construction affiliate. On the other hand, better than expected earnings announcements were appreciated. Nippon Meat Packers, which saw a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y28.5bn on a 7 per cent increase in sales to Y585bn, responded with a gain of Y30 to Y1,770. Short-term trading in theme stocks led activity. The most active issue of the day was Mitsubishi Kakoki, an industrial waste water treatment equipment maker, which rose Y90 to Y1,190 on the environmental theme. Traders are also promoting the stock as an Aids-related issue, due to increasing sales of its condom production facilities. In Osaka, the OSE average gained a slight 0.73 at 21,348.15 in volume of 20.5m shares. Roundup THE Pacific Rim was generally firmer as international funds were switched out of Thailand into neighbouring markets. HONG KONG rose sharply on speculation that interest rates would be cut by the weekend. The Hang Seng index advanced 111.52 to 5,753.76 in turnover of HKDollars 3.91bn. HSBC Holdings led the rally, rising 75 cents to HKDollars 44 on news that the Bank of England would not object to the group's proposed bid for Midland Bank. BANGKOK rallied on bargain hunting following Tuesday's 8.9 per cent drop. The SET index gained 9.53 to 677.37. SEOUL lost ground, with sentiment depressed by rumours that the tax affairs of some individual investors were to be investigated. The composite index fell 8.06 to 579.91 in turnover of Won400bn. MANILA was stronger on selective buying of commercial and industrial stocks. The composite index appreciated 19.25 to 1,358.20 in turnover of 182m pesos. Philippine Long Distance Telephone gained 25 pesos to 1,090 pesos. TAIWAN extended Tuesday's advance and the weighted index put on 59.18 to 4,560.00 in turnover of TDollars 30bn. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index climbed 3.18 to 594.09 in turnover of MDollars 138m. Telekom moved ahead 20 cents to MDollars 12.70, with some 549,000 shares traded. AUSTRALIA advanced in strong trade. The All Ordinaries index gained 15.7 to 1,682.0 in turnover of ADollars 205m. Westpac shed 5 cents to ADollars 3.89 before reporting a loss of ADollars 1.67bn for its fiscal first half. The bank also announced an ADollars 1.2bn rights issue. Elsewhere, BHP moved forward 14 cents to ADollars 14.28 and News Corp put on 48 cents to ADollars 22.10. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index rose 3.07 to 1,472.87 in dull trade, with most institutional interest focused on Hong Kong. NEW ZEALAND declined as investors took profits. The NZSE-40 index retreated 5.26 to 1,547.43 in NZDollars 19.4m turnover.</p>

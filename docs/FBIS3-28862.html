Gen. Chhim Chhorn, with  his new role, will receive orders directly from the first and  second prime ministers.    Thousands of soldiers from the PDK, the only faction that  boycotted last year's UN-supervised general polls, have defected  and rejoined national community following the implementation of  national reconciliation policy under the august directive of His  Majesty Norodom Sihanouk.    In northwestern Battambang Province alone, the number of the  Khmer Rouge returnees had reached 3,364 by the end of December  last year. Among the 235 Khmer Rouge troops incorporated in the  KRAF, 58 former officers and noncommissioned officers have been  promoted as senior and junior officers.</p>

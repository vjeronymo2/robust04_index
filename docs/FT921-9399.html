			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / French Socialists defeat censure France's Socialist government easily defeated a no-confidence motion tabled yesterday by the centre-right opposition over the controversial hospital stay in Paris of the Palestinian radical, Mr George Habash, Reuter reports from Paris. The Communist party said before the vote it would not support the motion, ensuring the survival of Mrs Edith Cresson's minority Socialist-led government. The motion finally mustered 261 votes in favour, 28 short of what it needed to succeed. The government has been under pressure since news leaked of the admission to France of Mr Habash, who aroused no public sympathy because of his involvement in bombings and aircraft hijackings. Five senior officials were forced to resign over the affair, but opposition politicians ministers' heads to roll. President Francois Mitterrand yesterday agreed to scale down plans to build a giant new national library in the centre of Paris which critics had condemned as too grandiose, Reuter reports. He said in a letter to Mr Jack Lang, culture minister, he had decided to change the design after studying an independent report on the FFr7.2b (Pounds 730m) project. The building would be made more cost-effective and compact by reducing the height of glass towers to be situated at each of its four corners.</p>

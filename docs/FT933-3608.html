			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Sanctions no answer to halting the decline in rhino population Sir, The sanctions ('US to impose sanctions on China and Taiwan over rhino horn trade', September 8), if forthcoming, will undoubtedly reduce the volume of rhino horn reaching China and Taiwan. However, they are also likely to result in a further decline in rhino populations. The price of rhino horn will rise, on an increasingly clandestine market, thereby encouraging further poaching activities. The horn is prized in Asia as a fever remedy. However, the lack of a legal market (or an illegal outlet in Asia) renders a lucrative commodity worthless to the local people of Zimbabwe, Sumatra etc. Therefore they have little incentive to protect their rhino. If, on the other hand, local people were allowed to own and trade in rhino horn (at prices up to Dollars 60,000 a kilo) it would provide a powerful incentive for them to protect their rhinos. For example, white rhino horn can effectually be harvested without killing the rhino. This would have two effects: first, it would increase the rhino farmers' incentive to protect the rhino; second, a rhino without a horn is less attractive to a poacher. The motive of the US Environmental Investigation Agency is laudable in wanting to maintain the world's rhino population. However, attempting to reduce the supply of horn will not reduce the demand for it, and will merely increase the likelihood of a faster extinction rate for the rhino. Allowing trade in rhino horn may offend many people, but it would ensure that a sizeable population of rhinos remains, which is, I presume, the aim.

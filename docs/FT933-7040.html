			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Copymore advances to Pounds 758,000 at midway COPYMORE, the USM-quoted office equipment company, lifted pre-tax profit from Pounds 506,000 to Pounds 758,000 for the six months to June 30. In part to compensate shareholders for the omission of a final dividend last year, the interim is increased from 1p to 2.5p, payable from earnings of 4.5p (3p) per share. Mr Stephen Matthews, chairman, said turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 14.9m). The result reflected the efforts of the sales team and determination to control and centralise fixed costs, as well as integrating new acquisitions, particularly National Technical Services. As yet there was no real sign of recovery in the office automation market, but he was confident of a satisfactory outcome for the year. Combined full year service revenues from the acquired Solutions II group and Concorde Copiers were expected to be Pounds 1.45m. Gearing had been cut from 134 per cent to 111 per cent. Interest cover improved to 6.8 times. Mr Matthews is leaving the board at the end of the month to concentrate on other interests.</p>

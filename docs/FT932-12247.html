			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (11): A growth stock in today's MBA market - A look at distance learning DISTANCE learning is the growth stock in the MBA market. Cheap, compatible with full-time work, geared to the middle and junior managers hitherto cold-shouldered by the business schools, the ultimate in flexibility - distance learning was a concept waiting to take off. In the UK it did so in the late 1980s, as a result of three forces: The advent of the Open Business School (OBS), which lent respectability to the concept; A succession of studies earlier in the decade - notably the Harbridge House Report in 1984 - claiming that in many respects full-time courses offered a poor return to students and employers alike; The development of sophisticated inter-active software packages, making it possible to tackle the 'hard' parts of courses (such as data analysis) in front of a screen. The Open Business School is an integral part of the Open University, the UK's pathfinding institute for post-experience distance-learning courses. It is about to celebrate its 10th birthday and 100,000th management development course. It is Europe's largest business school; this year it will graduate its first full cohort of 569 MBA students. Another 1,000 will follow next year. The numbers will rise; within a few years, OBS expects to be graduating one in five of the UK's new MBAs. The average age for its MBA students is 36 - some six years older than the typical part- or full-time MBA student elsewhere. The OBS is a huge operation, requiring more than 1,000 tutors, many of them practising managers, with regular residential schools and face-to-face tutorials. Students are expected to buy their own IBM-compatible PCs, but courses cost a fraction of the going part-time rate. 'Before OBS came on the scene, Henley (Management College) had the market to itself,' says Mr Roger McCormick, director general of the Association of MBAs. 'Even when OBS started, its massive first year intake was widely considered a freak. No-one thinks that now.' Nor do they under-estimate the OBS's achievement. 'Without doubt, the OBS has added a new dimension both in numbers and sophistication to the idea of a distance-learning MBA,' says McCormick. He emphasises the impact OBS is having on other business schools. First, it has pushed them to start or improve their distance-learning courses.' Henley, reinvigorated, is to the fore; so are Warwick and Strathclyde. Second, OBS is leading other schools to adopt a more modular approach to existing MBAs, and promote the integration of home-based inter-active techniques within part- and full-time courses. 'Statistics is a good example,' says McCormick. 'It is a course easily delivered by inter-active programmes, and incapacity at maths is something British students and managers are notoriously reluctant to admit in the classroom.' The numbers make you dizzy. This year's OBS registration tally is 22,000, representing some 15,000 students (equivalent to the whole of Oxford university and more). Until 1991, growth was at 35 per cent a year; it is slowing down to about 10 per cent - 'as much as we can manage while safeguarding quality,' says Professor Andrew Thompson, the school's director. In fact, it would have declined this year but for the overseas market, which is growing fast: OBS's aim is to have between 5,000 and 6,000 students in mainland western Europe by 1996. The concept apart, the OBS has three particular strengths: the modular nature of its courses; their international appeal; and their attraction to the public sector. OBS's management courses come in three ascending levels: certificate, diploma and MBA. One leads to the other, though it is not always necessary to start at the bottom. The certificate and diploma each take a year; the MBA three years, or two if taken after the diploma. With over 4,000 management students outside the UK, OBS now has co-ordinators in every EC country besides Denmark, and in most EFTA states too. OBS is one of the few western business schools making large inroads into central and eastern Europe. In western Europe all teaching material is in English; further east, it is translated. Hungary and Slovakia each have 1,000 OBS students; the first cohort of 500 started in Russia last year, and tutors are being trained in Bulgaria and Romania, partly under the Foreign Office's 'know-how' fund. A dramatic rise in corporate interest in distance-learning is the biggest change of the last few years, says Thompson. 'When we started, we were dealing with individuals; now the dynamic has shifted to companies and other employers, who want to integrate our courses into their own training structures.' Leading corporate clients include Abbey National, Whitbread, Price Waterhouse, Rank Xerox, ICI and BT. Some 40 open universities exist around the world. Most do management programmes, but with courses mostly at undergraduate, not graduate level. OBS has a true global market before it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xi Mi: "New Decree To Try and Brace Curbs on Illicit </F> Profiteering"]    [Text] The Chinese Government has been making painstaking  efforts to stabilize prices and check illegal profiteering.    The latest measure to keep the market in order will be the  promulgation of a decree aimed at curbing excessive profits  gained through unfair means.    This would add to the existing laws and codes aimed at  consumer protection.    "But these existing laws were not easily enforced because  they are far too general and abstract. What's more, few of them  address the new realities of the market economy because they  were made when the State controlled the prices of most  commodities," said Kuai Ming, of the State Planning Commission,  which drafted the decree.    "The decree will be one that suits the market economy. The  first draft of the regulation has been completed and the formal  version is expected to go into effect around July."    The decree is being prepared against a background of  continuous price hikes.    In February, the price index of consumer goods in 35 cities  rose 25.9 per cent over the same period last year.    And in January and February, growth of the retail sales  index  across the country was 3 per cent higher than over the same  period last year.    Such rapid price rises have lowered the living standards of  workers in loss-making firms, as well as hitting retired people,  students and farmers in poverty-stricken areas.    The imminent decree is just the latest in a series of  government moves to regulate market prices.    The State Council has previously urged strict control of the  scale and growth of investment in fixed assets. It has also  sought increased commodity supply, strengthened price management  and the establishment of a risk fund for growing grain and other  foods.    A watchdog will be established to monitor the prices of over  20 daily necessities and basic services.    Regulations on labelling have also been issued.    "The government has decided to relax controls on consumer  goods, allowing them to be priced according to market demands.  But this does not mean the government should let prices go  adrift," said Jiang Runyu, from the former State Administration  of Commodity Prices, which was recently merged with the State  Planning Commission.    The government needs to maintain overall macro-control of  the  market, he said.    Speaking at a meeting earlier this month, Chen Jinhua,  Minister of the State Planning Commission, said the government  should adopt new measures to prevent unlimited price rises and  drastic fluctuations, while at the same time preserving the  vitality of the market.    "The State should take legislative, economic and if  necessary, administrative measures to stabilize market prices,"  said Jiang.    The socialist market economy now taking shape is far from  perfect and the market pricing system needs standardizing.    Besides, the consumers themselves are not mature and don't  know how to protect their interests.    Dealers often arbitrarily and unreasonably raise their  prices-- and that seldom occurs in a mature market economy, he  said.    In February, vegetable prices in 35 cities rocketed by 53.5  per cent. In Beijing, the price rise was even higher.    Many former State-subsidized vegetable stores in the city  turned to other businesses when their subsidies were abolished.    The business volume of the State-run vegetable shops now  only  accounts for 10 to 15 per cent of the total market.    The market has now been collared by private traders.    According to the PEOPLE's DAILY, the retail price of  vegetables used to be only 10 to 20 per cent higher than the  wholesale price. But in spring this year, vegetables were  selling on the street for twice the wholesale price.    In many cases, the prices hikes were due to vegetables being  sold by one retailer to another before reaching customers.    Vegetable producers and transporters benefited little from  the price hike, while vegetable wholesalers and retailers gained  and the customers suffered.    "In the West, a profit margin of 30 per cent is considered  very high," said Kuai.    To further illustrate arbitrary pricing, Kuai cited an  example from the fashion business.    Some new and renovated department stores in downtown areas  sell 100-yuan ($11.5) garments at 1,000 yuan ($115). Stores  also charge high fees for renting their counters.    They set a bad example to other stores, inciting them to  also  impose high prices, which results in an inflated market.    "They expect to recover their investment in too short a time  and they shift the burden to customers--it's not right," Kuai  said.    Kuai said he once spotted a book priced at 180 yuan ($21) in  the Lufthansa Shopping Centre. Yet in State-run bookstores, the  same book could be bought for only 45 yuan ($5). Kuai dismissed  such arbitrary pricing as incomprehensible and deemed the  practice as rank profiteering.    The excessive profits gained through unethical measures will  be curtailed when the new decree comes into effect, he said.    "At present, we are soliciting opinions on the draft from  localities so the decree can reflect the demands of different  regions," Kuai said.    He hopes the decree will help the healthy development of the  market economy and that it will be improved by amendments.    According to Kuai, the forthcoming decree is in many ways  similar to "the Temporary Code against Price Cheating and  Excessive Profits" that was issued in Shanghai earlier this  month.    The Shanghai code stipulates that dealers should not sell  shoddy products, short-measure, or cheat customers through  dishonest advertising and deceptive labelling.    Neither should dealers spread false market information or  force customers into buying.    According to the decree, profit margins must be in line with  general price standards on any given commodity. The "proper"  standards are decided by the local price administration  departments.    Those who violate the decree face fines. And their illegal  profits must be returned to customers or confiscated.</p>

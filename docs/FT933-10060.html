			<p>930806 FT  06 AUG 93 / Zimbabwe stands firm on farm sales Zimbabwe's government will not back down on plans to force white farmers to sell their land, Mr Kumbirai Kangai, the agriculture minister, said at the annual congress of the Commercial Farmers' Union which ended yesterday, Reuter reports from Harare. There would be social strife without land reform, the minister said. 'Land just has to be redistributed because if it is not, then those with no land will take the law into their own hands and there will be social trouble,' said the minister. CFU delegates said the government had a 'racial agenda' in its land redistribution programme.</p>

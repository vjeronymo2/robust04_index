It has been learned that Anhui reaped a comprehensive  agricultural bumper harvest in 1993. First, the production of  principal agricultural products grew steadily, with that of  grains, edible oil, meat, eggs, and milk all breaking records.  Total grain production is estimated to have topped 25.4 billion  kg, up 8.46 percent compared to the previous year and exceeding  1990's production total of 25.2 billion kg. Total edible oil  production was 31.33 million dan [one dan equals 50 kg], up  11.86 percent compared to the previous year and exceeding 1987's  total production of 30.21 million dan. Total silkworm cocoon  production reached 32,300 dan, up 13.3 percent compared to the  previous year and an increase for 15th consecutive year. Total  meat production topped 1.372 million tons, up 6.4 percent  compared to the previous year; total egg production was 370,000  tons, up 2.2 percent compared to the previous year; and total  dairy products output was 27,000 tons, up 1.5 percent compared  to the previous year. Second, the economic efficiency of  agriculture was raised, and peasants' incomes increased  markedly. Anhui's total agricultural output value (in 1990  fixed prices) is estimated to top 41.7 billion yuan, an increase  of 3.3 billion yuan or 8.47 percent compared to that of the  previous year. The per capita income of the province's farmers  could reach 670 yuan, an increase of 97 yuan or 16.9 percent  compared to the previous year. Third, market-oriented  agriculture developed rather rapidly, and the proportions of  high-quality agricultural products increased. The problem of  surplus agricultural products was fundamentally solved. The  entire province's total cultivated area of high-grade rice was  9.31 million mu, an increase of 2.64 million mu compared to the  previous year. In seven counties and cities, 1 million mu of  high-yield and high-efficiency demonstration zones for  high-grade rice cultivation were established. The production at  these demonstration zones was generally 30 percent higher than  that of nondemonstration zones.    The tasks for elevating our province's agriculture to a new  stage in 1994 and the preliminary production goals for principal  agricultural products this year included: 25 billion kg in  total grain production; 6 million dan of cotton; 31.20 million  dan of edible oil; 1.42 million tons of meat; 13 million mu of  high-grade rice cultivation area; and the proportion of  herbivorous animals and poultry to reach about 16 percent of the  total agricultural output.</p>

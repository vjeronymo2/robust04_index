			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the National Assembly created a  Commission of Banking Operations that will prevent Nicaragua  from becoming a haven for money-laundering by large drug  cartels. The creation of this commission is discussed in  Article 21 of the draft anti-drug bill on which debate continued  yesterday in a full session of the legislature.    In the past two years, Nicaragua has been the victim of a  strong assault by the drug cartels that want to overrun our  territory, taking advantage of the current economic situation to  institutionalize the laundering of drug money.    Article 23, which was approved yesterday, says, ``The  commission's goal is to study the different techniques and  methods used to carry out all banking, financial, or related  operations that facilitate the legitimization of capital derived  from illegal activities.''    According to this bill, banks--private as well as  state-owned--must report to the commission any deposit whose  total amount surpasses $10,000 in operations conducted by any  single client.    If a person or institution is being investigated for  suspicion of money-laundering, the bill mandates that the  individual is not entitled to any banking or fiscal secrecy  whatsoever. Banks are obligated to reveal to the respective  authorities all bank accounts of individuals being investigated  in cases concerning drug-trafficking or the laundering of money  or valuable objects.    The aforementioned commission will comprise a banking law  specialist, an auditor, an expert in marketing, and a member of  the National Police Commission on Economic Crimes.    The anti-drug bill moved closer to passage yesterday in the  wake of a great deal of pressure being exerted by the police and  the U.S. Embassy itself, as was disclosed by Congresswoman Doris  Tijerino.</p>

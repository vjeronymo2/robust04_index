			<p>BFN     [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS, 25/06/1994 -- "It seems that the  Council of Europe [CE] representatives either do not completely  understand the situation in the southern districts or follows  someone's command, as during the negotiations in Comrat they  emphasized that Gagauzians are not a nation and that human  rights are superior to nationalities' rights," states a  communique of the Gagauz Supreme Soviet and President. The  communique states that the CE experts said that Gagauzians  cannot assume priority over other national minorities that live  in Moldova: they believe that Gagauzians can receive only  cultural autonomy. The CE experts agreed with the Gagauz  Parliamentary Commission on the 12 articles of the draft law on  the "Gaguz Eri" project. The law's preamble and Articles 1, 2,  and 12 on the Gagauzians' self-determination and Gagauz Eri  self-administration as well as the prerogatives of the local  administration were discussed. The CE recommendations are  juridical amendments that were accepted by the Gagauz side. The  communique states that the "meeting in Comrat was productive.  However, as a result of the negotiations held with the CE  representatives the conclusion can be drawn that an unjustified  delay in settling the Gagauz problem is again imposed due to  Moldovan officials that create artificial barriers and deceive  not only the Moldovan public but the international organizations  as well." It is obviously Moldova's wish to enter the CE without  resolving political problems, but the Gagauz issue impedes the  fulfillment of this wish: that is why spirits are again stirred  around a problem that should have been settled long ago, states  the communique.</p>

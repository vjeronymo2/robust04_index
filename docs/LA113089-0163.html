			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ICAHN ASKS OK TO ACQUIRE 25% OF USX CORP.;  </P> <P> TAKEOVERS: THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THE CORPORATE RAIDER HAS ASKED TO INCREASE  HIS STAKE IN THE OIL, GAS AND STEEL CONCERN.  </P> <P> Investor Carl C. Icahn disclosed Wednesday that he is requesting federal  approval to acquire at least 25% of USX Corp.  </P> <P> In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn revealed that he  was seeking permission from the Federal Trade Commission to increase his stake  in the Pittsburgh-based oil, gas and steel concern.  </P> <P> Federal Trade Commission antitrust clearance for such an acquisition is  required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.  </P> <P> According to the SEC filing, which was released after the stock market closed,  Icahn owned nearly 34 million, or 13.26%, of USX's outstanding shares of common  stock.  </P> <P> Icahn, known for his past corporate takeover attempts, also owns Trans World  Airlines Inc.  </P> <P> USX finished down 12.5 cents at $33.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The SEC document noted that last November, Icahn made a Hart-Scott-Rodino  filing indicating his intention to acquire more than 15% of USX's voting  securities "and, depending upon market conditions, more than 25%" of its voting  securities.  </P> <P> But because his group did not acquire in excess of 15% within a year, a new  filing is required to permit acquisition above 15%, said the filing, known as a  13-D.  </P> <P> USX spokesman William Kessler said the company was aware of Icahn's filing but  had no comment.  </P> <P> He said Icahn made similar requests in late 1987 and late 1988 but never  boosted his stake to the amount requested within the allotted year. "This is  the third time he's filed," Kessler said. "This is a renewable thing."  </P></p>

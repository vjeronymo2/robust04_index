The international convention on biological diversity agreed  upon at the Earth Summit in the Brazilian capital, Rio de  Janerio, 18 months ago came into effect yesterday. Under the  agreement, companies will have to pay royalties to states or  nations if they want access to native plants and animals. Jim  Divine of the Association of Forest Industries says that by any  international standard, Australia's forest practices are a model  of sustainability.    [Begin Divine recording] With more than 100 years  of operation, managed forest logging in this country has not  resulted in any extinction or loss of a single animal or plant  species. The other thing is the fact that we are working to  sustain the yield patterns and we are working in less than one  percent of the forest to (?state) annually [End  recording].    State governments are expected to start work in the new year  on a new strategy to preserve the nation's genetic material.  The strategy is the first step towards implementing the  international biodiversity agreement. Under the agreement,  companies will be forced to pay royalties to states or nations  if they want access to native plants and animals. The worldwide  fund for nature which took part in the negotiations says the  agreement will help ensure biological resources are used  sustainably. A consultant for the organization, Alistair  Graham, says its now up to the states to work out royalties.    [Begin Graham recording] It will be state  governments who can be expected to assert proprietor ownership  of wild biological resources and they are the ones that would  have the commercial interest to negotiate such royalty or rental  payments. And it will be up to them and it has to be said that  on the basis of past experience on royalties of minerals or  wood, they may not do very well. But at least the opportunity  is there [End recording].</p>

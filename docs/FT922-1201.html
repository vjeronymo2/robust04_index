			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Arts: The Montreal Symphony Orchestra This fine orchestra returned to London for two concerts, one on South Bank and one at the Barbican. The Saturday-evening Festival Hall programme had to be changed and its piano concerto (the Beethoven First) removed, when Martha Argerich fought shy of a London appearance yet again. The replacements - Ibert's Escales and the Shostakovich Ninth Symphony - consoled any disappointment; indeed, in showing off the strength of the orchestra's 15-year-old partnership with Charles Dutoit, the new first-half bill of fare may even be accounted preferable to the old. Not often does one encounter such balanced orchestral playing, not often such a natural-seeming interchange of ideas between conductor and orchestra. I guessed that the substitute works had been well routined earlier on the Montreal's current European tour, for both works came across with effortless clarity and a feeling of disciplined spontaneity impossible to counterfeit. In particular, the Shostakovich symphony, a Haydn-like work that conceals its seriousness beneath a disconcertingly impudent surface, was delivered with an ideal knack of knowing where to put on the pressure, where to relax it. Hints of deeper things were just that: hints, not nudges. This is not an orchestra of instantly identifiable stamp, not a Czech or Berlin Philharmonic. In Daphnis and Chloe after the interval, the playing of the Montreal Symphony was, again, excellently clear and purposeful (and well-blended with the voices of the London Symphony Chorus). Here, however, I felt a want of thrill in the music, of lyrical inspiration in the timbres and phrasing. In Ravel, as indeed in so much of the French music he conducts, Dutoit keeps a cool head. His scrupulously unsensational approach is admirable as far as it goes - which, in the heady exhilaration of the finale, was just not far enough. The marvel was that when the players made the transition to the Barbican Hall on Monday, they still sounded a great orchestra. This is not often the case and it is a tribute to the beautiful tone quality and the orchestra's unfailing sense of balance that its class shines through in difficult acoustics. Above all, they were never tempted into playing too loudly, a regular misjudgement in this hall. Charles Dutoit likes to keep the orchestra's sound neat and trim, preferring quality to quantity of decibels. In their performance of Falla's El sombrero de tres picos given in its complete form as the full ballet, the very precision of the ensemble brought its own sparkle to the score. Jill Gomez was the expert vocal soloist. The other work in the programme was Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony and here excellence in matters technical just managed to outweigh some lack of dark, tragic, Russian passion. Dutoit gave us a very civilised view of Tchaikovsky, presenting as it were his public face with French elegance and immaculate etiquette, rather than the tormented soul of the private man. The last movement, however, had plenty of dash. Dutoit and the Montreal make a truly first-class team.</p>

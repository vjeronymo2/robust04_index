			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A proposal too far for directors Sir, I read with interest the proposals concealed within the article 'Risks for directors grow', by Graham Maw (Survey on International Legal Services, January 25), which go further than the Cadbury report. As a practising and, I hope, professional chief executive, I am increasingly concerned at the range and number of bodies and committees giving well-intentioned advice to me. There will be so many checks and balances that there will be no room for progress. In particular, I do not agree with Mr Maw that a remuneration committee should be wholly non-executive. I am in the best position to know the detail of my subordinates' performance and I wish to have a direct say in their salary and other rewards. The Cadbury recommendation for a remuneration committee to be 'wholly or mainly' non-executive provides for me to be a member of that committee. Inveresk supports both the spirit and the letter of Cadbury, but not further. Has Mr Maw, I wonder, experienced the pressures of the real commercial world? S G Kay, managing director, Inveresk, Inveresk House, 3 Pitreavie Court, South Pitreavie Business Park, Dunfermline, Fife KY11 5PU</p>

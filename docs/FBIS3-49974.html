The present UNPROFOR commander, Fin Saermark Tomsen,  and the chief-of-staff of the Macedonian Army were also present  at the meeting. They all discussed the cooperation between the  UN peace keeping forces in Macedonia with the local authorities.    General Tellefsen stated the following for the press: "This  meeting was the first one between myself and the Macedonian  defense minister and was of great significance for the future  stay of UN troops in Macedonia. It is our wish to establish an  as close as possible cooperation with the Macedonian Government.  My first impressions of Macedonia are excellent. I like the  country, and my future job is a great challenge. I believe  contacts and cooperation will continue as before. To my  knowledge, UNPROFOR forces in Macedonia, led by General Tomsen,  have so far made extraordinary good contacts and cooperation.  There will be no changes in attitude towards the relations on  my part, I even hope to be able to give personal contribution to  their further development. According to the plan, I am to stay  for a whole year in Macedonia. Having in mind the fact that the  overall situation is improving and the fact that establish  relations are very good, I believe it will be a pleasant year in  your country."    After the talks, Minister Popovski said they had discussed  previous results of the peacekeeping mission and agreed they  were positive from aspects of the political effects and the  operative tasks of the mission. UN troops will stay in  Macedonia for a longer period, since the process of calming down  of the crisis in former Yugoslavia will last for a long time.  They agreed to continue the previous successful cooperation  between the Macedonian authorities and the UNPROFOR Command.  Working meetings are scheduled for as early as today.    Now that the Republic of Macedonia is internationally  recognized, borders are considerably safer and the situation in  the country is more stable, Minister Popovski stated.    The official transfer of duties between Generals Tomsen and  Tellefsen will take place 25 January.</p>

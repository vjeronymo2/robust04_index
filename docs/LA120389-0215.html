			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS CITE 'VILLAINS' IN VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES  </P> <P> The campaign against the cosmetics industry's use of animals in product safety  testing is just one aspect of what has been dubbed the "animal rights  movement."  </P> <P> Some animal protection groups have also campaigned against the use of animals  in tests designed to ensure the safety of other consumer products; food  additives and cleansers among them.  </P> <P> The activists' positions range from demands for better lab conditions to calls  for setting all animals free. The tactics have ranged from letter writing and  peaceful picketing organized by groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment  of Animals and In Defense of Animals to the burglary and acts of violence  linked to the Animal Liberation Front.  </P> <P> Animal rights groups have enlisted the help of many celebrities: Doris Day, Bob  Barker and Candace Bergen among them.  </P> <P> Following is a brief list of other animal rights activities.  </P> <P> The Fur Trade: Animal rights activists have long opposed the trapping, killing  and -- in some cases -- the raising of animals for the fur trade.  </P> <P> Medical Research: Some animal protection groups say medical researchers make  excessive use of animals in their search for cures and treatments for diseases  and illnesses. How much animal pain, they ask, is necessary for progress? Some  oppose all testing of animals for biomedical research.  </P> <P> Agriculture: Some animal rights activists contend that many family and  corporate farms maintain animals in brutal conditions from birth to butchering.  They call for reforms. Others oppose eating meat and actively campaign for  vegetarianism. GEORGE WHITE  </P></p>

Copenhagen Public Prosecutor Hanne Bech Hansen has decided  not to charge former Interior Minister Britta Schall Holberg,  former chief medical officer and chief of the Public Health  Administration Soren K. Sorensen, and Public Health  Administration department chief Jens Overo in the case of  HIV-tainted hemophiliac medication.    The public prosecutor found no evidence for bringing charges  and this seems to exhaust the possibilities for the Danish  Hemophiliac Society to hold anyone personally liable for the  fact that 89 hemophiliacs were infected with HIV-tainted blood  products in the mid-1980's.    The Hemophiliac Society called the public prosecutor's  decision ``sad, unfortunate, and incomprehensible.''    The society had reported the three for quackery, negligent  manslaughter, and causing considerable damage to body and health.    ``In order to prove that anyone is criminally liable it must  be possible to establish that the hemophiliacs referred to in  the report were given the infected blood after the three people  named there became aware of the risk.    ``There is no evidence in the case to establish this,'' the  public prosecutor wrote the hemophiliac society in her decision.    ``This decision is sad in many ways. Partly because we will  probably never be able to assign personal responsibility and  partly because in the future these three people will now be able  to state that they had no responsibility. This will evoke strong  feelings among hemophiliacs,'' said the chairman of the Danish  Hemophiliac Society, Terkel Andersen.    In her reasons for the rejection Hansen referred among other  things to a judicial review of the case prepared by superior  court judge Niels Johan Pedersen. But according to the  hemophiliac society the review deals solely with the period  after 1 January 1986, while the society's citation concerned the  time before that.    ``The review is exclusively descriptive as far as the period  before 1 January 1986 is concerned--it was not part of the  judge's commission to express an opinion about the course of  events prior to that date,'' Andersen said.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. EXECUTIVES TOO PAROCHIAL, SURVEY FINDS  </P> <P> U.S. corporations will continue to lose ground to foreign competitors in world  markets because of shortcomings in the nation's executive ranks and the rest of  its work force, according to a major new study.  </P> <P> The report -- based on a survey of about 1,500 top managers worldwide by  executive recruiters Korn/Ferry International and the Columbia University  business school -- faulted Americans for minimizing the value of learning  foreign languages and cultures. Executives in Japan, Western Europe and Latin  America, on the other hand, were found to place a high priority on  multilingualism.  </P> <P> "These results," said the report, "provide a poignant indication of national  differences that promise to influence profoundly the success of American  corporations. The insularity of U.S. attitudes toward international business  and international communications . . . points to a continuation of America's  lagging competitiveness.  </P> <P> "By discounting the importance of an international outlook, of multilingualism  and of foreign assignments," the report continued, "our U.S. respondents gave  expression to a parochialism that can only inhibit opportunity."  </P> <P> The study, which projected economic conditions in the year 2000, said that a  shortage of U.S. senior managers prepared to run global businesses will  translate into "the highest level of executive turnover in history."  </P> <P> "The shortage of talented executives with the abilities and background  necessary to run global businesses will soon become a major theme of human  resource management, and human resource management will become the most  significant challenge facing business," the study said.  </P> <P> According to the study, only 2% of U.S. executives believe that knowledge of  foreign languages will be a very important business factor in 2000. Among  Japanese executives, the figure was 13% -- despite the fact that their foreign  language skills, in general, already surpass those of their American  counterparts, the authors of the study said.  </P> <P> However, Warren Bennis, a USC business professor who has written books on  executive leadership, said the study's assessment on that score does not square  with what he has found at most of the nation's largest companies.  </P> <P> "I see tremendous change in the mind-set of executives at top companies about  the importance of international understanding and language skills," Bennis  said, "and that awareness is increasing all the time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Coming Up Short'  </P> <P> Americans responding to the survey, who accounted for 44% of those polled,  expressed more concern about the quality of the U.S. work force than in top  executives' foreign language skills. Asked to predict their competitive  advantages in the year 2000, only 4.8% of the Americans cited "availability of  qualified personnel." In contrast, 9.3% of the Japanese respondents saw their  country's labor pool as an important future asset.  </P> <P> "American education, training and development are seen as coming up short in  the business world," the report said.  </P> <P> In another section of the report, the respondents -- representing corporations  that produce about 10% of the world's goods and services -- said they believe  that the United States' economic and political power will decline substantially  during the next decade. For example, 69.5% said the United States was the most  economically powerful nation in 1988, but only 45.2% believe that it still will  be in 2000.  </P> <P> Even so, the United States came out narrowly ahead of Japan as the nation most  likely to be the world's economic leader in 2000. The study found that 39.8% of  the executives believe that Japan will hold that position at the beginning of  the next century.  </P> <P> "This means that we are in for several decades of shared leadership in the  business world," said Lester Korn, chairman of Los Angeles-based Korn/Ferry.  "That would mean more joint ventures by multinational corporations."  </P> <P> Japan will be gaining economic ground in world markets over the next 11 years,  according to the respondents. However, Japanese executives believe that they  are likely to lose some of their domestic market to foreign firms, according to  the study. Of all the nationalities represented in the survey, Japanese  executives expressed the most concern about the prospect of competition on the  home front.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: S African insurance group rises to R81m SOUTHERN Life, South Africa's second largest listed insurance company, increased attributable profits by 18.5 per cent to R81m (Dollars 27m) in the six months to September. Net premium income rose to R1.15bn from R953.2m during the same period in 1991. Net investment income, however, fell to R530.8m from R542.6m. Mr Jan Calitz, managing director, attributed this to lower interest rates and minimal growth in dividends from share investments. The rise in total income was limited to a 12 per cent increase, to R1.68bn from R1.49bn. Attributable profits rose to R81m from R68.3m, equivalent to 48 cents a share against 40.5 cents. The interim dividend was lifted to 32 cents per share from 27 cents. Mr Calitz said the company had continued its practice of setting interim earnings and dividend figures at 50 per cent of the previous year's total. Full actuarial valuations were undertaken at the end of each year. Total assets rose 6.3 per cent to R17.5bn from R16.4bn. The figures reflect the recent weak performance of the South African stock market. New business totalled R511m, a 39 per cent rise over the 1991 first half. Single premium business accounted for R299m and new recurring business for R212m.</p>

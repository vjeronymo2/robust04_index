			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gary Alfonso in Ulundi] </F>   [Text] [Alfonso] We have moved in from the chilly air  outside and of course, the well known backdrop of the statue of  King Shaka, but I'm sure this new backdrop is not entirely  displeasing. It's of course the tusk of the old Indlovu, which  is elephant, in Zulu. To get back to what we are actually  supposed to be talking about, we had a talk to Dr. Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader a short while  ago and we asked him about his impressions after this election  and he said he had some anxieties about the few days ahead.    [Begin Buthelezi recording] ...I think the latter. I'm very  anxious. I mean if I look at what has happened, you know,  during the elections in some...[pauses] with irregularities that  have taken place, now in my mind I sort of wonder whether -- are  you going to have any of that, any things that are hanky panky  when it comes to counting and so on of the elections. So I've  got that anxiety about it because of what has happened during  elections in some parts of KwaZulu. I'm not implying that it  happened everywhere. [end recording]    [Alfonso] Well the IFP leader there called it hanky panky,  but there's no doubt that there has been some disorganized  action here in the KwaZulu-Natal region, especially in these  rural parts. This morning, of course, they had to move the  ballot boxes from Ulundi to Nongoma because of possible  political irregularities which some parties had raised with the  IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. The boxes were moved,  but once they got to Nongoma they were also delivered at the  wrong venue and only about 30 minutes ago they actually started  counting at the correct venue in Nongoma, where the IEC  officials are overseeing the whole process. We are not entirely  sure exactly when the totals will come out, but what we do know  is that the district electoral officer, Mrs. Crystal Williams,  has told us that it might even take up to tomorrow evening.    And on another possible point of interest, we've heard that  the IFP leader, Mr. Buthelezi, has been told either by his  office staff or possibly a medical opinion, to take a rest and  he is sitting out at his home in Mahlabatini and having a look,  of course, at what is possibly the outcome on the channel where  it happens.</p>

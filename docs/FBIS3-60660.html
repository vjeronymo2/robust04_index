			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] Hans Blix, secretary general of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], has stated in a report on Iran's  nuclear activities that there is no cause for concern and that  the Islamic Republic of Iran does not intend to make nonpeaceful  use of nuclear energy.    The IAEA secretary general's report was submitted after  studies were made by a delegation sent to Iran by the agency.  In Khordad [month ending 21 June] Hans Blix stated that the  Islamic Republic of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA was perfect  and that there was no proof that Iran was using nuclear material  for nonpeaceful purposes.    The IAEA's inspection and report on Iran's nuclear  activities  took place within the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Pact and agreements between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the  IAEA. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact is a worldwide agreement  that was approved in 1968 to prevent the proliferation of  nuclear arms in the world. Under this pact, nuclear countries  have refrained from transferring nuclear arms and technology to  other countries, while nonnuclear countries have accepted not to  attempt to attain nuclear arms. The IAEA has been assigned the  job of supervising the implementation of the pact. By signing  agreements with various countries, the IAEA monitors the nuclear  installations and activities of countries in a bid to prevent  the nonpeaceful use of nuclear energy.    The IAEA's view, which has been stated at a time when Iran  is  being accused of trying to gain access to nuclear arms, is very  significant. Even though the Islamic Republic of Iran is a  member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact and emphasizes the  peaceful use of nuclear energy, there has been a wave of  propaganda on Iran's intentions and efforts to acquire nuclear  arms.    This propaganda, which is mainly being disseminated by  America, is aimed more at inflicting pressure and sanctions on  Iran rather than at preventing nuclear proliferation. America  has resorted to this accusation on several occasions and has  called on its allies to review their relations with Iran.    But while revealing that there is no basis for the false  propaganda against Iran, the remarks by the IAEA secretary  general as an impartial and international source showed that  Iran does not intend to make nonpeaceful use of nuclear energy  and that its activities to acquire nuclear energy are within the  framework of international pacts that grant this right to every  country.</p>

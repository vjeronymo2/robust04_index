			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / EU industry concerned at competition: Round Table seeks to stop drain of jobs to US, Asia Europe's top industrialists yesterday called for a campaign to reduce public spending, speed privatisation, and improve education and training, in order to prevent the drain of jobs and wealth to the US and Asia. In a hard-hitting report issued ahead of next month's European summit in Essen, the European Round Table said it was an illusion to believe that economic recovery signalled an end to Europe's competitiveness crisis. 'This is a dangerous conclusion. The need to improve long-term competitiveness in order to generate job opportunities through sustained growth remains as important as ever,' the report says. The ERT groups 40 top industrialists from such companies as Bayer, BP, Fiat, ICI, Philips, Siemens, and Unilever. Its seven-page report makes several recommendations to force competitiveness to the top of the EU's political agenda: The creation of a Competitiveness Advisory Group. The forum would be drawn from business and trade unions, and would offer an independent assessment of industry's performance in global markets. The appointment of a European commissioner for competitiveness charged with filtering proposals for EU-wide legislation. The idea would be to halt directives deemed to damage businesses' ability to compete internationally. Investing - not consuming - the 'recovery dividend'. Public finances must be put on a sound footing, the burden of the public sector must be lifted, and the proposed CO energy tax scrapped, says the report. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, and Viscount Etienne Davignon, chairman of the Societe Generale de Belgique, presented the ERT report to Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission, yesterday. Mr Delors was said to have given a favourable response. Sir Denys said Europe could not afford to slacken efforts to bolster its competitiveness, despite the economic recovery. 'We are, so to speak, at the point of maximum danger, where people often let loose (on costs).' Sir Denys warned that EU trade with the rest of the world had failed to keep pace with intra-EU trade. Energy costs to European industry were at least 30 per cent higher than in the US; tax levels in Europe were 46 per cent of GDP, as opposed to 31 per cent in the US and 34 per cent in Japan. Despite a general wariness about state subsidies and public spending, the ERT report gave a cautious welcome to the Trans-European networks, the billion-dollar infrastructure projects expected to span Europe in the 21st century. Viscount Davignon urged Europe's leaders to examine the projects seriously at the Essen summit on December 9 and 10. In response to sceptics in the British and German governments worried about financing the projects, Mr Davignon said: 'We should not make this a point of principle. We should have a debate on a project - not on a concept.' Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

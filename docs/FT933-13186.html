			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Former Eni chief Cagliari found dead in prison MR GABRIELE CAGLIARI, the former chairman of Eni, Italy's state oil concern, was found dead in a Milan jail after magistrates refused to release him on bail. Mr Cagliari was facing charges of corruption and illicit financing of political parties. Mr Paolo Liguori, a close friend of the family and editor of Il Giorno, the daily newspaper owned by Eni, said Mr Cagliari, aged 67, had committed suicide after 133 days in prison. He had been found alone in his cell with a plastic bag tied round his head with a shoelace. He died of a heart attack in the prison hospital after he failed to respond to artificial respiration. Mr Francesco Saverio Borelli, the Milan attorney-general, said the former Eni chairman had left behind several letters from which 'there emerges a precise intent to commit suicide and thus on the nature of his death there should be no doubt'. If suicide is confirmed, it would be the ninth since Italian magistrates began investigating corruption in February 1992. Mr Cagliari's death shocked the political establishment and immediately stoked a debate, initiated on July 8 by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, on the abuses of the system of preventive detention. Milan magistrates in particular have used preventive detention as a means of extracting confessions from suspects. Mr Cagliari was arrested in March for alleged corruption concerning the payment of bribes on a power station contract won by an Eni subsidiary. However, it soon became clear the magistrates wished to question him about his period as chairman of Eni since 1989, convinced that the state oil concern was a significant source of illicit funding for political parties. He was refused bail on five occasions, the most recent three days ago, even though he had admitted knowing about bribes being paid at Eni. According to Mr Vittorio D'Aiello, his lawyer, he still refused to incriminate friends and colleagues. Mr Cagliari, a distinguished engineer, had extensive international experience in the oil and chemicals industries. Although a political appointment of Mr Bettino Craxi when he was Socialist leader, he had had a long career in Eni. When it became a public company last August, he was forced to the sidelines as titular head. The magistrates were reported to be pressing Mr Cagliari for details of the reorganisation of the chemicals industry and the purchase by Eni of Montedison's stake in their joint venture, Enimont. Alleged kick-backs and illicit share deals in the 1989-90 Enimont affair are also central to the interrogation of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former Ferruzzi-Montedison chief executive, who was extradited from Switzerland last week.

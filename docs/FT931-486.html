			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MoD revives Pounds 170m helicopter carrier plan THE GOVERNMENT yesterday threw a lifeline to Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipyard, by reviving plans for a specialised naval helicopter carrier, expected to cost about Pounds 170m. The carrier emerged as a prime candidate for cancellation earlier this year in order to help the Ministry of Defence meet the budget cuts imposed in last November's public expenditure settlement. After intensive lobbying by naval chiefs and by Swan Hunter, Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said yesterday in a written parliamentary answer that the MoD was keeping the carrier in its programme and expected to place an order later this year. However, he said tenderers had been asked to 'clarify' their bids. He also warned that the ministry would apply 'normal technical and value-for-money criteria' in deciding the contract award. Swan Hunter, which has no naval shipbuilding work on its books beyond next year, is relying heavily on the order to maintain its 2,200 jobs. But it will have to compete against the VSEL yard at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, which envisages buying the hull from the Norwegian-owned Kvaerner Govan commercial shipyard on Clydeside. Both bids were submitted last October. Mr Alex Marsh, joint group chief executive of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, said it was excellent news, both for the Royal Navy and Swan Hunter. Swan Hunter now faces a bitter fight for the order, worth around Pounds 170m, from VSEL, which has linked with Govan on the Clyde to tender for the landing platform helicopter. 'Quite clearly we intend to win this competition,' said Mr Marsh. 'We'll win it by taking advantage of our excellent track record in building ships of this type.' Mr Marsh has described the order as 'absolutely critical' for Swan Hunter, which has a blank order book after 1994. The company, which employs 2,200, has spent Pounds 1.5m on its bid. The decision means that the MoD will have to make cuts elsewhere in its equipment programme.</p>

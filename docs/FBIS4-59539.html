			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, the minister  of oil and mineral resources, has confirmed that Yemeni oil  production and (?refining) operations have not been affected, in  spite of the violent fighting going on in our country. Brother  Bin-Husaynun, who is currently visiting a number of Arab  capitals, said that the production of oil from the Ma'rib,  Shabwah, and Hadramawt fields was proceeding normally, and that  the oil installations have not been subjected to any attacks.  He pointed out that defense precautions had been taken to  prevent sabotage operations and repulse any attacks.    He said that oil was a resource belonging to all the Yemeni  people. The forces of the bloody al-Ahmar gang should avoid any  attacks on these installations.</p>

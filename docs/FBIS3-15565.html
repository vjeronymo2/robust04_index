The press service said that "Abkhazian and North Caucasian  units continue to terrorize" civilians in the Gali and other  districts of Abkhazia and carry out brazen raids on villages  along the Inguri River.    Earlier today, the Abkhazian Defence Ministry accused  Georgian military commanders of making preparations for a new  aggression.    The Ministry said in a statement that between February 24  and  March 6 Georgian military commanders had moved paramilitary  Mkhedrioni and White Eagle units and military hardware from  central Georgia to the Zugdidi district. Meanwhile, Georgian  secret services continue sending out saboteurs and terrorists to  Abkhazia.    Abkhazia will take all necessary measures to give an  adequate  response to these activities. All responsibility for their  possible consequences will rest with the Georgian side, the  statement said.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Property: Prices start the long climb back - But don't expect anything more than a gentle recovery from recession With not a property bear in sight in 1994, happy days are here again. Or such is the gospel according to every Knight, Savill, Strutt and Wood. But is it believable? Will prices really rise by 19 per cent across the country and 25 per cent in the best parts of London as Yolande Barnes, head of Savills' residential research, prophesied before Christmas? Certainly, gloom and bust vanished last year. The property scene turned from late autumn 1992, when foreign buyers set the central London market rolling. Spotting prices way below the peaks of 1988-89, plus a low pound, political stability and a country that looked to be the first in the EU to be coming out of recession, they bought houses and flats galore. In no time, agents were claiming they did not have enough to sell. Last year was an odd one, partly because buying carried on into the winter but did not then follow the usual pattern of trading peaks in spring and autumn. January and February were surprisingly good, says Trevor Abrahamson of Glentree Estates, which sells in the prime parts of the north-west London suburbs. So was August. In between, fears about the March budget stifled the winter improvement and stopped potential vendors from selling. Then, the government seemed to lose its grip - another blow to vendors' confidence. Not surprisingly, June was poor. And it all happened again in the autumn. While the market during summer showed continuing signs of recovery, the second Budget in November became a convenient excuse for putting off any decision about selling until the spring. At least there is no looming Budget to upset confidence this year - but the tax increases and VAT on household energy could prove a problem. Another twist to 1993 was the high number of repossessions caused by the recession, along with houses which stayed on the market. These were sold eventually, often at auctions - which became a regular way of selling batches of properties. By the end of the year, prices had stabilised on average around the country, and risen in London (7 per cent according to Abrahamson). Bold vendors had a good chance of getting their asking prices if these were reasonable. But ask too much and buyers shy away, however much money they have. For some good, highly desirable houses, the asking price has come down. Eilean Aigas, the island domain in the Beauly river in Scotland, is now Pounds 600,000 (down from Pounds 800,000); and Kingsmead in north Wiltshire, which has a topiary tree house in the garden, is Pounds 950,000 (originally, Pounds 1.2m). All the same, there is still a large imbalance between demand and supply. That is the key to 1994, and justifies the bulls' forecasts of higher prices. Take two Surrey houses, priced at Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 850,000, which had failed to sell for four years. Their owners were then offered the full amounts - but have withdrawn them from the market to wait for a better price this year. Surrey, which led the market into recession, seems now to be pulling it out again - no wonder Barnes' forecast is so cheery. But Yorkshire is sceptical. Tim Blenkin of Blenkin &amp; Co., Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's associate in York, 'verges on the positive side of neutral.' He points out that Yorkshire thrift meant prices there fell less than elsewhere during the recession because local people did not have to sell to raise cash. Likewise, they will rise less. I see a general picture of moderate cheer. Of course, conditions are excellent. It is 15 years since houses have been so affordable, especially for first-time buyers who can obtain attractive packages. Mortgage interest rates and inflation are low and - much more important - look set to stay so. A fixed-rate mortgage gives certainty in financial planning for five years at a time. And, with unemployment down, job security looks less chancy. Memories are strong, though. If Christmas sales were not what retailers had expected, buyers will not be stampeded into paying over the odds for homes, either. The prices paid in 1988-89 are still on the far horizon, but they will occur in 1994 as isolated peaks. Large end-of-year bonuses have given City workers the power to bid aggressively. That will create a pull from the top which 'could start a bush fire,' according to Tommy de Mallet Morgan of Savills' Guildford office. (London taxi drivers would agree. Their business, always one of the first things to suffer in bad times, has picked up). This competition will raise prices and make more vendors eager to sell, buy elsewhere and commission builders (if they need them) before they put up their prices - as they are bound to do now they are getting more jobs. If we are out of the valley and on the up, with the prospect of some real increases in value, I still expect wide variations across the country. Those who have waited can probably ask now that bit more: Pounds 275,000, say, rather than Pounds 250,000. (Abrahamson expects a general rise of 10 per cent). If the money goes on a move to Wales from Surrey, that buys a considerable house. It will not be a boom and it will not be a bust. In most of the country, the rise will be a gentle ascent. Supply will give way to demand; it must. But not overnight.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mexico City, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Catholic Church  authorities have reported that the Mexican Catholic hierarchy  accepted a request from Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for  peace in Chiapas, to promote peace in that southeastern state.    Today, Ramon Godinez Flores, secretary general of the  Mexican  Bishops Conference, said the Catholic hierarchy will prepare a  campaign with "positive" messages directed at the people of  Chiapas to overcome "obstacles" in the pacification process.    Camacho Solis announced in a news conference that he had  asked the Mexican bishops for their cooperation to break the  "vicious circle" that might "undermine" the pacification  mechanism. After meeting privately with the members of the  pro-Chiapas commission of the Bishops Conference, Camacho Solis  said, without going into detail, that the "obstacles" and  "vicious circle" in the reconciliation and pacification process  in Chiapas must be overcome. [passage omitted]    Godinez said Camacho Solis asked the bishops to send  messages  of peace and harmony to the people of Chiapas with the objective  of fomenting reconciliation and making the EZLN [Zapatist  National Liberation Army] more receptive [sensibilizacion] to  the Catholic hierarchy.    Godinez added that during the seven and one-half hour long  meeting, Camacho Solis refused to mention dates for the  resumption of the dialogue with the EZLN. Godinez also said the  bishops see the positive side of the continuation of the virtual  cease-fire.    The meeting with Camacho Solis was also attended by Vatican  Ambassador Geronimo Prigione and SBmuel Ruiz, mediator in the  peace dialogue and bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, a  Chiapas city located 1,200 km east of the Mexican capital. The  meeting was presided by Adolfo Suarez Rivera, president of the  bishops conference, who reiterated the Catholic clergy's  willingness to support the peace process in Chiapas.</p>

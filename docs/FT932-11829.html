			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Switch in oils by US funds LARGE switching from Shell Transport to British Petroleum by US funds was responsible for driving the latter sharply higher against the market and leaving Shell languishing. The switching included one block of 5m Shell shares traded at 568 1/2 p and several large lines of BP at 282 1/2 p. At the close, BP was 4 higher at 285 1/2 p after keen turnover of 8.6m, while Shell was 3 1/2 off at 550 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 9.6m, the highest single day's business since November last year. BP shares, among the Footsie's best performers since the turn of the year, have come back sharply in the past couple of weeks, reflecting the steep rise in sterling. BP announced recently that US investors now speak for more than 25 per cent of the company's shares.</p>

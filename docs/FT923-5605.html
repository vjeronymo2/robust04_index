			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Latest forecast of economic growth THE LATEST forecast of economic growth from the Confederation of British Industry indicates that gross domestic product will fall for a second consecutive year and recover only feebly in 1993. The projected fall in GDP of 1 per cent for this year is more gloomy than the most recent consensus from City and academic economists, which forecasts output to fall by 0.5 per cent. Government borrowing is expected to reach Pounds 32bn this financial year and Pounds 38bn in 1993-94. The rate of growth of imports is forecast to remain strong but to slow next year. Improved export performance, however, should mean the trade deficit does not worsen significantly next year. The outlook for manufacturing is unpromising, with the CBI projecting a mild contraction in the second half of this year. According to the CBI the fourth quarter is likely to mark the trough in output.</p>

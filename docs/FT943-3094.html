It has taken equity stakes and forged other links with medium-sized financial institutions in Mexico, Chile, the Philippines and Thailand. It is in the process of finalising a deal with Idris Hydraulic, a Malaysian financial-services group. Mr Peter Godsoe, Scotiabank's chief executive, said the bank was committed to 'maintaining and building on the international diversity of our operations, and we expect the rate of economic growth in Latin America and the Pacific rim to provide us with solid returns'.</p>

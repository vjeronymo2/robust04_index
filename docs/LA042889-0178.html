			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCIENCE;  </P> <P> 'NICOTINE PATCH' USED TO KICK HABIT  </P> <P> More than three-quarters of the people trying to quit smoking were able to do  so with the help of nicotine patches in a study at the Mayo Clinic, researchers  reported today.  </P> <P> In a six-week study that started last fall, 77% of the people who wore nicotine  patches had stopped smoking, said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Mayo  Clinic's Smoking Cessation Center and one of the investigators.  </P> <P> The silver-dollar-sized patches slowly release nicotine through the skin to the  bloodstream. A control group in the study wore patches not treated with  nicotine, and 39% of them quit smoking.  </P> <P> While cautioning that a long-term follow-up study is needed, Hurt said the  patch could be a "remarkable advancement" as a tool for helping people stop  smoking.  </P></p>

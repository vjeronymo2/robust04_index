			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Polystyrene recycling plant LINPAC Plastics International, the food packaging group, has opened the first polystyrene recycling plant in Europe with a capacity to process 2,500 tonnes of waste. The 21,000 sq ft plant based near Macclesfield, Cheshire, will collect polystyrene packaging waste from fast-food restaurants and local authorities and reuse it for multi-layer polystyrene-foam egg cartons. Linpac is investigating other applications in products such as office accessories, building insulation and horticultural trays. The UK uses about 200,000 tonnes of polystyrene a year.</p>

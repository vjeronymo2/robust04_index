			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER STRIKE TALKS HANG UP ON PAY ISSUE  </P> <P> Negotiators in the 5-day-old Los Angeles teachers' strike resumed talks Friday  in hope that schools could be back to normal by Monday, but there was no sign  of a breakthrough and officials said pay hikes remain the big sticking point.  </P> <P> After about six hours of talks, Dick Fisher, chief negotiator for the Los  Angeles Unified School District, said his side was "not too happy with the  progress of the negotiations." Asked to characterize the talks, he said:  "Disappointment, that's a fair word for it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Goldberg Not Optimistic  </P> <P> Despite growing expectations around the district that a settlement might be  near, school board member Jackie Goldberg said she "was not particularly  optimistic" for a quick settlement if the union continues to insist on a 10%  retroactive raise for this year. The board, she said, would not go any higher  than a total 24% raise over three years, while the union is seeking 26%.  </P> <P> Goldberg spoke after a four-hour, closed-door meeting of the board. Later, at  about 4 p.m., negotiating teams gathered in a room on the 28th floor of the  Westin Bonaventure Hotel downtown, and huddled late into the night. On  Thursday, they had met there for 10 hours.  </P> <P> At a large and enthusiastic rally in Exposition Park at noon Friday, United  Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson told his membership to be prepared  to go into a possible second week of the strike. "Hold on, hold on," Johnson  said in a passionate address. "If they don't settle this weekend, we will force  the contract from them. We are going to win; make no mistake about that."  </P> <P> In an interview at the park, the union leader described the negotiations as  "friendly, cordial and frank." But he said he would abide by an agreement for a  news blackout on specifics of the talks.  </P> <P> "We will meet until this thing is resolved," Johnson said. "As long as we're  talking, there is hope."  </P> <P> Entering the Bonaventure, district Supt. Leonard Britton estimated that about  two-thirds of the remaining disagreements center on pay. He also said he is  worried about the long-term effects of the strike on the school system.  "Everybody is tarnished by it," he said.  </P> <P> Participating in the talks were, for the district, school board President  Roberta Weintraub, negotiator Fisher and Britton. On the union side were UTLA  Vice President Helen Bernstein, negotiator John Britz and Johnson. Refereeing  was state mediator Draz Mrvichin, who handled talks earlier this year.  </P> <P> According to Britton, a settlement would have to be reached by noon Sunday in  order to have schools in full operation on Monday. The school board will remain  ready for an emergency meeting, officials said.  </P> <P> The union's House of Representatives is on call to meet this weekend if a  contract is ready for a ratification vote, Johnson said. If a contract is  approved by those representatives, teachers would go back to work on Monday and  hold a full membership ratification tally soon afterward, he said.  </P> <P> Police estimates of the crowd at the noon teachers' rally ranged from 3,000 to  8,000. But there were no doubts that the teachers' spirits were high.  </P> <P> "We will not go back to school unless we solve our problems," Jaime Escalante,  the famous calculus teacher from Garfield High School told the gathering. "The  strike energizes us. The strike puts together the whole team as a unit. And I'm  proud to be a teacher."  </P> <P> The presence of Escalante, whose work with Latino youngsters was the basis of  the hit film "Stand and Deliver," gratified union leaders who feared that he  might not support the strike because of his conservative political beliefs.  </P> <P> Other speakers included Assemblywoman Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles) and  school board candidate Mark Slavkin, who is strongly supported by the teachers'  union against incumbent Alan Gershman in a runoff election next month that  could determine the majority on the panel.  </P> <P> In a parody of the old Chuck Berry rock song, "Johnny B Good," entertainers and  the teachers sang "Go, Go, Lenny Go, Back to the Swamps." That was a musical  suggestion that Supt. Britton return to Florida, where he formerly headed Dade  County schools. Someone also strung up from a tree branch a dummy with a  drawing of Britton's face.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Prepared to Hold Out'  </P> <P> 'We'd rather be inside teaching but we are prepared to hold out," said Barbara  Goodson, an English teacher at Fremont High School in San Pedro. She was  carrying a sign that said: "Rita Walters, We Won't Forget," referring to school  board member Walters' opposition to some union proposals.  </P> <P> Jerry Gediman, a fifth-grade teacher at Justice Street Elementary School in  Canoga Park, said strikers will continue the picketing if necessary. "There are  just too many reasons why teachers are fed up," said Gediman, who has worked  for the district for 31 years. "There is something for everybody to latch  onto."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the district reported that school attendance on Friday continued to  drop sharply and that the strikers' numbers held. However, district spokeswoman  Eva Hain suggested that many students and teachers saw Friday as a chance to  have a long weekend.  </P> <P> According to Hain, only 259,128 of the district's 594,000 students were at the  morning attendance roll call Friday. That was 24,492 fewer than on Thursday and  70,192 fewer than on Monday when the strike began.  </P> <P> Of the nearly 26,259 regular teachers in the district, 8,642 came to work  Friday, only 18 more than on the day before, according to district figures. On  Monday, 6,740 teachers worked. Strikers also include school nurses, counselors  and librarians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It's Reasonably Quiet'  </P> <P> Wesley Mitchell, chief of school district police, said no arrests related to  the strike were made Friday. "It's reasonably quiet, probably the quietest day  we've had all week," he said.  </P> <P> The schools, with the help of 2,453 substitute teachers, continued efforts to  offer classes, although films and games were again the mainstay at some  campuses.  </P> <P> At Stephen M. White Intermediate School in Carson, Principal Carolyn Bohm,  reported that about half of her 1,200 students attended Friday, and that about  40 of the 75 teachers were on strike. "I hope it ends soon, so we can get back  to normal," she said.  </P> <P> Tamotsu Ikeda, principal of Gardena High School, said that only a third of his  usual 1,900 students came to school Friday. And, he is worried about the effect  on the academic achievement and grades of the absentees, especially since the  youngsters who are coming to school tend to be the better students, he added.  </P> <P> In another development Friday, nine teachers and aides who continue to work at  Capistrano Avenue Elementary School in Canoga Park held a press conference at a  Sherman Oaks hotel to protest their treatment by picketers.  </P> <P> "We've had people spit on us. We've been called scabs. And there have been  obscene gestures," complained Richard Mason, a fifth-grade teacher who is  president of a group called Professional Educators of Los Angeles. The group,  which he said has about 3,000 members, was formed by teachers who opposed the  previous school strike in 1970.  </P> <P> Mason also denounced a union proposal for an agency shop fee, under which all  teachers would be required to pay some form of dues.  </P> <P> Uncertainty remains on how much of an enormous state tax windfall over the next  two years will be available to raise teachers' pay. However, the union  continues to say that the district can afford much of the raises even without  any new state funds.  </P> <P> Starting pay for Los Angeles teachers is $23,440 and the current top salary is  $43,319, although some teachers earn more for extracurricular duties and summer  school. A state fact-finder's report released this week and denounced by the  union described the current pay range as among the best in the state.  </P> <P> Other issues include the elimination of schoolyard duties for elementary school  teachers and the formation of school governing councils on which teachers would  have a big say over schedules and curricula.  </P> <P> "We are education professional people and we want some control over what we do  every single day of our lives," Johnson told teachers at the rally.  </P> <P> Also contributing to this article were Times staff writers Tracey Kaplan and  Bob Williams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STRIKE HOT LINES  </P> <P> District telephone hot lines open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.  </P> <P> General strike information: 213-625-KIDS.  </P> <P> High school information: 1-800-345-GRAD.  </P> <P> Adult education information: 213-62-LEARN.  </P> <P> District's 24-hour recorded telephone hot line updated daily.  </P> <P> English: 213-625-4000.  </P> <P> Spanish: 213-625-4643.  </P> <P> The union has a hot line for teachers only, which is not made public.  </P></p>

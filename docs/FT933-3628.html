			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: Restoring Welsh landmark A team of divers working in some of the most feared tidal conditions in the world, at depths of up to 40 ft, are helping to repair the 80-year-old Mumbles lifeboat station on the Welsh coast. The five divers are part of a team of concrete experts and technicians from TARMAC STRUCTURAL REPAIRS, restoring the time-ravaged structure supporting the lifeboat house, slipway and walkway. The Pounds 500,000 contract is the seventh to be awarded by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution to the company for structural repair and strengthening of some of Britain's most famous lifeboat stations. The tidal range around the Mumbles headland approaches 10 metres and the tidal currents generated in the Bristol Channel frequently allows only brief spells for the divers to work below sea level on the base of the structure, which was completed in 1914. Diving and repair crews operate from a barge, which provides a 14-metre long working platform with 18-metre long jack-up legs embedded into the sea bed. A mobile crane installed on the barge lifts goods and equipment on to the working platform. The divers, working in relays against the clock, use air lines from powerful suction pumps to remove sand from around the pile supports, which are buried to a depth of six metres in the sand of the sea bed. Specifically designed fabric jackets are then placed around the exposed piles and filled using underwater concrete.</p>

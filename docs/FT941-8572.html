			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (3): Breakneck growth may slow as attention turns to safety - China's aviation industry Marred by a series of crashes in the last year, the breakneck growth of China's aviation industry is likely to slow as the country seeks to reverse its image as one of the most dangerous places in the world to fly. 'Investment is being diverted to upgrading airports,' says a western executive involved in the Chinese aviation business. 'They are concerned about training and safety. That is why there is a slowdown.' 'There will be a period of consolidation,' adds another knowledgeable western businessman. 'They ordered a lot of aircraft in 1993 and are taking delivery in 1994. The rapid expansion in the number of airlines and number of aircraft may have stretched their resources.' Last year, passenger and cargo volume rose a record 25-30 per cent from 1992. This was the highest aviation industry growth rate in the world, compared with 5-6 per cent in industrialised countries. Even with a slowdown, China is still expected to remain the international leader. In 1993, China bought 12 A300-600 aircraft worth Dollars 1.2bn from Airbus Industrie, as well as 28 Boeings from its 737, 757 and 767 series, altogether worth Dollars 1.35bn. The new purchases were designed to replace ageing Russian aircraft as the number of new Chinese airliners grew to 35. With a serious shortage of ground equipment, radar, navigation systems and adequately trained pilots, the infrastructure has not kept pace with the expansion. This was one key reason for the country's appalling safety record, with at least five known fatal accidents in the last year and a half, killing hundreds of people. In addition, 10 aircraft were hijacked last year from China to Taiwan, further aggrav- ating security problems and disputes over sovereignty between Beijing and Taipei. But these were not the only reasons for the poor safety record. As more civilian aircraft fly in narrow corridors allocated by the military, air traffic control capability has also lagged behind. China lacks civilian flight information regions which help guide pilots from one area of the country to another. 'In the US, there are several flight information regions, but within China there isn't such an animal,' a western executive says. 'After a pilot has left an airport, he is probably not on a civil aviation control radar, although the military is following it.' Problems stemming from the military's continued control over air traffic corridors are compounded by the increasing decentralisation of China's aviation industry. As more independent airlines have been established, they have been increasingly reluctant to give any of their profits to the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the industry's supervisory agency and owner of some of the country's increasingly autonomous airlines. Without financial clout, analysts say CAAC's ability to compel airlines and airports to improve their radar and ground facilities is limited. Growth in passenger and cargo traffic this year is also likely to be constrained by the country's moves away from subsidies and towards a market economy. Ticket prices are currently artificially low. 'If they are really going this way, this will free the price,' a western businessman says. 'If every airline has to cover its cost, they must raise the ticket price.' For example, a two and a half hour flight from Beijing to Guangzhou costs less than Dollars 200 one way. In contrast, a flight of a similar distance from New York to Chicago costs about Dollars 400. In addition, Chinese airlines are likely to be hit by foreign exchange fluctuations since the devaluation of the local currency, the renminbi. Businessmen said fares are likely to increase to compensate for the more expensive dollar to repay loans for aircraft purchases. In an attempt to improve both safety and efficiency, the government has reorganised CAAC. Chen Guangyi, former governor and communist party secretary of China's coastal Fujian province, was appointed CAAC's director general, replacing Zhang Zhuping. Chen has had no previous background in aviation, although he is an engineer by training. 'He has said his mandate is two-fold - to improve safety and make the airlines do quality work serving the public,' a western diplomat says. 'The State Council wanted a new person to shake up CAAC a little bit and make it more focused on safety.' Chen was also believed to be appointed because as governor of a prosperous coastal province, he could bring his business knowledge to bear on China's cumbersome state-run airlines. There is speculation that Chen, who has vast business connections across the Taiwan straits, might be able to accelerate the process of starting direct flights to Taiwan and encourage Taiwanese businessmen to invest in China's ailing airline industry. Chinese authorities have also imposed tougher financial, technical and operational restrictions for new airlines seeking to be established, warning that criminal charges would be pressed against any airline staff if it could be proved they were negligent in their duties in the course of an accident. China has also agreed to allow the recent opening of a representative office of the US Federal Aviation Authority in Beijing. The FAA's role is to assist the Chinese in helping them develop and integrate their aviation system to meet international safety standards. An FAA investigation team was called in for the first time late last year to help ascertain the cause of an accident in Urumqi in western Xinjiang province involving a McDonnell Douglas jet. In another positive move, the military has also agreed to turn control of the vital and heavily travelled air route from Beijing to Guangzhou, the capital of southern Guangdong province, to civilian authorities. With the country expected to need at least 700 new pilots in the next few years, a number that the main training centre in Chengdu, Sichuan province, cannot turn out, the Chinese are also sending more of their pilots to the west for training. Guangzhou-based China Southern Airlines has even bought part of an Australian flight school to help train its pilots. At the same time, Airbus Industrie and Boeing are each also considering the possibility of establishing a flight training school for entry level pilots. Although Chinese officials have publicly welcomed foreign investment in the aviation industry, so far foreigners have seemed reluctant. A recent dispute involving Air China, China Eastern and Evergreen, an American air cargo carrier, provides one explanation why. The Chinese had blocked cargo destined for the US from being loaded onto Evergreen planes in contravention of a bilateral treaty. The dispute was resolved only after pressure from the US government. But businessmen say the handling of the affair demonstrates that Beijing will protect Chinese aviation interests first, regardless of who may be right.</p>

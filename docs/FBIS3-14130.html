He said the country has put behind its first national  development plan and is about to embark on the second 5-year  plan with more confidence.    "The first plan worked a lot for the country and the effects  of it will gradually become apparent. The first effect of it is  that the country has acquired strength against conspiracies and  unwelcome incidents. We have solidified the infrastructure of  the country.    "In the cultural, educational and political sectors our  people are at a high level of intelligence in the area of  religion and politicis. Their presence on the scene and their  Islamic conduct and their observance of Islamic dictates is  among the peculiarities of this nation throughout the world, and  we take pride in this nation," said the president.    He took note of reconstruction and development efforts and  said the difference between the deprived areas before and after  the plan is really very much.    "Our people have heard the statistics and the figures. The  infrasturctural works such as water, electricity and gas and  attention to the water and power of the villages, roads,  airports, telecommunications and post for all has progressed at  a very good level, which has brought us ahead of the development  plan, and our people understand the presence of these  communication affairs.    "Our country is not at all comparable to five years ago. The  level of production has increased very much and we have  approached self-sufficiency. In the area of foodstuffs, cattle,  poultry, fisheries, forests and others, thanks God we have  advanced with coordination," elaborated the president.    In the use of the resources of the country mines and  industries have been activated and strengthened, and today Iran  is an exporter of steel, copper and aluminum, three major  elements for the industrialized world, he added.    Rafsanjani pointed out that exports of the country during  this period has almost quadruppled, and "if this movement  continues, the second plan, God willing, can make us to a large  extent independent of oil revenues...I think such successes are  mainly because of the supports of the people and their presence  on the scene."    He said that for youth this year and in the future years  there are new programmes, because "from the point of view of  population our country is a young country, and our young forces  require guidance and help so that they will be able to pass the  course of the revolution well."    The hojjat ol-eslam lauded the effective role played by  Iran's Muslim women in the era of the revolution, and said  "grounds for their added activity in the social affairs and this  policy will continue to be exercized so that this year from the  point of attention to the spiritual needs of our youths and  especially women we will have a successful year."    He was all praise for the armed forces and the unknown  soldiers who serve the country and said their vigilence and  sacrifice, saw Iran come out with flying colours during the era  of holy defense (1980-88).    The president spoke of big accomplishment in the heavy  industries field and the procurement of raw materials for plants  such as steel and petrochemicals.    "We supplied all kinds of our needs for minerals, most of  them can stand on their feet. We can control the market up to  some degree, and we hope the shop keepers and the respectble  traders will cooperate with us and will consider equity. We,  too, will support them.    "Of course, we agree with their balanced profit, and God  willing, we will provide them with administrative facilities,  especially for the people active in exports."    He was hopeful that "with the support of self-sacrificing  people and with the presence on the scene of the war disabled  and the former pows and their proud families and with the  efforts of those who work for the people with sincerity," Iran  is fully geared up to welcome the second five year plan and to  embark on the tasks ahead.    He said "fortunately, in the last weeks of this past year  foreign exchange constraints that had been created because of  the fall of the oil price were removed, and in the coming year  we will live without any constraints. Next year we will find a  chance to have more power on the market."    Turning to problems on the world scene, Hojjat ol-Eslam  Rafsanjani said the Islamic society is having much headache.    "Still in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, Afghanistan,  Tajikistan, Karabakh, Iraq, Somalia and many other places  Muslims have difficulties and this indicates the spite world  arrogance has towards Muslims and Islam."    He said Iran was trying its best to to help Muslims and will  continue to contribute towards the resolving of their problems.    "Our foreign policy is nowhere clashes and strife, and I  think problems can be solved by negotiations, peacefully and  with cooperation," he was confident.</p>

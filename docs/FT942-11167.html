			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria cuts payout despite rise Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, yesterday reported a sharp rise in operating profits but will pay a reduced dividend of 8 per cent, compared with 10 per cent in 1992, as part of further efforts to improve financial resources and enhance competitiveness. Partial operating profits doubled to Sch4.2bn (Dollars 347m) from Sch2.1bn in 1992, helped by further measures to reduce costs and additional synergies from the 1991 merger of Oesterreichische Landerbank and the city of Vienna's Zentralsparkasse savings bank to form Bank Austria. Profits before allocations to reserves at Sch1.32bn were broadly in line with the Sch1.29bn earned in 1992. Operating expenses declined by almost 7 per cent, mainly due to a 15 per cent cut in labour costs, and the one-off effect of a reform of the company's pension scheme. The domestic branch network was reduced by 15 branches to 340 branches, and more will be closed this year. Provisions against bad debts were reduced by almost one-third from 1992 to about Sch4bn 'despite the problems faced by the Austrian economy, and bankruptcies climbing to an all time high', the bank said. Primary funds totalled Sch332.9bn, with private household savings deposits accounting for 48.5 per cent of the total. The bank continued to expand in central and eastern Europe. It now has subsidiaries in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia, and became the first foreign bank to open an operational branch office in Moscow. Bank Austria recently completed its takeover of GiroCredit, Austria's third largest bank.</p>

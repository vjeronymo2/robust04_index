			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salam Musafir in Moscow] </F>   [Text] Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the information  policy and media committee [title as published] at the Russian  parliament, says the growing audacity of pro-Zionist and  pro-Israel circles in Russia is such that they are pursuing a  systematic campaign against the Russian people that could  conceivably culminate in horrible massacres.    A close political aide to President Boris Yeltsin, Mr.  Poltoranin said in an interview with AL-RA'Y: I fear the  Russian people may lose their patience with this filthy effort.  While the Russian people have the capacity to endure hunger,  misery, and deprivation, they will not remain silent for long  when Zionists trample their national pride underfoot through the  news media they are seeking to control.    In a a recent television appearance, Poltoranin recalled, he  said that by speaking the language of the Jewish concentration  camps, the Zionists are fueling so-called anti-Semitism in  Russia. By temperament, the Russian people, he emphasized, do  not discriminate against others on ethnic, racial, or religious  grounds. These circles, however, are trying our people's  patience. If a massacre should take place, the Zionist lobby  active in the media must take the blame in full. The Zionist  circles have gone too far in insulting the Russian national  dignity, he added.    Poltoranin disclosed that the salary of the Russian  television Hebrew correspondent is paid by the Israeli  Government and so it was not surprising that his reports have an  anti-Arab and pro-Israel slant. When I intimated to the Russian  television's director my surprise that the cash-strapped station  had no correspondents in the country's provinces, while it  maintained one in Israel, he revealed to me that the latter gets  his pay from Israel.    This affair, which as a Russian parliamentary committee  chairman I will not condone, is legally and politically  insulting to Russia's national dignity and prestige, Mr.  Poltoranin said.    He would keep the fight against these circles, which he  regretted are seeking to isolate President Yeltsin after they  secured influential positions within his entourage.    I am confident that Mr. Yeltsin will soon heed the danger  this represents, and will come to recognize that a halt must be  called to the Zionist-inspired defamation campaign against  Russian national pride.    He indicated that by April, the Russian parliament will pass  a law regulating the activities of the media organs,  particularly the competing radio and television stations, which,  he said have turned into tools manipulated by the Zionist lobby.  The parliament, he added, will decree the formation of a  federal, central consultative council to administer radio and  television.    There is a consensus in parliament and an initial acceptance  by Mr. Yeltsin that I take charge of this council. We will then  put things in order and ban this feverish activity, because  Russia will not countenance becoming an occupied country.    At the parliament's initiative, a committee was formed to  look into where the money came from to fund anti-Arab and  anti-Russian television programs, Mr. Poltoranin disclosed. Let  me tell you that we will not have our media channels turn into  mouthpieces for cheap Zionist propaganda, he added.    I asked him about Yeltsin's feelings toward what is  happening  in Russia. Poltoranin said that by virtue of many complex --  both objective and subjective -- factors, President Yeltsin is  suffering from symptoms of a lack of concentration, more  precisely drift, because the situation is far removed from the  way he had hoped would turn out two years ago when he launched  his economic reform program.    Two years ago, Poltoranin continued, I put forward to Mr.  Yeltsin a moderate, sober, gradualist reform plan to lead up to  a full- fledged market economy. Gaydar, on the other hand,  proposed a shortcut, which Yeltsin, for purely personal reasons,  adopted and, which, in the end proved a failure and produced  serious political and social eruptions that the president is now  seeking to contain lest there be a total collapse. Yeltsin's  awakening came rather too late, which, has, for the past months,  put him in a depressed state of mind that I have watched at  close range. It has affected his health considerably.    Poltoranin said the president's illness is not a secret. He  has been suffering from an acute infection of the brain vessels  for several years. He has always complained of this.  Naturally, his case is exacerbating with age. He added:  Still, I do not think it is a hopeless case, although it  affects his vigor and activity in one way or another. He added:  Until recently, we have been practicing tennis with the  president, his favorite hobby. I think he needs more rest.  Poltoranin said what is more serious in the president's latest  conduct is that he listened to tendentious advisers and shut  himself off from the people because his entourage does not  provide him with correct information on what is taking place in  the country.    Russia will see large-scale labor strikes after the  formation  of regional and federal committees all over the country. These  committees will first demand early presidential elections, or  more accurately, the dismissal of Yeltsin. Actually, these  strikes are legal because the workers have not received their  salaries for months. The commercial establishments, like Moost  [name as transliterated], which finances several Zionist  television programs, confiscates the state budget funds and uses  them in commercial deals. After making huge profits, it pays a  small part of the wages and salaries which, in turn, lose their  purchasing power due to inflation. Thus, these establishments  play a major destructive role, protected and supported by  ministers in the government and by Ilyushin, the president's  close aide who represents the interests of the ruling  establishment.    Regrettably, the president, due to the objective and  personal  factors I have mentioned, does not have an accurate or clear  idea about what is going on around him. But when the street  factor simmers and popular anger bursts out as a result of these  policies, it will be too late to do anything. He added:  Popular pressure may lead to early elections and this is  something the president is not giving due consideration right  now.    Poltoranin said Gaydar's parliamentary bloc, Russia First,  is  a political movement with no future. Elaborating, he said: The  bloc is suffering from a major split that will surface within  the next few weeks. This bloc includes opportunists seeking  senior positions. It also includes sincere deputies who blame  it for its inactivity and unclear political and economic  programs. Those deputies will form their own parliamentary  bloc. Once they have done so, I expect them to dismiss Gaydar  and the small group supporting him.    The Russian national factor also plays a role in the  collapse  of Russia First because Gaydar refuses to deal with sincere  Russians. He prefers to deal with educated Moscovites. These  include many representatives of the lobby to which I have  referred. He said he personally does not desire a split in  Russia First, but reality is stronger than wishes.    In his interview with AL-RA'Y, Poltoranin strongly condemned  the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and said: The bestial  action perpetrated by an occupation settler was not a transient  incident. The regime that sanctioned the horrible massacre  should be taken to account because Israeli policy, which is  hostile to the rights of the Arabs of Palestine, is fertile soil  for acts of repression, terrorism, and the killing of innocent  people. He indicated he will ask the Russian parliament to  discuss the situation in the Middle East and draw up a sound  policy for fruitful cooperation with the Arab states.    He added: I said on more than one occasion that the Russian  Foreign Ministry policy in the region is limping along on  Western legs and that Russia should adopt an independent policy  based on its national interests in the region, which is an area  of important strategic geopolitical interests for our country.  Russia has relinquished its interests in the Middle East to  accommodate the aims of those forces that harbor evil to Russia  and the Arabs.    He said: The West, led by the United States, offered Russia  nothing but bad advise. It is occupying positions Russia has  abandoned one after another. Russia has only one option,  namely, alliance with the Arab states and the Pacific Ocean  states so an effective political and economic alliance can be  established to end to the imbalance in world power and to  confront the U.S. hegemony and the chauvinist expansionist U.S.  policy in the world.    Concluding, Poltoranin said Russia should toll the alarm in  the Security Council vis-a-vis Israel's possession of nuclear  weapons because the Israeli nuclear factor threatens the  national security of Russia as well as that of the Arabs. He  said: Using double standards in dealing with states' possession  of weapons of mass destruction should be terminated.</p>

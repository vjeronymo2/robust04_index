			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTIQUES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> AMERICAN EMPIRE FURNITURE  </P> <P> FOR MANY YEARS, American 19th-Century furniture has been overlooked, while  furniture of earlier periods commands the highest prices at auction. Empire  furniture, in particular, has never been popular. This is hard to understand,  since the furniture itself, dating from the 1820s and the 1830s, is graceful  and well designed and uses the finest mahogany and rosewood veneers. It is far  simpler -- and often more appealing -- than the French Empire and English  Regency furniture upon which it is based. Ormolu is hardly ever used, and all  excess has been avoided.  </P> <P> Of the cabinetmakers who specialized in the style, the best known, and  certainly the finest craftsman, was Duncan Phyfe (1768-1854) of New York City.  Born in Scotland, he came to America at the age of 16 and served as an  apprentice to a cabinetmaker in Albany. By 1792, he had made his way to New  York City, where he established a highly successful workshop. Elegance and  simplicity were his trademarks.  </P> <P> His name is forever associated with Empire furniture, a style based on European  models but adapted to American tastes. Fine examples of the style can be seen  today in the Old Merchant's House on East 4th Street in New York City, now a  museum and almost perfectly restored to the original condition that existed  when the Treadwell family bought the house in 1835. During the early 19th  Century, quantities of sofas, chairs, beds and pedestal tables were made in the  Empire style, along with the popular window seats (really small sofas, designed  to fit into a window alcove) -- all variations of the elegant forms developed  by Phyfe. At the time, French influence was pronounced, because many pattern  and design books from Paris found their way to the United States after the  birth of the new nation. There were also many emigre cabinetmakers like  Charles-Honore Lannuier of New York and Anthony Quervelle of Philadelphia, and  there was a considerable amount of imported furniture on hand, the result of  increased trade between France and the United States.  </P> <P> In its American form, Empire furniture is not easy to find but, when available,  can often be bought at bargain prices. At auction in 1988, it sold for far less  than other American furniture. A Federal carved mahogany sofa and a carved  window seat, for example -- both attributed to the shop of Duncan Phyfe -- sold  at Christie's for $49,500 and $26,400, respectively. During the same year,  however, a pair of American Empire side chairs, c. 1835, brought $15,000. These  were handsome and gracefully designed pieces whose lines blend well with  contemporary decor.  </P> <P>  Look for Empire furniture at Panache, Vivian Farren, Edwin-Anthony, all in Los  Angeles; Richard Gould in Santa Monica; Carlyle Eubank in Beverly Hills;  Richard Yeakel and Nicholson's Antiques, both in Laguna Beach; Jay's Antiques  in Pasadena, and The Snow Goose in La Jolla.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Roger Ricardo Luis] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Pages 4 and 5 of today's GRANMA  carries an interview with Public Health Minister Julio Jesus  Teja Perez by reporter Jose Antonio de Oca in which the minister  outlines the details of the country's strategy for production  and distribution of medicines, based on the country's potential  and available resources.    I will read passages of this interview, which was published  today on pages 4 and 5. It says that medical control will begin  on 16 May in Havana City and that it will gradually be extended  throughout the country. The objective is to increase the level  of satisfaction as guarantees are strengthened to distribute the  medicines the people need; to reduce the number of medicines not  readily available; and to systematically prevent the  embezzlement, for increased profit which occurs with this type  of product.    The success of this plan will depend to a large extent on  the  cooperation and understanding of our doctors, on those  responsible for administration, and on pharmaceutical experts.    Some provinces that began to develop initiatives in this  area  have implemented most of the measures adopted in Havana City,  with positive results even when experiencing greater shortages  than in the capital. One of the first measures seeks to fight  speculation and hoarding, in an effort to tighten relations  between the community and drug stores. Approximately 30  medicines can therefore be purchased at the drug store nearest  the individual's residence by presenting the ration book for  identification of the family group.    Medicines will not be sold through preestablished quotas,  but  in an individual manner, based on availability of these  medicines. A list of residences will be required, to register  all possible consumers.    The pharmacies will sell various products such as boric  acid,  camphorated pomade, aspirin, (pasta lazar), magnesium sulfate,  and (citrogal), among others. The links that will be established  between family groups and their neighborhood drug stores do not  exclude the purchase of prescribed medicines from other  pharmacies, taking into account that each doctor or dentist must  have his name officially registered in the drug store near his  workplace. This means that the health units will also be linked  to the neighborhood drug stores where patients will be able to  acquire the medications indicated by the emergency service or by  consultation. The same goes for those already discharged from  the hospital, but who need to continue their treatment. In  Havana City especially, pediatric doctors, surgeons, and others  will have one intrahospital pharmacy for the purchase of the  medications prescribed by the emergency service.    The 73 medicines sold today through cards, for the treatment  of chronically ill people who require lengthy treatment, will be  purchased from special drug stores through the appropriate  health field.    Current medical prescription models will be changed. The old  ones must be presented at the pharmacy, together with the new  prescription, to obtain the prescribed medicine. Medical  prescriptions for the purchase of antibiotics and other  medications will have a time limit. If the medicines are not  purchased within that period of time, the validity of the  prescription is automatically canceled and will thus require a  new medical examination.</p>

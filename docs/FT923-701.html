			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic and election uncertainty hit Dow Wall Street MORE BAD economic news and renewed uncertainty about the election battle left US share prices sharply lower across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.55 at 3,250.32, although above its lows for the day when the index had registered a 50-point loss. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 4.13 at 414.35, while the Amex composite shed 2.45 at 378.49 and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.73 to 577.20. Turnover on the New York SE was 216m shares. Although bond prices staged a strong recovery, and yields fell, A series of poor economic news set the tone for a weak opening to trading. The biggest surprise was the 0.1 per cent decline in August durable goods orders, which followed a big rise in July and defied analysts' expectations of a similar increase for August. Particularly worrying was the new five-year low for unfilled orders. Until backlogs begin to increase again, companies will not hire new workers, said analysts. This has serious ramifications for consumer spending. The latest data on personal spending showed it fell by 0.1 per cent in August, alongside a 0.5 per cent drop in personal income. Those figures, plus a 3.2 per cent drop in August existing home sales, prompted concerted selling. Among individual sectors, drug stocks were hit by the latest press reports on government plans to introduce new regulations to control rising healthcare costs. Investors fear the regulations could reduce corporate profits. Leading the way lower were Merck, down Dollars 2 at Dollars 43 1/8 , Schering-Plough, Dollars 2 3/8 lower at Dollars 57 1/4 (despite a broker's upgrade), Pfizer, down Dollars 4 3/8 at Dollars 74 3/8 , Bristol Myers-Squibb, Dollars 2 1/8 lower at Dollars 63 3/4 and Johnson &amp; Johnson, Dollars 2 7/8 weaker at Dollars 47 5/8 . Insurance stocks were mixed after hectic gains, on Thursday inspired by hopes that losses from Hurricane Andrew could end the property and casualty insurance industry's price slump and drive rates higher. AIG added rose another Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 102 1/4 , as did Travelers (already buoyed by favourable reaction to the recent Dollars 722.5m injection of capital by Primerica), up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 22 7/8 . SCOR US rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 16 1/8 after announcing it would take an 89 cents a share charge in the third quarter to cover hurricane losses but reassuring that overall earnings would be positive. Aetna held steady at Dollars 40 3/4 , but profit-taking dropped General Re Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 99 3/4 . Medical Care America plunged Dollars 33 to Dollars 25 after the company warned third quarter earnings would be comparable with the 45 cents a share earned a year ago after one-time charges of 44 cents a share. Canada TORONTO Stocks ended the week on a losing note, following most major world markets. The Composite Index lost 25.12 points at 3,385.49, down about 60 points on the week. Declines led advances 309 to 214 with volume at 24m shares. All but one of the 14 stock groups ended lower. Industrial products were off 1.16% and financial services lost 0.98%. Consumer products and mining were down moderately, with gold and energy stocks flat.</p>

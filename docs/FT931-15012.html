			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Israeli troops kill three ISRAELI troops shot dead three Palestinians and wounded 55 in three separate incidents in the occupied territories yesterday, Palestinians said, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The toll brings to 990 the number of Arabs killed by Israeli soldiers and civilians in a five-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Yesterday's incidents took place in Dir el Balach and nearby Khan Yunis in the occupied Gaza Strip and in the village of Jenin on the West Bank. Israeli MP Mr Benjamin Netanyahu has suffered a setback in his campaign to become the next leader of the opposition Likud party. A media superstar during the Gulf war, Mr Netanyahu admitted yesterday to having an extra-marital affair and said he was being blackmailed by a member of his own party. He was in the midst of a heated primary campaign for leadership of the opposition Likud party which many believed he would win.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TYSON GETS HIS SECOND SPEEDING TICKET IN NINE DAYS  </P> <P> Mike Tyson may be undefeated in the ring, but he's 0-2 against Albany police,  who on Friday issued the heavyweight champion his second speeding ticket in  nine days.  </P> <P> Tyson, whose career began in nearby Catskill, was ticketed shortly after 10  a.m. for driving his 1989 Lamborghini at an imprudent speed, according to  Albany police Sgt. Robert Wolfgang.  </P> <P> Wolfgang said a police officer spotted Tyson's car and another vehicle  exceeding the 30-m.p.h. speed limit while traveling east on Albany's Central  Avenue.  </P> <P> "It was not a clocked situation, but the officer determined they were driving  at a greater speed than is prudent for the traffic conditions," Wolfgang said.  </P> <P> The driver of the other vehicle was identified as Jason Knell, 18, of Clifton  Park. He was driving a 1989 Toyota, Wolfgang said.  </P> <P> Tyson and Knell are scheduled to appear May 23 in Albany Traffic Court,  Wolfgang said.  </P> <P> Police issued Tyson a speeding ticket April 26 for driving 71 m.p.h. while  racing his Lamborghini against a friend on Central Avenue. He is scheduled to  appear in court Tuesday for that incident, police said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Leonid Kravchuk told journalists in Kiev Tuesday  that the Black Sea Fleet in its present condition was in  practice not subordinate to Ukraine, while both Russia and  Ukraine take responsibility for its actions.    Kravchuk said that it should be made stipulated as soon as  possible that the Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet with  Russian laws and that Russia takes responsibility for its  actions, while Ukraine takes responsibility for the actions of  its own fleet.    Noting that at present certain statements made by  participants at the April 15 talks in Moscow on the Black Sea  Fleet were being interpreted in different ways, Kravchuk said  that there was one official position -- to resolve the question  of the Black Sea Fleet, in particular the question of its base,  its division, and the payment to Ukraine for the part handed  over to Russia.    Kravchuk went on to say that Ukraine was sticking to the  terms of the four document on the subject -- those prepared in  Yalta, Zavidovo, Massandra and now Moscow. "I would like the  fifth document to be the least [as received] -- then we will  have a magnificent five," said Kravchuk.    He said he supported the idea that Sevastopol should become  a  naval base for the Russian fleet and that it should be leased on  terms recognized around the world.    "I support this idea because I do not see another option. I  cannot imagine that other, Ukrainian naval forces would lie side  by side with Russian ones. The Ukrainian navy should have its  own base."    He said that Sevastopol should not become a Russian town,  but  rather the base of the Russian fleet. "The wording should be  carefully defined," he said.</p>

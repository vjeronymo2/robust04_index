			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Musical Chairs: Columbia/Tri Star incurred royal wrath after a seating mix up  at the Buckingham Palace premiere of "Steel Magnolias."  </P> <P> One person's wrong choice of the seat reserved for Olympia Dukakis next to  Prince Charles led to seating pandemonium. When Dukakis and actress Julia  Roberts showed and had nowhere to sit, the Prince tried to move and nobody knew  where to go. The Palace sent a letter of complaint about the musical chairs  game to Columbia/Tri Star's London office, expressing unhappiness that the  Prince and Princess of Wales had to move seats. The next royal premiere is "The  Hunt for Red October" on April 17. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

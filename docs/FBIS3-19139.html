			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Stuttgart (DDP/ADN) -- The main wages commission of  the public sector union of OeTV [Union of Public Service and  Transportation Employees] has approved the employers' offer of a  2-percent pay rise with a large majority. This was announced by  OeTV Chairwoman Monika Wulf-Mathies this afternoon in Stuttgart.  This means the wage compromise deal for the 3.5 million or so  workers and employees in the public service sector is settled.  The 36-man OeTV negotiating commission had earlier recommended  acceptance of the compromise with 29 votes.    The employers' proposal provides, among other things, for a  pay rise for lower paid workers from July 1994. The pay of  medium- and higher-paid employees will be raised from September  1994. In addition, the pay of east German employees will be  brought up to western levels in two phases of 2 percent each.  Employment-protection measures are also planned in eastern  Germany. The new wage agreement will have a 15-month period of  validity to offset costs.</p>

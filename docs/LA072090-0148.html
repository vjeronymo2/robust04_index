			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONILLA, WITH A LOT ON HIS MIND, SCUFFLES WITH PIRATES' EXECUTIVE  </P> <P> All-Star outfielder Bobby Bonilla, unhappy with his wife's parking spot,  angrily grabbed a Pittsburgh Pirates' vice president during a shouting match  after the Pirates' 11-2 victory over San Francisco on Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Upset because his wife and young daughter had to park in an unguarded lot about  150 yards from the players' entrance at Three Rivers Stadium, Bonilla  confronted vice president for public relations Rick Cerrone in the Pirates'  clubhouse.  </P> <P> Cerrone, who is not responsible for parking, waved Bonilla off. That angered  Bonilla, who shouted at Cerrone and grabbed him by the tie as the two were  shoved into the trainers' room.  </P> <P> Neither Bonilla nor Cerrone would talk about the incident. Cerrone, appearing  upset, left the clubhouse after discussing the parking situation with player  representative Jay Bell and Manager Jim Leyland.  </P> <P> The players were given a new parking area earlier this season after complaining  about a lack of security. As attendance has increased -- the Pirates are  threatening to break the 2 million mark for the first time -- some players'  wives have been unable to find spots in the new area.  </P> <P> "You can be sure I will get this taken care of," Bell said.  </P></p>

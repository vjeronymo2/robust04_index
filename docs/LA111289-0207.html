			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS LOOK TO CHILL HOT RAIDERS;  </P> <P> "-----------.": CHARGER QUARTERBACK JIM MCMAHON TO LOCAL BEAT REPORTERS ON  TODAY'S HOME GAME AGAINST THE RAIDERS.  </P> <P> And, yes, according to McMahon's agent, Steve Zucker, there is truth to the  rumor that Kleenex, the company that makes tissue paper, has approached Zucker  about a possible endorsement contract for McMucous.  </P> <P> The moral: Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be boring.  </P> <P> The morality: Reprehensible.  </P> <P> The morale: For the Chargers (3-6), great now. They ended a four-game losing  streak by upsetting Philadelphia last Sunday, 20-17, on a 49-yard field goal by  Chris Bahr with four seconds remaining. For the Raiders (5-4) morale is even  higher. They have won four of their last five.  </P> <P> It's just that life around the Chargers was so much easier the first time they  played the Raiders nine weeks ago.  </P> <P> Bo "You-Don't-Know-Diddley" Jackson was still in a Kansas City baseball uniform  then. Marcus Allen was healthy and worlds less dangerous than Jackson. And the  only thing phlegmatic about McMahon was his postgame press conference after the  Raiders beat the Chargers, 40-14. That's when he said he could have gone back  into the game when Charger Coach Dan Henning yanked him trailing by just two  touchdowns. Then backup quarterback David Archer said McMahon asked to come out  of the game. Henning subsequently gave several versions.  </P> <P> Controversy has dogged the Chargers ever since.  </P> <P> After two games, their owner, Alex Spanos, criticized the defense for playing  too much "three-man prevent." Since then only one team, the 8-1 New York  Giants, has allowed fewer points than the Chargers. In the last two games the  Chargers have sacked opposing quarterbacks 10 times.  </P> <P> This guy Spanos, maybe he knows his onions.  </P> <P> From weeks Five through Eight the Chargers lost four straight games in which  they had a chance to win or tie on their last possession. The day after the  last of those losses, McMahon blew his nose in the face of a writer. And while  many people turn paler every time the incident is retold, this much is  undeniable: Nothing any of the Chargers have done before or after has been  talked about more.  </P> <P> Now come the re-tooled Raiders, a team more into flaring tempers than flaring  nostrils. They have a different coach than they did Sept. 10. They have the  multi-talented Jackson, who has gained 467 yards in the four games since his  return. They have monster pass rusher Howie Long happy and healthy again. And  they have a rushing defense that has allowed 3.5 yards per carry since Art  Shell replaced Mike Shanahan as head coach.  </P> <P> "Art's a little bit more relaxed (than Shanahan)," says Jay Schroeder, the  quarterback who probably will start in place of Steve Beuerlein. Beuerlein  injured his knee two weeks ago in a Raider victory over the Redskins, 37-24.  Schroeder started in last week's, 28-7, victory over Cincinnati.  </P> <P> In the first encounter between these teams the Raiders picked ceaselessly on  Charger cornerback Sammy "The Way Out" Seale, a former Raider. Wide receiver  Willie Gault, working almost exclusively against Seale, caught four passes for  131 yards and a touchdown. But Seale hasn't been beaten deep since.  </P> <P> "That first game it was like, 'We're the big bad Chargers, we'll kill these  guys,' " Seale says now. "Now I'm more realistic. I've been wearing a target  for seven weeks. If I was an offensive coordinator, I'd throw at me, too."  </P> <P> Unless that offensive coordinator happens to have Jackson back in action. "If  you tell me we'll be able to keep Bo Jackson to 10 yards in his first five  carries, I'd take it," says Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn. "But if you  couldn't guarantee what those next five carries would be, I'm not so sure I'd  take that."  </P> <P> Last week Jackson rushed for 159 yards on just 13 carries, including a 92-yard  burst that made him the first player in NFL history to score on the ground from  more than 90 yards twice in his career. Two years ago he did it from 91 yards  away at Seattle.  </P> <P> The Raiders have brought Jackson along slowly since his return from baseball,  allowing him to find his football "shape" at his own pace. He has averaged less  than 16 carries per game.  </P> <P> "Like they say," Shell says, "Bo knows football. Bo knows baseball. Bo knows it  all. But the thing Bo knows best, is Bo."  </P> <P> "Right now, I don't think we've played against a better back, because of his  size and speed," says Charger outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal, who has  five-and-a-half sacks in his last two games.  </P> <P> The Chargers know the Raiders are their arch-rivals. And they don't deny it,  even though the manual says you're supposed to treat every game the same . . .  each counts just as much in the standings . . . on any given Sunday . . . these  guys are all professionals . . . et cetera . . . .  </P> <P> "The rivalry is not only divisional," says Henning, a former Charger  quarterback. "It's geographical and it's historical." History shows the Raiders  have won seven of the last nine.  </P> <P> Thirty of the Chargers' 47-man roster are new to the team since 1988. But,  Henning says, "even though they can't give you dates and times, they know it's  important."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Today's Charger-Raider game (kickoff 5 p.m.) is a sellout, which means the  ESPN-TV broadcast can be seen locally. . . . The Charger rushing defense, which  ranks 16th in the league, gave up a season high 178 yards rushing to the Eagles  last week. Philadelphia entered that game ranked fourth in rushing offense.  This week the Raiders rank fourth in rushing offense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAKING A STAND  </P> <P> After two games, the Chargers had allowed 74 points, second most in the NFL  behind Pittsburgh's 92. Since then has been quite different. A look at the  points-allowed rankings for the past seven games:  </P> <P> Team: Total: (Avg.)  </P> <P> 1. Giants: 98 (14.00)  </P> <P> 2. CHARGERS: 99 (14.14)  </P> <P> 3. Indianapolis: 101 (14.42)  </P> <P> 4. Denver: 106 (15.14)  </P> <P> 5. Seattle: 110 (15.71)  </P> <P> 6. Minnesota: 113 (16.14)  </P> <P> 7. Raiders: 117 (16.71)  </P> <P> 8. San Francisco: 118 (16.85)  </P> <P> 9. Cleveland: 119 (17.00)  </P> <P> 10. Pittsburgh: 128 (18.28)  </P> <P> 11. Kansas City: 139 (19.85)  </P> <P> 12. New Orleans: 139 (19.85)  </P> <P> 13. Philadelphia: 140 (20.00)  </P> <P> 14. Cincinnati: 141 (20.14)  </P> <P> 15. Washington: 147 (21.00)  </P> <P> 16. Phoenix: 156 (22.28)  </P> <P> 17.

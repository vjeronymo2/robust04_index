			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Observer: Title brewing One cannot question the loyalty of George Younger, the former defence secretary. Who else would prefer to adopt the title of an obsolete Scottish airport rather than some pretty glen? Lord Younger of Prestwick, as he will soon be known, has always been uncommonly faithful to the under-utilised airport in his former constituency of Ayr. In the 18 years he was an MP, he led the lobby which persuaded the government to keep Prestwick's monopoly on transatlantic flights to and from Scotland. Because the airport was highly inconvenient for much of the Scottish population, its traffic dwindled to the point when on some winter days there were no passenger flights at all; the development of air services from Scotland was retarded by a decade, often to the benefit of airports like Manchester. However, Younger lost his battle in 1990 when the government finally allowed neighbouring Glasgow to break Prestwick's transatlantic monopoly. As a result BAA sold Prestwick earlier this year to a consortium, backed by the local authority, with Younger a prime mover. Prestwick is now developing its freight business and hoping for the day when Glasgow becomes too congested. However, if Prestwick really proves a white elephant, Younger won't necessarily be tagged for life. He should eventually succeed to his father's title Viscount Younger of Leckie, the name of the family home, a long, long way from Prestwick.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (7): A multitude of options  -Tremendous potential seen for fledgling mobile data market THE VIABILITY of a market for mobile data services in the UK was brought into question after the collapse this summer of one of its pioneers, Cognito. But while there might not be one market, there may well be 50 or 60. Cognito's withdrawal from the market after the acquisition of its biggest investor, Dowty, by the TI group, was not unexpected. Mr Karim Khoja, general manager of Ram Mobile Data Services, a competitor of Cognito's, believes rationalisation in the mobile data industry was bound to happen. To begin with, according to Mr Khoja, 'the government awarded licences for five operators when there is probably only a market in the UK for two'. Cognito's downfall may have also been a result of its different approach, says Mr Khoja: 'Cognito tried to reinvent the wheel by developing its own technology,' he says. His own company, like the other surviving operators in the sector, uses off-the-shelf mobile data systems. And, according to Mr Khoja, Cognito concentrated to heavily on one particular service: two-way paging. It hoped this would help it see a quick return on its investment, but in fact it made the company look like a one-service supplier. 'It was then unable to break out of this mould,' says Mr Khoja. That the mobile data market is potentially large is something on which all involved agree. For many applications, mobile data is much cheaper to use than say cellular or mobile radio. 'Data can be prepared in advance and then sent with no need to enter into long conversations,' says Mr David Pearce, marketing manager for data products and service at Vodata, part of the Vodafone telecommunications service group. All agree that mobile data may make a big difference to a company's bottom line. 'For companies with service or delivery vehicles, often the only competitive advantage is in the actual speed of delivery or service delivered,' says Mr Pearce. But where mobile data runs into problems is with the complexity of its own message. 'It's not an easy buying decision for customers,' says Mr Pearce. 'Remote communications using modems are difficult to use; they require specialist skills in installation and use. This puts many people and companies off using mobile data,' he adds. 'It is a mistake to conceive or portray mobile data as a single product,' says Mr Jonathan Elder, mobile data product manager at Cellnet, the UK cellular service provider. 'Our market research shows that what customers want to do requires a lot of their own development time,' he says. At the same time, his market research shows 'that customers are left cold by current applications', he adds. Even if customers do identify an application for themselves, finding the right operator or working out the cheapest method for their applications may prove to be difficult. Mobile data services are offered by the cellular operators, dedicated mobile data network operators such as Hutchison Mobile Data and Ram Mobile Data, and data over private mobile radio networks. All of these services are offered over different largely incompatible technologies. There is no worldwide standard for mobile data services. Suppliers also find the market a difficult one. Selling cycles are usually four to eight months at the shortest but can often take up to 18 months with up to a three-year return on investment likely. says: 'The different niche markets and fragmented supplier base make this a very difficult market to address.' But, he says, it may be this very diversity which gives the market its greatest strength, as it pushes both suppliers and users towards customised solutions. One way forward for the operators may be to link up with third parties. 'We just offer a simple connectivity service. We are network operators not systems integrators,' says Mr Terry Bowden, managing director of Hutchison Mobile Data. But, he admits, it may be systems integrators that hold the key to addressing the various niches in the mobile data market. Different applications packages may be designed by the systems integrator with an operator to address a particular niche and marketed mainly by the systems integrator. Cellnet is currently trying out a package designed with a systems integrator for motor insurance adjusters to help them work out the fair price for motor insurance claims. It will allow adjusters to access a remote database from the site where the car with the damage is to see what similar claims have recently cost. Another possible application may be for a pensions adviser to offer an instant on-the-spot quote to a customer by being able to consult the office database remotely. Another option may be for a customer who has developed a package for its own needs, to go on to market it to others in its own industry. British Airways, for example, is helping Ram mobile data to sell its specially developed luggage handling mobile data application to other airlines. Like many other mobile communications markets, mobile data is still essentially an immature market. According to Mr Garry Garrard, mobile communications specialist at London based PA Consulting, the mobile data market may develop in three phases: Specific packages for large customers. Off-the-shelf application specific packages. More horizontal off-the-shelf packages. Given time, some believe, the use of mobile data could become as ubiquitous as the facsimile. Combining new digital cellular technologies, such as GSM in Europe, with new forms of sending data - such as light pens which allow the user to enter commands by simply pointing at on-screen symbols could - at sometime in the future, even make the mobile data market into a mass market, says Vodafone's Mr Pearce. 'Imagine a system that can be used over all of Europe where the user interface isn't cable, buttons or keys but just a pen.' Some big names are taking this proposition seriously. Since the launch of Apple's pocket computer, the Newton, this spring, Mr John Sculley of Apple has made it clear that he sees communications as the way forward for the personal computer industry. US telecoms giant AT&amp;T seems to be laying equal value by the contribution pocket computers could make to the telecommunications industry. It is expected soon to announce its own response to the Newton - the Hobbit, a personal communications terminal not only capable of supporting data communications but also of voice and image.</p>

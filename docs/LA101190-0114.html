			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PROBERT'S FIRST GOAL IS A WINNER  </P> <P> Detroit's Bob Probert picked a good time for his first goal of the season.  </P> <P> He scored 4:08 into overtime and capped a three-goal rally as the Red Wings  defeated the Calgary Flames, 6-5, at Detroit Wednesday night for their first  win under new Coach Bryan Murray.  </P> <P> Shawn Burr had tied the game with 58 seconds left in regulation, and Probert  flipped a 10-footer over Rick Wamsley's glove on Detroit's only shot in  overtime.  </P> <P> The Flames, 3-1-0 under new coach Doug Risebrough, led, 5-3, until Lee Norwood  beat Wamsley with a long slap shot with 2:39 remaining. The Red Wings pulled  goaltender Tim Chevaldae with 1:08 to play and Burr tied the game 10 seconds  later, deflecting Steve Chiasson's shot from the right circle behind Wamsley.  </P> <P> Chevaldae preserved the tie with four saves in the overtime as the Red Wings  killed the final 1:54 of a penalty to Chiasson.  </P> <P> The Red Wings were 0-2-1 in their first three games under Murray, who was hired  as coach and general manager after Detroit missed the playoffs last spring.  </P> <P> New York Rangers 4, Washington 2 -- Darren Turcotte had two goals and an  assist, including the tiebreaking short-handed goal at 10:47 of the third  period, and Mike Richter made 40 saves in the Rangers' win over the Capitals at  New York.  </P> <P> Turcotte added an assist on John Ogrodnick's insurance goal 3 1/2 minutes  later.  </P> <P> The Capitals outshot the Rangers, 11-0, in the first five minutes and 42-17 for  the game.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Dave Poulin scored the tiebreaking goal in the second  period to lead the Bruins over the Jets at Winnipeg. It was the fourth  consecutive win for the Bruins.  </P> <P> Dave Christian, Peter Douris and Wes Walz also scored for the Bruins, who  outshot the Jets, 33-30. Pat Elynuik and Danton Cole had goals for Winnipeg,  1-2-1.  </P> <P> Hartford 4, Buffalo 3 -- Kevin Dineen's goal with 7:42 left to play was the  difference in the Whalers' victory over the Sabres at Buffalo.  </P> <P> The Whalers, trailing, 3-2, entering the third period, tied the score on Ulf  Samuelsson's goal at 6:16, then won it when Dineen, assisted by Ray Ferraro  from behind the net, connected on a quick wrist shot near the left post.  </P> <P> Bobby Holik, Czechoslovakian rookie forward, and Randy Cunneyworth also scored  for the Whalers (2-1-1). Christian Ruuttu, Alexander Mogilny and Rick Vaive  scored for the Sabres, 0-2-1.  </P> <P> Quebec 8, Toronto 5 -- Tony McKegney and Joe Sakic each scored two goals to  lead the Nordiques over the Maple Leafs at Toronto.  </P> <P> Mats Sundin, Brian Fogarty, Mike Hough and Guy Lafleur also scored in Quebec's  first win after two defeats and a tie to begin the new season.  </P> <P> Vince Damphousse had two goals and Wendel Clark, Rob Ramage and Dave Hannan one  each for the Leafs, who have struggled with four defeats to open the season.  </P></p>

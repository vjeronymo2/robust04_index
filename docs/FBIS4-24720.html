			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`One Country, Two Systems' Must Not Be </F> Undermined"]    [Text] When delivering a speech in Hong Kong in early May,  Lu Ping pointed out: "It was on the basis of Hong Kong's  economic value that China drew up the current policy on Hong  Kong" and "there are always a handful of people who naively  believe that they can turn Hong Kong into a political city which  can influence the mainland politically." Lu Ping's remark met  with the approval of former Hong Kong Governor Maclehose, who  thought Lu Ping's speech deserved due attention from the people  of Hong Kong.    Former British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe also made a  speech in late May. He pointed out that it is not sensible for  anybody to try using Hong Kong as a "bridgehead" for changing  the mainland, as this might spell destruction for Hong Kong. If  Hong Kong wishes its existing system and lifestyle to be  preserved without intervention from the mainland, Hong Kong  should not be used as a "bridgehead" in any attempt to change  the mainland. We should respect China's idea of not wanting to  be changed or challenged by Hong Kong.    Anson Chan also pointed out on 26 May: "Outsiders come to  Hong Kong, trying to use Hong Kong as a base to carry out  subversive activities or interfere in China's internal affairs.  Naturally, we citizens of Hong Kong do not wish them to use  Hong Kong as such a base."    Why were these remarks made? Because one foreign country at  one time took in a batch of so-called "pro-democracy activists"  who attempted to subvert the Chinese Government, providing them,  in addition to food and clothing, with "political asylum."  These people are indeed very "free" and carefree and have even  managed to move their families abroad, but their bosses do not  want them to stay idle and tell them to return to the mainland  to carry out subversive activities against the Chinese  Government. Han Dongfang's claiming that he would return to the  mainland to organize a solidarity trade union [as published] was  obviously to make trouble out of nothing. Who remitted money to  Han Dongfang to make sure that he had enough to eat and could  carry out anti-China activities? It was none other than the  American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial  Organizations [AFL-CIO], the anticommunist organization which  has been a staunch advocate of economic sanctions against China.  Han Dongfang's recent providers have been the members of the  Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement in  China [ASPDMC].    The mainland's political situation is stable at present, but  some people, relying on the backing of foreign countries, are  running counter to the keen wish of the 1.1 billion Chinese  people to concentrate on economic construction and improving  their livelihood in an environment of stability and unity. They  want to change the mainland's current situation and its system.  Following in Han Dongfang's footsteps, they vie with each other  to get to Hong Kong and put on a "show" first, before moving on  into the mainland via the springboard of Hong Kong to make  trouble. The purpose of such people as Wuer Kaixi, Liu Binyan,  and Ruan Mingzhi [7086 6900 0037] in coming to Hong Kong is none  other than to join the ASPDMC, fan the flames of disorder, and  "put out feelers" before returning to the mainland to make  trouble. They want, first of all, to sound out the political  climate in Hong Kong; second, to elicit a response from the  mainland with Hong Kong as the bridgehead; and third, to try to  drag out their stay in Hong Kong, just like Han Dongfang.    The purpose of their transferring the base for challenging  and confronting the mainland to Hong Kong is obviously to drag  Hong Kong into the political whirlpool; undermine the  relationship of harmonious coexistence between Hong Kong and the  mainland; and therefore damage the prosperity, stability, and  smooth transition of Hong Kong and change the orientation of  "one country, two systems."    The feasibility of "one country, two systems" is subject to  the prerequisite that the system of socialism is not interfered  with, subverted, or sabotaged and that Hong Kong's economic  development is conducive to socialist construction. This is  where the value of a capitalist Hong Kong lies. If some people  attempt to change the system of socialism using the system of  capitalism, they are bound to cause clashes and confrontation  between Hong Kong and the mainland, which would spell disaster  to Hong Kong. The implication of Hong Kong's being an economic  city is that it plays a positive role in the development of the  Chinese economy. If Hong Kong becomes a political city and is  used by some people as a base for changing the mainland's  political system, the mainland will certainly consider  responding to the act of one system interfering in another.    The wish of the 6 million Hong Kong people is that the  mainland system will not change the system in Hong Kong. This  wish has been respected by the mainland, which set it down in  Annex 1 of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. But the  mainland's wish is that Hong Kong should also respect the system  of the mainland and not attempt to change it. Jiang Zemin  delivered a well-known speech on "well water not mixing with  river water." Is it not very unfair if Hong Kong does not  respect the wish of the mainland and yet hopes that the mainland  will respect the wish of the Hong Kong people?    Respect is mutual. Only when two systems respect each other  can one country, two systems be implemented. If one system does  not respect the other system and tries to bring it down, the  implementation of "one country, two systems" will suffer. The  ASPDMC's recent statement of its position indicates that they  are impenetrably thick-headed. They still want to use Hong Kong  as a base to carry on with the confrontation. This is like  playing with fire that will make Hong Kong and the people of  Hong Kong suffer.</p>

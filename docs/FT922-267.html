			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Broader range of indicators sought AS ECONOMISTS mull over their inability to plot the path of the longest UK recession for 50 years, they are examining a broader range of indicators. But many economists and statisticians are sceptical about data that provide a less than complete picture of a specific part of the economy, or are derived from relatively new surveys and so lack historical perspective. Many potentially interesting statistics are also guarded jealously on the grounds of commercial secrecy. The new approaches attempt to add new sources of data. They include: A new industrial panel convened by the Treasury. This met for the first time last week. It comprises Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, and Mr Colin Mowl, head Treasury forecaster, with about eight industry economists. It is an effort by the Treasury to build stronger links with private-sector economists. Better insights into retailing. The Central Statistical Office is attempting to improve its monthly survey of the sector while 30 large retailers are providing their own sales index, updated weekly. The figures are not made public because some stores are concerned about giving information to rivals. Monitoring the telephone system. The Treasury put out feelers to British Telecom, Britain's biggest telephone group, to see if it would provide regular statistics on voice and computer traffic, which could provide useful clues to economic activity. BT refused, saying the statistics could be commercially sensitive. But Mr John Leighfield, chairman of AT&amp;T Istel, a large manager of private-sector computer networks says he is keen in principle to make some sales data available to the Treasury to help monitor economic change. Information from specific industries. Detailed statistics on recruitment advertising - a useful bellwether of confidence and activity in large companies - are available from a range of consultancies. Hotel occupancy. That is thought to be a good indicator of trends in the consumer and business sectors. Horwath Consulting, leisure consultants, every month asks a sample of about 400 hotels about business patterns. New packages of indicators. The consultancy Oxford Economic Forecasting says it has had a lot of interest from the private sector in efforts to provide a snapshot of change in the economy based on specific figures about, for instance, electricity use. The CSO is also attempting to modernise its package of 'cyclical indicators' which attempts to do much the same thing.</p>

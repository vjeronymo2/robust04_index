			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / 'Greater flexibility in EMS required' THE European Monetary System had to work more flexibly, with more timely and more frequent realignments, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said in Davos yesterday. Describing the lessons learnt from September's currency turmoil, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said monetary integration had to follow, not lead, economic convergence. In addition to the economic strains which contributed to September's upheaval, there had also been a strong element of political pride, and a reluctance to face the need for a realignment. Looking ahead, he said the official timetable for monetary union under the Maastricht treaty might no longer be realistic. But it would be a mistake to sacrifice convergence objectives in order to meet the Maastricht deadlines. A Europe moving at different speeds might be inevitable, he said. It would 'not be a big deal'. But it would be a mistake for any one country to rush into a currency union before Europe was ready. Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he took a highly pragmatic view of the future, and had not lost sight of the monetary union objective, which he believed Europe would achieve 'at some time'. Such a regime would be free from the distortions of political influence - and would be built on the basis of independent central banks.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cost reductions point way foward for Pilkington MR ROGER Leverton, who joined Pilkington as chief executive last summer, said there were some positive signs within the glass group's annual results despite the fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 95.7m - restated from Pounds 77m to comply with FRS 3 - to Pounds 40.7m and the reduced dividend. He said that for the first time cost reductions had more than offset inflation. During the year costs of Pounds 70m had been taken out while inflation had increased costs by Pounds 66m. Over the last three years annual costs of Pounds 170m had been cut, largely through job reductions. Cash flow excluding disposals, but before dividends, was positive in the second half of the year for the first time since 1990, he said. Capital expenditure had been reduced to Pounds 128m in the year, below the depreciation charge for the first time since the mid-1980s. Mr Leverton said it would stay at about the Pounds 125m level for the next couple of years. Working capital had also been cut, by Pounds 30m in the year and by Pounds 250m since 1990. However, trading results from each of the group's divisions were lower, except for the rest of the world group which includes Argentina, Brazil and Australasia. Operating profits from continuing businesses in European glass fell 29 per cent to Pounds 37.5m, while North American profits dropped 68 per cent to Pounds 3.5m. In both areas excess glass-making capacity had put pressure on prices. The rest of the world increased profits 80 per cent to Pounds 39m with Argentina making a record profit and the Australian business benefiting from cost cutting. Visioncare, the spectacle and contact lens business, saw profits down from Pounds 20.9m to Pounds 18.8m, although within that the Sola spectacle side, which is soon to be sold, increased profits; contact lens profits fell from Pounds 5m to Pounds 2m. Gearing at the year end was 78 per cent with net debt, including finance leases, of Pounds 932m (Pounds 760m). The Heywood Williams acquisition would take gearing to about 88 per cent, Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said. However, the sale of Sola was expected to be agreed soon, he said, and would be for a 'good premium over book value of Pounds 120m'. That would 'make a substantial dent in gearing'. More disposals over the next two years would bring gearing down further. Pilkington is expected to reduce its stake in the Australian operations to 50 per cent and is likely to sell its contact lens business once profits there recover.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: DREXEL WAS NO SURPRISE BUT MARKET'S CALM WAS  </P> <P> What was the biggest surprise last week? To many on Wall Street, it wasn't that  Drexel Burnham Lambert was forced into bankruptcy. That was expected.  </P> <P> More surprising was that the financial markets reacted as calmly as they did as  Drexel was going out of business.  </P> <P> "I'm amazed at how the Drexel event was absorbed without a ripple," says Donald  Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Group. "It does  seem that somebody in Washington has done a good bid of homework since 1987 to  handle special events."  </P> <P> The fact that the stock and bond markets barely shrugged this past Monday,  Tuesday and Wednesday as Drexel was self-destructing brought out the conspiracy  theories. These are the same theories that surfaced Oct. 16, the first trading  day after the Oct. 13 mini-crash. And the theories are similar to those  expressed by many after the crash of October, 1987, when people speculated that  somehow the government intervened to stabilize stock prices.  </P> <P> The government has always denied that it would interfere in the stock market,  and nothing can prove that to the contrary. But that didn't stop some market  pros last week from suspecting that the subtle hand of Washington was again at  work.  </P> <P> In Chicago, for instance, the stock index futures markets were buzzing with  rumors that Washington was putting pressure on big trading houses to give the  market a lift.  </P> <P> "I heard those rumors," says one futures trader. "I don't think the government  is pressuring people to buy. Maybe there is a certain amount of jawboning and  encouragement not to force the market down."  </P> <P> There could, of course, be another explanation for the nonchalance. Drexel has  been in trouble for a long time, and the markets may have already made price  adjustments in case of its demise.  </P> <P> "The (bankruptcy) filing was largely anticipated by the market," says James  Rosenfeld, finance professor at Emory University. "Everybody was aware of the  financial woes." In fact, Rosenfeld feels that the markets may have skipped  right over the bad news and started looking at the bright side.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve may have to reduce interest rates to keep other Wall Street  firms solvent, says Rosenfeld.  </P> <P> But keep the Drexel situation in perspective.  </P> <P> Interest rates are all that the financial markets really care about. If the  Drexel bankruptcy had affected borrowing costs, then it would have been of  major importance to the stock market.  </P> <P> In the weeks ahead -- when Drexel is long forgotten -- Wall Street will still  be concerned about rising foreign interest rates and this nation's sluggish  economy.  </P> <P> And unless there is a sudden improvement in rates there or the economy here,  the stock market will still be on shaky ground.  </P> <P> Where are interest rates going? John Paulus, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.'s chief  economist, said last week that he thinks they'll climb.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coniston Bid for UAL May Depend on Arbs  </P> <P> Are Coniston Partners' chances of beating UAL Corp.'s board in a proxy battle  slipping away?  </P> <P> Coniston and UAL would agree that the number of shares of the airline company  in the hands of arbitragers, or speculators, has fallen dramatically in the  past few months. Arbs, of course, are the natural allies of Coniston in any  proxy fight.  </P> <P> Coniston and UAL try to keep track of the holdings of arbs through informal  surveys. Last week, UAL's proxy solicitation firm, Kissel-Blake Inc., quietly  called arbs and, I'm told, estimated that these speculators hold about 6  million of UAL's 22 million outstanding shares. At the peak, they were believed  to have owned 9.5 million to 10 million. But the sharp plunge in UAL's stock in  recent months has caused many to liquidate.  </P> <P> Coniston Partners, which has been threatening a proxy fight since last year,  owns 2.6 million UAL shares. That means that if Coniston decides to go forward  with a proxy contest -- or its close cousin, a consent solicitation -- it would  have to win the vote of approximately 2.5 million shares to achieve a majority.  </P> <P> While it is still very likely that Coniston will win, any further reduction in  the number of shares held by arbs won't make the effort any easier. It could be  especially difficult to oust the board if Coniston can't come up with an  alternative that UAL shareholders find more attractive than whatever the  company's board ends up proposing.  </P> <P> Coniston was to have begun a consent solicitation in January, but it backed off  from that threat when it looked as though UAL was making progress in its  efforts for a buyout led by management and the airline's unions.  </P> <P> It is now February, and UAL is still trying to structure some sort of buyout or  restructuring. A couple of times each week, Coniston, the unions representing  UAL employees and the company's management get together at the New York offices  of First Boston Corp., the investment banking firm, to discuss the situation.  While these meeting are supposed to be secret, Wall Street keeps very close  tabs of when they occur. The only thing that Wall Street doesn't know is the  amount of progress being made behind closed doors.  </P> <P> Coniston is said to be happy with the progress of the talks. That's why there  hasn't been much gossip lately about a proxy battle. But if Coniston should  become dissatisfied at some point, it is going to wish it had more help from  arbs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long-Distance Carriers Not Much Different  </P> <P> You've seen the commercials: A guy on a pay phone tries to call Phoenix and  accidentally gets Fiji. He becomes so frustrated that he vows to go back to the  good service of AT&amp;T.  </P> <P> MCI Communications makes similar claims for the quality of its long-distance  telephone service. So does US Sprint.  </P> <P> Which service is really the best? Smith Barney, Harris Upham recently surveyed  managers of corporate telephone systems and found that there really isn't much  difference in quality.  </P> <P> Smith Barney says it sent out 110 questionnaires in its second annual survey.  Of the 52 people who returned them, 48 said they managed annual budgets of $1  million or more.  </P> <P> The managers were asked to rate the long-distance carriers on a scale of 1 to 5  (with 5 being best) in network quality, service and sales. In quality, AT&amp;T  got a 4.2 rating, Sprint 3.9. and MCI 3.5. AT&amp;T also led in service with a  3.6 rating, followed by Sprint and MCI tied at 3.3. In sales, Sprint led with  3.4, AT&amp;T was second at 3.2 and MCI third with 3.1.  </P> <P> Overall, AT&amp;T's rating was 4.2, Sprint's 3.9 and MCI's 3.5.  </P> <P> Analyst Charles Schelke, who conducted the poll, concluded that the  long-distance phone companies were "generally comparable." He told clients in a  report called TeleTrends that "while all carriers now appear to be providing  satisfactory service, no one is consistently providing exceptional service."  </P> <P> Incidentally, AT&amp;T did moderately better in this survey than in a similar  poll Smith Barney conducted a year earlier. MCI did a tiny bit better, and  Sprint's rate was unchanged.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Beware Greenspan's Soothing Forecasts  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan pulled off a magic trick a few weeks  ago when he calmed a jittery stock market and pacified Congress by saying the  chances of an economic recession have been reduced. But just how good a  forecaster has Greenspan been?  </P> <P> Take a look at his predictions in 1981, the last time that the nation's economy  slipped into a recession, and you'll see that sometimes his crystal ball gets a  little foggy.  </P> <P> In April, 1981, Greenspan -- then a private economist but also an unofficial  adviser to President Reagan -- predicted that the U.S.' gross national product  would grow 0.7% in the third quarter. But by August, Greenspan had dramatically  changed his opinion -- predicting, instead, that GNP would decline 1.1%.  </P> <P> The change came after a government report in July said business conditions were  weakening. According to the Commerce Department, the GNP actually grew by 1.8%  in third quarter 1981.  </P> <P> Greenspan further predicted that April that GNP would grow 3.6% in the fourth  quarter. But by August he was predicting a decline of 0.2%. The economy  actually declined 5.5% that quarter.  </P> <P> Also in that month, Greenspan predicted that the U.S. economy would grow by  3.8% in the first quarter of 1982. He changed that estimate in August to an  increase of just 0.8%. GNP actually declined 5.9%.  </P> <P> Two successive quarters of contraction -- as happened in the fourth quarter of  1981 and the first quarter of 1982 -- are popularly defined as a recession.  Greenspan had correctly predicted an economic downturn (albeit a slight one),  but it did take two tries and a little hint from the government before he got  it right.  </P> <P> Greenspan's prediction of a rebound in the first quarter of 1982, of course,  was way off target.  </P> <P> His record got a little better in the second quarter of 1982. Greenspan's  revised estimate of a 3.5% gain in the second quarter of 1982 wasn't too far  off the actual 1.2% growth experienced in that period. But Greenspan went back  to his losing ways with his long-range prediction for the third quarter.  </P> <P> Greenspan's revised forecast in August, 1981, was for 4.3% growth in the third  quarter of 1982. The economy actually declined 3.2% that quarter.  </P> <P> In short, the closest Greenspan had come to spotting a recession was his  prediction of a decline in GNP in the third and fourth quarters of 1981. But he  was forecasting a short, painless downturn. The recession actually lasted,  according to the Commerce Department, from July, 1981, to November, 1982. And  it was anything but painless.  </P> <P> Greenspan, one hopes, has a better feel for the economy now that he has access  to all those government statistics. But the financial markets should also  remember that a Fed chairman can't always be as candid as he'd like to be --  especially if he is trying to calm a jittery nation.  </P></p>

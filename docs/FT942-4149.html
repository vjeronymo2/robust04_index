			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Call to jail De Michelis Milan's public prosecutor yesterday called for Italy's flamboyant former foreign minister, Mr Gianni de Michelis, to be jailed for a year for illicit party financing, judicial sources said. Mr De Michelis, known for his long hair and penchant for disco-dancing, is accused of receiving L200m (Pounds 83,500) in bribes for his Socialist party from a Milan-based company. The former minister has denied the charge.</p>

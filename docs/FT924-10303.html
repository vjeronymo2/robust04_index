			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: Fanuc earnings tumble to Y16bn in first half FANUC, the leading Japanese equipment maker for machine tools, saw non-consolidated profits for the six months to September tumble, due to a sharp fall in corporate capital spending. The company's pre-tax profits for the first half fell 47.8 per cent to Y16.2bn (Dollars 131m) on a 26.5 per cent decline in sales to Y62.2bn. After-tax profits fell 46.3 per cent to Y9.27bn, compared with Y17.27bn in the same period of the previous year. At the operating level, profits fell to Y11.02bn compared with Y23.09bn the previous year. Sales of Fanuc's numerically controlled systems fell 31.4 per cent to Y25.7bn due to sluggish orders from machine tool makers, while the fall in demand from automotive manufacturers resulted in a 7 per cent fall in robot sales to Y10.7bn. Overall orders for the first six months declined 27.4 per cent to Y61.1bn. For the full year, Fanuc expects a continuing fall in demand to push pre-tax profits down 40.9 per cent to Y30.8bn on a 20.2 per cent decline in sales to Y124.2bn. After-tax profits are projected to fall 42.3 per cent to Y17.3bn. The company will spend Y8.7bn on plant and equipment for the current year as originally planned. It has agreed to an unchanged dividend of Y9 per share.</p>

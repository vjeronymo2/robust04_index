"If they  don't get in the end zone, it's not dangerous. They got down there, and our  defense wouldn't let them in."  </P> <P> Shell on the Raiders scoring 24 points for four consecutive weeks: "If we could  score three points and win the football game, that's all I care about," he  said. "I don't care about statistics, I just want to win." . . . The Raiders  are 4-0 against AFC West opponents. CHRIS DUFRESNE  </P></p>

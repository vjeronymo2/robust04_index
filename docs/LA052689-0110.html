			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> NATURAL HABITAT RECONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> Recent news articles reported a search for natural habitats that could be  improved or built to offset the destruction of wetlands by the ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach. Among habitats being considered are new artificial  reefs off the local coastline, but such reefs do not meet federal and state  criteria and do not compete with tide pools in the production of flora and  fauna.  </P> <P> The best habitat to reconstruct is the beach, tidal and sub-tidal areas in the  Abalone Cove-Portuguese Bend landslide areas. About two miles of coastline have  been severely damaged and neglected for years. The sand beaches and productive  tide pool areas have been replaced or covered with landslide debris consisting  of small rocks and cobbles that support very little sea life. The sub-tidal  area that was reef rock and sand is now covered with silt mud that has  smothered most of the flora and fauna. Near-shore sea life can't compete with  loose rocks and mud.  </P> <P> Let's rectify the damage that started in 1956. State and federal laws require  that habitats destroyed by planned port construction be offset by repairing  conditions elsewhere -- in this case, the Portuguese Bend and Abalone Cove  areas.  </P> <P> The repair of the Portuguese Bend coastal area (splash zone, tidal and  sub-tidal areas) involving 100 acres will very likely be as valuable to the  ocean environment as the Seal Beach (Naval) Weapons Station wetlands  reconstruction.  </P> <P> WILLIAM R.

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc and krone fall again The French franc and Danish krone fell close to historic lows against the D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism yesterday as dealers took the view that their policy of keeping short term interest rates high would not work, writes James Blitz. France negative reserves position continued to work against the franc's favour yesterday because dealers believe that the French authorities must buy D-Marks to rebuild reserves and repay the Bundesbank for its support defending the currency in the ERM. Mr Edouard Balladur's strong hint on French tv on Thursday night that French rates would remain high did not help the currency. Nor, too, did his suggestion that France was seeking ways of controlling currency speculation: one analyst suggested yesterday that this might be enough to encourage some major players to hedge their bond exposures. The franc therefore closed at FFr3.538 from a previous FFr. 3.514. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation, believes that the franc is heading for FFr3.60 in the next few weeks. 'If France does not reduce rates, it could go lower,' he said. The rest of Europe was dominated by D-Mark strength. The Danish krone fell sharply to a low of DKr4.1400 against the German currency, having been at DKr4.1200 at the start of the day. Even the Dutch guilder came under attack at one stage; dealers have at various stages this week wondered about the credibility of the more closely tied currencies in Europe. At the close of ERM trading yesterday, there were some 8.43 percentage points dividing the strongest and weakest ERM currencies. The yen was, again, the other source of interest touching a new high of Y101.80 in Europe, before closing at Y102.20. The Bank of Japan intervened again in the currency market. But the Japanese currency was boosted by comments from Mr Walter Mondale, the new US ambassador to Tokyo, who said that reduction of the trade deficit with Japan was one of his highest priorities. Many dealers are convinced that the currency will break the Y100 level soon, although there are expectations that the new Japanese government could order a cut in the Official Discount Rate at its cabinet meeting on Thursday. Sterling fell back sharply on all fronts yesterday, partly hindered by D-Mark strength but also by perceptions that the UK's economic data earlier this week were worse than expected. there is bullish talk in UK money markets about a near-term cut in base rates. The pound closed at DM2.4975, down 2 pfennigs on the day.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Books: A dubious victory and kinky sex - Fiction ARCADIA by Jim Crace Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 352 pages VOX by Nicholson Baker Granta Books Pounds 7.99, 169 pages REAL LIFE by DJ Taylor Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 265 pages KORZENIOWSKI by James Lansbury Serpent's Tail Pounds 7.99, 176 pages JIM CRACE'S first two novels, Continents and The Gift of Stones, were triumphant leaps of literary imagination, utterly compelling fables set in other worlds, other times. Though his third novel displays much of the skill of his previous work, this time the magic is strangely lacking. Arcadia tells the story of Victor, an 80-year-old millionaire who, haunted by memories of his impoverished youth, decides to clear out his unnamed city's market district in order to build a modern shopping mall as a monument to his long-dead mother. In this, he is opposed by Rook, an embittered former employee who becomes an agitator on behalf of the city's threatened marketeers. Their conflict climaxes in a New Year's Eve conflagration that leaves one dead and the other grasping a dubious victory. Although it starts strongly, Arcadia soon organises itself along such conventional lines - corrupt city versus idealised country, vain wealth versus humble industry - that it eventually loses its power. Crace is too intent on myth-making here, forgetting that a fable must grow out of a story rather than be imposed upon it. His diffuse, ornate style tends to obscure his drama and flatten out his characters. The section dealing with Victor's childhood, spent publicly sucking at his beggar mother's breast until the age of six, is original and affecting, though the elderly Victor is nothing more than a papery old cipher, wandering his penthouse at night, dreaming rather dubiously of innocence. Likewise with Rook, who starts out as an intriguing social climber but ends up a problematic avatar. And the calamitous ending seems more a product of an authorial scheme than any internal combustion. Nicholson Baker's much-hyped Vox involves a single conversation on an adult chat line between a couple who end up sharing their innermost fantasies and secrets in a pas de deux of mutual arousal. Jim is fascinated by the mechanics of female masturbation, while Abby has fantasies about being serviced by a squad of house painters. Linked only by satellite, they verbally probe their way toward mutual climax. Baker has hit upon a very contemporary notion - the complicity of sex and telecommunications - and brings to bear upon it his much-celebrated power of minute observation. But where this style served him well in his earlier work exami ning a lunch break or baby care, it seems distinctly undernourished tackling the big theme of sexual imagination. The only thing we ever know about Jim and Abby are the few fantasies they choose to share. This might have worked as a short story or even the first chapter of a novel, but as it is Vox is like overhearing a conversation between strangers one has no hope of encountering again. Despite moments of prurient interest, it remains a slight literary exercise. Kinky sex is also a theme in DJ Taylor's Real Life, the story of Martin Benson, a young pornographer who retreats from Soho to Norwich after a decade spent writing such films as 'Schoolgirl Lust'. Unfortunately, real life in the provinces proves just as trying as make-believe in Soho, with dumpy girlfriend Suzy and dubious mate Fat Eric making demands our hero just cannot meet. To complicate matters further, Martin's prurient past comes back to haunt him in the form of plain brown envelopes filled with some very disturbing photos that start dropping through his letter box. Taylor's novel is engaging and believable, though not quite as funny and racy as you might expect, given the subject matter. He has a strong sense of character and builds his story's momentum nicely, though attempts at Martin Amis-like humour are undercut by stiffly ornate prose and a too-conventional imagination. A good read, but Taylor will do better when he tackles a subject more conducive to his temperament. Korzeniowski is a literary detective novel which examines the events surrounding the composition of Joseph Conrad's short story The Secret Sharer. First-time novelist James Lansbury blends supposedly eyewitness accounts and literary criticism to see if in 1884 Conrad, then a young captain by the name of Korzeniowski, actually did, like the story's narrator, spirit away a fugitive seaman wanted for murder. Although individual parts of the book are well done, especially a Freudian essay and the testimony of an old sea dog who claims Conrad and his sharer were homosexual lovers, Lansbury fails to shape his material into a compelling narrative. Devoted fans of Conrad and practitioners of textual analysis may find much of interest here, though the general reader will be rather less satisfied.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE may relax trading restrictions The Tokyo stock exchange (TSE) is considering whether to ease trading restrictions on newly listed shares ahead of the listing of Japan Tobacco, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The TSE hopes an easing of restrictions will reduce excessive share price volatility when JT is listed on October 27. This is an attempt to prevent a repeat of the chaos which followed the listing in 1993 of East Japan Railway, a TSE official said. 'To prevent excessive share price volatility after the listing of JT, we are looking at a number of measures, including allowing share prices to fluctuate more than at present,' said the official. Share prices of new listings are now allowed to fluctuate by 15 per cent. The official declined to say how much this range might be increased. He also declined to say what other measures to reduce volatility were being considered and when they might be introduced.</p>

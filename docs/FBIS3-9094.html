			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Zagreb, March 20 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs have  agreed to a second aid convoy for the northern Bosnian Moslem  town of Maglaj as the first one arrived Sunday, providing its  first supplies since October, a UN official said. The new convoy  should leave from Zagreb Monday, travelling through the  Serb-held town of Banja Luka, said Peter Kessler, spokesman for  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The second  10-truck run will provide a real test of Serb will to allow  humanitarian aid for the 100,000 people living in the enclave,  which has been under Serb siege since mid-1993. [passage omitted]    "It's wonderful, we all are very pleased, we finally  succeeded," said Kris Janowksi, a UNHCR spokesman in Sarajevo.  Janowski said several additional convoys are scheduled in coming  days to assist the region's war-weary population, described in a  recent UN report as walking skeletons. On Sunday, the Bosnian  Serb army denied Croat reports that it was retreating from  Maglaj to the town of Teslic, 20 kilometres (12 miles) further  north-west. Croatian Radio said the withdrawal followed an  ultimatum by the HVO commander in Zepce, a Croat enclave 20  kilometres south of Maglaj. In a statement carried by the local  Serb agency SRNA, a commander of the First Army Corps of the  self-styled Bosnian Serb Republic described the report as "pure  disinformation and a propaganda action by the Croat media." Serb  forces "are not withdrawing and their heavy arms are not  blocked," said the statement.</p>

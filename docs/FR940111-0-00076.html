Vol. II, 678 (funeral homes refrained from increasing prices for professional services even more than they did because of the GPL).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See R&hyph;B&hyph;5 (SBP) at 42297.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The funeral home industry is classified by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce in the standard industrial classification scheme (SIC) as a ``service'' industry, because, like other service industries, it sells services as well as goods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 76, 79&hyph;80. Even if overall industry compliance were higher and consumer expenditures still remained unchanged, the level of expenditures is not the sole test of the Rule's benefits. As the BE staff stated in its report, expenditures may rise as a result of price increases related to funeral homes' fixed costs that are not associated with any costs of Rule compliance. The record evidence indicates, in fact, that Rule compliance has not significantly increased funeral providers' costs or prices, that consumer expenditures and funeral prices, when compared to other service industries, have not increased above inflation, and that an industry ``price consciousness'' induced by the availability of the GPL may have tempered price increases. If the Rule's only benefit were to increase informed consumer choice (without imposing substantial costs on industry), regardless of whether some chose to spend more for their arrangements than they would have without the Rule, that benefit would likely justify retention of the Rule because other consumers would have the right to choose to spend less. The Commission in its 1982 SBP for the Rule so stated the Rule's purpose. The record evidence in fact indicates that many consumers will purchase fewer funeral items or less-expensive services as a result of informed choice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 69 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Funeral Service Insider,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> March 20, 1989, at 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to these benefits, record evidence discussed above suggests that the Rule has helped increase consumers' awareness of prices and service options as factors to consider in making funeral purchase decisions. Many consumers choose low-cost funeral homes and caskets competitively offered by third-party providers, and consumers who chose cremation in 1987 purchased fewer caskets and embalming than in 1981. Finally, that evidence indicated that consumers now decline items once included in packaged funerals, and increasingly choose less-expensive cremation alternatives. <FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 70 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although the record evidence supports the conclusion that the Rule facilitates consumers' choice of cremation, the degree to which the Rule has affected the cremation rate is unclear from the record evidence. The NFDA suggested that the Rule has not played an important role in the steadily increasing cremation rate, because the increase began in the early 1970s and is based primarily on changing social and moral values, as well as on the wishes of the deceased, and not on price concerns. The CANA and the AARP, in contrast, asserted that the Funeral Rule proceedings, which also began in the early 1970s, as well as the Rule itself, substantially increased publicity about the cremation alternative, and that many consumers do choose cremation based on price and other considerations. The CANA also provided evidence that the marketing of cremation options has dramatically increased since the Rule's inception.

In 1987, those figures declined to 9% (unneeded embalming) and 2% (unneeded caskets), respectively. See R&hyph;M&hyph;5 (Staff Rebuttal) at 9; R&hyph;B&hyph;2 (RS) and R&hyph;B&hyph;3 (BLS) data tapes. The decline in unneeded casket purchases is statistically significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Record data also indicate that those arguably ``unneeded'' casket purchases occurred in many cases as a result of funeral director misrepresentations. Those data show that in all but one case, in instances where cremation was selected, consumers purchased a casket when told that one was required_8 of 9 instances in 1981, and 2 of 2 in 1987.

See R&hyph;B&hyph;2 at IV&hyph;8; R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 39, n. 149. The 26% figure may be somewhat overstated, however, because, unlike the RS, the 1981 BLS question did not include a response category permitting the compliant statement that an unfinished wood box (an alternative container that is arguably a type of casket) was required. Eleven percent of the 1987 RS respondents answered the question that way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In 1981, 19% of BLS respondents thought that caskets were required for cremation (vs. 13% in 1987); 61% said that embalming was always required (vs. 50% in 1987); and 60% in 1981 believed that a sealed casket preserved remains for an indefinite time (vs. 42% in 1987).

Costs to providers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the Rule has begun to provide benefits to consumers, empirical evidence demonstrates that its requirements have not been a significant contributing factor to increases in funeral home costs of doing business or funeral home prices, or to any reduction of overall consumer satisfaction with funeral services. Funeral provider groups, however, asserted that the Rule has imposed on providers a variety of increased costs, most notably for personnel as a result of a 23-minute average increase in the duration of the arrangements conference, and for business expenses such as printing, accounting and legal services. These costs, those groups said, have been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, particularly for professional services. <FOOTCITE>77</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, e.g., R&hyph;M&hyph;9 (NFDA/NSM) at 62&hyph;76, 89&hyph;96 and McChesney, HX&hyph;126&hyph;A at 52&hyph;53, 86&hyph;89.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Malaysia Defense Minister </F> Mohamed Najib by ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter Osamu Daiwa in Kuala  Lumpur; date not given]    [Text] At a recent interview with an ASAHI SHIMBUN  reporter, Defense Minister Mohamed Najib, man of influence in  Malaysian politics, revealed that he is going to push through an  armaments modernization plan on the ground that "it is now an  unpredictable and uncertain period of time, despite the fact  that the Cold War rivalries among the big powers are gone." He  added that "he would avoid relying on either of the big powers  for weapons supply," and made it clear that Malaysia will  continue to purchase weapons not only from the United States but  also from a number of countries, including Russian-made MiG  fighters. He also emphasized the necessity of expanding  multilateral dialogue to prevent conflicts. He made it clear  that he would request from Japan the knowhow and money for  maintaining the security of the Malacca Straits.    As for foreign relations, including those with the United  States and Europe, the defense minister stressed that "ours is  based on mutual respect." He made reference to press reports on  suspected scandals involving Malaysian Government leaders in  such projects as the British export of weapons and construction  of power plants developing into the economic sanctions against  the United Kingdom. He said, "I do not intend to apply pressure  on mass media but I have to give signals that unfounded slanders  against foreign leaders cannot be tolerated."    With reference to guaranteeing security, he said:  "Modernizing outdated defense capabilities is a priority for  the security of Malaysia, situated in a geopolitial location  surrounded by wide seas. It is not intended to respond to  specific threats but is a due conclusion of logic.  Modernization of armaments is different from expansion of  armaments."    At the same time, he made a point of emphasizing  independence  in choosing armaments and techniques by saying "you cannot rely  on outsiders for security." As for the kind of the  next-generation fighter planes for which hot contests have been  waged by U.S. F-18's and Russian MiG-29's, he made it public  that MiGs are included as a future choice. Leading Defense  Ministry officials present at the interview said: "It is based  on the policy of avoiding reliance on one country in weapons  purchases."    In the meantime, the defense minister said: "Security must  be dealt with in a broad sense, including economy, psychology,  sentiments, and welfare and environmental problems as well as  from a military point of view. It is rather dangerous to think  of filling the power vacuum caused by post-Cold War changes of  the big powers. Importance must be attached to the maintenance  of good relations, with emphasis on economy, with all countries."    Based on that viewpoint, he pointed out "the importance of  preventive diplomacy based on military [preparedness]." He  placed a high value on ASEAN's first security forum to be  participated in by Japan and the United States and so on in late  July at Bangkok by saying that "it shows that trust is being  built up." As for the Asia Pacific Economic Council [APEC], he  said, "We will join in so far as it does not incorporate ASEAN  or institutionalize it."    He said that "he believes that Prime Minister D.S. Mahathir  bin Mohamed will participate" in the APEC summit to be convened  in Jakarta at the end of the year.    With reference to China, he "hopes for it to continue  policies to encourage foreign investments for its economic  modernization and does not anticipate security problems, at  least for a short while." He added: "But I understand that  China has lingering domestic problems. I am closely following  what movements the Chinese leadership will make after Deng  Xiaoping and on the modernization of armaments, including the  introduction of long-range bombers and aircraft carriers."    As for Vietnam, he said: "Now is the time for her to share  the development and prosperity of Southeast Asia," welcomed "her  restored relation with the United States," and made public that  he intends to lead other nations in assisting her participation  in ASEAN.    With regards to Japan, he looks forward to more  contributions  to the area in economic, technical, and medical fields and asked  Japan to "share efforts in maintaining security" in the Malacca  Straits. As for the East Asia Economic Council being promoted by  Malaysia, he asked for Japanese agreement by saying: "I am  waiting, although I have not obtained any new indication." At  the same time, he indicated that he would press for more opening  up of markets by saying: "The Japanese markets are very  important to our country in the course of pursuing  industrialization."    Defense Minister Najib -- number three man in UMNO [the  United Malays National Organization], a national organization of  Malays as well as the ruling political party. Son of the late  Razhak, the second prime minister after independence. After  graduating from a British university he served in important  government posts. Though young at age 40, he is regarded as the  man of influence next to Prime Minister Mahathir and D.S. Anwar  bin Ibrahim, deputy prime minister and finance minister.</p>

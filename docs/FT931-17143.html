			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Reality belies the European dream: Political compromises and confusion likely to delay a barrier-free common market THE European Community yesterday became a 12-nation single market but was forced to concede that the free movement of people, goods, capital and services within the EC was not yet a reality. All internal EC border checks on goods were abolished at midnight on December 31, and the European Commission declared that the Community had adopted 95 per cent of the 300 measures proposed when the single-market project was launched in 1985. Six members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) are set to join the free-trade area during 1993 when the European Economic Area comes into being. But in practice, confusion, omissions, delays and the inevitable political compromises mean the Community is unlikely to realise the aim of the 1957 Treaty of Rome - to establish a barrier-free European common market - before the end of the millennium. Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, declined to fete the arrival of the market. He argued that it would not be appropriate and that as a gradual process the single-market project was never supposed to end with a 'big bang' on January 1 1993. In a statement released yesterday, he said: 'We shall have to display a more active presence together in global affairs relating to peace, liberty, respect for others and solidarity with the poor worldwide. The task is immense but it can be carried out successfully.' For the EC's 344m inhabitants - and travellers within the Community - the immediate effect of the legislation that came into force yesterday will be limited. The main change is the abolition of limits on the goods individuals can carry across internal borders. Travellers can now return home with as much alcohol, tobacco and other goods as they want, having paid tax where they bought the items. But national authorities can carry out spot-checks and seek proof that the goods are for personal use or consumption. For many regular travellers within the EC, the greatest disappointment will be the failure of member states to lift passport checks at internal frontiers. Passengers on flights within the EC will still have to show passports at airports until December at least, when most terminals should have adapted to the changes. Nine continental members of the EC will try to abolish other controls on people by the middle of this year, if external frontier controls are strengthened. But Britain, Denmark and Ireland could well persist with passport checks beyond 1993. To a large extent, EC businesses have already adapted to the single market. Its announcement helped fuel the boom of the late 1980s and many companies have already restructured to take account of existing and proposed legislation lifting barriers to trade. Exchange controls in all but four EC members were lifted by mid-1990, for example. Ireland yesterday joined Portugal and Spain in lifting controls reimposed during the autumn currency crisis. Only Greece has been granted a delay in liberalising capital movements. Alongside the abolition of border controls on goods, yesterday was the birthday of a new system for collecting and monitoring value added tax and excise duty. The new regime abolishes 60m forms which had to be filled in by business each year, but traders complain that new administrative burdens have been imposed. They also fear confusion about the application of the new rules will undermine its benefits during the first few months of operation. From now on EC banks are also free to set up branches anywhere in the Community, and government curbs on the setting of air fares have been lifted  -a move which could herald cheaper air travel. Utilities and public authorities also have to open all contracts, except those in services, to competition. But recent breakthroughs allowing stockbrokers and banks to deal on stock exchanges across Europe will not come into force until 1996 at the earliest, and legislation enabling insurance companies to set up anywhere and sell policies across borders does not take effect until 1994.</p>

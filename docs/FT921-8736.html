			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Property: Sold, the broken dreams of a market under the hammer - A look at the crowds hoping to pick up a cut-price repossessed home at a property auction in London THE LANTERN-JAWED assistant auctioneer holds the telephone receiver tightly to his chest. 'She's got the money for the arrears,' he tells the young man standing opposite. Paul Milner, the legal representative overseeing the forced sale of the caller's repossessed property, inspects his notes. 'No,' he replies, and records the event in a notebook while the woman is informed of the curt response. 'It's a ruse,' he says. 'At this stage they'll try anything. She has had ample time in which to settle, and we have tried everything to get her to pay.' The high drama being played behind the auctioneer's rostrum goes unnoticed by the 1,000 buyers packed into a west London hotel to bid for the catalogue of properties, many of them the result of bad debts and repossessions. 'The proportion of the auction market taken up by repossessions has grown markedly in the last year,' says Robin Cripp, deputy chairman of Barnard Marcus and chief auctioneer for the two-day sale. 'In the last six months they have been arriving in bulk.' As repossessions have risen so, too, has consumer interest in auctions. The attendance at last month's sale was more than double the usual size. More than 9,000 catalogues were requested, an increase of 3,500 on last time. Unprecedented demand has forced General Accident Properties to close its books for an auction later this month. 'There is only so much one can sell in a day,' says Maureen Freeman, business and development director for GA Properties. 'The response has been quite outstanding. Auctions are showing the first signs of a tentative revival in the general market.' Even so, Freeman believes that the fundamental problem of oversupply (caused chiefly by repossessions) will continue to be a drag on any recovery. 'Although some official statistics were indicating about 80,000 repossessions in 1991, the real figure was far higher, probably in the order of 110,000,' she says. 'This year it will probably go as high as 150,000 as unemployment compounds problems with arrears.' Some banks and building societies - Alliance &amp; Leicester, Citibank, Bradford &amp; Bingley - have introduced low-start mortgages in an attempt to move repossessed stock off their books. Bradford and Bingley says that since October it has had 33,000 enquiries about its 6.99 per cent low-start mortgage offer, resulting in half of its 2,000 repossessed homes being re-sold. In response to government concern, building societies have also extended the negotiation process on repossessions, leading to a fall in repossessions in January. However, many people in the industry believe this is only a short-term effect of the building societies' new stance. Michael Minahan, manager of the Bradford &amp; Bingley building society branch in Sutton, Surrey, says: 'Since the new year, we have stopped action on a lot of our repossessions. I am due to visit some of our customers on whom we would normally be seeking repossession orders, to discuss their arrears.' But Freeman believes: 'The softer line being taken at the moment by some building societies will just feed through to the repossession figures for the spring.' A report by stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew warns of 'a tidal wave' of 500,000 vacant properties by the end of 1992. A fifth of that total will be caused by a fresh bout of repossessions. A flood of empty property - albeit through the worst of circumstances - would seem to be excellent news for the professional auction buyer. But the rise has been more than matched by an influx of private buyers into the auction market. This has irked the developers. 'The owner occupiers tend to kill it for the dealer,' Robin Cripp agrees. 'They obviously do not need to re-sell the properties, so can bid a higher price than the dealers. Some of them are not too happy about it, I know.' Sohail Sarbuland, a young property developer hoping to add to his company's portfolio of rented accommodation, complains: 'Owner occupiers are pushing prices up for very low-grade houses. They can bid at a level which is pitched right at our profit margin.' Sarbuland was interested in eight houses and expected to buy three. One property he intended to bid for was a freehold three-floor terraced house in West Kensington, London. He reckoned on a top bid of Pounds 100,000, spending a further Pounds 20,000 on improvements, with a year's let followed by a sale at around Pounds 180,000. 'The money we make has got to pay for the interest while we're sitting on the property,' he explains. Bidding started at Pounds 90,000, but soon overtook Sohail Sarbuland's reserve. The house eventually sold for Pounds 120,000 - to a private buyer. Purchasers must pay a 10 per cent deposit on the day of sale, and the balance within 28 days. Auction catalogues are available a month in advance so prospective buyers can inspect properties. Vendors often hold viewing days prior to auction. Michael King, an Essex developer, was another unhappy businessman. 'There were over 100 people at one view I went to - they were queueing all the way round the block. I took one look, and turned my car around and left.' He had, he admits, broken one of his own golden rules of looking at a property in an area off his regular patch. 'The best buys are outside London  -where fewer people will be bothered to go and view the property.' By the time the auction starts, latecomers are struggling to get through the doors. Nearly everyone carries a bulky catalogue, and is greeted by a large sheaf of papers detailing withdrawals, errors, misprints and qualifications. The removal of a whole selection of British Rail properties - subject of a freehold dispute with the local council - causes a ripple of disappointment. People struggle to hold on to their coffee cups - courtesy of the auctioneers - as the crowd increases in size. In between intense study of the catalogue, men in suits eye men in leather coats. Young couples jostle for space with turbaned businessmen and a sprinkling of Hasidic Jews. Nearly everyone, it seems, carries a portable phone. At the front of the glitzy ballroom a couple of hundred chairs and their occupants soon become lost from view. To the sides, screens allow private access to the cramped area behind the auction rostrum, where a dozen Barnard Marcus employees wait to process the sales. Here, also, regular customers are allowed to stand to avoid the crush at the back of the hall. In another room a taping system records the proceedings for legal protection. Off to the left the auctioneers have prepared a reception room for their most feted guests. The auction starts apace, the auctioneer quickly whittling buyers down to the two or three serious contenders per sale. On either side of him stand half a dozen clean-cut male assistants who help to spot bidders and, when the hammer comes down, collect the successful buyer from the crowd. The properties are largely drawn from the south-east, principally from the London area. The reserve price is set by the vendor, who will pay Barnard Marcus a 2 per cent commission if the property is sold. Most properties make their reserves easily. A four-bedroomed house in Walthamstow, east London, fetches Pounds 38,000 (reserve Pounds 25,000); a three-bed semi in Selston, Nottinghamshire, makes Pounds 38,000 (Pounds 22,000); a three-bed house in Brixton, south London, sells for Pounds 60,000 (Pounds 55,000). Matthew Collier, a 32-year-old export order clerk from Harlesden, north London, has come to bid for a three-floor terraced house in nearby Crouch End. 'This house would probably cost me Pounds 120,000 at an estate agent,' he says. 'I've been to see it, and although it needs a bit of work on it, if I get it for under Pounds 100,000, I'll be happy.' (A smiling Collier leaves Pounds 99,000 lighter.) High bidders steer well clear of a two-bed terrace in Balham, south London, which has only a three-year lease. Despite Cripp's most persuasive tones, it sells for only Pounds 24,000. Two terraced houses in the same street in Hetton-Le-Hole, Tyne and Wear, meet different fates: one sells for Pounds 6,000, the other is withdrawn by its owner at Pounds 7,700. As well as residential properties, there are also investment opportunities of varying attractiveness. A four-floor terraced house on London's prestigious King's Road is withdrawn after failing to reach its reserve price of Pounds 140,000, chiefly because the property - which is split into three flats - contains two long-term tenants with registered rents of just Pounds 26 and Pounds 21 a week. Over the two days, 80 per cent of the properties reach their reserve and are sold - well above the normal level of sales. On the second day, some of a large number of Halifax Building Society properties even sell above their open market rate. Overall, the auction realises Pounds 9.2m: 50 per cent above last year's average auction sale. But this is still far short of the Pounds 20m per auction in 1988. A somewhat hoarse Cripp says that the rise in auction sales could mark the beginning of the end of the housing slump. 'If we carry on with this rate of enthusiasm, I think we will see prices levelling this year and rising in 1993.' Solicitor Paul Milner's effort to realise a sale for his client comes to nought. The house fails to meet the Pounds 59,000 reserve set by the court; the case has now been re-referred for a fresh valuation. A week after the event, a frustrated Milner complains: 'And we still haven't received any money from her.'</p>

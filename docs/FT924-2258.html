			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (5): The worst may be over - Regional report: North America THE BEST that can be said for the North American pulp and paper industry is that signs are emerging of a patchy recovery. But the emphasis is patchy. Price discounting and spare capacity are still prevalent in many sectors. International Paper, the biggest US producer, reported a 7 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings with the comment that prices for uncoated papers remain under pressure. Georgia-Pacific, which suffered a third-quarter loss, noted that much of the industry is still burdened by high inventories and excess capacity. In mid-November, Mr Sherman Chao, analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, cut his 1993 earnings estimates for seven US forestry groups on evidence that weakening Scandinavian currencies and the strong US dollar are intensifying competition from European pulp. 'The burden of world over-capacity will be borne more by the US industry,' Mr Chao says, adding that soft pulp prices could ripple through to weak prices for a wide range of papers. Nonetheless, there are signs that the worst of the recession is over. Although Mr Chao has cut his 1993 earnings estimates, the revised figures still represent an improvement on this year's expected performance. Another analyst, Mr Chip Dillon, of Salomon Brothers, predicted in a recent report that prices of lumber, linerboard, pulp, newsprint, uncoated and coated papers, and tissue should all recover during 1993, although in some cases, the upturn will be shallow. Producers of lightweight coated papers lifted prices by 4 per cent on October 1, and east-coast newsprint producers succeeded in pushing through a 5 per cent price increase (or, to be more precise, a 5 per cent cut in list-price discounts) on August 1. An official at Abitibi-Price, the Toronto-based newsprint-maker, says that 'demand has been a little more sustained than we originally thought.' Abitibi has cancelled much of the downtime which it planned for its newsprint machines in the second half of this year. Canadian pulp and paper makers, whose high costs have made them the heaviest casualties of the recession, are also benefiting from a 13 per cent tumble in the Canadian dollar against the US currency over the past year. British Columbia's Council of Forest Industries predicts that Canadian west-coast producers could, on aggregate, break even or show a small profit in 1993 after combined losses of almost CDollars 900m in 1991 and an estimated CDollars 400-500m this year. The cautiously upbeat mood is based on hopes of a recovery in the US economy from 1993, and on the painful restructuring which has taken place within the North American pulp and paper industry over the past three years. The optimists' argument runs that, as a sector which is traditionally sensitive to the business cycle, the paper industry could be among the early winners of any economic stimulus administered by the new Clinton administration in Washington. Industry operating rates already exceed levels normally seen at the start of an economic upswing. Linerboard mills, which produce the inner and outer layers of a corrugated cardboard box, are operating at almost full capacity, and are expected to push through a price increase before the end of the winter. Furthermore, little new capacity is likely to come on-stream in the early stages of the recovery. According to Mr Dillon, of Salomon Brothers, the American Paper Institute's (API) forecast of new capacity, due to be published later this month, will point to an annual increase of only 1.2-1.4 per cent. This compares with the API's earlier forecasts of 1.8 per cent annual expansion between 1991 and 1994, and an average of 2.8 per cent in the three decades to 1990. A recovery will be especially welcome to the newsprint industry, which has seen some of the most wrenching changes of the past few years. Customers have become more demanding, with the range of products expanding to include soft-calendered, high-gloss and coloured newsprint, as well as a growing quantity of paper made from recycled pulp. According to the API, some 52 per cent of all newsprint is now recovered for recycling in the US, up from 35 per cent in 1988. More than half of all corrugated material is also recovered. Fierce competition has put especially heavy pressure on Canadian newsprint producers, whose capacity shrank from a peak of 10.3m tonnes last year to 9.8m tonnes in September. With the rising demand for recycled newsprint, Canadian mills have been handicapped by their distance from the main urban centres. The Canadian industry has also paid the price of a high cost structure. Several old, inefficient machines, mostly in eastern Canada, have been closed down. According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, shipments to the US tumbled to 4.23m tonnes in the first nine months of 1992, from 4.88m tonnes in the same period of 1990. Meanwhile, US suppliers' share of their home market has climbed from 4.16m tonnes to 4.27m tonnes, but the US newsprint market itself has become more fragmented. California's ailing economy and sagging demand in Japan have opened a gap of about Dollars 35 a tonne between east- and west-coast newsprint prices. At least one big California newspaper publisher is understood to have told suppliers that it is unable to accept any discount reduction for the time being. By contrast, east coast producers' thoughts are already turning to another price increase next spring.</p>

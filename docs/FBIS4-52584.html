			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michihiko Kano, representative of New Party </F> Mirai, by an unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter; date  and place not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Does your party plan to  participate in the new parliamentary group "Kaishin"?    [Kano] The Japan New Party and the Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP] have asked us about it. Their thinking that reform  should be carried out in all areas is essentially the same as  ours. But we consider procedural matters as being important,  too. We would like to make a decision after hearing views of  parties concerned.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] At least, do you intend to  participate in the decisionmaking bodies of the coalition  parties -- like the representatives' conference?    [Kano] The nine-item basic policies agreed to by the  coalition parties conform to our line of thinking. We would  like to offer our efforts in pushing for the policies. We will  participate in the decisionmaking bodies, if asked.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you view the moves being made  by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] toward collaborating with each other?    [Kano] With the international community in a period of  change, we must walk the way of reform. We cannot move  backward. We must realize why we wanted to carry out political  reform to begin with. What I want to do is to pursue this goal  based on common policy ideals. People who want to be  politicians must think about this point. That is the  responsibility of politicians toward the people.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] If the LDP and the SDPJ decide to  collaborate, they will be able to carry a no-confidence motion  in the cabinet, too.    [Kano] Their collaboration must not be an illicit union.  Both parties said so themselves. That is what I want to say to  them. We must recall why political reform was necessary. We  must push our policy from a new position.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There are people saying the House of  Representatives should be dissolved once the budget is passed.    [Kano] The next general election should be held under a new  election system since the Political Reform Bill has been passed.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you intend to expand the force  of your party in the future?    [Kano] We will make efforts to have our party's position and  basic thinking understood better. There are people who have  actively sought political reform. We hope we will succeed in  gaining understanding from a larger number of people.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There are all kinds of stories now  circulating about your New Party Mirai. Some say it is leaning  toward Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and some say the Mirai  members defected from the LDP because of problems they had with  their constituencies.    [Kano] I am aware that there are many rumors. But our  actions are based on the belief that we should go for reform and  act future-oriented. We cannot stake our political lives only  on the human relationship. I hope you will understand the  sincere resolve each of us made in taking the action of bolting  the LDP and forming the new party and thus risking our own  political lives.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is your position on the taxation  sytem reform?    [Kano] It is part of economic reform, and the question lies  in how best the assets, consumption, and income levies can be  balanced. There is also the question of how the direct taxes and  indirect taxes should be proportioned. It is important that we  all discuss the matter frankly. In reviewing the matter, we  will have to think about the future picture of Japan, too.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think an increase in the  consumption tax rate would be unavoidable?    [Kano] The question is not whether to raise that tax, but  why we must think about it. The vision for the future, the  standard of lives for the people -- these things need to be  thought out. We will have to think about the taxation system  reform, thinking about all these things.</p>

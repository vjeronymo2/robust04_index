			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Review Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the filing of a request for review with the Office of Drug Pricing, the parties must attempt, in good faith, to resolve the dispute. All parties involved in the dispute must maintain written documentation as evidence of a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute. Such evidence includes documentation of meetings, letters, or telephone calls between the disputing parties that concern the dispute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the dispute has not been resolved after a good faith attempt, a party may submit a written request for a review of the dispute to the Director of the Office of Drug Pricing. [See address in ``For Further Information Contact'' section].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The party requesting the review may not rely only upon allegations but is required to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact in dispute that requires a review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The request for review shall include a clear description of the dispute, shall identify all the issues in the dispute, and shall contain a full statement of the party's position with respect to such issue(s) and the pertinent facts and reasons in support of the party's position. In addition to the required statement, the party shall provide copies of any documents supporting its claim and evidence that a good faith effort was made to resolve the dispute. These materials must be tabbed and organized chronologically and accompanied by an indexed list identifying each document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The filing of the dispute does not affect any statutory obligations of the parties as defined in section 340B of the PHS Act. During the review process, for example, a manufacturer must continue to sell covered outpatient drugs at or below the section 340B ceiling price to all covered entities, including the covered entity involved in the dispute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director, Bureau of Primary Health Care, shall appoint a committee to review the documentation submitted by the disputing parties and to make a proposed determination. A minimum of three individuals shall be appointed (one of whom shall be designated as a chairperson) either on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis, or as regular members of the review committee. The chairperson shall be from the Office of Drug Pricing and the committee members shall be from other sections of PHS (e.g., chief pharmacist, auditor).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon receipt of a request for a review, the chairperson of the review committee will send a letter to the party alleged to have committed a violation. The letter will include (1) the name of the party making the allegation(s), (2) the allegation(s), (3) documentation supporting the party's position, and (4) a request for a response to or rebuttal of the allegations within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the letter. 7 days from the date of the postmark of the letter will be allowed for mailing and processing through the organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon receipt of the response or rebuttal, the review committee chairperson will review all documentation. The request and rebuttal information will be reviewed for (1) evidence that a good faith effort was made to resolve the dispute, (2) completeness, (3) adequate documentation supporting the issues, and (4) the reasonableness of the allegations. If the documentation is adequate, the review committee will be convened to consider the matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reviewing committee may, at its discretion, invite parties to discuss the pertinent issues with the committee and to submit such additional information as the committee deems appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reviewing committee will propose to dismiss the dispute, if it conclusively appears from the data, information, and factual analyses contained in the request for a review and rebuttal documents that there is no genuine and substantial issue of fact in dispute. This proposed finding of the committee will be submitted to the Director of the Office of Drug Pricing for consideration and approval. A written decision of dismissal will be sent to each party and will contain the Director's findings and conclusions in detail and reasons why the request for a review did not raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With all other proposed findings, the review committee will prepare a written document containing the findings and detailed reasons supporting the proposed decision. The document is to be signed by the chairperson and each of the other committee members. The chairperson will submit the proposed findings to the Director of the Office of Drug Pricing for consideration and approval. The Director's written decision will be sent with a transmittal letter to both parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the covered entity or the manufacturer does not agree with the Office of Drug Pricing's determination, the covered entity or the manufacturer may appeal within 30 days after receiving such a determination to the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration who will appoint a review official or committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the final determination is that a manufacturer has violated the provisions of section 340B of the PHS Act or the PHS pharmaceutical pricing agreement, the manufacturer's agreement with PHS could be terminated or other actions taken as deemed appropriate. If the final determination is that an entity has violated section 340B prohibitions against resale or transfer of covered outpatient drugs, the prohibition against duplicate discounts and rebates (or billing Medicaid more than the actual acquisition cost of the drug), or other statutory prohibitions, the entity shall be liable to the manufacturer of the covered outpatient drug that is the subject of the violation in an amount equal to the reduction in the price of the drug for the period of the violation, as provided by section 340B(a)(5)(D) of the PHS Act. The entity may also be excluded from the drug discount program, if the conduct warrants such a sanction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the dispute is resolved, any disputed amounts plus the rate of interest must be paid or credited to an account balance no later than 30 days following a final determination. Interest will begin to accrue from the time the manufacturer is deemed to have been out of compliance with section 340B (or provisions of the PHS Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement) or the entity is deemed to have violated prohibitions of section 340B. The interest rate will be based upon an annual rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury after considering private consumer rates of interest prevailing at the time of the violation. This rate, utilized by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the collection of debts owed to the United States, may be revised quarterly by the Secretary of the Treasury and is published by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . See 45 CFR 30.13 Parties will apply the interest rate for the quarter in which the violation occurred, and this rate will remain fixed for the duration of the time in which interest accrues. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (The reporting requirements of this document are subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520, and will not be implemented until such clearance has been obtained) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ciro V.

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Moslem refugees pour out of Bihac Tens of thousands of refugees yesterday streamed out of Bihac, the Moslem pocket in north-western Bosnia as UN officials said Bosnian government troops had overrun it, Laura Silber reports from Belgrade. Bihac has been the stronghold for nearly a year of a rebel Bosnian Moslem leader, Mr Fikret Abdic, a communist entrepreneur. The destruction of his effort to form a personal fiefdom in Bihac will bolster the Bosnian army, which has used its important 5th Corps and could free up troops to fight against Bosnian Serb forces elsewhere in Bosnia. UN refugee officials said as many as 20,000 people had been displaced over the weekend, according to unconfirmed reports. Panicked civilians were trying to flee the dense Moslem heartland into Serb-held areas of Croatia. 'Roads are flooded by people.' said Mr Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. UN officials yesterday were trying to help the refugees - some of whom were trapped in a mined no-man's land between rebels Serb forces and Croatian troops. Croatia so far has allowed 50 ethnic Croats to cross the border, said a UN official. Rebel Serbs were chasing the refugees into the minefields, said Mr Kessler. Refugees started to leave the Bihac pocket when Mr Abdic's revolt began to collapse last week. Bosnian army troops gained control of the dense Moslem heartland early yesterday, reported Sarajevo radio.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices rally in subdued trading session - Market Report The big sell-off in the UK equity market was halted yesterday after Wall Street's late recovery overnight. But a promising rally in London was showing ominous signs of running out of steam as the day wore on. Dragging on sentiment was an underlying worry about Wall Street and the chances of renewed weakness there, plus nagging concerns about Monday's EU vote in the House of Commons which has been turned into a government resignation question by the prime minister. The FT-SE 100 Index, which had fallen 103.5 since the start of the week, moved ahead early in the session before slipping back to close a net 9.1 up at 3,036.6. The second liners, on the other hand, continued to suffer, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finally 7.6 lower at 3,481.2, extending the fall over the past four sessions to 94.4, or 2.6 per cent. The absence of any US influences - the US was closed for the Thanksgiving Day holiday - was welcomed by traders throughout Europe, who said markets needed time to assess the big shift in market sentiment following this week's steep slide on Wall Street. There were renewed worries in the City with the not unexpected news that the Office of Fair Trading decided that Stock Exchange rules allowing marketmakers to delay the reporting of above-average sized trades for 90 minutes, and in some cases for up to five trading days, 'restricted or distorted competition to a significant extent'. 'The OFT report spells trouble for the existing system,' said one dealer. 'The process of change in the way we deal does seem to be speeding up,' he added. Wall Street's recovery from an early 37-point decline to close only three points off, and the continued strength of treasury bonds, promoted an early mark-up for leading UK stocks. The FT-SE 100 opened some 10 points higher and gradually improved to a day's peak of 3,044.7, up 17.2, in mid-morning. Although there was no real selling pressure in London, buying interest simply faded away, with most marketmakers happy to close their books early. Turnover was a subdued 576.9m shares, with non-Footsie stocks providing around 57 per cent of the total. Customer business on Wednesday, when the market was in freefall, was revealed as reaching Pounds 1.5bn. Marketmakers remained extremely cautious about short-term trends in the market, with some expressing increasing concern that the recent pressures on Wall Street, stemming from worries about the impact of recent US interest rate increases on corporate profits, could rebuild when US markets reopen today, albeit for a truncated session. 'If Wall Street begins to wilt, then we are in trouble again,' said a senior trader in London. 'The feeling is that we will be testing 3,000 on the FT-SE 100 and possibly 2,980 in short order.' Electricity and water stocks caught the eye as the Labour party threatened windfall profits taxation in its Opposition Budget; and there was a hint that the chancellor may have prepared a lesser version of the same for Tuesday's Budget. The day's big company news items failed to trigger much enthusiasm. Allied Domecq was a sharp faller after releasing slightly disappointing interims, as was Storehousem where the performance of the Mothercare division was said to have disappointed analysts. Preliminary results from the hugely successly Direct Line telephone insurance company were more than doubled, but they disappointed some of the market's super-optimists. Consequently, Royal Bank of Scotland, Direct Line's parent, attracted keen selling ahead of its preliminary figures scheduled for Thursday; dealers still expect a near 20 per cent increase in the bank's dividend.</p>

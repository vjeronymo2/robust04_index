			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Cites Host of Facts Indicating </F> That British Side Is Responsible for Undermining Talks"]    [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA News  Agency Hong Kong Branch, yesterday cited a host of facts to  point out that the British side is solely responsible for  undermining the Sino-British talks and cooperation. Robin  McLaren, the British ambassador to China, said yesterday morning  after attending a meeting of the Executive Council in Hong Kong,  that he hoped the Chinese side would not overreact to the  tabling of the second part of the reform bill by the Hong Kong  Government in the Legislative Council today. Zhang Junsheng  said he wanted McLaren to explain what is meant by "overreact."    Zhang Junsheng said that as far as the Chinese side is  concerned, its original intention was to win cooperation with  the British side, and that the British side is the one who has  now undermined the talks and cooperation. The British side  decided unilaterally last year to leave the negotiating table  and to submit the first part of the reform bill to the  Legislative Council, and this showed that they did not want to  have Sino-British cooperation, but wanted a complete breakdown  of the talks.    Zhang Junsheng reflected: "In fact, since the very beginning  of the Sino-British talks, the British side did not have  sincerity for the talks." When the Sino-British talks began, in  light of the British side's record of not keeping its promises  in agreements, the Chinese side first demanded the British side  to recognize the principles for the relevant talks, but the  British side refused to recognize these relevant principles.  Afterwards, the Chinese side made concessions and the talks  were able to enter a concrete stage. However, the British side  did not return to the foundation of the Sino-British  understanding, but raised many unreasonable demands, including  attempts to interfere in China's sovereignty as well as matters  which should be handled by the future government of the special  administrative region, and this led the talks to an impasse.  Thereafter, in order to win an agreement, the Chinese side  proposed separating the arrangements for the 1994 and 1995  elections and solving problems step by step through the method  of "tackling the easy ones first." In the beginning, the  British side rejected this and then raised a number of  preconditions; both sides discussed the methods, however, when  an agreement was about to be reached, the British side quit the  talks with an excuse. They are now saying that because the  Chinese side omitted the words "on its own" from the phrase "the  government of the special administrative region will determine  on its own whether to reinstate the appointed membership  system," they quit the talks. Zhang Junsheng said that this was  complete sophistry from the British side. In fact, the British  side never mentioned this problem across the negotiating table,  while in diplomacy such wording problems can be discussed after  the principle has been fixed.    Zhang Junsheng said that, in fact, the British side had left  the negotiating table because it insisted on solving the problem  of using the single-seat, single-vote system in the 1995  Legislative Council elections simultaneously, whereas this  problem is a problem of principle. The British side's rationale  was that the single-seat, single-vote system had already been  passed by the Legislative Council. If anything passed by the  Legislative Council can be imposed upon the Chinese and British  Governments, then what kind of talks were these? Using such an  excuse to quit the talks only shows that the responsibility for  undermining the talks and cooperation is solely on the British  side.</p>

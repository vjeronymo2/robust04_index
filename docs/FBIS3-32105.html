After spending several days  and weeks contemplating the one issue that interests you so very  much -- an issue you ask me about each and every day -- last  night, I came to a decision. That is when I wrote a letter  addressed to all ministers of state. This letter was sent to  all ministers early this morning -- first by fax, and then  followed by the original.    The letter says the following: I must begin by stating what  I have said many times: The current cabinet members are not only  exemplary officials, but I have also developed a close  friendship with each of them. Nevertheless, circumstances of  which you all are aware have prompted me to take this action,  which I would have preferred to avoid.    After thinking about this issue, I have concluded that I  must  reorganize my cabinet. In other countries and for other  countries, this is a frequent procedure. For me, however, this  situation cannot be described in terms of my personal feelings.  Therefore, I, as president of the Republic, ask that you resign  from your post as minister of state, thereby enabling me to have  the chance to appoint a cabinet which, under the circumstances,  would better serve the interests of the Republic of Panama.    Because I am not naming a new cabinet at this time, I would  be most grateful if you could remain in your post and attend to  your duties, for which you will have my support.    I thank you in advance, and I reiterate my friendship.    Now, before taking your questions, I would like to answer  two... [pauses] some of them. First, you probably are wondering  when I will appoint the new cabinet. The answer is I do not  have a deadline for appointing a new cabinet. This is an issue  I will think about constantly over the next few days, and I will  make an announcement to the media when I decide on the new  cabinet.    The second question I am sure you will ask -- indeed, I want  to save you the trouble of asking it -- is whether I already  have some candidates to fill the posts. The answer is no; I do  not have any names to give you officially.    This whole time I have been mulling over this issue. I have  thought about some people, but I have not made a decision. At  this point, I am unable to give you any names. I will announce  all of the names when I select my new cabinet.    I will now be glad to take your questions, but first I must  say that nearly all of the ministers have tendered their  resignations. All of them are exemplary citizens who are my  friends. I appreciate them very much. This is a situation  that, as I said before, is normal in some countries. I never  like making cabinet changes, as you are well aware.    [Unidentified moderator] We will now begin the question and  answer period. We will begin with colleague Luis Alberto  Henriquez of RPC Radio.    [Henriquez] Good morning, Mr. President. First, I would like  to ask this: What is the objective of your new cabinet? Will  the new ministers be members of your party of [word indistinct]?    [Endara] You are all aware of the reason. It is a situation  we have been experiencing for a number of days. You have all  awaited anxiously for me to make a decision.    I told all of you that at the opportune time... [pauses] I  first told you I was mulling over the matter. Then I told you  that at an appropriate time I would inform all of you together,  as I am doing now. The reasons are obvious. These are the  changes that have taken place within the political scene. I  would have preferred that these situations did not affect my  government, but as in any government or any democratic  government in the world, political changes have repercussions  within the government.    As to whether all of the cabinet members will be members of  my party, I reiterate that I have not made a decision on the  names of the people I will pick for my cabinet. In principle,  it is not my intention that all cabinet members belong to my  party. My intention is that independent individuals and those  from some other parties should participate. This is my  intention, but I have not made the final decision.</p>

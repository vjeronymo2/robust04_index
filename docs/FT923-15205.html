			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Northern Electric surges to Pounds 98.2m NORTHERN ELECTRIC, the Newcastle-based regional electricity company, announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 98.2m for the year to end-March 1992, a 42 per cent increase on last year's pro forma Pounds 69.3m. The result was struck on turnover up from Pounds 774m to Pounds 813.7m. Underlying profits, after adjusting for exceptional price rises in April 1991 and undercharging last year, rose by Pounds 19m, or 26 per cent. Earnings per share improved 44 per cent, from 41.4p to 59.6p, and a final dividend of 13p is recommended making a total for the year of 18.55p. The bulk of the profits increase came from the main distribution business, which turned in a 28 per cent advance from Pounds 71.2m to Pounds 90.8m, while income from the supply business - which buys and sells bulk electricity - fell 36 per cent from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 4.1m. The company turned a Pounds 1.8m loss from the retail, contracting, and other unregulated businesses, into a Pounds 3.3m profit overall, but cut its contracting business, which is still loss-making, by half. Some Pounds 12m of the underlying profit increase was attributable to normal tariff increases, said Mr David Morris, chairman. Another Pounds 5m was due to increased sales volumes, which improved by 1.7 per cent, as sales to all classes of customers increased. Net interest charges fell by Pounds 5.2m, and income from the company's 6.5 per cent stake in the National Grid Company grew by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 10.2m. Costs were cut across the business by some Pounds 6m as 240 jobs - 4.7 per cent of the workforce - were lost. The outlook for the company was good, Mr Morris said. He expected to cut the contracting business by half again in the current year, down to 100 or fewer staff. Costs will be cut by some 3 per cent again, and there should be further savings from this year's staff cuts. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m, putting the company on a prospective p/e of 6.2. The dividend is forecast to be between 20.5p and 20.8p. COMMENT Northern Electric must wonder what it has to do to get a re-rating from the City. Analysts still don't rate the company's management - despite the fact that Northern is doing everything the City usually asks from a utility. It has no dubious diversification, an excellent consumer service record and sales volume growth in its main business, and a small under-recovery in the well-managed supply business, which the City generally regards as an ideal position. It is getting rid of loss-making contracting, and making money in retail. It also gave a positive, but not worryingly positive, dividend statement. Perhaps the only cause for concern is the relatively high rate of return and the relatively high tariff increase this year - which could alert the regulator.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Reda Bekkat: "What Legitimacy?"] </F>   [Text] Is the national conference heading for failure now  that three of the largest parties deny it their support? In  fact, less than three days before the start of the conference,  the FLN [National Liberation Front] declined the commission's  invitation, thus following the example of the FFS [Socialist  Forces Front] and the RCD [Rally for Culture and Democracy].    It is not unlikely that other major parties or social  organizations may follow the boycott movement. We are thinking  of employers' organizations, in particular the UGTA [General  Union of Algerian Workers] which, recently again, denounced the  methods and men of a regime that it demands should resign.  Already, however, with such conspicuous absences, we cannot fail  to wonder whether the national conference will retain any  legitimacy, any credibility, especially as far as the objectives  assigned to it are concerned.    Apart from a certain consensus on the draft platform and the  participants' commitments during the transition period, which  would be binding for political and social players, the  conference should also approve whoever will be in charge during  the transition period.    In other words, it should settle the matter of the HCE  [Higher State Council] succession with the parties to the  conference and representatives of the present government.    There is absolutely no doubt that the commission's  legitimacy  is considerably reduced by the absence of major political  parties, including the one that used to be the single party but  whose participation in the conference the members of the  national dialogue commission nevertheless deemed necessary.    Under these conditions, how can the national conference  legitimately take place, and how could any solutions adopted  concerning who is to be in charge during the transition period  be considered as emanating from a national consensus between  political and social organizations? Undoubtedly, this is the  dilemma that the initiators of the national dialogue must face.  A deadlock, therefore, is possible.    In this case, we cannot help recalling the defense  minister's  statements, which some interpreted as a warning to the political  class in general and to the parties in particular, against any  attempt at obstruction.</p>

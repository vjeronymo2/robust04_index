			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Ukraine divided over N-missiles UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk yesterday insisted that his government remained committed to becoming a non-nuclear state, contradicting Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma's assertion on Thursday that the Slav republic should, at least temporarily, retain some of its nuclear missiles. However, the Ukrainian parliament not the president must ratify the two international treaties which would bind Ukraine to its non-nuclear promises. Yesterday an overwhelming majority of MPs appeared to favour the prime minister's more hawkish stance. Deputies said that in a closed parliamentary debate on the issue, which adjourned yesterday afternoon, most speakers called for the Start 1 treaty, which covers only 130 of the 146 Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles left on Ukrainian territory after the break-up of the Soviet Union, to be considered separately from accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. That would leave the way open for parliament to back Mr Kuchma's proposal and declare Ukraine to be, temporarily, a nuclear power. Mr Kuchma's call for Ukraine to keep some of its nuclear weapons for the time being - the first time a senior government official has expressed such a view - and parliament's enthusiastic response threaten a schism over the nuclear issue at the highest levels of the Ukrainian leadership. Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, is to hold talks with Ukrainian officials in Kiev tomorrow in the first cabinet-level visit by a member of the Clinton administration. The US's initial strategy of treating Ukraine frostily until it followed through on promises to get rid of its nuclear weapons has now changed, and now includes more carrot and less stick.</p>

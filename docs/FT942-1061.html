			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Greece mourns end of an era - The death of bouzouki player and composer Manos Hadjidakis There is a poignant scene in Jules Dassin's Never on Sunday in which Homer Thrace, the brash American know-it-all determined to bring back the true cultural values of ancient Greece to a country he finds riddled with happy hookers and hard drinkers, castigates Takis, the local bouzouki player, for being unable to read music, thus forsaking any right to be called a musician. The scolded Takis sulks away to lock himself in the bathroom, only to recover his spirits when Ilya, the compassionate whore played by Melina Mercouri, persuades him that the birds in the trees manage to be the most beautiful of all music-makers without ever needing to consult written notes. The scene was almost certainly based on a real-life incident during the shooting of the film; Dassin had been assured by his wife Mercouri that the film score's composer, Manos Hadjidakis, would produce a fitting piece of music to accompany his sharply cynical portrayal of American cultural imperialism. What he had not expected was that Hadjidakis would turn up with a group of friends with not a leaf of sheet music between them, asking them simply to improvise round any random melody he would start picking out. Dassin need not have worried; Hadjidakis's main theme for Never on Sunday, sung by Mercouri, won that year's Original Song Oscar and became a massive international hit. The death of Hadjidakis last week, following so closely that of his great friend and collaborator Mercouri in March, has left Greece in a state of shock which is hard to imagine in any other European country. These two great charismatic performers, along with Mikis Theodorakis, were by far the most potent symbols of Greece's cultural golden era at the start of the 1960s, when the country began to emerge from the lengthy shadow of its Nazi occupation and civil war, and started to enjoy the fruits of cheap air travel and hordes of sunshine-seeking northern Europeans. The bouzouki, and the brooding, sensual rebetiko folk-song became ubiquitous harbingers of the country's new self-confidence; previously dismissed as a marginal, working class phenomenon, Hadjidakis and Theodorakis used their flair for melody, and later their thirst for experimentation, to bring this essentially eastern musical form to mass attention. Today, serious music critics dismiss much of these composers' work as tourist-kitsch, but that is to underestimate its role in defining a new identity for a modern country straining to shed a frightening burden of ancient glories. For a brief period, before the Colonels' coup in the spring of 1967, Greece  -modern Greece - felt it could teach the world a thing or two about living, whether in the form of Anthony Quinn's Zorba, conducting Alan Bates in a few weary dance-steps on the beach, or Mercouri's Ilya, devouring ouzo, sailors and capitalism in equal measure. Today, straining to breathe through the belching fumes of its capital city, racked by economic uncertainty, feeling threatened by border states, Greece has lost that momentary sense of exhilaration and has reverted to its previous cultural inferiority complex. As long as there was Melina fighting to her last breath for her Marbles, as long as Hadjidakis continued to hold court in Athenian cafes, Greeks could still remember when things felt better. The loss of these dominant figures deals a hefty blow to a national psyche which, forged by the Cassandras and Medeas of its cultural heritage, needs little encouragement to look on the bleak side of life.</p>

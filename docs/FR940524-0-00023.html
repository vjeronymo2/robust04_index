Any narrowband PCS licensee who assigns or transfers control of its license to a business owned by minorities and/or women may request that the Commission issue it a tax certificate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unjust enrichment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Designated entities using installment payments, bidding credits or tax certificates to obtain a narrowband PCS license will be subject to the following unjust enrichment provisions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If a small business paying for a narrowband PCS license in installment payments seeks to transfer a license to a non-small business entity during the term of the license, the remaining principal balance must be repaid as a condition of the license transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Female and minority-owned businesses seeking to transfer a license to an entity that is not owned by women or minorities will be required to reimburse the government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest at the rate imposed for installment financing at the time the license was awarded, before transfer will be permitted.

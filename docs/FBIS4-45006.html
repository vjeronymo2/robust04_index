			<p>CSO     [Text] The weekly economic report from Shell's Kuwait  office speaks of clear discrepancies between what the Minister  of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank have said about  debtors who had not documented their debts. The report suggests  that the Kuwaiti oil tanker firm's current management leaked to  a Kuwaiti newspaper a report prepared and submitted to the  Cabinet, dealing with past conditions at the company. It had  been decided the Cabinet would forward it to the public  prosecutor, but the company protested and held back from  publishing it. The text of the report follows:  <H5>  Hard Currency Indebtedness </H5>   The official Kuwaiti News Agency attributed to the governor  of the Kuwaiti Central Bank additional information about the  level of preliminary compliance with Law 41/93, which deals with  hard currency indebtedness. The numbers attributed to the  governor give a picture somewhat different from those we had  printed as of last week, which relied on what the minister of  finance had stated immediately after the conclusion of the time  limit for compliance with the law on 31 March 1994, [a  discrepancy] which may be due to the delay in the checking and  analysis of the statements.    The governor says that there are 10,323 agents subject to  the  law, with a total balance of indebtedness of 6,294 Kuwaiti  dinars [KD]--nearly KD703 million more than the number of bonds  issued.    He attributes this discrepancy to several conflicting  processes, as the bonds were issued at a higher value to banks  including interest on the balance of indebtedness from 1 August  1990 until 31 December 1991, but the balance of indebtedness is  greater than its coverage of debts, to which are added the  allocations collected by banks from 1986 until 1 August 1990 and  discounted from the value of the bonds, plus the balance of debt  clearance, amounting to KD900 million. These are political and  non-professional debts paid from the public treasury through  some major investment companies.    The governor says that "debt measures have been concluded  for  a total of 3,651 agents (those who paid immediately); this is  35.4 percent of the whole, with a balance of KD71 million in  debts, 11.3 percent of total indebtedness, with an average debt  balance per agent of about KD195,000. On the other hand, nearly  3,503 agents have not documented their manner of debt settlement  and violated the provisions of the law; this is 34 percent of  the total, with a debt balance of nearly KD209 million, or 3.3  percent of total indebtedness, with an average debt balance of  nearly KD60,000. This shows a crucial disparity from what the  minister of finance had said (KD900 million). This means KD3.169  billion, or nearly 85.4 percent of total indebtedness, with an  average debt balance of about KD1.7 million."    In brief, there are nearly 6,820 agents complying with the  law, representing nearly 66 percent of total agents, with a  balance of KD6.085 billion in debts. An over-all view, in terms  of averages, makes it possible to say that most of the agents  complying with the law have average debts. It is they who paid  up immediately. The smallest number of them complying had small  debts, benefiting most from the law. As to lack of awareness or  special circumstances, especially the rebate of consumer loans,  one notes that those with large indebtedness complied with the  law when they provided documentation in the limited time.  Undoubtedly some of them are betting on time and the chance for  changes in the law.  <H5>  Kuwaiti Oil Tanker Company </H5>   One of the local newspapers has published a secret report  that seems to have been submitted to the cabinet before the case  was to be forwarded to the public prosecutor's office. It is  clear that it had been prepared by the company's present  management. The management sent the newspaper an advertisement,  which the newspaper refrained from publishing, thereby  confirming its truth, to some degree. We believe it is an  unfortunate step on the part of the company, if one assumes such  reports to be public information of which it is the right of all  people to form a public opinion, both in terms of the extent of  its effect, with other cases, on the past, present, and future  of the country, or as a result of circumstances and the time in  which they occurred. What makes this report unusual is that it  presents the documents and computer printouts used in the  embezzlement we mentioned last week, such as buying at higher  than the value, domination of management decisionmaking,  choosing the team, money laundering through paper companies, and  secret accounts.    There must be verification, and action to deny the  connection  of two banks in which the government owns a majority share, and  whose names appear in the report. We do not think they had any  role in what happened. A third bank was also named, in which one  of the two banks owned shares, and which was supported by the  Kuwaiti Government during the period of occupation.    Perhaps one of the distinctions of the case is that it was  discovered by coincidence, either through the neglect of some  officials involved in the seizure of all the company's documents  linked to the case, or by way of one of the bank officials  intruding, through either curiosity or courtesy, with questions  about the drop in the level of operations activity. Perhaps this  is certain evidence of the failure of internal and external  monitoring agencies, and individual authority in management,  whether in political or administrative terms, or in terms of the  oil sector. What the tanker company officials failed to do in  destroying the bonds, the officials of the Kuwait Investment  Office in London succeeded in doing, as did the management of  the Torras Group in Spain.    Despite all the evidence recorded in the report, which  cannot  except any of the accused, the consitutional court is now  looking into the competence of the ordinary courts to try one of  the ministers due to the ordinance of a law the Cabinet adopted  in 1990.    In terms of political immunity, and in light of what has  come  before, and apart from the verdict of the constitutional court,  one would assume that the government will take the initiative to  do everything in its power to pursue trying the officials, and  the other authorities will do their utmost to achieve this goal.</p>

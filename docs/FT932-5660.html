			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Australia and US locked in dogfight over airlines AUSTRALIA and the US yesterday became locked in a dispute over aviation rights. Canberra ordered Northwest Airlines to cancel its three weekly services from New York to Sydney via Osaka and the US government retaliated by cancelling three of 10 weekly Qantas flights from Sydney to Los Angeles. The cancellations take effect from the end of the month. The Australian action follows a long-standing dispute over the number of passengers carried by Northwest on the Osaka to Sydney leg, which Canberra claims is subject to Australian regulation. Senator Bob Collins, transport minister, said Northwest would be allowed to reinstate two flights a week if it accepted Australian instructions to limit the number of Japanese passengers to 50 per cent of each flight's capacity. He said the government had acted in response to Northwest's 'sustained violation' of an order issued last December to abide by the terms of an agreement negotiated in 1991. Senator Collins said it was 'legitimate for Australia to pursue its rights and to protect its national interests. It is doing no more than the US would do in similar circumstances.' Australia is concerned that Northwest's flights are having an adverse impact on Australian and Japanese airlines, which dominate the lucrative routes between Sydney and Japan. Northwest said it was 'disappointed' by the Australian decision, which it described as 'unilateral, unlawful and unjust.' The airline said it would seek to expedite a federal court action contesting the December order. Northwest claims that the 1991 agreement is invalid because it was signed under duress three days before services from Osaka were due to start. The airline has the support of the US transportation department. The US embassy in Canberra said Washington hoped to resolve the dispute through negotiation.</p>

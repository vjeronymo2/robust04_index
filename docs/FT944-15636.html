			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Economic Digest: Swedish unemployment falls Unemployment in Sweden fell last month in line with a trend of gradual improvement in the economy, but the numbers out of work remain at historically high levels. Those without work or places in government training programmes totalled 346,000, or 8.1 per cent of the workforce, in September, down from 8.8 per cent in August and below the figure of 8.7 per cent a year ago. Although an export-led recovery has created many jobs, much of the fall in unemployment in September was due to a rise in the number in training schemes by 40,000 to 289,000. The number of jobless in Poland fell to 16.5 per cent in September from 16.8 per cent in August, but it was up from 15.4 per cent a year ago. Hungary's monthly consumer price index rose 2.3 per cent in September, up from 1.4 per cent in August, making it 18.9 per cent higher than a year ago.</p>

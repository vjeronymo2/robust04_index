			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television A Chip in the Sugar (BBC2 at 9.30pm) is exquisite and unmissable. In this second repeat of the famous Talking Head monologues by Alan Bennett, the author himself stars as the repressed, middle-aged son of a fearsome mother. El Caudillo was born a century ago this year. Franco: Behind the Myth (BBC1 at 10.20pm), is billed as a documentary which unearths the truth about a ruler whom modern, Olympic-hosting Spain, has consigned to oblivion. Surely an exaggeration, but nevertheless, producer Anthony Geffen has a good track-record with profiles of dictators,. An 'exclusive' interview with his confessor sounds promising. Set in Civil War Spain, part two of the Spanish drama, Riders of the Dawn (C4 at 10.50pm) holds out the promise of being every bit as cryptic, torrid, and absurd as part one. I should warn you that the priapic hermit gets his come-uppance in a particularly nasty fashion which may well be a first for British TV. Legendary Latin lover of all times, Casanova gave his name to the Complex which will be discussed tonight in Men Talk (C4 at 10.20pm.)</p>

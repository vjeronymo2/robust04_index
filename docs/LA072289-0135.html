			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> $200,000 AMERICAN CONTINENTAL GIFT TO GLENN DISCLOSED  </P> <P> Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) received $200,000 in undisclosed corporate donations  for his political action committee in 1985 and 1986 from the head of a  California thrift for whom he later intervened with federal regulators.  </P> <P> Glenn's disclosure, prompted by queries from Ohio reporters, brings to at least  $1.35 million the amount in donations and gifts that Charles H. Keating Jr. and  his American Continental Corp. of Phoenix raised over a two-year period for the  favorite causes of five senators who argued Keating's position in meetings with  top officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank board in April 1987.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said he solicited $850,000  from Keating for three voter-education projects, including one started by his  son. It has been reported previously that Keating and his business associates  contributed more than $320,000 to Cranston, Glenn and three other senators who  attended the meetings on his behalf.  </P> <P> Keating's thrift, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine, was seized by  regulators in April, a day after American Continental entered bankruptcy  proceedings.  </P> <P> Glenn, whose campaigns also have received $34,000 in reported donations from  Keating, his family and employees, said in an interview Thursday that there was  no connection between the Keating donations and the senator's decision to  attend the meetings with thrift regulators. "Do you forget the $234,000? No,  you don't," Glenn said. "But that doesn't have one thing to do with whether I  would compromise a vote or access to my office or my personal principles."  </P> <P> Glenn said he has known Keating, who is from Ohio, for years and has voted  against other requests he made. He said he went to the meetings with regulators  after investigating Keating's complaints about the length of an examination of  Lincoln.  </P> <P> Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, has said  the meeting with the senators was a "grievous" attempt to "subvert the  regulatory process." Glenn declined to respond to Gray's characterization.  </P> <P> The previously unreported $200,000 in donations for Glenn were made to his PAC,  the National Council on Public Policy. They were arranged by James Grogan, a  former Glenn aide who became Keating's corporate counsel. Grogan also  approached Glenn's staff about attending the meeting with bank board regulators  in 1987.  </P> <P> William R. White, a former Glenn aide who handled records for the now-defunct  PAC, said Thursday that Grogan called him in the summer of 1985, saying Keating  wanted to help Glenn. Grogran confirmed White's account, noting that Keating  was a longtime supporter of Glenn.  </P> <P> At the time of the donations, Keating was actively campaigning to stop a  proposed bank board rule that would limit Lincoln's direct investments outside  the home mortgage field.  </P> <P> A short time after Grogan's call, American Continental made the first of two  $100,000 corporate contributions to the PAC's non-federal bank account. The  second $100,000 check arrived in March, 1986. Such donations are legal. They  also are controversial because they do not have to be reported publicly.  </P> <P> Glenn said his sole purpose in attending the meetings was to find out whether  Lincoln was being treated fairly. According to extensive notes of the  discussion at the April 9, 1987, meeting, Glenn said, "I'm not trying to get  anyone off. If there is wrongdoing, I'm on your side. But I don't want any  unfairness against a viable entity."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government met this  afternoon to discuss the current situation in Gorazde. At the  beginning of the open part of the session, Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic read the following statement:    [Begin Silajdzic recording] The aggression against  Bosnia-Herzegovina has been underway for more than two years  already and has culminated in a fresh invasion by the  aggressor's forces from Serbia and Montenegro. With the  knowledge of the entire world, the aggressor is bringing new  troops, tanks, and artillery from Titovo Uzice, Kraljevo in  Serbia, and Podgorica in Montenegro. The residents of Gorazde,  surrounded and cut off, have been destroyed with everything that  the aggressor has at his disposal for two years, including  irritant agents that are being used in concentrations prohibited  by the Geneva convention. Every square meter is shelled and the  hospital is almost destroyed. Gorazde is defending itself the  way it can and is trying to stop the aggressor's forces from  entering the town, and naturally, to prevent a massacre [words  indistinct].    We would like to remind that this is a UN Protected Area.  The UN (?leaders) failed to undertake the measures to which  they are entitled by the relevant resolutions of the UN Security  Council. We have learned that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali  sent a letter to NATO Secretary General Woerner in connection  with these events. However, for the time being there is still no  action. The aggressor is encouraged by such a position of the  United Nations.    The aggressor's soldiers today used force to seize the arms  that were in Lukavica guarded by the members of the French  Battalion on the basis of a NATO ultimatum of 9 February 1994.  This action constitutes a flagrant violation of the NATO  ultimatum and paves the way for a new aggression on Sarajevo and  other towns throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Parallel to this,  the aggressor's forces have been holding approximately 100 UN  Protection Force [UNPROFOR] soldiers hostage.    This is not merely a question of United Nations and NATO  credibility, but also a question of peace or war in this [word  indistinct].    The international community is responsible for this [word  indistinct] because it has facilitated the aggression and made  it easy by keeping in power the arms embargo that is only  effecting the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is a victim  of the aggression.    We informed NATO Secretary General Woerner about the  development of the situation and demanded urgent action in  accordance with the NATO ultimatum. [end recording]    The government's session at the beginning of which Prime  Minister Silajdzic read the statement that you have just heard,  was continued without the presence of reporters.</p>

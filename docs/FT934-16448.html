			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: A&amp;C Black slips to Pounds 244,000 A DROP in its publication programme led to reduced turnover at A&amp;C Black, but some improvement in margins together with a further fall in net interest payable, meant first-half 1993 pre-tax profits were only Pounds 10,000 lower at Pounds 244,000. Turnover of the group, which publishes yearbooks, children's and general books, fell 10 per cent to Pounds 3.38m. Mr Charles Black, chairman, said the publication programme for the second half was comparable with last year and directors were hopeful of a reasonable outcome for 1993 as a whole. Net interest charges were Pounds 10,000 (Pounds 35,000). Earnings per share slipped from 11p to 10.6p, while an unchanged interim dividend of 4.25p is declared.</p>

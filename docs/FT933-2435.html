			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / The Long View: The Norman inquest EARLY THIS week articles began to appear celebrating the UK's year outside the European exchange rate mechanism. It had all gone better than anybody could have expected, with the economy returning to growth, and inflation running much lower than most people can have expected after the substantial devaluation on Black (sorry, Golden) Wednesday. Moreover the feared crises over public sector funding and the balance of payments deficit simply had not happened. The great and the good in Britain, including the captains of industry, are now in favour of a floating currency. On Thursday, moreover, a director of Rothschilds called Norman Lamont burst into anniversary print to declare that the UK had gone into the ERM for all the wrong reasons. The man who once assured us that there would be no devaluations, no leaving the ERM, is now urging John Major to pull the UK out of the plan for European economic and monetary union. The one-year-on celebrations, however, had a strange familiarity. They read uncannily like the articles that appeared at the beginning of October 1991 to celebrate the first anniversary of the UK's ERM entry. It had all gone better than anybody could have expected. Inflation was tumbling, interest rates were falling steadily, and sterling had stayed within its band without strain. As for falling gross domestic product and rising unemployment, they were prices well worth paying (by other people, anyway). The great and the good, especially those captains of industry, were almost unanimously pro-ERM. In fact, Britain's ERM honeymoon ended almost as soon as the first birthday cake had been consumed. Sterling suddenly crashed to the bottom of the ERM grid, and the struggle against unequal odds began in earnest. We never quite got to the moment for lighting two candles. This week, too, an anniversary jinx spoiled the party. The industrial production figures were revised downwards, unemployment edged up again, inflation jumped back above 3 per cent on an underlying basis, and the Footsie index slipped temporarily back under 3,000 - albeit on a wave of profit-taking in international bond markets. Now, this is not put forward as evidence that economic strategies have a one-year shelf life. I suspect that we are going to discover that an economy cannot be satisfactorily run through violent changes in strategy, and that we should not allow ourselves to be misled by the time lags that are involved, so that we have benefited from the ERM's disinflation long after we have left it. As Bill Martin, of UBS, puts it, if devaluing the pound and cutting interest rates were all that were required the UK would have a world-beating economy. After a year back in a floating rate regime there are signs that some of the bad old ways of the UK economy are reasserting themselves. Pay growth in manufacturing, the most buoyant sector of the economy at present, may have bottomed out at around 5 per cent, giving an indication of what may happen when the services sector recovers. There is bound to be fierce resistance to the Government's rather feeble attempt this week to impose a semi-freeze on public sector pay. After a year in which inflation has almost always undershot expectations it has started to forge ahead again, and the prospect that the headline rate, boosted by indirect tax increases, might top 3 1/2 per cent next year is cooling the market's hopes of an interest rate cut this autumn, at any rate one that is unaccompanied by significant tax increases and deficit reduction. The low level of inflation has not, however, been entirely good news - not for the corporate sector anyway. In spite of the latest spell of weakness the Footsie index remains 26 per cent above its level at the close on Black Wednesday (and 32 per cent higher than at the low point in August a few weeks earlier, when the market began to scent the imminent change of course). The upsurge has been founded upon the scope for companies to raise their prices and their profitability. But it has been very difficult in practice for companies to pass on higher costs in the domestic market place and some sectors - food manufacturing, for instance - have been squeezed. So the current profits reporting season has been a little disappointing, and certainly the prospects for a large increase in manufacturing investment in the UK to cure our underlying trade deficit do not look bright. True, the manufacturing productivity figures are very good but low wages and layoffs do not promise a convincing route to long-term prosperity. Rapid output growth would be much better, but it does not look a likely prospect. Depressed Continental Europe remains the big problem here, as business surveys are highlighting. We can break free of the ERM but we can scarcely escape from the constraints of weak European demand. And for all the fuss about the ERM crisis at the end of July, and the switch to wide currency fluctuation bands, more than half the EC member states have short-term interest rates at 9 per cent or more. Although the foreign exchange speculators have been away sunning themselves and counting their profits they must now be tempted to have another go at individual currencies. The bond market shakeout may reflect fears that countries like France and Belgium will, after all, remain obstinately trapped in the economic doldrums. We can float, but we may not be able to beat the tide. In any case, the bond market itself is becoming an important source of financial linkage between economies. The British government, for instance, is estimated to have financed anything up to 40 per cent of its fiscal deficit this year by selling bonds to foreign investors. Foreigners hold 17 per cent of the outstanding debt, and they expect prudent policies. Even outside the ERM freedom is relative.</p>

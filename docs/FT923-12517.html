			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Moscow call for Estonia sanctions RUSSIA'S parliament yesterday demanded sanctions against the Baltic republic of Estonia if it does not stop discriminating against its large Russian minority. The resolution, which included a call to consider suspending the co-operation treaty between the two states and a threat to raise the issue at the United Nations, is a sign of the deepening hostility between Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and Russia. It is also a further indication of the hardening of attitudes in Russian political circles - a trend which is leaving Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the moderate foreign minister, increasingly isolated. The latest call for his resignation came yesterday from General Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president - who again accused him of malign intent in predicting a coup organised by military and security circles. In spite of efforts to improve relations - especially on the parts of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the Lithuanian president - the issues between them continue to drive them further apart. This week, members of an Estonian paramilitary force fired on Russian trucks and temporarily captured a detachment of Russian soldiers. The Baltic states say there has been no progress in talks to remove the 130,000-strong army based in the area. Mr Yeltsin promised at the Munich summit this month that it would be withdrawn next year - but he later hedged his pronouncements and the Baltics remain sceptical. A plan to attract foreign investment of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) a year over the next three years was yesterday adopted by the Russian cabinet. The ambitious target - given a total of only Dollars 2bn in foreign investment over the past five years - would make up 18 per cent of total investment in the economy, according to Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister. The programme calls for further legislation on investment to be enacted this year, together with changes in tax and customs duties. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic relations and one of the more experienced of the young ministerial team, will head a foreign investment committee, co-ordinating the work of different ministries and departments. Goldman Sachs, the US merchant bank charged by the government to attract investment, believes that it is likely to pick up next year as the larger companies are put up for sale and foreign companies find ways to invest in them.</p>

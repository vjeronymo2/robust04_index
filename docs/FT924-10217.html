			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Syndicated Loans: Bankers await launch of Italian deal IF syndicated bankers had to choose their least favourite credits, the chances are that Italian names would top the list. Last year's collapse of Federconsorzi, the Italian farm services group, and this summer's debacle with Efim, the Italian state holding company which was put into voluntary liquidation, have certainly reduced foreign bankers' appetite for Italian credits. International bankers were furious when the Italian government refused to repay Federconsorzi's debts, since many of the banks had lent money to the group on the understanding that it was effectively a state credit. In Efim's case, foreign banks were told that their loans would not be repaid in full. After months of lobbying by the foreign banks, the Italian government announced proposals to repay the debts in full, although some of the foreign banks involved claim they have not received full details of the proposals. So syndicated lenders will no doubt watch the next Italian loan closely. Three banks - ABN Amro, Bank of America and Banca Commerciale Italiana - are preparing a Dollars 120m five-year loan for Trans-Tunisian Pipeline Company (TTPC) which is intended to help finance its expansion. Although TTPC is a Jersey-registered company, the loan market regards it as an Italian credit because it relies on a payment agreement from SNAM, the gas pipeline subsidiary of Italian state group ENI. The pipeline carries gas from the Algerian border across Tunisia. Another company - Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline Company - transports the gas from Tunisia to Sicily. One of the bankers familiar with the borrower said that even though the deal is regarded as Italian risk, he felt confident that the money would be raised. 'All of the banks involved are familiar with the pipeline project, and this borrower has done several deals in the past,' he said. SNAM is a well-known name and some bankers believe that provided the pricing is suitably generous, there should be little difficulty in getting the deal done. However, bankers are awaiting the launch of the deal with considerable interest - not only because this could be the first real test of appetite for an Italian deal since Efim ran into trouble with its lenders. Bankers admit they are growing increasingly worried about lending to Italian names because of concern over the state of the Italian economy.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / November deadline set for opening milk market The Milk Marketing Board has set November 1 as its new target for opening the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales to competition. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, said he hoped significant concessions made by the board in its plans to become Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative would prove acceptable to Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, and the dairy trade. Government and European Commission objections to some aspects of the plans - on the grounds that they could undermine competition - forced the board to abandon its original date of April 1 for freeing the market. The ministry said talks to resolve the problems were not concluded yesterday, as had been hoped, but that 'considerable progress' had been made and they should be wound up shortly. The board, which has acted as sole buyer of milk from farmers for the past 60 years, told government officials it would separate two of its main assets. Mr Dare said that Genus, the cattle breeding service which has a book value of Pounds 20m, would become an unquoted company. Its shares would be distributed to the country's 28,500 dairy farmers according to how much milk they produce. The board has also agreed that National Milk Records, which holds data on the quality and quantity of milk produced by individual cows and is valued at about Pounds 3m, will initially be turned over to the residuary body that will wind up the board's affairs, provided that farmers are adequately represented on the body. Mr Dare said the records might eventually be linked up with the independently run Animal Data Centre. The board hopes to persuade the Dairy Trade Federation to accept the concessions it has made on Milk Marque's system for selling milk to dairy companies. It has agreed to allow an independent arbitrator to check that Milk Marque applies its selling rules 'fairly and evenly' to all buyers during its first two years, and has offered to fund this service jointly with dairy companies. The board aims to submit its revised plan to the government early next month. If it wins government approval, the plan is to float Dairy Crest, the milk processing subsidiary, in July. The sale has to precede abolition of the board because it will provide working capital for the new co-operative.</p>

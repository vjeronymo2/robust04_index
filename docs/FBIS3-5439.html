Yogie  S.M. stressed that political reform is a consequence of  increasing openness and democratization. This reform is being  spurred in order to create increasingly stable quality as a  nation and greater progressiveness and self-sufficiency in life  as a state.    Although there are now many challenges, the desires for  political changes by part of society are a product of the  success of national development. "Therefore, we view them  positively and do not belittle the demands of society, because  the reformation produced by openness and democratization must be  consistent with Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution."    Yogie said this Wednesday [26 January] at the Department of  Home Affairs, Jakarta, in a limited working meeting of governors  from throughout Indonesia in connection with preparations for  implementation of the 1994-95 RAPBN [Draft National Budget] and  RAPBD's [Draft Regional Budgets]. There was also discussion of  political upbuilding, stabilization of the mechanism for  selecting heads of first and second level regions, and  implementation of the INPRES [Presidential Instructions] Program  for Backward Schools (IDT).    He also said, "Because of growing public political  awareness,  political upbuilding of the people must be inspired by the  people's aspirations, which naturally carry much weight. Good  aspirations are those that benefit the prosperity of all the  people and avoid giving attention to only one group. Because  giving attention to only one group could trigger disintegration,  it must be avoided."    Besides, he said, approaches based on aspirations can be  properly realized only if supported by a strong political  infrastructure and superstructure. An awareness needs to be  implanted among the people that the aspirations that are  developing, as an aspect of openness, must adhere to norms,  ethics, and rules.    The same point of view on the part of the government and the  people will create future political communications marked by  dialogue and harmony. Such communications require a society that  is full of aspirations as people who are independent and free  from pressure and dependency.    The domestic political supervisor also said that because  democracy is a situation that is always developing, it is not  possible to determine a standard model, let alone make the  democracy of any specific country a model that must be imitated.  "Democracy cannot be developed immediately as merely a single  phase. Basically, democracy develops spontaneously (not  engineered). There may be many natural characteristics.  Democracy should not be developed through `social  experimentation' and certainly not by repeatedly trying things,  because what is at stake is the nation's security and the  country's unity," the minister of home affairs said.    Touching on the 1994-95 budget, he said the Department of  Home Affairs has established a set of programs to cover nine  sectors, 14 subsectors, 23 programs, and 105 projects, with  funds totaling 40.476 billion rupiah, which means an increase of  7.5 percent over the 1993-94 budget.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Property Market: Building bridges - A forum designed to foster a better understanding of property finance Next week sees the formal launch of the Association of Property Bankers, a new group set up to consider and promote issues involved in property lending. The origins of the association date back to December 1991 when a handful of property bankers decided to pool their views and lobby on issues such as environmental legislation and property valuations. The APB is embarking on a series of meetings and talks, which start next week with a lecture by Mr Pen Kent, a director of the Bank of England, about the future of property finance. The aim is to 'foster a better understanding of property finance and its techniques among all those interested in commercial property finance'. 'We are trying to form a bridge between the property and banking worlds,' said Mr Richard Lovell, manager of property finance at the Industrial Bank of Japan and the association's president. 'We are trying to develop a philosophy of good property banking.' Any consideration of these issues is likely to involve an examination of what went wrong in the late 1980s - the spectacular increase in bank lending to the UK property industry, which fuelled runaway increases in property prices and a period of buoyant building. Even with hindsight, the answers to these questions are not straightforward. Bankers' assessments of the industry's collective mistakes include the following: Too much money flooded into the property market and the taps were not turned off soon enough. The number of banks lending to property expanded from about 20 to some 150 throughout the 1980s, largely the result of financial deregulation in the UK; the globalisation of the banking sector; and the banks' loss of large corporate business to the commercial paper and bond markets. The result of this intense competition was that banks took increased risks on poorer quality business, at the same time as lending margins narrowed. According to Mr Lovell, there is a need for a clearer appreciation of risk. 'If risk is being incorrectly priced you should step out of the market,' he said. Bankers were not sufficiently aware of the extent of lending to particular parts of the market. Although bankers are aware of their immediate competitors and the overall statistics for property lending, they do not have the means to analyse lending to particular markets or sub-markets. Bankers were misled by the large demand for their loans and not sufficiently concerned about how their loans would be repaid. The fact that institutions had become disillusioned with property and were unwilling to buy new developments on completion was not considered thoroughly. Bankers were frequently willing to lend on generous terms even when the developments were in fringe areas with little certainty of attracting tenants. 'In any other area of business where you had risks of that magnitude, they would be financed by equity,' said Mr Morris of CIBC. The traditional formula for property lending, whereby the ratio of loan to equity was typically 70:30, was often relaxed, sometimes to a point where banks were prepared to lend the total value of a project. Some critics argue that this approach to lending is fundamentally flawed. Bankers overemphasised the importance of an asset's value, instead of concentrating on income flow and the financial security of a tenant's covenant. 'Everybody thought that bricks and concrete had an intrinsic value,' said Mr Graham Morris, of CIBC, the Canadian Bank, and APB's treasurer. 'What we lost sight of was that the real fount of value for property relies on cash flow.' Commercial mortgage indemnities, in which banks insured against falling property values, were wrongly considered to be a guarantee against loans turning sour. Some lenders eventually discovered problems in the small print; others found they would only get paid when the property was sold. But this has proved difficult given the state of the market. Bankers increased their risks by lending against individual properties, sometimes on a non-recourse basis which gave them no redress to the parent company if the project failed to meet early expectations. Some bankers criticise this practice in the belief that lending to individual properties is inherently risky; banks should reduce their risk by lending to companies which own a portfolio of properties. Bankers sometimes exhibited an overly simplistic approach to analysing the property market. Bankers were too reliant on property valuations, which are merely snap-shots of value at a particular time, and failed to adequately assess the prospects for a property over several years. Likewise, banks tend to be attracted to property lending when the market is relatively straightforward. Since this is usually when values are rising strongly, it can prove a dangerous time to lend. Bankers are rarely prepared to take a counter-cyclical approach to property lending. Most appear to make loans in the upswing of the property cycle and withdraw when the market is near the bottom. Most banks have withdrawn from property lending in the past few years. An estimated 40 banks remain and these tend to be highly conservative in their lending policy. Part of the reason for the banks' withdrawal from property lending is that they are under pressure to meet international standards on capital adequacy. But an equally important factor is that banks still suffer from deep psychological scars from the huge losses they incurred on property lending. 'We have been shell-shocked by the enormity of the problems that have hit us,' said Mr Morris. As the postmortem of the 1989-93 property crash gets under way, several lessons will doubtless emerge. But it is salutary to recall that bankers of the late-1970s also thought they had learned from the property crash earlier in that decade and that those mistakes would not be repeated. History may not repeat itself, but it would be rash to think that property booms and busts are a thing of the past. This point is accepted by the founders of the APB. 'We know the property market is a cyclical business. We don't think we can apply an iron to the cycles and say no more cycles,' said Mr Morris. Mr Lovell agrees: 'We are nowhere near arrogant enough to think we can prevent another crash.'</p>

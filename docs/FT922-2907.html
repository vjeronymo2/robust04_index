			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (9): Quest for greater independence - Profile of Eftyhia Pylarinou, ETVA governor MRS Eftyhia Pylarinou, the governor of the Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (ETVA), took on a more difficult task than the many other younger Greek bankers who returned home from jobs abroad to help modernise the state-owned banks. All the Greek state banks have a large backlog of non-performing loans, as well as equity stakes in heavily indebted companies, now being privatised. But as a development bank tied to implementing the government's industrial policy for more than 20 years, ETVA is saddled with a depressingly large number of unprofitable companies. ETVA controls 20 industrial companies and holds minority stakes in about 100 others, from mineral extraction and processing operations to hotels, shipping and textile factories. Mrs Pylarinou, who worked in New York for 12 years, first at Bank Leumi and then at the First New York Bank for Business, initially felt hemmed in by the network of committees which make decision-making in the state sector a frustratingly long drawn-out process. She says: 'Privatisation is slowed down by bureaucracy and there are a great many legal obstacles to overcome. But we have to sell all these companies if we're to get on with banking.' In her quest for greater independence for the bank, Mrs Pylarinou persuaded the government to come up with a capital injection of Dr50bn. This helped offset problems caused by the government's decision to end a longstanding practice of subsidising interest rates on ETVA bonds. ETVA has also paid off its overdraft with the central bank by starting to take deposits from some of the big state-owned corporations, and recently raised another Dr40bn through a one-year bond offered at an attractive interest rate. 'We operate much more like a normal bank now, taking deposits and making short-term loans. But it will still take another two or three years to clean up the balance sheet,' Mrs Pylarinou says. Inthe meantime, ETVA is trying to build new business elsewhere in the Balkans, both through its participation in European Community programmes for developing market economies in former east bloc countries and on a bilateral basis. ETVA is co-operating with the Romanian Development Bank on developing a pilot industrial estate at Brailla on the Danube, to which it hopes to attract Greek businessmen. The bank has set up more than 20 industrial estates around Greece and retains a technical staff for such projects. ETVA recently held a three-week training seminar and business forum on privatisation and setting up joint ventures for technocrats from Romania, Bulgaria and Albania. Plans are being discussed for ETVA to assist with setting up a capital market in Romania, initially through a joint venture for leasing activities and later by introducing financial services, leading to the establishment of a stock exchange. 'The relationship with Romania is most advanced but we have projects in other places, including the Ukraine. We want to have good connections in all the eastern European countries,' Mrs Pylarinou says.</p>

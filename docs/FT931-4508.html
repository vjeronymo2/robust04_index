			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Cambodia curbs timber exports The United Nation's top peacekeeper in Cambodia imposed strict export quotas on sawn timber yesterday to preserve dwindling resources and curb the income of recalcitrant Khmer Rouge guerrillas, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. A ban on the export of uncut logs, backed by the United Nations, was agreed last September by the Supreme National Council, representing all Cambodian factions, to protect Cambodia's resources. It also curbed a lucrative source of income for the Khmer Rouge in an attempt to get them to abide by the pact. But UN sources say the guerrillas and the government have been circumventing the ban by setting up sawmills and exporting sawn timber. Mr Yasushi Akashi, who heads the 21,000-strong UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), told a news conference the Funcinpec faction and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front sought a complete ban on exports of sawn timber. But this was opposed by the government, which would have been faced with a cut-off of one of their few remaining sources of income. To break the deadlock, Mr Akashi used his executive powers as SNC chairman and imposed a 30 per cent reduction. He said the total volume of sawn timber exported in 1993 would be the equivalent of 160,000 square metres of unprocessed logs.</p>

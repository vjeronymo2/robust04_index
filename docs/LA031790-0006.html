			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SATISFIED WITH MANTELL AFTER REVIEW  </P> <P> San Diego police officials announced Friday that they are "completely  satisfied" that longtime police psychologist Michael R. Mantell is working the  number of hours that he has been paid for interviewing police recruits and  counseling law enforcement officers.  </P> <P> The police officials, including Chief Bob Burgreen, said they reached their  conclusion after reviewing a list of contracts supplied by Mantell this week,  and that they trusted that the number of hours Mantell said he works for about  10 other government agencies did not conflict with his city obligations.  </P> <P> The officials said they did no independent audit of Mantell's performance nor  did they contact other government agencies to determine the scope of the  psychologist's work and whether it conflicted with his requirements for the  city.  </P> <P> Burgreen and Leroy Brady, head of the police personnel unit, said they were  only concerned with Mantell's level of service for the city and were not  particularly interested in how his work compares with other government  agencies.  </P> <P> "I've reviewed his figures," Burgreen said. "And I am completely satisfied he's  performing for us the number of hours he's required. We have the utmost  confidence in his ability to provide psychological services for this  department."  </P> <P> Police Department records show that Mantell worked 2,017 hours -- or about 40  hours a week -- for the department last year, well above the 1,850 he was  required to perform under his contract.  </P> <P> "I work as much or more than that," the chief added. "So by no stretch of the  imagination is the number of hours he's submitting to us unrealistic."  </P> <P> A separate investigation into Mantell's work by the San Diego County Civil  Service Commission is expected to be completed next month. That probe began  after a job applicant complained about Mantell's screening review process.  </P> <P> Mantell met Friday afternoon with county investigators to discuss the status of  their review.  </P> <P> "We're asking him a lot of questions," said Larry Cook, executive officer of  the Civil Service Commission. "This is just a normal part of the  investigation."  </P> <P> Mantell could not be reached for comment Friday about the police officials'  conclusion that he is performing the hours he claims on his work sheets, which  he submits monthly to the Police Department.  </P> <P> Copies of those work sheets, obtained Friday by The Times, show that he  normally works more than 2,200 hours a year for the Police Department, and that  in his busiest year, 1985, he worked 2,472 hours, or about 47 hours a week.  </P> <P> Mantell has said that he works an additional 15 to 20 hours a week on his other  government contracts and in his private practice.  </P> <P> For 10 years, Mantell has enjoyed a no-bid contract with the city. But now that  contract has been put up for bid, and Mantell is competing with 19 other  psychological service providers who have submitted contract proposals.  </P> <P> A special committee of advisers has been formed to study the 20 bids and make  recommendations to the chief's office on which are best suited for the city  contract. Mantell's current contract, at $235,000, is the largest program for  police psychological services in the county.  </P> <P> Burgreen said Friday that he would not allow the county's ongoing  investigation, and dissatisfaction among some small city police agencies with  Mantell's work, to influence his decision on whether Mantell will win the new  contract for next fiscal year.  </P> <P> "I'm certainly not ruling him out, and I'm not saying he's got a lock on it  either," Burgreen said.  </P> <P> City police officials began reviewing Mantell's work after learning of the  county investigation. They said they wanted to make sure that because of  Mantell's numerous obligations with other government agencies, the Police  Department was not being shorted in the number of hours Mantell was supposed to  perform.  </P> <P> Brady said he and Burgreen met with Mantell this week, and that the  psychologist submitted a list of about 10 contracts and performance obligations  that he has with other government agencies. Included in that list was the  average number of hours he spends each year on those obligations.  </P> <P> Brady would not provide a copy of that list to The Times.  </P> <P> However, he said that he and Burgreen concluded that Mantell's work with other  agencies did not impede his ability to work the required number of hours under  his city contract.  </P> <P> "We saw nothing inappropriate," Brady said.  </P> <P> Jack McGrory, assistant city manager who oversees the Police Department, agreed  Friday that Mantell's work for the city has been fault-free.  </P> <P> "At this point we're comfortable he's doing a good job," McGrory said. "We  think that he is giving our contract the high priority that it deserves."  </P></p>

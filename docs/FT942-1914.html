			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Contractors urge tendering rules shake-up Contractors yesterday called on the government to publish new ground rules on compulsory competitive tendering and market testing. The move follows a recent Court of Appeal decision that European rules cover the transfer of a hospital cleaning contract from one private contractor to another. The Business Services Association, a public-sector contractors' lobby group, said it was no longer possible to sustain the position that the European rules - translated into UK law by the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, known as Tupe - did not apply to contracting out. The association said that contractors would have no option but to tender on the basis that Tupe applied in most cases. When Tupe applies contractors must take on an existing workforce on unchanged pay and conditions. This makes it more difficult for private contractors to undercut public-sector costs. The association will continue to press for contracting-out to be removed from the ambit of the European rules contained in the acquired rights directive. In the meantime it said it was essential for the government to reconsider details of its market testing and compulsory competitive tendering rules in order to maintain genuine competition. Mr John Hall, the association's director-general, said contractors wanted: Warranties from public authorities of the accuracy of employee information, with an indemnity for any undisclosed liabilities. Indemnity for historic liabilities accrued while staff were in the public sector. Longer contract periods to maximise opportunity for cost-saving reorganisations of the workforce. The association also wants the government to change its advice that contractors must offer pensions comparable to those in the public sector. Another group of contractors represented by the Clause 26 Group confirmed yesterday that as many as 200 companies holding contracts for work in the local authority sector might sue the government for up to Pounds 20m for misleading them over the application of Tupe. Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, the group's co-ordinator, said contractors had been advised by lawyers that they had a strong case for recouping money spent on legal advice on Tupe in the past two years. There was evidence the government had known in 1983 that Tupe did not meet the requirements of the acquired rights directive, he said.</p>

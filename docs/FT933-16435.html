			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Quadramatic to be priced on Wednesday Shares in Quadramatic, a coin-handling and optical group which is being floated with a market value of Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m, will be priced on Wednesday. The group is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer which will raise Pounds 20m in new money to pay off debt. No existing shareholders are selling shares. Quadramatic is backed by Mr Tony Gartland and Mr Jeff Whalley, two dealmakers who during the eighties expanded FKI, the electrical engineering group, by turning round lossmaking companies. They want to build Quadramatic by acquiring high-margin engineering companies with international opportunities. Quadramatic is forecast to make Pounds 4.5m in the year to September. Private investors can apply for shares through intermediaries.</p>

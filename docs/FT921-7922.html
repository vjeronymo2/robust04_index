			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bank adopts peacemaking role - 'Honest broker' attempts to end Brent Walker/GrandMet dispute THE BANK of England has been acting as a peacemaker to end the dispute between Grand Metropolitan, the drinks conglomerate, and Brent Walker, the leisure group. 'The Bank has been acting as an honest broker', said a banker with a close knowledge of the talks. A settlement with GrandMet has been the last hurdle to be cleared by Brent Walker in its year-long attempt to reconstruct its balance sheet and avoid receivership. However, it also emerged yesterday that the refinancing of Brent Walker  - which owes Pounds 1.5bn to more than 50 banks - could go through as soon as next week, whether or not a deal with GrandMet is struck. Brent Walker owes GrandMet the Pounds 50m deferred payment on its Pounds 679m purchase of the William Hill bookmaking chain. But it is counter-claiming almost Pounds 300m, which it said is owed by GrandMet, because William Hill's profits have been less than expected. The banks had originally stipulated that they would only reschedule their loans to Brent Walker and convert some of the debt into equity if GrandMet also agreed to defer its Pounds 50m claim on Brent Walker. But a banker said that the banks' patience was almost at an end. So the banks are likely to drop the condition that Brent Walker reach agreement with GrandMet before the refinancing is finalised. They are no longer frightened of the consequences if GrandMet exercises its right to put Brent Walker into receivership. 'In the short term, the losses for us on our loans to Brent Walker would be identical, whether or not it is in receivership', a banker said. An offer has been put by Brent Walker to GrandMet that - as part of the reconstruction - Pounds 20m owed to GrandMet should rank ahead of the banks' loans in the pecking order for repayment and that the remaining Pounds 30m should rank alongside the banks' loans. 'We have made GrandMet a very attractive offer', said a banker. 'If it does not accept and puts Brent Walker into receivership, it will end up with nothing', said another banker. The banks have also told GrandMet that they would provide funds to a receiver to allow the receiver to pursue GrandMet through the courts for payment of the Pounds 300m. 'GrandMet will not come to the negotiating table', said one of the group's principal bankers, who are owed more than Pounds 1.5bn. Because of its reluctance, Standard Chartered, the bank acting as co-ordinator of Brent Walker's banks, recently arranged for officials at the Bank of England to attend a meeting between Brent Walker and GrandMet.</p>

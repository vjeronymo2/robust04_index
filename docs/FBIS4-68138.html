			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 11 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ferhat Ataman on Wednesday said that claims of security forces  burning down villages and forcing the population in the  southeast to emigrate to northern Iraq are all part of a  previously written ploy aimed at fooling the world.    Speaking at his weekly briefing, Ataman strongly denied  foreign press reports on so-called forced emigration of 3,500 to  6,000 Turks of Kurdish origin following operations by security  forces in the region and of villages being burned down.    "We knew the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist  organization would try to send some of our citizens voluntarily  or by force to northern Iraq, group them together and present  them to the foreign press as `Kurds escaping Turkish  oppression'," Ataman said adding that this action aimed at  increasing the foreign pressure on Turkey.    "The organization has started to transport its sympathizers  as well as others from the region to northern Iraq in small  groups and are also aiming to obtain money from the United  Nations for their own," he said.    "The terrorist organization is trying, as ever, to deceive  the foreign public and stage a new play completely based on its  own scenario," he said. "It is trying to obtain United Nations  money through its own supporters in the process."    "There is no question of any village being purposefully  bombarded or destroyed by security forces," he said. "Some of  the villagers have been already moved to safe regions in order  to escape PKK terror and there has been some damage in some  hamlets or villages where the security forces have clashed with  terrorists."    "In these cases, our innocent citizens, as always, are  compensated by the state," he said.</p>

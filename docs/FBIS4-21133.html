It exposes the weaknesses,  incongruities, errors, and interference by the selfsame U.S.  drug policy and shows, in that respect, Washington has gone from  militarist attitudes of the Bush administration to something  very close to inconsistency. Examples of that are: Although the  U.S. State Department deplores the inefficiency or lack of will  on the part of the governments of Bolivia, Peru, Panama, and  Lebanon, among others, in the counternarcotics trafficking  struggle, it refuses to place them on the list of "punished"  nations, such as Iran, Syria, Burma, and Nigeria, for reasons of  "national security;" that is, for reasons totally removed from  the drug topic.    The U.S. document praises the Colombian Government for  killing Pablo Escobar, top leader of the Medellin Cartel,  despite the fact this, as well as other actions by Bogota  authorities, did not significantly reduce the production and  trafficking of cocaine, nor did it prevent the recent illegal  production of heroin. In other words, the exhaustive violence  unleashed in Colombia by the government's war against the  Antioquia band has caused infinite deaths but has not reduced  drug trafficking. In another sense, the report criticized  Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, a man of renowned moral  authority in Colombia, for negotiating with certain  narcotraffickers the reduction of their sentences in exchange  for their surrender. U.S. officials can hardly condemn this  practice, however, when it is a daily practice in U.S. courts  for prosecutors to offer the accused, whether or not they are  narcotraffickers, more lenient sentences, acquittals, and even  money and protection in exchange for information.    Continuing with the examples, the U.S. State Department has  stated the Peruvian Government is plagued by vast corruption,  which makes it difficult to fight drugs, but does not say a  single word about the same phenomenon in the United States. It  omits the fact that only the corruption of government employees  can explain the massive entry of drugs to the nation which  consumes the most drugs in the world.    Panama's case merits separate mention. With the pretext of  fighting narcotrafficking, Panama was invaded violently by U.S.  troops, a country whose institutions were destroyed and in which  puppets to Washington's liking were placed in power. They are  the same ones now accused by the State Department of doing  nothing to eradicate the laundering of drug money. This fact  constitutes either a demonstration a priori of how false the  Bush administration arguments were or proof the interfering  imposition of pro-U.S. governments is no guarantee that that  drug policy will meet U.S. demands.    After viewing the confused, partial, and interventionist  nature of the report issued yesterday in Washington, the  inclusion of Mexico on the list of nations that "have complied"  is encouraging only in the sense it can be considered a  guarantee that U.S. authorities will not use the  narcotrafficking topic as a pretext to exert undue pressure  against our country, as they have done other times. The  assessment of Mexico's counterdrug struggle and achievements,  viewed as important and commendable, corresponds solely and  exclusively to Mexicans' sovereignty and no foreign government  has the legal or moral authority to give "grades" on this or  other domestic issues.    Finally, and strangely enough, it should be noted the U.S.  Government in its report is capable of setting aside its  anti-Cuban phobia, giving a report devoid of ideology, although  no less interfering, on the efforts by the Havana government in  the counternarcotics trafficking struggle. Concerning the rest,  the document presented by the U.S. State Department yesterday  depicts a combination of deplorable attitudes, which hinder  reaching international agreements that are needed to confront  the drug plight with a global, multilateral spirit, to attack  simultaneously consumption, production, and the illegal sale of  drugs, respectful of sovereignties.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / France warns of rise in jobless LABOUR minister Mr Michel Giraud yesterday warned that France's unemployment rate of 10.7 per cent would rise much further by the end of the year, Reuter reports from Paris. He said estimates by Unedic, the French unemployment fund, that the number of unemployed would rise by 340,000 this year were realistic. In the first quarter of the year, the number of unemployed grew by 88,000 to 3,066,400, or 10.7 per cent of the workforce. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who last week unveiled a mini-budget aimed at reviving growth, has already said he does not expect unemployment to peak before late 1993 or early 1994. The National Statistics Institute, in a report confirming that France had sunk into recession, forecast last week that the jobless rate would climb to 11.2 per cent as early as June. The economic downturn was yesterday underscored by reports from union officials that Elf-Atochem, the chemical group, and Shell France, the oil company, planned to cut a total of 1,350 jobs. Faced with the deterioration in the job market, Mr Giraud said the government must continue with measures to ease unemployment and companies must limit lay-offs. A five-year employment plan being drawn up in consultation with employers and unions would aim to promote job creation by easing payroll taxes on low-paid workers, rethink the way part-time work is organised and improve vocational training.</p>

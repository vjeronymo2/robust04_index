			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Olympic revenue to increase to Dollars 2.5bn TOTAL REVENUES to the Olympic movement, from the sale of television rights and sponsorships, were Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.23bn) in 1989-92 and projections for the next four years, which cover the Lillehammer and Atlanta Games, show an increase to nearly Dollars 2.5bn, the International Olympic Committee said yesterday in disclosing details of its financial standing for the first time, writes Keith Wheatley in Monte Carlo. The Lausanne-based IOC has assets of Dollars 125m and received an average annual income for its own use of Dollars 39m over the latest period. In its first-ever annual report Mr Francois Carrard, chief executive, says that less than 7 per cent of gross income is retained by the IOC to fund administration. The remainder is distributed to Games organising committees, national Olympic committees and individual sports federations. Yesterday the IOC, meeting in Monaco where it will choose the site of the 2000 Games, agreed to establish an independent Olympic Foundation. Lausanne's Olympic Museum, opened in June, and other assets worth up to Dollars 74m will be transferred to the foundation by the end of this year.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges lower as region continues to set records PROFIT-TAKING and arbitrage selling depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average lost ground in spite of early morning buying by life insurers and public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index ended 102.21 off at 20,072.21, having firmed in the morning, led by continued strength in telecommunications shares, to a day's high of 20,265.53. However, index-linked selling pushed down prices and the average hit the day's low of 20,071.51 just before the close. Volume came to 222.3m shares, against 338m. Falls led rises by 620 to 340, with 205 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 5.32 to 1,648.69, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.07 at 1,282.60. In the morning, financial institutions bought high-technology issues due to the lower yen, while traders sought telecommunications stocks on news of the merger between Bell Atlantic, of the US, and Tele-Communications Inc, the US cable television operator. However, slow trading in the afternoon prompted profit-taking. Index-linked selling also depressed share prices as stock futures traders, discouraged by a fall in bond prices, liquidated positions. Construction companies, battered by the recent spate of bribery scandals, fell on small-lot selling. Obayashi weakened Y15 to Y660 and Taisei declined Y14 to Y665. Mazda Motor dipped Y3 to Y453 on selling by foreign investors. Profit-taking depressed large-capital issues, with Nippon Steel easing Y2 to Y327 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y1 to Y682. The yen's decline against the dollar supported some export-oriented high-technology issues. Matsushita Electric Industrial rose Y10 to Y1,500. Aiwa jumped Y180 to Y1,780 on favourable earnings reports, while Sony, its parent company, gained Y190 at Y4,800. Telecom-related shares were higher. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y4,000 to Y910,000, Fujitsu, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y1 to Y867 and Oki Electric advanced Y8 to Y563. DDI, the long-distance telecom company listed on the second section, closed unchanged at Y6.78m after hitting a record high of Y6.96m during the morning. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 82.12 to 22,245.79 in volume of 18.7m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets maintained their record-setting ways. In Bombay, brokers continued a strike that has shut down the bourse after a judge delayed settlement of a dispute over shares, seized by tax authorities investigating a securities scandal. HONG KONG continued to break new ground, with unceasing demand by large and small investors taking the Hang Seng index 267.15, or 3.1 per cent, higher to a record 9,031.13, after a day's peak of 9,053.98. The market breached 8,000 just eight trading sessions ago and is up 63.9 per cent so far in 1993. Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 10.20bn, compared with HKDollars 9.09bn on Friday. On the futures exchange the October Hang Seng futures contract closed at a strong premium to the market at 9,145, up 325 points, and November and December contracts both finished at 9,150. Star performers were Jardine Matheson, HKDollars 4 higher at HKDollars 73.50, HSBC, up HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars 90, and Wharf Holdings, HKDollars 2.10 ahead at HKDollars 27.40. AUSTRALIA established another six-year peak in spite of some profit-taking in afternoon trade. The All Ordinaries index added 11.4 at 2,085.5 after an intraday high of 2,086.4. BHP, 24 stronger at ADollars 17.68, and News Corp, 16 cents ahead at ADollars 11.80, both continued to set all-time highs. NEW ZEALAND registered a new four-year peak, with the strength of foreign markets helping to support prices. The NZSE-40 capital index climbed 14.79 to 2,087.34 in moderate turnover of NZDollars 29.48m. Most leaders posted modest gains, while selected smaller issues were very strong, especially in the publishing sector. MANILA finished at a record high as buying of PLDT continued to buoy the market and offset profit-taking. The composite index was up 12.70 at 2,187.95 after touching 2,216.08. PLDT rose 35 pesos to 1,850 pesos. TAIPEI closed higher for the seventh consecutive day, on a late wave of buying in financials. The weighted index, little changed for much of the session, ended 30.31 up at 4,061.47 in active trade of TDollars 24.3bn. SINGAPORE moved forward but early gains were pared in a technical correction after the market hit an intraday peak of 2,145.68. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 3.19 ahead at 2,116.14. SEOUL bounced higher at the close on the back of strong foreign and individual buying of small and medium-capitalisation issues which neutralised earlier profit-taking. The composite index ended 8.05 up at 747.19. BANGKOK's SET index fell 4.15 to 1,150.80 after reductions in lending and deposit rates by leading banks triggered selling of financial stocks. KUALA LUMPUR halted an eight-session record-setting streak as profit-taking pulled the composite index 12.93 lower to 914.53.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Chancery plays phoenix CHANCERY, the BES sponsor which was critically damaged earlier this year when its parent bank went into administration, has been resurrected under the wing of Close Brothers, the merchant bank. The four-strong management team, and two support staff, have now joined Close Brothers Investment, a newly created subsidiary. The BES companies which the team launched over the past five years will continue to be monitored by remaining staff at Chancery, headed by John Dodwell, who founded the division. Chancery will not float any new BES companies in this tax year. Craig Reader, previously managing director at Chancery, said the team would attempt to 'do a phoenix impression' at Close Brothers. The company wants to make BES issues by the end of September, when the opportunity to carry forward tax relief from last year ends. Its particular interest will be in 'growth assured' companies, which attempt to cut the risk in BES property investments by obtaining promises from housing associations to buy back properties at a fixed price after five years. Close Brothers will also look at tax shelter investments in enterprise zone property. Reader said he also hoped to explore the buy-back concept for trading companies, rather than assured tenancy property companies, although he admitted the upper limit for investment of Pounds 750,000 in these companies was a problem. Chancery was second in the BES market before the trouble hit its liquidator, but several other sponsors successfully launched schemes with 'buy-back' arrangements towards the end of the last tax year. Its enterprise zone trust deal for a property in Docklands was sponsored instead by Greig Middleton, and raised Pounds 10.72m.</p>

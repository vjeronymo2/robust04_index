			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The methodology for determining the wage index values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for redesignated hospitals is applied jointly to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals located in those rural counties that were deemed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urban under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act and those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals that were reclassified as a result of the MGCRB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(8)(C) of the Act provides that the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wage index to redesignated hospitals is dependent on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hypothetical impact that the wage data from these hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have on the wage index value for the area to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they have been redesignated. Therefore, pursuant to section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(8)(c) of the Act, the wage index values were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by considering the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If including the wage data for the redesignated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals reduces the MSA wage index value by 1 percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point or less, the MSA wage index value determined exclusive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the wage data for the redesignated hospitals applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the redesignated hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If including the wage data for the redesignated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals reduces the wage index value for the area to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hospitals are redesignated by more than 1 percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point, the hospitals that are redesignated are subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wage index value of the area that results from including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wage data of the redesignated hospitals (the ``combined''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index value). However, the wage index value for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated hospitals cannot be reduced below the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index value for the rural areas of the State in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals are located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Rural areas whose wage index values would be reduced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluding the data for hospitals that have been redesignated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to another area continue to have their wage index calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as if no redesignation had occurred. Those rural areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose wage index value increases as a result of excluding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wage data for the hospitals that have been redesignated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to another area have their wage index calculated exclusive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the redesignated hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The wage index value for an urban area is calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusive of the wage data for hospitals that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassified to another area. However, geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification may not reduce the wage index for an urban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area below the Statewide rural average, provided the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index prior to reclassification was greater than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statewide rural wage index value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 13501(b) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 amended section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(8)(C) of the Act to provide that a change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification of hospitals from one area to another may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in the reduction in the wage index for any urban area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose wage index is below the rural wage index for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State. This provision also applies to any urban area that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encompasses an entire State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that, except for those rural areas where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignation would reduce the rural wage index value, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the situation described above that was addressed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 13501(b) of Public Law 103&hyph;66, the wage index value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each area is computed exclusive of the data for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals that have been redesignated from the area for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of their wage index. As a result, several MSAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in Table 4a have no hospitals remaining in the MSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is because all the hospitals originally in these MSAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been reclassified to another area by the MGCRB. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those areas, we have listed the Statewide rural wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revised wage index values effective for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994 are shown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Tables 4a, 4b, and 4c of the addendum to this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. Hospitals that are redesignated should use the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index values shown in Table 4c. For some areas, more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one wage index value will be shown in Table 4c. This occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when hospitals from more than one State are included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group of redesignated hospitals, and one State has a higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statewide rural wage index value than the wage index value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise applicable to the redesignated hospitals. Tables  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4d and 4e list the average hourly wage for each labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area based on the FY 1991 wage data. In addition, we have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded Table 3c (Hospital Case-Mix Indexes for Discharges)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include the average hourly wage for each hospital based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the FY 1991 data. The average hourly wage published in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule will be used by the MGCRB to evaluate if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital meets the reclassification criteria. Hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that choose to apply before publication of the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can use the proposed wage data in applying to the MGCRB for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index reclassifications that would be effective for FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996. We note that in adjudicating these wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification requests during FY 1995, the MGCRB will use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the average hourly wages for each hospital and labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area that are reflected in the final FY 1995 wage index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FY 1995 wage index values incorporate all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification decisions made by the MGCRB for FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time this proposed wage index was constructed, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MGCRB had completed its review. There were 429 hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated for purposes of the wage index (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals redesignated under both sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(10) of the Act). This number does not include MGCRB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions that are still under review by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any changes to the wage index that result from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawals of requests for reclassification, wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrections, appeals, and the Administrator's review process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be incorporated into the wage index values published in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule. The changes may affect not only the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index value for specific geographic areas, but also whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated hospitals receive the wage index value for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area to which they are redesignated or a combined wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that includes the data for both the hospitals already in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area and the redesignated hospitals. Further, the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index value for the area from which the hospitals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated may be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;412.273, hospitals that have been reclassified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the MGCRB are permitted to withdraw their applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 45 days of the publication of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document. The request for withdrawal of an application for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification that would be effective in FY 1995 must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received by the MGCRB by [OFR: Insert date 45 days after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of publication]. A hospital that requests to withdraw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its application may not request that the MGCRB decision be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reinstated after publication of the final wage index values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pelts: "Peacekeeping Forces' Training </F> Battles"]    [Text] Tajikistan -- Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian  defense minister, arrived in Dushanbe. With the defense  ministers of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan he will observe the  course of the tactical exercise by the collective peacekeeping  forces and Russian Border Troops in the Republic of Tajikistan.    As we know, the main aim of the exercises is to improve the  system of management of the collective peacekeeping forces and  also to rehearse combat teamwork training and collaboration with  the Russian Border Troops units. The first stage -- putting the  units in a state of heightened combat readiness, advancing into  the region of the exercises, and field fortification -- has been  completed. As Colonel General Grigoriy Bessmertnyy, chief of  staff of the collective peacekeeping forces, stressed in an  exclusive interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, all troops taking part  in the exercise have taken up their positions and are prepared  to research defense operations. It is planned later in  conjunction with the border guards as the tactical training  situation proceeds to switch from defensive operations to a  counterattack -- to "restore the situation along the Republic of  Tajikistan state border."    Grigoriy Bessmertnyy stressed that the exercise which is  being conducted is not connected with the complication of the  situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and is a planned one. The  joint command had given advance notification of the start of the  exercise and had invited numerous observers, including through  UN channels, and the ambassadors of Russia and the United States  to the Republic of Tajikistan. He also denied rumors which had  appeared in various mass media that the troops' actions could  cause serious harm to the natural resources of the "Tigrovaya  balka" state nature reserve. The collective peacekeeping forces  chief of staff stated that the region of the exercise had been  agreed in advance with the leadership of the Republic of  Tajikistan and with environmental specialists. The rumors which  have appeared are all the more unfounded in that the area where  the exercise is being conducted is in the Northern regions of  "Tigrovaya balka" and more than 15 km from the borders of the  state nature reserve.    Touching on the progress of the exercise, Colonel General  Grigoriy Bessmertnyy noted that it had entered its most active  stage 23 March.    Our correspondent visited the Russian border guards on the  eve of the study, and in particular the tragically famous 12th  border post, which now bears the name of 25 heroes. According  to Lieutenant Aleksandr Orlov, acting chief of the post, the  situation here remains complex. On 20 March Tajik gunmen and  mojahedin had yet again shelled the mobile observation point.  The border guards put an end to the act of provocation with  return mortar fire. There were no casualties among the border  guards. Here, at the 12th border post, Russian servicemen of  the 201st motorized rifle division are serving -- tank crews  under the command of Senior Lieutenant Yuriy Nekrasov.</p>

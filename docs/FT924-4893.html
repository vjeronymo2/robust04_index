			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Contracting for public services - regulations not extended for first time, and employees' fears confirmed Sir, Mr Waldegrave's attempt to reassure potential contractors for public services ('Government seeks to clarify rights of employees in transfers', November 26) will only serve to confirm their fears. He claims that discussion of the application of the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (TUPE) is a 'red herring'. The only thing fishy about the debate is the government's attempt to pretend that the TUPE regulations (and the EC directive on which they are based) have no effect on the market testing programme. Playing with words, the government argues that TUPE has always covered the public sector. Formally, this is true - but up to now TUPE has never been deemed to cover the contracting out of public services because 'non-commercial' ventures were excluded. The government's recent proposed amendments to UK legislation effectively admit that it was in breach of the EC directive. The minister's next defence is that the regulations applied 'only when an undertaking was transferred' and that this would depend on the facts of the case. A recent European Court of Justice decision makes it much more likely that the regulations would now apply in most cases of contracting out of services. And to rub salt into the wounds (or the herring), those who have suffered as a result of the government's failure to implement correctly an EC directive into domestic law now have the option of bringing an action for damages against the government under principles laid down by the European Court of Justice.

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUS IS THE LATEST ATTRACTION FOR THE FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> TRANSIT: AGENCIES ALLOCATE FUNDS TO IMPROVE SERVICE DURING THE 17-DAY CULTURAL  EVENT. OFFICIALS HOPE PUBLIC TRANSIT WILL PROVE A CATCHING EXPERIENCE  YEAR-ROUND.  </P> <P> Southern California residents attending September's Los Angeles Festival could  be in for an exotic new experience:  </P> <P> Riding the bus.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and the Southern  California Rapid Transit District approved an allocation of $150,000 to ensure  that Angelenos can get to the Los Angeles Festival. For many denizens of  car-crazed L.A., boarding a city bus might represent a bigger culture shock  than attending a performance by aborigine spiritual dancers or the Kun Opera of  China.  </P> <P> But festival and transportation officials hope the 750,000 expected to attend  the 17 days of festival events will help prevent traffic snarls and parking  hassles at 70 widespread venues by taking public transportation.  </P> <P> They also hope a good experience during the festival will entice passengers to  commute by bus regularly.  </P> <P> The funds will allow municipal bus lines to extend beyond their usual  boundaries, beef up the ranks of traffic control officers and engineers and  provide traffic helicopters. Riders can already get computerized route  information by calling (800) 2LA-RIDE.  </P> <P> Bill Bicker, Mayor Bradley's transportation adviser, said developing a  transportation plan for Los Angeles Festival 1990 is more difficult than for  the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival and the 1987 Los Angeles Festival, where most  events were by paid attendance. Since 75% of the events at this year's festival  are free, it's tougher to anticipate attendance, he said.  </P> <P> Bicker said cities will determine which events might be particularly attractive  to their residents and add bus lines accordingly. "For example, there are some  ethnic groups (in specific neighborhoods) that might be attracted to particular  events," Bicker said.  </P> <P> In addition to RTD buses and shuttles, UCLA's Fleet and Transit Service will be  used to take the public and 500 international artists participating in the  festival who will be living at UCLA's Artists Village to festival sites.  </P> <P> A shuttle-bus service will be developed with $85,000 of the allocated funds to  take festivalgoers from parking sites to major festival event areas, some of  which have little or no parking space.  </P> <P> In some cases, "if you don't utilize the park-and-ride, you don't go to the  festival," said Errol Talley, special events coordinator for the Department of  Transportation.  </P> <P> A case in point are the opening-day ceremonies, slated for Sept. 1 at San  Pedro's Angel's Gate and nearby Point Fermin Park. There are only a few dozen  parking spaces at the site, but between 60,000 and 100,000 people are expected  to visit the site over the three-day Labor Day weekend. Signs will direct  visitors to various large nearby parking sites and shuttles will take them to  festival site areas.  </P> <P> Bicker said no special transportation or parking will be provided for weekday  events, which are predicted to draw crowds of less than 1,000.  </P></p>

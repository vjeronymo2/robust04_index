			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average recovers 1.2% to 16,492 COMMENTS BY leading politicians advocating government support for the market, and renewed hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate, prompted short-covering and shares rose for the first time in three trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 205.18 at 16,492.63, its first rise of more than 200 points since December 18. The index fluctuated between 16,216.11 and 16,535.47, jumping near the end of the session before losing some gains on profit-taking. Volume increased to 200m shares from 175m. Advances led falls by 572 to 364, with 187 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 5.85 to 1,255.91, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.17 to 1,016.24. Calls by Mr Yoshiro Mori, the minister of international trade and industry, for government support for the weak stock market boosted sentiment, along with comments by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who hinted at the possibility of public support for the land purchasing organisation set up today for the country's ailing banks. Some retail issues held by Shuwa, the troubled stock and land speculator, gained ground. The stocks recently met heavy selling on reports that Shuwa, which is squeezed for cash, was looking for buyers of the stocks. Isetan, the department store, rebounded Y110 to Y1,920, Nagasakiya rose Y47 to Y805 and Matsuzakaya Y42 to Y992. Oil issues were in favour on an overnight surge in the oil sector on Wall Street, due to growing expectations of output reductions by Opec members. Nippon Housing Loan, burdened with mounting bad loans, fell Y13 to Y266 on reports of a Y60bn annual loss. On the over-the-counter market, NMB Semiconductor, affiliate of Minebea, lost Y100,000 to Y658,000, falling by its daily limit for the third consecutive session. Minebea and Nippon Steel are in negotiations over the transfer of NMB, and the Japan Securities Dealers Association is investigating possible insider trading of NMB shares prior to the announcement. In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 45.72 to 17,805.77 in volume of 44.3m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday. HONG KONG returned from the long holiday weekend, but after some early buying prices gave up much of the advance to leave the Hang Seng index a net 9.34 up at 5,923.73, after touching 5,970. Turnover of HKDollars 2.09bn was down from last Thursday's HKDollars 2.34bn. HSBC was the most active stock, rising HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 62 in line with sharp advances in London in recent days. AWT World Transport said its public offer of 38.15m shares at HKDollars 1.02 each was more than 81 times oversubscribed. AUSTRALIAN shares held on to early gains to close slightly higher in scattered trade which was hampered by the Australia Day holiday. But the crossing of two large portfolios in London brought sharp movements in transport leader Brambles. The All Ordinaries index added 5.8 at 1,529.2. Brambles rose 8 cents to ADollars 16.20 in early trade but fell back to close 12 cents down at ADollars 16 after broker Ord Minnett sold 3.65m shares at ADollars 15.80. Minnett also sold a portfolio valued at ADollars 2.3m, while BZW sold two portfolios, each valued at ADollars 70m, in London overnight. The London portfolio trade boosted local turnover to 110.9m shares. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index rose 8.50 to 1,605.28, just below the record 1,607.12 set on March 27, 1990. Volume was 43.8m shares. MANILA was lower after last week's rally and the composite index fell 22.83 to 1,317.31. Brokers said the market had already discounted President Fidel Ramos's announcement of his determination to break up the monopoly of phone giant Philippine Long Distance Telephone. PLDT shares ended 25 pesos lower at 865 pesos The state-run National Development Company is to auction 89.7 per cent of International Corporate Bank in April after acquiring 40 per cent of the equity from American Express Bank. The remaining 10 pct of the bank, known as Interbank, will be sold immediately after to small Filipino investors. SEOUL was easier, with the widely expected announcement of interest rate cuts already discounted. The composite index shed 5.11 to 702.50 in heavy trade. KUALA LUMPUR was mixed in thin trading with the market lacking a clear direction. The composite index edged up 0.41 to 626.34. TAIWAN is to offer stakes in state-owned enterprises to foreign investors during the next six months as the government pushes ahead with its faltering privatisation programme.</p>

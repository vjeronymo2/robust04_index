			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexico to ease way for mining investors THE MEXICAN government has submitted new mining laws to congress that will lighten the administrative burden of investing in the country's mining sector, and provide greater legal security for the investor. The new laws, which are certain to be passed by congress, will scrap all restrictions for Mexicans on investing in concessions in the mineral sector, except in hydrocarbons and uranium. Previously domestic investors in strategic minerals, such as rock phosphate, sulphur and potassium, wishing to have full ownership rights over a concession were forced to enter into a limited partnership with the government, to whom they would have to pay royalties and surrender a percentage of profits. Private investment in coal was prohibited. The government will also ease restrictions on foreign investment in concessions for gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper mining. In the past foreign investors in these sectors had to be minority partners or set up cumbersome trusts that allowed them to circumvent the law. Now foreign investors can purchase 100 per cent of the full voting shares of a mining company. Mexico's constitution reserves to the state mineral ownership, but allows the government to sell off concessions. The new legislation increases the period of concession for prospecting from three to six years and for exploitation from 25 to 50 years, both periods being renewable. Mexico, whose economy under Spanish colonial rule was built on the exploitation of its huge mineral deposits, is still the world's largest producer of silver, and among the top producers of sodium, graphite, copper, sulphur and zinc. The government has also reduced by half taxes on mining concessions in the past two years to 3.5 per cent, and plans to eliminate them altogether in another two years, in the hope of attracting more investment.</p>

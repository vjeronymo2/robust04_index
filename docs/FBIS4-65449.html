			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alexis Papakhelas from Washington] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's government has  actively intervened in the mediation efforts for Skopje by  promoting an overall package solution and the name "North  Macedonia." U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz has presented  the U.S. package of "new ideas" to both sides. Nimetz is also  trying to convince the Greek community's leadership on the need  to compromise, and to focus on the name "North Macedonia."    U.S. officials said that President Clinton asked Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou, during their recent telephone  conversation, to study seriously the U.S. proposals. According  to the same officials, Papandreou agreed to submit a reasonable  alternative solution. The White House has taken the Greek prime  minister's promise very seriously and believes that it is  possible to reach a compromise by June.    President Clinton's close associate George Stephanopoulos  told private station MEGA that (during their telephone  conversation) Clinton "encouraged Papandreou to proceed with a  swift solution to the problem." Stephanopoulos stressed that  "the United States has submitted some new ideas and is now  waiting for the Greek proposals." He added: "The United States  believes the more comprehensive a solution is, the better."    UN mediator Cyrus Vance met Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis,  the Foreign Ministry secretary general, in New York yesterday.  According to reliable information, Vance is trying to determine  Greece's real intentions on the name issue. In the first phase,  concerning Skopje's name, he tried to determine whether the  Greek side would prefer a geographical or a national definition  before the term "Macedonia." Diplomatic observers believe Vance  considers the solution of a composite name as a given, but has  abandoned the term "Nova Majedonia" because he knows that it has  been identified with negotiations of former Prime Minister  Konstandinos Mitsotakis' government.    The same observers appear pessimistic about the outcome of  the New York talks. They note that both sides may accept the  principle of a "package solution," but point out that it would  be very difficult to agree on a compromise solution on the name  issue.</p>

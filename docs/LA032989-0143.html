Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> POLICE LIE INVALIDATES MURDER CASE  </P> <P> A man accused of killing a detective during a drug raid cannot be tried because  police lied to obtain the search warrant, a judge ruled today.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Charles M. Grabau dismissed the murder charge against  Albert Lewin, 33, ending a case that has raised questions about whether police  routinely lie in obtaining warrants.  </P> <P> "A fair trial is not possible," the judge told a jammed courtroom. "The conduct  was egregious . . . and the evidence is tainted."  </P></p>

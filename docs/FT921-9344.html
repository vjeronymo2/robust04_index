			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Planned rise in EC revenue may reawaken old quarrels THE European Commission last night agreed proposals to raise Community budget revenue by a third over the next five years. Officials fear the package could lead to a re-opening of budgetary squabbles between the UK and other EC members. Under the Commission plan, unanimously approved last night, EC revenue would rise from Ecu66bn (Pounds 47bn) this year to Ecu88bn in 1997, at 1992 prices. The 1993-97 financial plan, which Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, is due to present to the European Parliament today, aims to double fiscal transfers to Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece in order to help them prepare for economic and monetary union (Emu). If member states approve the plan, several countries undergoing fiscal strain will be asked to contribute significantly more than they do now, and there are clear signs that some will fight hard to shift part of the burden. Germany, the EC's main paymaster, is straining to finance unification and pay for its large east European aid programme. It has already asked the Commission to re-examine the budget rebate the UK has received since 1985. A senior Commission official said yesterday, however, that this would not happen until after the UK general election. The Financial Times has obtained normally confidential details on the net contributions made by EC governments. These illustrate why some countries are likely to demand revisions to the budget. Germany this year is contributing a net Ecu9bn to the EC's budget. The UK - the second largest net contributor - would contribute just over Ecu5bn but would receive more than Ecu2bn 'abatement'. This was originally won by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former UK prime minister, because Britain gets proportionally less than its comparable partners from the farm budget, which still accounts for 54 per cent of EC spending. Although contributions from both countries, and from France, the other main net contributor, are set to rise, Germany wants a redistribution of financial responsibility. 'It is pretty obvious that we have to talk about the UK rebate again,' a German official said. Belgium and Italy, two countries intent on entering Emu in the first wave later this decade, will be particularly hard hit. Belgium, like Denmark and the Netherlands, usually fares better under the EC budget than its high per capita income would justify. Italy's position fluctuates; this year it will take Ecu600m net out of the budget but in 1991 it contributed a net Ecu400m. However, both Belgium and Italy face uphill struggles to cut public indebtedness and budget deficits to meet the stiff Emu conditions by 1999. The Commission, concerned to contain the budgetary squabbles it fears will break out, insisted yesterday that the overall benefit of EC membership cannot be quantified simply in budgetary contributions.  --------------------------------------------------- 1992 EC BUDGET (in Ecu bn)  ---------------------------------------------------                          After    Before                             UK        UK                         rebate    rebate  --------------------------------------------------- Net contributors  --------------------------------------------------- Germany                    9.0       8.5 UK                         3.0       5.0 France                     1.5       0.9 Netherlands                0.1       0.0  --------------------------------------------------- Net recipients  --------------------------------------------------- Denmark                    0.5       0.5 Italy                      0.6       1.1 Luxembourg                 0.7       0.7 Portugal                   1.1       1.2 Belgium                    1.6       1.7 Ireland                    2.4       2.4 Spain                      2.9       3.2 Greece                     3.9       3.9  --------------------------------------------------- Source: European Commission  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 484] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, April 25, ELTA -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas told the radio that he "would try to  evaluate the historical stage of the Lithuanian-Polish relations  at the Seimas plenary meeting on Tuesday" [26 April].    Speeches by Lithuanian and Polish presidents will be  delivered soon after the treaty is signed. The ceremony should  take place around the noon on Tuesday.    Brazauskas said that the treaty included problems of the  national minorities and expressed hope that the articles of the  treaty would make a solid background to solve the problems of  Lithuanians in Poland and Poles in Lithuania on a parity basis".    Brazauskas put accents on educational problems. He said that  meanwhile 127 Polish schools worked in Lithuania while at the  beginnning of the national revival there were only 92. Last  year there were 148 groups for Polish children in the pre-school  institutions.    1200 young people of Polish nationality study at the  institutions of higher education, 400 every year leave for  Poland to study. Brazauskas reminded that last year the Polish  language and literature department had been established at  Vilnius University. 40 students study at the department.    Six specialities can be studied in Polish language at  Vilnius  Pedagogical University. Polish is also studied at Kaunas and  Vilnius Seminaries.    Four Polish periodicals out of eight which circulate in  Lithuania receive the support from the state. Polish radio and  television are broadcasted in Lithuania.    At the beginning of the year 261.5 thousand people of Polish  nationality lived in Lithuania, which made seven percent of the  total population.    There are 35 thousand of Lithuanians in Poland. They have  several schools, a magazine and broadcast radio features from  Bialystok.    Brazauskas said he did not want to set one nation against  the  other, however, Lithuanians in Poland had more cultural  problems. Brazauskas hoped to discuss many of them during the  meeting with Walesa.</p>

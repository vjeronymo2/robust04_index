			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Irish government invites bids for Greencore stake THE IRISH government yesterday threw open the bidding for its 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the recently privatised agribusiness group, following reported objections from minority coalition partners over proposals to sell the holding to a US agricultural conglomerate. In a statement issued yesterday, the government said it had intended to dispose of the stake through an institutional placing. However, following approaches from an international foods group - believed to be Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland - and several Irish food companies, it decided to open the bidding until March 24. Although ADM has categorically denied it is involved in discussions on buying the stake, speculation now centres on Alfred Topfer, a European associate of the US company. Yesterday, that company also denied it was involved. The decision to put the stake on the open market is reported to have angered management at Greencore, which has been seeking a partner to help it expand in Europe. In a statement released yesterday, Greencore confirmed that it had introduced a company, believed be a European associate of ADM, to the government with a view to buying the stake. However, it had not been informed of approaches from Irish parties. Observers in Dublin speculated that the Greencore stake had become a political football, following the controversy over last week's decision by Digital Equipment, the US computer maker, to close its manufacturing facility at Galway. 'Games are being played by the minority parties,' said one observer. 'They cannot be seen to be selling it immediately.' The government stressed in its statement that any decision on the stake would be based on price and the 'long-term strategic development of Greencore as a major Irish food company'. Greencore's own statement, however, stressed its interest in developing an 'Irish-based international food group'. Most analysts dismissed the possibility of an Irish company taking the stake. The two domestic groups which analysts suggested would have the cash were Dairygold and Fyffes. Neither would bring any strategic advantages to Greencore, observers said. The favourite was still ADM or a company associated with it. Greencore will have the last say in any substantial sale by the government, as disposals of 15 per cent or more require the approval of shareholders at an extraordinary meeting. Greencore announced yesterday that its shares, suspended at 245p in London on Monday, would resume trading this morning. Reports of the proposal from the international food group cited an offer of about 260p per share, valuing the stake at Pounds 66m. The group is believed to be prepared to go as high as 280p.</p>

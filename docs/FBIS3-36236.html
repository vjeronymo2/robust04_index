			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian delegation at  the Estonian-Russian talks, the latest round of which ended  today, said that Russia intends to link the issue of Russian  military pensioners rigidly with the troop withdrawal.  According to Svirin, Estonia demands that the majority of the  servicemen who retired after 20 August 1991 should leave when  the army leaves, even if they have no accommodation in Russia.  The remaining military pensioners must apply to Estonian  authorities for residence permits. At the same time they are  required to give a signed declaration saying that they have no  arms at home and do not intend to obtain any. Retired  servicemen must also promise not to join any military formations  nor endanger the state of Estonia through their actions.    Svirin stated that such requirements are humiliating.    According to Svirin, the Russian side expected to reach an  agreement on the citizenship issue, but the Estonian delegation  refused discussion on the matter.</p>

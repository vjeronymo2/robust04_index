			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN STUDENT PRESIDENT'S RESIGNATION  </P> <P> As a former president of the Associated Students at Cal State Northridge, I  feel a need to comment on the revelation (Feb. 28) that this year's president  failed to be enrolled as a student.  </P> <P> Every president knows the bylaws backward and forward and is aware of the  requirement to be taking seven units. Had Lynn Westlund been a student activist  or a minority, the CSUN administration probably would have attempted to remove  her from office, as it attempted to remove four senators from office in 1983  just for failing to sign our financial statements.  </P> <P> If Westlund's actions are not criminal fraud or misrepresentation for taking a  stipend and allocating funds, then they should be.  </P> <P> ZEKE ZEIDLER  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

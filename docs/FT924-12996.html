			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The repossession man who boards sinking ships - Simon Lyon-Smith tells Keith Wheatley about bankruptcy at sea FOR AN owner, much worse things happen to ships than simply sinking. They can be arrested for debts - even small ones - and prevented from trading their way back to solvency. A main engine failure can cripple a small ship financially in a way that dwarfs the effect, say, of a similar breakdown on a truck. With European freight volumes low and rates at rock bottom, a good many banks are finding themselves reluctant shipowners. Owner-skippers, often a romantic and commercially unrealistic breed, are tying their ships up and walking away from the debts. The more brazen simply stop making payments on their marine mortgages and find themselves face-to-face with Simon Lyon-Smith, a specialist in the arcane business of marine repossession. 'You used to be able to borrow 100 per cent against the right ship. A lot of skippers want to stop being a maritime lorry driver and be their own boss,' said Lyon-Smith. 'It's a dream to them to be a ship-owner - until you've been one and then it's a full-scale nightmare.' He speaks from the heart. Eight years ago, aged 25, he took a gamble on an old ship and made a fortune plying European ports on sky-high freight rates in the wake of the British miners' strike. One ship became four - all on bank finance and all old and cheap. While the luck held, Lyon-Smith seemed to be the archetypal 1980s success story. He had gone to sea at 15 with the long-established Exmouth coasting firm of Watts, earning first his mate's and then his master's ticket. His time as a ship owner ended with a series of engineering calamities and a shortage of work for the ships still at sea. The banks foreclosed. 'Explaining to the crew on Friday that you can't pay their wages or get them home. It's horrendous,' he said. 'We're seeing it all the time now but you just can't act like that.' Lyon-Smith was declared bankrupt with liabilities of just under Pounds 500,000. 'We lost everything. House, car, savings,' he admits with complete frankness. Even amid the wreckage of his business it grieved him that the banks were unable to obtain decent prices for the ships, which were after all their security for loans. Now he is a poacher-turned-gamekeeper; a 'marine repo man' acting for banks who are often all at sea and out of their depth. But Lyon-Smith also has a mission, to reverse the banks' simple desire to sell the asset at any price and demonstrate to them that shipping can be profitable and has a future. 'I don't want to take the attitude that it's just another bank who've made another silly blunder. I want to show that you can make money running ships,' he says. So, the bank becomes the owner and Lyon-Smith manages the vessel. At worst the income should pay the interest on the loan and, most important, the chances of a viable sale increase. According to Lyon-Smith any tonnage sold lying tied-up and idle is worth around 50 per cent less than a ship under charter and trading. British coastal shipping as an industry is in sorry decline. According to the National Union of Marine Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers there were 546 British-registered small coasters in 1975. This fell to 42 last year and, says Lyon-Smith, is now even lower. Yet, unlike steam locomotive manufacture, this is not an industry about to wither and die. German and Dutch small freighters still crowd north European harbours. Their governments, says Lyon-Smith, have for a decade subsidised the building of modern, efficient ships. If Britain could weed the over-mortgaged junk out of its fleet it might be on the beginnings of the road back, he believes. 'The older ships, more than about 15 years, I don't recommend that the bank even move them from the quay,' he says. 'We've got clients in the Middle East and West Indies that will take them as long as they're floating. The key thing then is to get the newer units trading again.' The analogy with houses is clear. Building societies have found to their chagrin that repossessed homes, empty and neglected during the legal process, have to be sold at auction for a fraction of their value. Even in the current market, a well-presented, maintained family home is still saleable. Banks have been pleasantly surprised - a couple amazed - that of four recent repossessions Lyon-Smith has been able to recover 100 per cent against three loans and 75 per cent on a more difficult case. Lyon-Smith also works as a consultant to vet fellow seafarers with stars in their eyes about buying an old ship and plying the coastal trade. 'I had a fellow the other day, early 40s, secure job as a captain with a blue-chip ferry company, high salary and he wanted to mortgage his house and invest his life savings in buying an old ship. I hope I talked him out of it,' said Lyon-Smith. 'British shipping as an industry is in a disgraceful state but we have to live in the world we're in. If my experience can prevent a few more disasters and show the financial boys that shipping is not inherently loss-making and unsuccessful then something good has come out of it.'

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Rwanda rebels make offer of a ceasefire Rwandan rebels yesterday said they were ready to end three days of fighting with government forces but would not withdraw from territory they had captured, Reuter reports from Kigali. The fighting raged on in northern districts as the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front's radio broadcast the announcement. Refugees continued to trek into Kigali. Food was growing scarce in the city and prices have shot up amid panic buying. The fighting was the worst flare-up since a ceasefire was agreed last August.</p>

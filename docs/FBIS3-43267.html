			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Luanda on 30 </F> December -- recorded]    [Text] Angolans, Excellencies:    Another year is about to end and yet the longed for peace is  not present in every home and in the hearts of Angolans as a  whole. The war continues, carrying in its midst destruction,  grief, misery, and suffering to millions of Angolans.  Nonetheless, I believe the situation will soon be overcome  because our people have always been able to resolve their  problems by themselves, however big the obstacles and the  difficulties they face. On this occasion, which should be one  of joy for all, I would like to convey a message of comfort and  hope to all those who have been forced to leave their homes or  live in locations and provinces occupied by National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] troops. I refer in  particular to the war orphans. I would also like to salute  Angolan and international organizations for everything they have  done to relieve the suffering of those Angolans.    We are all aware that for legitimate reasons, the government  has not been able to fully implement the program of action of  the party that won the September 1992 elections. In practice,  that program has been replaced by specific measures of an  emergency nature designed to minimize major shortcomings.  Although one still sees a degree of slackness on the part of  certain government officials over the implementation of urgent  tasks that have been planned, I am confident that the situation  will be overcome, and that the government will be more efficient  to ensure a better performance of the country's political and  socioeconomic sectors. It is imperative that our government  continues to ensure the functioning of democratic institutions,  self-defense operations against UNITA's military forces, and to  promote effective productive measures, giving priority to those  sectors that cater for the basic social requirements of the  people.    In addition to other parties and political forces, the  government has the great responsibility of organizing,  encouraging, and mobilizing citizens for productive work as a  precondition for the effective enhancement of their salaries,  and improvement of their living conditions. To achieve that, we  need capable and active cadres because the successful  implementation of the socioeconomic development program for 1994  depends on them. This program calls for effective work and the  socioeconomic enhancement of Angola as a whole, particularly the  areas of greater potential. The implementation of that program  is linked to the strengthening of the state's democratic  authority, the structural adjustment of the economy, and the  integration of Angolans into the national economy which is now  market orientated. In so doing, Angolans will be assured of  their social and economic upliftment, thus promoting real growth  for the stability of the country. In that context, agriculture  will be the basis of food security and economic growth.  Petroleum and mining will finance development, and education and  health will be the conduit for professional training and social  participation of citizens in the development process. This is a  challenge that the government ought to be able to accomplish as  soon as possible.    Other issues like the privatization of property, land  utilization, housing, and construction and related materials  will also require the government's great attention so that the  policies to be adopted and the tasks to be accomplished suit the  strategic interests of the state and the needs of the people.  The process of economic transformation will continue with a  view to favoring private initiative. That, however, does not  mean that the state should withdraw completely from the  productive economic sector. The state ought to be capable of  either replacing or complementing private initiative when the  latter shows no interest in less attractive activities, but  which are essential for development. Obviously, the scope and  complexity of those and other tasks call for an efficient,  operational, and sound government, as well as an efficient  public administration. It is, therefore, imperative to redefine  the policy on cadres and salaries, while continuing to introduce  indispensable changes to overcome stagnation and indiscipline.    In tandem with the implementation of the socioeconomic  development program and other urgent measures covering the  various sectors, the organization of the armed forces and of the  security and internal order services ought to be stepped up. It  is only in an atmosphere of calm and social peace that the  government can continue to implement the emergency measures  designed to halt the worsening of the situation and to create  conditions to reactivate economic development on a short-term  basis. Over the past year the police general command made a  praiseworthy effort to purge its ranks of undesirable and  pernicious elements. Despite material shortcomings and the  difficult living conditions of many of the command's staff  members, I urge it to continue with the purging of such elements  from the police ranks. The people want an organized, loyal,  disciplined, and vigilant police that ensure tranquility of  citizens, and see to it that social and private property is  protected.    The new Angolan armed forces have brilliantly accomplished  their mission. I am convinced that they will continue to defend  our people by holding on firmly to their positions on the ground  and preventing further advances by UNITA's military forces. The  Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Armed Forces  should, therefore, continue with their efforts to organize and  discipline the Angolan Armed Forces, seeing to it that their  equipment and personnel are better controlled, and that the  National Assembly approves the legislation required for the  strengthening of their role.    Excellencies, there can be no lasting solutions to the  current crisis unless they are followed by the creation of an  atmosphere of peace and national reconciliation. That is the  ultimate goal of the ongoing Lusaka talks. In its strategic  agenda for the resolution of the postelectoral crisis, the  government still believes that the Bicesse Accord is the legal  and political framework, and the relevant UN Security Council  resolutions the international legal and political basis of the  Angolan peace process.    So, I feel that only the demilitarization of UNITA, the  fulfillment of outstanding aspects of the Bicesse Accord, and,  as a consequence, national reconciliation are the fundamental  premises that guarantee peace and the country's stability. In  addition to that, there ought to be adherence to the principle  of respect for democracy by acknowledging the power of law as  legitimized by the people's verdict during the 29-30 September  1992 elections. These have resulted in power being legally in  the hands of the majority, with the rights of the minority being  respected.    That experience has taught us that the factors leading to  the  collapse of the Bicesse Accord included, in addition to UNITA's  bad faith, the profound mistrusts between the sides, the  extremely short timetables for the execution of essential tasks,  the lack of a budget to cover expenditure, the lack of resources  to finance all the operations, and the inadequate personnel of  the UN Angola Verification Mission-2.    New efforts should be made to avoid the same situation once  the Bicesse Accord is revived and implemented. So, it is  indispensable that we define realistic timetables for the  planning and execution of organizational, political, and  material tasks to be carried out by the government, the United  Nations, and the international community to ensure the  implementation of the future political commitments to be made by  the government and UNITA. The international community ought to  be aware of the costs and logistical difficulties posed by every  aspect of a peace operation in Angola and should take steps to  give its contribution.    Obviously, the government will not evade its  responsibilities. In its plan of action, the government will try  to consider every aspect of promoting stability and harmony in  the country. I think that the Angolan people will also give  their support when the time comes. The great political  awareness that the majority of our people have already shown  will once again permit them to distinguish between fair  solutions and measures that are useless and serve only to  promote chaos and anarchy.    We will continue our efforts to find a fair and lasting  solution to the Angolan dispute, but while that does not come  about, I urge you to be vigilant, to be even more committed to  the upholding of democracy, freedom, and the interests of the  Angolan people. Let us put aside all the artificial factors  that have led to misunderstanding and mistrust and begin the new  year, bearing always in mind the sacred values of national unity  and love for the fatherland. United, our people will win.  United, our people will fulfill their dream of peace and  prosperity. A happy new year. [applause]</p>

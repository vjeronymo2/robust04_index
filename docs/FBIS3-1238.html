W. de  Klerk on Wednesday [23 March] announced that 10 generals  implicated in the Goldstone Commission report into gun running  had been withdrawn from service without loss of privileges. He  told a press conference in the border town of Queenstown: "They  won't work...They will just become inactive."    The 10 included Maj-Gen "Krappies" Englebrecht. The others  would be named later on Wednesday, Mr de Klerk added. Generals  Basie Smit and Johan le Roux have since their implication in gun  running sought legal advice. There had been negotiations on  their withdrawal from service and a decision was expected on  Thursday morning.    Mr de Klerk said if those negotiations did not lead to the  generals' withdrawal, following laid down procedures, Minister  of Law and Order Mr Hernus Kriel would suspend them.</p>

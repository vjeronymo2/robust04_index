			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Explanation of Performance Standards Levels <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C numerical standards were derived from PY 1992 aggregate performance data reported on the JTPA Annual Status Report (JASR) and are generally set at a minimally-acceptable level that approximately 75% of the SDA's can be expected to exceed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revising the numerical standard for the Youth Entered Employment Rate (YEER) in the same way would lead to reduced standards for SDAs. However, recent National JTPA Study results suggest that employment and earnings experienced by out-of-school youth in JTPA fall short of acceptable levels. Therefore, to encourage improved services to out-of-school youth, the numerical standard for the YEER will remain at its current level of 41 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Earnings standards have been adjusted to account for expected future inflation. Finally, an additional special adjustment has been made to employment-related standards to account for the requirement in section 106(k) that permits credit, for performance standards purposes, only for employment that is scheduled for 20 or more hours per week.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar to the Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C standards, the Title III standard was derived from PY 1992 performance data reported on the Worker Adjustment Program Annual Program Report (WAPR). This standard is set at a level that, approximately, 75 percent of the substate areas can be expected to exceed. As with the employment measures for Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since discrete aggregate data were not available for PY 1992 Section 204(d) Older Worker program performance, available SPIR data were used to assist in setting performance standards levels for that program. As with the employment measures for Titles II&hyph;A, II&hyph;C, and III, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Programs operated under section 204(d) are State programs even though they may be managed by various local entities. Therefore, performance standards will be applied to the total older worker programs State-wide. Unlike the adult and youth programs under Title II&hyph;A/C, however, no incentive awards or sanctions are associated with these standards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Implementing Provisions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The following implementing requirements must be followed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Required Standards <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, Governors are required to set, for each SDA, a numerical performance standard for each of the six Secretary's measures; for the Older Worker program, Governors are required to set numerical Entered Employment Rate and Average Wage at Placement standards for programs operated under section 204(d); for Title III, Governors are required to set for each substate area a numerical performance standard for the Entered Employment Rate and are encouraged to establish an Average Wage at Placement goal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Setting the Standards <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Consistent with new legislative provisions, Governors are now  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> required <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to adjust the Secretary's performance standards to reflect local area circumstances (section 106(d)). Such adjustments apply to Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, section 204(d) and Title III programs, and must conform to the Secretary's parameters described below:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Procedures must be:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Responsive to the intent of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Consistently applied among the SDA's/SSA's,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Objective and equitable throughout the State,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _In conformance with widely accepted statistical criteria;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Source data must be:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Of public use quality,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Available upon request;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Results must be:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Documented,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Reproducible; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Adjustment factors must be limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Economic factors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Labor market conditions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Geographic factors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Characteristics of the population to be served,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Demonstrated difficulties in serving the population (this adjustment factor is new), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Type of services to be provided.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department offers Governors an adjustment methodology that conforms both to these parameters and to the requirement in section 106(d). This methodology covers Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C Section 204(d), and Title III programs and will be provided to States in a soon-to-be issued Training and Employment Information Notice. Should the Governor choose to use an alternate methodology, or make adjustments not addressed by the Departmental model, it must conform to the parameter criteria and be documented in the Governor's Coordination and Special Services Plan (GCSSP) prior to the program year to which it applies. The State Job Training Coordinating Council and, where appropriate, the State Human Resources Investment Council must have an opportunity to consider adjustments to the Secretary's standards and to recommend variations. To determine whether an SDA has met or exceeded a performance standard, Governors must use actual end-of-year program data to recalculate the performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Performance Standards Definitions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Governors must calculate the performance of their SDA's, SSA's, and section 204(d) programs according to the definitions included in the Attachments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C Incentive and Sanction Policies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Performance standards are to be established for programs funded under Titles II and III of the Act. In applying the Secretary's standards for Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, Governors  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> must use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the six core measures and also consider criteria relating to programs successfully serving out-of-school youth and placement in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Governors are encouraged to begin using these criteria in PY 1994 incentive policies; these criteria are required (i.e., they cannot be zero-weighted) to be incorporated into State incentive policies beginning in PY 1995. Governors may select additional non-cost measures, such as increased service to hard-to-serve participants, to form the basis of incentive policies as long as the following criteria are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. As the basis for making incentive awards, the Governors must use  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i.e., cannot ``zero weight''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of the six Secretary's core measures. Beginning in PY 1995, Governors will also be required to reward innovative out-of-school youth program models either identified by the Department of Labor or recognized by the State as having a demonstrated record of success, and placements in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Although successful programs for out-of-school youth remain the cornerstone of out-of-school incentives, SDA's will still be expected to exceed the 50 percent minimum service level to be rewarded under that criterion. Governors have considerable flexibility in implementing the new incentive criteria. Suggested approaches to addressing these criteria are included as Attachments 3 and 4 to this TEGL. Decisions regarding the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> relative <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  weight or emphasis of each core measure (e.g., the Youth Entered Employment Rate) and incentive criterion (e.g., placement in jobs with employer-assisted benefits) in a State's incentive award formula rest with the Governor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

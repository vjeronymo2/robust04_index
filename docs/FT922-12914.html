			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: The beginning of an era of change for Hong Kong investors - The impact of the Hongkong Bank's takeover of the UK clearer on the colony's banking sector INVESTMENT analysis in Hong Kong will never be quite the same again. HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong Bank, yesterday ended years of speculation with the revelation of its secret inner reserves. The final figure caused few surprises, amounting to HKDollars 16.6bn (Pounds 1.2bn), before minority interests, with an additional HKDollars 8.7bn surplus on the value of its long- term investments and proper- ties. Hongkong Bank still, however, stuck by its rule of valuing its interest in Hang Seng bank at its 1965 acquisition price of HKDollars 51m. Today that shareholding is worth about HKDollars 33bn. The new figures emphasised the profitability of the bank's Hong Kong operations - the colony accounted for 45 per cent of the bank's assets and 87 per cent of its profits before tax in 1991 - but underline the risks inherent in its expansion away from its main profit centre. The latest figures, accompanying HSBC's recommended offer for Midland Bank, come as an enlightening post-script to the bank's recently announced 1991 profits. For the first time investors caught a glimpse of the banking group's genuine earnings over the past three financial years and the numbers are impressive. The strength of HSBC's local operations was highlighted in the fact that it transferred HKDollars 1.58bn to its inner reserves in 1990, one of the toughest years in recent banking history. While 1991's HKDollars 6.77bn group profit (before minority interests), understated the actual figure by HKDollars 3.52bn. The total amount transferred by HSBC to its inner reserves over the past three years amounted to HKDollars 8.5bn. HSBC's announcement was accompanied by its 62 per cent-owned local subsidiary Hang Seng Bank declaring inner reserves. These amounted to HKDollars 7.06bn at December 31 1991, and compares with its shareholders' funds of HKDollars 23.16bn. The impact of the Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng's revelations are profound for the Hong Kong banking sector. Today the Hong Kong market will be trading banking stocks on unequal information. The colony's two biggest banks will be trading on a fully disclosed basis while others, notably the Bank of East Asia, Dao Heng Bank and Wing Lung Bank, will be trading on information which includes transfers to inner reserves. Analysts believe that Hongkong Bank's actions will force other listed Hong Kong banks to follow suit. The banking sector has necessarily been rated on the basis of disclosed earnings. In the case of Hang Seng Bank, the actual profits were 60 per cent higher than those it had announced to shareholders in February, due to a HKDollars 1.72bn transfer to its reserves. Analysts expected strong support for Hang Seng Bank shares as a result, providing added incentives for the remainder of the listed banks to follow suit and declare their true position. Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC, said Hongkong Bank had made little use of its inner reserves, except during the shipping crisis of the early 1980's and in 1987, when it wrote off the goodwill from the acquisition of Marine Midland and also marked down the US subsidiary's LDC loan exposure. The group's inner reserves would have been revealed for 1993, as a result of European banking legislation, but HSBC will be obliged to hard-sell its takeover offer and the reserves provide a big positive point. The HKDollars 16.61bn reserves represent a 20 per cent increase to its reported capital resources, resulting in a fully disclosed net asset value per share for HSBC of HKDollars 43.03, a premium of more than 10 per cent compared with its closing share price in Hong Kong. Mr Purves commented that criticism of the takeover of Midland has focused on the fact that Hong Kong has historically provided the bulk of group earnings and was entering a high growth period which would considerably outstrip the European economies. In 1990, when large banks around the world were writing off bad debts, Hongkong Bank had no need to resort to inner reserves. Its local operations contributed HKDollars 9.68bn to profit before tax, making up for HKDollars 2.89bn losses from its US and European operations. Mr Purves agreed with concern voiced by Chinese officials, over the bank stepping back from its his- toric base in Hong Kong. 'It is not in the group's interests to diminish its interests in Southern China and in Hong Kong. We are increas- ing our market share and will carry on doing so. We believe the authorities in China have nothing to fear,' he said. But in spite of his lengthy justification for the merger, there remained considerable concern that the deal was substantially pitched to the favour of London. One Hong Kong broker gave a 'consensus view' of the short-term impact of the Midland offer. 'From the UK side it is not paying enough. And on the Hong Kong side it is paying too much,' he said. Hong Kong operations had been expected to contribute substantial earnings growth in 1992. The impact will be diluted by the acquisition of the still-troubled Midland. Hong Kong investors are being urged to focus on the long-term benefits of the deal, which should come through in 1994, according to latest brokers' estimates. But Hong Kong investors are not renowned for their long-term outlook. That said, there may be some short-term gain from the announcement that the bank's prohibition on one investor owning more than 1 per cent of its stock will go. This will enable fund managers to raise their holdings in what is still an attractively priced international bank.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  HSBC HOLDINGS: THE INNER RESERVES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Year ended    Year ended      Year Ended                               31/12/91      31/12/90        31/12/89                            Pounds million Pounds million Pounds million Group net profit reported        465           272           376 add back: transfers to inner reserves                242           108           234 Fully disclosed group profit     707           380           610 Profit attributable to minority interests*             (121)          (97)          (80) Profit atttributable to shareholders                  586           283           530 Fully disclosed EPS               36p           18p           33p  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital resources as reported  5,648         5,484         5,431 Add back: inner reserves at year end                    1,141           923           859 Fully disclosed capital resources                      6,789         6,407         6,290 Less: Loan capital &amp; pref shares                   (1,274)       (1,375)       (1,421) minority interests*             (696)         (592)         (526) Fully disclosed shareholders funds             4,819         4,440         4,343 Fully disclosed net asset value per share            296p          275p          271p  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * HSBC Holdings owns only 62 per cent of Hang Seng Bank.

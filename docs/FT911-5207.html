			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Japanese stifle a yawn at Gorbachev visit WELL BEFORE Mr Gorbachev was due to arrive in Tokyo today for his first-ever visit to Japan, most Japanese had been cured of Gorbymania. The craze for Gorbachev look-alike dolls, for holidays in the Soviet Union and books about perestroika passed about a year ago. Department stores, which normally mark the visit of foreign dignitaries with displays of their country's goods, are barely bothering to put on a show for Mr Gorbachev. Seibu, a leading chain, says: 'Soviet things are selling rather slowly. Buyers are not interested.' One reason is a lack of suitable products: Seibu's limited range includes vodka, brandy and Soviet military watches. Another is lack of organisation: the promoters of a show of Soviet culture had to make do with a troupe of Japanese dancers after the Russian ensemble they originally hired failed to get visas in time. Japanese politicians and journalists have tried to clothe the Soviet leader's visit with the sense of historic importance which it undoubtedly deserves. The programme includes a banquet with Emperor Akihito and the Empress, no fewer than three meetings with Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, a speech to the Japanese parliament and a reception for 2,500 VIPs. The Soviet leader is to present a medal to Mr Akira Kurosawa, the internationally acclaimed film director. Newspapers have been filled with long accounts of the territorial row which has blighted relations between the two countries since 1945. Around 8,000 journalists have been despatched to cover Mr Gorbachev's every move. Japanese television plans blanket coverage of the trip, interspersed with film of the bleak islands off northern Japan which are at the heart of the territorial dispute. Yet the average Japanese does not expect much to come out of the visit. According to a poll by NHK, the national television station, only 7 per cent of people believe there will be a great change in bilateral relations. Even nationalist groups which have been protesting for years about the disputed islands do not attach great significance to the trip. They planned a modest demonstration for 2,000 people, well away from anywhere Mr Gorbachev might see them. In a strange way, foreign ministry officials are quite pleased Mr Gorbachev has not caused a greater stir. The Soviet leader is not expected to bring with him an immediate settlement of the territorial question; at best he may promise to start looking for a settlement. Japanese are wise not to be swept off their feet by the mere sight of the great man.</p>

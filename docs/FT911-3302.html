			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Demand for wool continues to build up. Prices were sharply higher at New Zealand sales on April 24 by around 10-15%. British wool is now expected to be dearer at the forthcoming sale on May 1. Australian wool prices continue to rise steadily with all wool offered taken up by the trade. There is not the same buoyancy in consumer markets. Prices are some 10p per kilo. dearer for tops in Bradford, where US dollar strength is also a firming factor. The basis for 64s super is 350p/kg and for 58s average 263p.</p>

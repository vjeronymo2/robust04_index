			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Tills are alive with sound of money: Are UK banks making too much profit? John Gapper says shareholders and customers may compete for the bounty For Mrs Margaret Bird, a Barclays' customer for 40 years, the news that Britain's biggest bank made Pounds 1.04bn pretax profits in the first half of this year was baffling. 'I think it is an awful lot of money when they are laying off people. It seems a bit strange,' said Mrs Bird as she used a cash machine outside Barclays' branch in Southwark, south London. Mr Dick Barfield, whose company Standard Life owns Pounds 200m of Barclays' shares as an investment on behalf of its pension and life insurance policy holders, did not agree. 'It is good to see the bank making decent profits after a period when it has not made much at all,' he said. 'Banks ought to make this sort of return to justify their existence.' It has been more than a decade since the UK's high street banks achieved the returns seen in the first half of this year. National Westminster Bank last week reported interim profits of Pounds 767m, and Lloyds made Pounds 605m. More important to the City of London, the banks achieved high returns on capital, and increased their dividend payments to shareholders substantially. It is a remarkably rapid return to good fortune for banks whose profits  - in proportion to their size - were negligible in the early 1990s. In 1992, NatWest made pre-tax profits of only Pounds 367m for the whole year, and Barclays made a Pounds 242m loss. The trauma forced Barclays into drastic steps: it cut its dividend, and appointed a new chief executive. The swing in earnings is almost entirely due to falls in provisions against bad debts. Banks made huge provisions in the early 1990s to cover unwise lending during the height of the late 1980s boom. But the financial health of companies improved sharply in the first half of the year, allowing Barclays to cut provisions by two-thirds to Pounds 306m. This revealed how much more profitable banks have made themselves in the past three years. They have pushed up margins on loans, increased charges and cut costs by reducing staff numbers. 'As abnormal bad debts have become normal, banks have been unmasked as very profitable institutions,' says Mr Chris Ellerton, banking expert at the investment bank SG Warburg. Despite banks' protests this week that their profits were reasonable, this level of return is higher than that of banks in other countries, or of UK industry generally. Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, says UK banks are an extreme example of a trend towards higher industry profitability. 'We are seeing a sizeable shift in the distribution of cash from wages and towards profits,' says Mr Rooney. But although profits of other UK industrial companies reflect this trend, the average return on capital for companies in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is under half that reported by Barclays and Lloyds. Most European banks are now reporting much lower returns than UK ones. British banks argue that protests about their profits are misplaced. First, they say that profits do not come solely from their UK branch networks. Banks such as Barclays and NatWest have built investment banking operations that trade in global markets and raise capital for large companies. They also run retail operations abroad. Barclays' high street branches in the UK made Pounds 659m - or 64 per cent - of its first-half profits. Mr Colin Fisher, Lloyds' senior general manager for retail banking in the UK, argues that the high street bank 'is not really making a great deal of money. Its return on investment is poor by any standard'. Rather than being congratulated, Mr Fisher says he 'comes under a lot of pressure from Brian (Pitman, the bank's chief executive)' to make more money. Second, banks say that they need a high level of profits to make a good return for their shareholders, to retain enough capital to invest in their business, and to offer fresh loans. Although Barclays made Pounds 533m pretax profits in 1991, it was forced to remove Pounds 96m from its reserves to meet its tax bill, and to pay Pounds 338m in dividends. Mr Martin Gray, chief executive of NatWest's UK branch network, says banks must make adequate profits because otherwise they would not attract capital from investors such as US pension funds. 'Banks have to compete in a global market where there is a scarcity of capital. We must make a high return to cover the risk,' he says. Quite how high is a matter of debate. Banks themselves say they have a 'cost of equity' - the return they must offer investors to obtain capital - of between 12 and 14 per cent a year. This is calculated by taking the 8.5 yield on 30-year Treasury bonds - a proxy for a 'risk-free' investment - and adding 5 per cent to compensate for the extra risk of shares. Banks should, therefore, make a minimum post-tax return of about this amount annually. Their return this year will be much higher: Barclays' return in the first half was more than 23 per cent. But bankers say this is not excessive because the industry is more cyclical than others. They have to make enough money in the good times to compensate for bad debt losses during recessions. This was the reason why Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive, was unabashed at its profits. He said Barclays had squandered its shareholders' funds over the past six years by making a return on equity averaging 4 per cent. 'That sort of return does not just damage banks, it destroys them,' he said, arguing that Barclays now needed to rebuild capital. But there is a flaw in this logic. Banks would normally be in need of capital in an economic recovery because demand for loans would be high. In practice, this has not happened. Companies are still repaying debt from the late 1980s, and individuals are wary of taking on fresh debts. This means that banks have no clear outlet for capital. The result is that banks are starting to build up excess capital - more cash than they need to back loans. Barclays is likely to add about Pounds 800m to its capital this year, and unless loan demand increases sharply, it will find itself with a large pile of cash. The question for its 7m UK personal and small business customers in the UK is whether it will be used to improve service and lower prices. There will be pressure on banks to do something. Investors are not keen on banks holding excess capital because they have a history of wasting such cash on loss-making acquisitions. Lloyds' shareholders have supported the bank's plan to spend Pounds 1.8bn of its cash on buying Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, but not all banks may find suitable takeover targets. An alternative means of slimming excess capital is to give it back to shareholders. A lot of regional banks in the US - where bank profits rebounded earlier - have bought back their shares. 'Shareholders tend to think excess capital is best dealt with by giving it back to the people who own the business,' says Mr Ellerton of SG Warburg. Yet customers could also benefit from banks' new-found wealth. There are already signs that rejuvenated banks are starting to compete with each other by lowering some of the prices that they raised in the early 1990s. Small business charges have been frozen, and initiatives such as Abbey National's cut in overdraft charges are proliferating. Mr Fisher of Lloyds says that despite his bank not making adequate returns on current accounts, he has had to respond to margin-cutting moves by other banks. He cites Lloyds' decision in June to clear cheques in three days instead of four - thus losing interest on funds. 'I did not want to do it, but I was forced into it by competitive pressure,' he says. Mr Gray of NatWest says that although banks 'provide a hell of a lot for free', they cannot ignore price competition over more profitable products such as credit cards or mortgages. Similarly, Mr Bill Gordon, Barclays' managing director of UK banking, says that improved profits mean that 'if there is a price war, we are in a better position to fight it'. Pricing is only one way in which consumers could benefit from banks' profits. Another is improvements in the level of service. Banks have been severely criticised for low service standards and inadequate technology since the recession. The more candid bankers admit that part of the problem stemmed from cost-cutting during the period of low returns. 'Quality of service can only be as high as you can afford,' says Mr Fisher. 'If you are trying to keep your bank going and your business customers alive, there is no doubt that you get distracted.' Most banks have been investing large amounts in staff training and technology in the past two years, but some say they will now be able to speed up the investment. In contrast to price cuts, investment in improved service may please shareholders. They would regard it as money well spent if it reinforced earnings by attracting new business, or protecting banks' large market shares. Yet there is limited evidence that banks have gained earnings benefits from the investments in technology and training made so far. Mr Gordon says that technology, such as a computer system currently being installed in 400 Barclays branches to guide managers dealing with small companies, could help customers more than cuts in loan margins. 'It will help our customers in spades. Some real insight into their finances is far more use to them than a quarter per cent off interest rates.' For this strategy to work, customers will have to recognise improvements in what their banks offer, and be less willing to be lured away by lower-priced products from others. Banks cite customer surveys showing gains in how they are perceived. But they appear some distance from regaining a level of customer loyalty that might protect them in a price war. Mr Bird is one customer who has not yet noticed much of a difference at Barclays. 'Service has really gone downhill,' she says. She has not switched banks because it is 'such a hassle' to do so. Yet her bank hardly has reason to feel secure in her loyalty if others start to use their growing piles of capital to woo her with cut-rate offers. If that happens, banks' record profits will start to look vulnerable. Mr Gordon of Barclays says a decline in earnings would be a pity. 'Far from banks being a bad thing, they are a very good thing. Where would we be without them?' he asks rhetorically. If banks are to sustain their profits at this year's level, he does not have much time to persuade the sceptics.</p>

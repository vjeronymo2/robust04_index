			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO SLUGGISH IN VICTORY OVER ANTELOPE VALLEY, 19-0  </P> <P> Bob Johnson, El Toro High School coach, said it was just a case of being "a  little out of sync." Perhaps, but overconfidence might have been the real  reason that the Chargers, ranked No. 2 in Orange County, struggled much of the  time Friday night in a 19-0 nonleague victory over Antelope Valley before 2,200  at Mission Viejo High.  </P> <P> That the Antelopes are the defending Southern Section Division II champions and  a perennial Southern California prep football power seemed to escape El Toro.  All the Chargers (5-0) seemed cognizant of was Antelope Valley's  uncharacteristic losing streak, which now stands at four games.  </P> <P> However, as Johnson pointed out after the game, the three prior losses also  were to quality opponents, including last week to Loyola.  </P> <P> "We were sluggish, but we'll take a 19-0 win anytime," Johnson said.  "Especially over a team like Antelope Valley (1-4). They take a back seat to  nobody, they play good people, and they are a big-time program."  </P> <P> El Toro made it 19-0 with 5:59 left when Steve Stenstrom, who completed 13 of  21 passes for 212 yards, threw a 47-yard pass to Rob Johnson, who had nine  catches for 154 yards.  </P> <P> The Antelopes had three scoring opportunities, but wasted them all. In the  second quarter, a bad snap deprived Peter Holt of the chance of even trying a  47-yard field goal. Holt recovered back at the Antelope Valley 39 yard-line, a  loss of 31 yards.  </P> <P> On its first possession of the third quarter, Antelope Valley drove from its 22  to the El Toro 13, when the drive stalled. Holt tried a 30-yard field goal, but  El Toro's Brian Haas blocked it.  </P> <P> Finally, in the fourth quarter, the Antelopes drove to the Charger 13 again.  But on first down, Freddy Edwards fumbled and El Toro recovered.  </P> <P> The Chargers took advantage of the turnover. Danny Maestas, who had 109 yards  in only eight carries, gained 46 of them on the next play, setting up Brad  Hulse's second field goal, a 34-yard kick, which made it 13-0 with 7:37 left.  </P></p>

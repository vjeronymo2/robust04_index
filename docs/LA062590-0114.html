			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KOITO DISPUTES PICKENS' STOCK HOLDINGS  </P> <P> Koito Manufacturing Co. said today that tax returns indicate T. Boone Pickens  Jr. is not the company's largest shareholder after all, and therefore does not  deserve a seat on its board of directors.  </P> <P> Pickens responded by releasing an amended return that he said proves Koito is  wrong.  </P> <P> In a letter to Pickens that was released to the press, Koito said the Texas  oilman had reported the total net assets of his investment firm, Boone Co., at  the end of 1989 at slightly more than $1.93 million.  </P> <P> But, it said, Boone Co. at that time held 39.4 million shares of Koito stock,  "valued at $950 million at the prevailing exchange rates at year's end."  </P> <P> The lower amount reported on the tax return "appears to reinforce our  conclusions that Boone Co. is not the genuine owner of the Koito shares," said  the letter, signed by Koito President Takao Matsuura.  </P> <P> But in a statement soon after Koito released its letter, Pickens presented the  amended return, which included roughly the amount Koito had brought into  question.  </P> <P> "If they think they found a smoking gun, it just blew up in their face,"  Pickens said in a statement. Pickens, who is in Japan to attend Koito's  shareholder meeting on Thursday, claims a 26% share in the Tokyo-based company.  </P> <P> The statement said the original tax report had inadvertently included only  Boone Co.'s American assets. The amended report, it said, was filed on June 12,  "long before Koito's accusation."  </P> <P> "It is a very technical matter," said Kanji Ishizumi, Pickens' lawyer in Japan.  "They are just picking up on technical details. These are very disturbing  tactics."  </P> <P> Koito spokesman Richard Wolff responded: "Why would (they) make a  billion-dollar mistake?'  </P> <P> Koito believes Pickens is acting as a front for Japanese investor Kitaro  Watanabe, who has "on two occasions tried to greenmail Koito or its  shareholders," Wolff said.  </P> <P> Greenmail involves large purchases of a company's stock in an effort to force  the company to buy it back at a premium.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: SECRETS TO BAKING FROM-SCRATCH CAKE  </P> <P> Maybe it's the proliferation of microwave cake mixes, maybe it's frenzied  schedules, but whatever the reason, few microwave owners have learned how easy  it is to toss together from-scratch batter and bake it by microwave.  </P> <P> There are disadvantages, we'll admit. For example, the cakes don't brown the  way they do in regular ovens. And they dry out too fast once they come from the  microwave.  </P> <P> But these are scarcely insurmountable problems. First of all, to compensate for  the lack of browning, you need only to build a little color into the batter.  </P> <P> As for the drying, that's hardly a problem. All you have to do is store the  cake airtight as soon as it comes to room temperature. Our method is to  double-wrap it in plastic wrap, then pop it into an airtight cake keeper or  tin. That way it stays moist.  </P> <P> CHERRY POUND CAKE  </P> <P> 2 cups sifted flour  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1 cup butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 cup light-brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon almond flavoring  </P> <P> 4 eggs  </P> <P> 1/2 cup finely chopped candied red cherries  </P> <P> 1/4 cup powdered sugar, about  </P> <P> Sift flour and baking powder. Cream butter until light. Gradually add brown  sugar, beating until fluffy. Beat in vanilla and almond flavoring. Add eggs, 1  at time, beating well after each addition. Mix in dry ingredients just until  smooth. Fold in cherries.  </P> <P> Spread batter evenly in greased microwave-safe, 9-inch (8-cup) ring mold. Rap  lightly on counter to expel air bubbles. Center mold on microwave oven rack or  elevate on microwave-safe, upside-down, shallow bowl. Microwave, uncovered, on  MEDIUM (50% power) 10 minutes, rotating 180 degrees at half time.  </P> <P> Rotate mold again 180 degrees and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 2 to 3  minutes, or until wood pick inserted midway between rim and center comes out  clean. (Any small moist areas will dry on standing.)  </P> <P> Let cake stand, uncovered, in upright mold 10 minutes. Loosen cake all way to  bottom of mold, invert onto plate, ease out and cool to room temperature. Sift  powdered sugar evenly over cake just before serving. Makes 16 servings.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER WON'T PAY DISPUTED MEDICAL BILLS  </P> <P> In what government officials say is an unprecedented move, Chrysler Corp. is  challenging the quality of medical care provided to dozens of injured workers  at its now-closed assembly plant here and is refusing to pay for it.  </P> <P> The care provided to workers by certain physicians in the Kenosha-Racine area  was "inappropriate, unreasonable and excessive," said David A. Lewsley, manager  of worker's compensation for the auto maker.  </P> <P> Chrysler has assured workers that they won't be liable for unpaid bills and  says its battle is with the doctors, not with the workers.  </P> <P> A former United Auto Workers leader said the union approved of Chrysler's  decision.  </P></p>

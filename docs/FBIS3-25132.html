In a "note" he issued this morning to Prime Minister  Faustin Birindwa and his colleagues in the cabinet, Mr. Kiro  denounced the "total isolation he has been subjected to since 3  February by being deprived of telephone calls and visits from  his family."    Furthermore, Mr. Kiro, who was placed under house arrest at  the "Cite de l'OUA" government estates in Kinshasa on 14  January, is protesting against the "arbitrary nature of the  emergency proceedings instituted by the public prosecutor's  office" against him. On 8 January, Marshal Mobutu Sese Sekou  issued a decree requesting the opening of a judicial enquiry at  the attorney general's office against Professor Kiro "for the  illegal sale and renting of public buildings in Kinshasa and the  interior."    Mr. Kiro was a very active radical opposition member in the  past and a former minister under Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi. He  joined Mr. Birindwa's government at its formation at the end of  the political conclave convened by Marshall Mobutu in 1993. Mr.  Kiro was a member of the Political Forces of the Conclave  delegation -- the presidential group -- in the negotiations with  the radical opposition held between September and December. He  was appointed member of the new parliament, the High Council of  the Republic-Transitional Parliament, which was formed following  the negotiations.</p>

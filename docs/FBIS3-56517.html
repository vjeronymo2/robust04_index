			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 14, BNS -- Estonian President Lennart  Meri and Prime Minister Mart Laar today signed a letter to NATO  Secretary-General Manfred Woerner informing him of Estonia's  wish to join the Partnership for Peace program.    Meri said after the signing this is "a historic decision  that  will have a stabilizing effect not only on Estonia but on the  entire northern Europe, and which concerns all Estonia's  neighbors." In the president's view, neither a system of  agreements nor a well-equipped army offer the most reliable  guarantees of peace, but a democratic system of government.  "Democratic states never pose a danger to each other," he said.    "Partnership for Peace was the best NATO could at present  offer to East European states," Meri said. Commenting on  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas' bid for full NATO  membership, Meri said Estonia and Lithuania face different  problems, and that there are no foreign troops in Lithuania nor  territorial issues that need solving.    Laar said Lithuania did not inform the Estonian Government  of  its request for NATO membership alluding to problems arising  from the differences between the Estonian and the Lithuanian  Constitutions. He affirmed, however, that the meetings of the  three states' premiers have repeatedly touched on Baltic  cooperation in the framework of the Partnership for Peace  program. The Estonian premier cited the setting up of the Baltic  peacekeeping battalion as a concrete step in this direction.    Asked whether the joint signing of the letter today  signifies  "domestic peace" between the president and the prime minister,  Meri said, "The joint signing of this document should rule out  such rhetorical questions being asked here today."</p>

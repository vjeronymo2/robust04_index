			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: 34% of Manders holders reject Kalon's Pounds 86m offer KALON'S hostile Pounds 85.7m offer for Manders (Holdings) took another potentially crippling knock yesterday as Finsbury Asset Management declared that it would not accept the bid, which closes on Friday. In all, shareholders of 33.8 per cent of the paint, inks and property company have now declared that they will not accept. Yesterday Manders shares dropped 13p to 198p. Finsbury's move follows the decision of British Steel Pension Fund, which holds 22 per cent of the target, to publicise on Friday its non-acceptance of the final offer. This lifted the terms from 8-for-3 to 17-for-6 with the partial cash alternative of 14 plus 300p for six, valuing Manders' shares at 232p or 241p with the cash. Finsbury holds just under 6 per cent of Manders. Mr Malcolm King, Finsbury investment manager, said that the British Steel announcement had 'no effect on our decision, only on what and when we told people'. He said that Finsbury was not accepting the bid 'because it did not feel that the bid terms reflected the underlying value of Manders' businesses, because it felt that Manders did have a strategy to realise that underlying value, and because of the all-share aspect of the bid: even with the cash alternative, 80 per cent was in shares'. Mr King added that as the Kalon share price declined over the bid - from 110p at the launch to a static 82p yesterday - the third factor meant less and the first more. It is believed that Kalon has received acceptances for more than 9 per cent of Manders. The British Steel press office said yesterday that BSPF had decided not to accept the offer because of the dominance of paper in a bid which was not 'high enough'. The decision was taken on the make-up of the final offer, it said.</p>

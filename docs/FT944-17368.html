			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hollinger to raise Telegraph stake Shares in The Telegraph jumped 20p to 330p in London yesterday after Hollinger, the Canadian publishing company controlled by Mr Conrad Black, said it would seek to increase its 57 per cent stake in the UK newspaper group. Hollinger said it would begin purchasing any available stock 'at or around current market prices' from the start of trading on Monday. Hollinger said it 'is prepared initially to buy up to 6.8m ordinary shares,' which would account for about 5 per cent of The Telegraph's shares. At yesterday's close, the exercise would cost Hollinger more than Pounds 22m (Dollars 34.76m). The move is likely to excite further controversy over Mr Black's dealings with The Telegraph. In May, Hollinger reduced its stake in The Telegraph to 57 per cent from 66.2 per cent, raising CDollars 152m (USDollars 113.4m), only weeks before the The Daily Telegraph cut its cover price as a price war erupted in Britain's newspaper industry. The share price consequently slumped to 332p from 540p. A London Stock Exchange inquiry cleared Mr Black of any wrongdoing, although Cazenove, the company's broker, later resigned. Yesterday, Mr Jack Boultbee, Hollinger vice-president, said: 'Conrad Black stated before that if the price was right he would buy Telegraph shares; that's just what he's done. 'We think The Telegraph represents one of the better long-term investments around at the moment. We are committed investors and will not turn around and re-sell this when the shares move up to, say, Pounds 5.' On the controversy surrounding the group's last dealings in The Telegraph, he said: 'Buying these shares isn't going to improve our image in the City of London. Only time will do that. But we're doing this because it's a darn good investment.' But he added Hollinger would have begun buying several weeks ago had there not been a conflict. Analysts speculated that the Hollinger statement could signal an end to the newspaper price war. 'The feeling is that The Times will increase its price in the next few months, which would allow everyone else to move theirs upwards too,' said one broker. The Times, owned by News Corporation, is the cheapest quality broadsheet paper. However, Mr Stephen Grabena, managing director of The Telegraph, denied the Hollinger move would be followed by an increase in The Daily Telegraph's price. 'We have no plans to change the cover price in the foreseeable future.'</p>

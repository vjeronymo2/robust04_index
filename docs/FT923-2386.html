			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Reed and Elsevier merge to create Pounds 5bn publishing group REED International and Elsevier of the Netherlands have agreed to merge, creating one of the world's biggest publishers with a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 5bn. The combined group, to be named Reed Elsevier, will have a total of 25,000 employees, with 11,000 in the UK, 4,500 in the Netherlands and 7,500 in the US. The merger, due to take effect on January 1, will be on a 50-50 basis without any premium to either set of shareholders, and both Reed and Elsevier will keep separate stock exchange listings. Reed, whose interests range from legal publishing and business publications to consumer magazines and local and regional newspapers, will, however, receive a significant minority stake in Elsevier to reflect Reed's higher market capitalisation. Mr Pierre Vinken, chairman of Elsevier who will also be chairman of the merged company, said Elsevier had in the past decade achieved world leadership in scientific information publishing. 'We now want to extend this success in other publishing areas.' Mr Peter Davis, Reed's chairman, who will be chief executive and deputy chairman of Reed Elsevier, said that for Reed the merger 'achieves two of our strategic aims, a stronger presence in Europe and in subscription-based information publishing'. Three years ago Elsevier and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, agreed an exchange of shares with a view towards a merger. The stakes were later sold and the companies went their separate ways. Based on forecasts for the year to the end of 1992, the new group would on a pro forma basis have revenues of Pounds 2.442bn or Fl 7.838bn and pre-tax profits of Pounds 424m. Reed's share price rose to 531p, an increase of 45p on the day, because the deal was seen to increase the group's stake in such high margin areas as scientific publishing. On the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, however, Elsevier's share price fell to a low of Fl 104.7 in the early afternoon from Wednesday's close of Fl 116.7 before recovering slightly to close at Fl 105.2 - a decline of 9.8 per cent on the day.

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Axa 1993 results forecast to surpass expectations Axa, the second largest French insurance group, is likely to fare better than originally expected in 1993, according to Mr Claude Bebear, chairman. Mr Bebear, at a conference in Paris, said that although the performance of the core French business was 'still inadequate', the 1993 results of both the French group and Equitable, its US associate, should surpass expectations. Axa, like other French insurers, has been affected by the economic recession and also by the precarious state of the property market, which has limited its ability to raise capital through asset sales. It has also been blighted by the poor performance of Equitable in the US. The group warned this autumn that it did not expect its net profits for 1993 to be much higher than the FFr1.5bn (Dollars 257m) it produced in 1992. However Mr Bebear yesterday indicated that the final result would be higher. Mr Tim Dawson, European insurance analyst at Lehman Brothers in London, forecasts net profits of FFr1.8bn for Axa in 1993 with further recovery to around FFr2.4bn for 1994. 'Frankly it's always difficult to forecast Axa's results because of its traditional reliance on capital gains,' he said. 'It's difficult to imagine a significant change on the operating front. The implication of Mr Bebear's remarks must be that it has made higher capital gains in the final weeks of the year.' Canal-Plus, the French media group, is launching two new television channels in Spain as part of its strategy of expanding its interests outside France. The new channels - Minimax for children and Cine-Classics for classic movies  -will be launched on New Year's Eve and will form part of a package of programming for Canal-Plus's Spanish subscribers. Canal-Plus has for the past few years been building up its international interests by 'exporting' the pay-TV service and thematic channels originally developed for the French market into other European countries, notably Spain. The initial rationale for this expansion was to counter the inevitable slowdown in growth of Canal-Plus's original French pay-TV service, which is now approaching maturity. However, Canal-Plus is also anxious to build up other sources of revenue as it prepares to renegotiate its pay-TV franchise with the French government. The terms of the new franchise are expected to be considerably less favourable than the existing agreement. As a result, Canal-Plus is accelerating its expansion plans. Last week it warned that it may face a sharp fall in net profits for 1994.</p>

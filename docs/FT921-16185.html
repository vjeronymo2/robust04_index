			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Arts: Docklands Sinfonietta - Queen Elizabeth Hall Among the few cultural enterprises that grew up in the London Docklands during the last decade is the Docklands Sinfonietta, founded in 1989. The orchestra was set up to bring music to the development area and its programme this season includes a series of summer concerts there, but for the big dates it is already starting to venture further afield. Whatever the setbacks being experienced in property and other business interests in the Docklands enterprise zone at the moment, this particular enterprise would seem to be flourishing. Friday's concert was well attended and well played. The group is relatively small (20 strings arranged 6-4-4-4-2) so there is nowhere for timid players to hide. But under Edward Downes's experienced baton the class of the individual musicians told. The programme was restricted to strings and percussion (though a Barbican concert next week will provide an opportunity to judge the wind and brass sections that have been assembled). In the first half Arvo Part's Cantus in memoriam Benjamin Britten and Bartok's Music for strings, percussion and celeste were agreeably lightweight, clear, sharp in profile - no question of the rich string sonorities that one would hear from, say, the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Instead Downes stressed other qualities. There is always a special pleasure to be gained when a chamber-sized group of talented string players is brought together and it was that extra degree of fiery attack and individual eloquence that came to the fore both in their Bartok and, after the interval, in a concentrated performance of Shostakovich's Symphony No 14. There the only reservation was that the two soloists, though admirable in every other respect, were not native Russian speakers. Sarah Walker is able to produce the right sort of Slavic edge to the voice. Willard White, noble, honest, suggesting a deep-seated stability at heart, had the vocal demands of the music well within his compass; but I missed the spirit of rebellious sarcasm with which this symphony openly mocks authority. Two decades (and a revolution) on, it remains a remarkably powerful work. As a study of man in isolation, whether of the lone prisoner pacing his cell or the poet who speaks out against dictatorship, this symphony is Shostakovich at his most painfully articulate and it is that aspect which Downes and his players caught so well. The solo cellos singing their poignant threnody in 'Oh, Delvig' were particularly fine.</p>

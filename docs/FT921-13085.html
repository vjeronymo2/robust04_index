			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazil is ready to perform in glare of the spotlight - Economic measures have now begun to stimulate overseas investment After star performances by other Latin American stock markets over the last few years, Brazil is finally getting its turn in the spotlight. Share prices surged 44.9 per cent in dollar terms in December and 29 per cent this month, catapulting Brazil into first place among emerging markets. Some observers predict that the country will end 1992 as the world's best performer. Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, says: 'I think Brazil will take over from Argentina as the top-performing stock market in 1992.' Buenos Aires chalked up the best result last year, rising 392.5 per cent in dollar terms, followed by Colombia, Pakistan and Brazil. Mr Alvaro Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange, agrees: 'Brazil is on the right track economically. At least Dollars 1bn will enter the stock market from abroad this year, which will push up prices tremendously.' Brazil drew in some Dollars 450m in overseas funds in 1991, after opening its stock market in mid-year for the first time to direct investment by foreigners. Initially, investment was restricted to institutions and 77 entered the market last year. But this month, the CVM, Brazil's stock market watchdog, loosened the rules further. Now, non-profit-making bodies, global managers of holdings of high net-worth individuals and other financial entities recognised by the CVM can buy Brazilian equities. Mr Vidigal's Dollars 1bn estimate is conservative, according to some. 'Banks are telling me that up to Dollars 2bn will enter the country this year,' says Mr Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho, president of the CVM. 'And I think their assessment is reasonable.' The opening of the stock market to foreigners is just half of the equation; investors also need a reason to invest. In December, that reason appeared in the form of a standby facility with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). ) Other positive steps, such as tax reform and privatisation, have also pleased investors. 'There is a real change in perception about Brazil,' says Roger Wright, head of the foreign investment fund at Banco de Investimentos Garantia. 'Investors believe that congress will back the president in economic reforms. The rise in prices reflects a belief that things are finally going to get done.' He warns, however, that the equity market is unlikely to rise steadily. 'This year will be a roller-coaster ride, although the trend will certainly be up,' he says. 'We will be getting a lot of bad news this year along with the good news.' Last week, some bad news caused a dip in the index when the IMF voiced its concern over plans to offer pensioners a 147 per cent rise in social security payments. The IMF is worried that the extra cost, which could run into billions of dollars, will prevent Brazil from balancing its budget this year. To placate the IMF, President Fernando Collor de Mello decreed that the adjustment be paid only in 1993. However, the Attorney General, Aristides Junqueira, declared the move unconstitutional. President Collor has said that if he loses the battle, he will boost income taxes to foot the bill. Yesterday the stock market was steady, after closing at 9,036 on Tuesday, as investors waited for further developments. Another danger is the formation of an investment bubble, a quick rise in prices followed by a crash. According to Mr Mattos Filho, this would occur if demand for Brazilian equities failed to be accompanied by a rise in supply. 'New stock issues are necessary to prevent this from happening,' he says. Mr Vidigal believes the exchanges will see a spate of new issues in 1992: 'We will see a lot of new paper on the market.' Brazil's performance this year will depend on several factors, most importantly the government's ability to control inflation. Price rises are running at about 25 per cent a month, and many economists expect inflation to stay high for much of the year. Investors will also keep an eye on the privatisation programme, which is an essential part in reducing the federal deficit. Mr Eduardo Modiano, president of the National Development Bank, which is in charge of privatisation, expects to raise over Dollars 3bn this year from selling off state companies. If Brazil pushes through the economic reforms it has begun, it seems likely that foreign money will keep pouring in. 'As the foreigners enter, Brazilians become more interested in the market, and that helps fuel price rises,' says Mr Vidigal.</p>

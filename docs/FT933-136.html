			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Dollars 640m US placement for Smurfit JEFFERSON Smurfit Group, the Dublin-based international paper and packaging company, has announced a private placement of Dollars 640m (Pounds 416m) in senior loan notes with US investors, to refinance existing debt. In what is thought to be one of the largest placements in this sector of the US corporate securities market by a non-US group, 28 US institutions participated in the issue, led by the Prudential Insurance Company of America and the Annuity Association of America which subscribed Dollars 104m each for the senior guaranteed notes. The notes have been issued in four tranches of 7,10,12 and 15 years with an average life of 10.1 years. Dollars 288m of the issue has been by Smurfit International, the group's main international holding company, and Dollars 352m by Smurfit Packaging Corporation, which holds most of the group's US interests. Mr Michael Pettigrew, group secretary, said that most of the group's existing debt will be replaced by the new notes. 'The rates are at an attractive level linked to US Treasury note rates. Their purpose is not to save on short-term interest payments but to strategically capitalise on long-term rates and take the debt profile out to longer maturities.' Last April, JSC/CCA, the lossmaking US associate of Jefferson Smurfit Group which operates 180 paper mills in North America, made a Dollars 500m offer of senior loan notes with a 10-year maturity to restructure its bank debts. Simultaneously Smurfit International created a facility to purchase Dollars 200m of junior subordinated notes in JSC/CCA as required. Jefferson Smurfit reversed out of JSC/CCA in a complex Dollars 2.6bn financial restructuring in 1989, remortgaging its US interests into a joint venture with the Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund. Mr Pettigrew said that the new senior notes issue by SIBV would not be used to finance the Dollars 200m purchase of junior notes in JSC/CCA.</p>

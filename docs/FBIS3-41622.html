			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``A Majority of Russians Not Willing </F> To Pay for a Clean Environment'']    [Text] The All-Russian Center for the Study of Public  Opinion has conducted a poll of Russian citizens concerning  their attitudes on environmental issues. Beset by financial,  day-to-day and political cataclysms, our countrymen are not  giving much thought to ecology, perhaps still believing that  this is a problem only the state needs to worry about.    If one compares the opinion of people in different age  groups, one find that the greatest willingness to make  sacrifices in order to solve environmental problems is expressed  by people between the ages of 25 and 40 (``yes'' -- 45 percent;  ``neither yes nor no'' -- 20 percent; and ``no'' -- 26 percent).  Among people over the age of 55 there are an equal number of  people interested in environmental issues as there are persons  who are indifferent to them (``yes'' -- 33 percent; ``no'' -- 31  percent).    Most of the people who express a willingness to solve  environmental protection problems have higher or incomplete  higher education -- with 51 percent saying ``yes'' (``no'' -- 24  percent; ``neither yes nor no''-- 18 percent). Among those with  incomplete secondary education 30 percent responded ``yes''  (``no'' -- 31 percent; ``neither yes nor no'' -- 20 percent).    Despite the fact that 40 percent of those responding are  willing to pay, those who really want to do something to improve  the environmental situation are considerably fewer in number.    In response to the question ``Are you willing to give up  some  conveniences in your life in order to preserve the  environment?'' only 30 percent of Russian citizens said ``yes,''  and 37 percent said they were ``not willing.''    The least interest in preserving nature at their own expense  was expressed by rural residents (``yes'' -- 30 percent; ``no''  -- 28 percent). The most interest was found among urbanites  (``yes'' -- 47 percent; ``no'' -- 28 percent).    In response to the question ``Are you willing, for the sake  of preserving the environment, to pay substantially higher  prices for goods and services so that more money will be  available for environmental protection?'' 40 percent of those  surveyed replied ``yes'' and 27 percent said ``no.''</p>

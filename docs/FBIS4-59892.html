			<p>BFN     [Text] An official spokesman for the Central Committee of  the Palestine National Liberation Movement, Fatah [dissident],  has asserted that statements made by 'Abd-al-Razzaq  al-Majayizah, member of the so-called committee negotiating  Palestinian security and one of 'Arafat's supporters, on  disarming our people's masses expose the mission and role of the  self-rule police.    He said that 'Arafat's police are doing what the Zionist  enemy has failed to do over the past years to harm our people's  steadfastness and resistance. The spokesman urged the sons of  our people and their active forces to be vigilant toward such  statements and their dimensions.</p>

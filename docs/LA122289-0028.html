			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW ;  </P> <P> FREDDY IS BACK FOR CHRISTMAS  </P> <P> If you want to find your Christmas-week movies at the video store rather than  contend with the crowds at the theaters, it'll help if you're a fan of Jerry  Lee Lewis, Freddy Krueger, the "Star Trek" crew or Almodovar.  </P> <P> Almodovar is how Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's name is often shortened in  the credits for his offbeat films, and the most popular of his outrageous,  Bunuel-on-speed comedies, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" is new to  videocassette this week (Orion, $79.98, R). The surreal farce about a woman who  entertains several odd visitors after losing her lover stars Carmen Maura and  Fernando Guillen.  </P> <P> Also just out is a horror film that might have been subtitled "Teen-Agers on  the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" (but wasn't) -- "Nightmare on Elm Street 5:  The Dream Child" (Media, $89.95, R). Robert Englund once again does his thing  as dream-haunting slasher Freddy Krueger. The tape includes a rap video by the  group Whodini, if that's a big selling point to you.  </P> <P> "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" (Paramount, no list price, PG) shows the  sci-fi series well past the verge of overextending its welcome, especially with  William Shatner directing (flaccidly) instead of Leonard Nimoy. But if you're a  Trekkie set on collecting all of the films, at least wait a few months until  Paramount reduces this one to the $15-$30 range. That "no list price" means  that you'd have to pay almost $100 for it now.  </P> <P> "Great Balls of Fire!" (Orion, $89.98, PG-13) seemed to evoke the same  descriptive word from every critic who reviewed it earlier this year: cartoon.  They didn't mean that this film about singer-pianist-wild man Jerry Lee Lewis'  rise and fall was animated by the folks who did "Roger Rabbit"; they meant that  it treated Lewis' fascinating story (focusing on his marriage to his  13-year-old second cousin) colorfully but superficially. Dennis Quaid stars.  </P> <P> Other new-to-video movies: "La Lectrice" (Orion, $79.98, R) is a clever,  whimsical comedy starring Miou-Miou. It's all about, believe it or not,  reading. Michel Deville directed.  </P> <P> "Lock Up" (IVE, $89.95, R) is a prison drama for die-hard Sylvester Stallone  fans only.  </P> <P> "How I Got into College" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13) satirizes college recruitment  and stars Corey Parker, Christopher Rydell and Anthony Edwards.  </P> <P> "Renegades" (MCA, $89.95, R) boasts a heavyweight bunch of brat-packers (Kiefer  Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Jami Gertz) in a weakly scripted cop/buddy  film.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 14 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign  Ministry on Thursday [14 April] sent a note to the Slovak  Embassy in Budapest, foreign affairs spokesman Janos Herman told  MTI.    The document says, "The Government of Hungary is, as  proposed  in its earlier Note of March 28, 1994, ready to engage in  immediate negotiations which will lead to the rapid  implementation of a satisfactory temporary water management  regime along the lines of the recommendations of the experts of  the European Commission of December 1, 1993. This presupposes  that the Government of Slovakia accept these recommendations, as  Hungary has done. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Republic of Hungary did not receive yet any information of such  an engagement on behalf of Slovakia neither from the EC, nor  from Bratislava. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs would  therefore be grateful if the Slovak side could, at its earliest  convenience, inform both the European Commission and the  Hungarian Government on the acceptance of the recommendations on  the basis of which immediate negotiations could start.    "In this connection the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes  to  point out that, far from being a 'categorical refusal' of the  recommendations of the Experts of the EC, the resolution of the  Hungarian Parliament of March 29, 1994, is entirely consistent  with those recommendations. A copy of the (as yet for technical  reasons unpromulgated) resolution is attached to this Note  Verbale for the information of the Slovak Republic. As is quite  clear from its terms, the resolution deals only with the  posititon pending the conclusion of an agreement on the  temporary water management regime. The Parliament's  consideration was that in this period an underwater weir shall  not be built at river kilometer 1843. This was precisely the  view of the EC Experts themselves, as expressed in the letter  written on their behalf by Professor Schreiner on February 8,  1994, to Mr. Pablo Benavides, director of the European  Commission. The experts had recommended the construction of two  weirs at different places, in connection with and subsidiary to  a substantial increase in the discharge regime. Such an  increase was, as the EC Experts have pointed out, 'the main  factor' in the recommendations."    "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to inform the  Embassy  of the Slovak Republic that the Government of the Republic of  Hungary remains fully prepared to implement the recommendations  of the Experts of the EC, as explained in its letter of January  14, 1994, and would like to express its earnest hope that the  Government of the Slovak Republic will do likewise," the  document says.</p>

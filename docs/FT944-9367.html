			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Power use rise shows economic growth Evidence of economic growth strengthened yesterday when PowerGen, the power generator, said overall demand for electricity in England and Wales rose 3 per cent in the six months to October after three years of stagnation. The company, reporting a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 118m, said the growth in demand was 'due to increased consumption in the industrial and commercial sectors, indicating a general upturn in economic activity'. The increase compares with current annual growth forecasts in the National Grid's seven-year statement of 1.3 per cent. In the six months to the end of September electricity demand was 123.3 terrawatt hours, against 119.7 in the comparable six months of last year and 1992, 119.9 in 1991 and 118.9 in 1990. The precise correlation between growth in electricity demand and economic growth is debatable but a rough rule of thumb in the industry is that power demand growth is usually about two-thirds of the expansion in gross domestic product. Offer, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday announced the terms of reference for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into Scottish Hydro-Electric's controls, but said it had no plans to reconsider price controls for the sector. It said it was working on licence amendments arising from changes in controls on Scottish Power and the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. It expected to publish the changes in the next few weeks. Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, said he had asked the monopolies commission to report within six months on the distribution and supply price controls of Hydro-Electric and the 'hydro benefit' provision which provides for a transfer of revenue from the generation business to distribution and transmission. Hydro-Electric was the only company to reject price controls announced this year by Prof Littlechild to take effect from next April. It was this that triggered the referral to the commission.

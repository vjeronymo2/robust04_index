			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Akram Tahir Hassan] </F>   [Text] In spite of many indicators that shed light on the  degree of expansion in Iraq's diplomatic, political, and  economic relations with countries within and outside the region,  it appears that Iraqis have adopted a new policy that  concentrates on their national capabilities to overcome the  embargo that has been imposed upon them for more than three  years.    Its mechanics geared in the realm of action and not words,  the new policy does not mean that Iraqi diplomacy has downgraded  its efforts toward the international organization, especially as  Iraqi delegations abroad have adopted quiet diplomacy and on the  spot decisionmaking in bilateral relations. This is done in the  context of a political reality that takes into consideration the  mode of conduct of international relations and American  strategic pressures through the Security Council and its bodies  like the special commission and others. That means that Iraqi  diplomatic activity has to deal with the special circumstances  that have formed and continue to form obstacles and limitations  that affect international bodies, countries, and organizations,  attempting thereby to deliver these countries and organizations  from consequences that might arise against them through American  pressure.    Iraqi diplomatic activity has not been limited to  dispatching  delegations, but has included steps to reinvigorate the foreign  service and to support its embassy employees in European  countries. Diplomatic cadres have begun their travel to those  countries after ministerial orders were issued to transfer them  there.    According to its custom, Baghdad remains the hub of economic  and political activity. No day passes without a delegation, or  perhaps more than one, making the rounds of ministerial  buildings, especially the foreign, petroleum, trade, and  industry ministries. Some employees of these ministries are  attempting to shroud the delegations and their nationalities in  secrecy. However, it is clear that in addition to Asian  countries, most of the European delegations belong to France and  Russia.    No one can positively say that these delegations were unable  to reach agreements or, at least, common understandings to  respond to mutual interests in a manner that is in accordance  with the nature of the international situation that is not  applicable to Iraq alone, after it came to apply to other  countries. It has become a restraint on their freedom to conduct  their trade policies.    In order to overcome American surveillance, some countries  have resorted to sending unofficial delegations headed by a  former minister, or a member of parliament or presidents of  chambers of commerce and industry in their own countries.    These delegations are often amazed by Iraqi negotiators whom  they expect to be "agreeable" to enormous concessions which are  usually called political or circumstancial concessions. However,  they are confronted by sound commercial terms, which leave their  adversaries with no option but to offer concessions themselves.    It is clear to the observer that current Iraqi diplomatic  activity is proceeding with studied steps and limited goals. It  has temporarily shelved wishful thinking and has adopted a  realistic policy in practical steps. The February visits point  to this. A delegation to Geneva to take part in a conference on  human rights and disarmamemt was led by the foreign minister,  Muhammed Sa'id al-Sahhaf. Tehran witnessed bilateral meetings  between Iraqi and Iranian delegations. The assistant foreign  minister, Sa'ad Faysal, led the Iraqi delegation. Up to the time  of writing, Assistant Minister Dr. Riyad al-Qaysi is still in  Paris conducting negotiations that, apparently, are not limited  to trade and legal matters only, but cross over to political  matters too. No doubt, they are focused on bilateral relations,  which are witnessing improvements in numerous areas.    Diplomatic activity did not cease with the visits of last  February. The current month of March will witness activities  that are intended to pave the way for the creation of a  non-hostile atmosphere for any new step that aims to break the  severity of the embargo, even partially, during the coming  Security Council deate. It is expected that Deputy Prime  Minister Tariq 'Aziz will arrive in New York to begin a series  of meetings. If no official communique or notice of the visit  and its date are issued by now, then it is expected that the  time for the arrival of Mr. 'Aziz in New York will be the end of  the month.    Observers expect the visit to have tangible positive results  that will be the basis for realistic diplomatic relations that  Iraq will be able to establish in various ways. The most  important first step is the invigoration of bilateral relations  with some European countries and the neighboring countries of  the region. Then there is the positive cooperation with the  organs of the international organization in such a manner as to  frustrate any pretext that might be exploited under diplomatic  cover to extend the duration of the embargo. Then there is  placing the United Nations in such a position as to make it far  from simple for it to bind the articles of the American  political resolution with a legal and legitimate cover.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sydney, Dec 11 (AFP) -- Britain has closed the door  on a controversial part of its relationship with Australia by  agreeing to pay a 45 million dollar [Australian dollars] (30  million U.S.) settlement over sites it once used for nuclear  tests, Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner said Saturday.    The ex-gratia payment ends a long-running dispute over the  clean- up of British test sites at Maralinga, Monte Bello  Islands and Emu Field in the southern Australian outback.    Australia has long argued that it was Britain's  responsibility to clean up the nuclear contamination which it  claims still affects the lives of local Aborigines.    ``The British decision is welcomed, it will allow Britain  and  Australia to put behind us one of the saddest aspects of our  relationship,'' Tickner told AFP from Canberra.    ``It is almost impossible to conceive now that atomic  weapons  were actually tested in Australia, they will leave a legacy of  contamination for many thousands of years to come.''    The indigenous Aborigine population was driven off its  traditional lands to make way for the British nuclear tests and  returned in the 1980s only to learn the area had been exposed to  high levels of toxic contamination.    ``As a result of the testing, Aboriginal people lost the use  of their traditional lands, but the compensation will allow a  clean-up and fencing where appropriate and will allow us to have  a much more mature relationship between Britain and Australia,''  Tickner said.    The Aborigines filed a formal complaint to Britain in 1991,  leading Australia to press Britain to share rehabilitation and  compensation costs of the Maralinga nuclear testing range,  abandoned by Britain in 1967.    The settlement, to be paid to Australia in installments over  the next six years, removed a ``major irritant'' to the  relationship between Australia and Britain, British Foreign  Office Minister Alastair Goodlad said in London Friday.    Australia had agreed in turn to abandon all further claims,  he said.    Australian Primary Industries and Energy Minister Simon  Crean  and Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said in a joint  statement from Canberra that resolution of the issue had  vindicated Australia's stance about the condition of the sites  left by Britain.    ``Australia has never accepted Britain's denial of legal or  moral responsibility for this issue,'' the ministers said. The  condition of the sites left by Britain ``was unacceptable even  by the standards that then applied.''    A study by Australian, British and U.S. scientists,  completed  in 1990, traced the full extent of plutonium on Aborginial land  and found that the Aborgines' outdoor lifestyle made them highly  vulnerable to the threat of plutonium, a carcinogen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ND-Funke": "`WAW' Repeated Murder Threats"] </F>   [Text] Berlin -- The Berlin-Weissensee Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS] has again received a threatening letter from the  neo-fascist "Weissensee Aryan Resistance" ("WAW"), after it had  found a similar pamphlet in its mailbox on Monday. The letter  from Friday [7 January] claims that the previous letter did not  contain a murder threat against [former PDS Chairman Gregor]  Gysi but "only" against all those who move about freely in the  PDS office. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution is  greeted with the remark that it will not catch the "WAW,"  instead, "we will catch you all." Just as in the first letter,  an ultimatum is posed to the PDS for clearing out the office by  the end of January. In flowery words the authors glorify Hitler  and are outraged about being called fascists -- they are, on the  contrary, National Socialists. The PDS office has filed another  complaint with the police, who reportedly are watching the house  more intensively now. According to findings by the Federal  Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the "WAW" is a  group of extremely militant neo-Nazis.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALAYSIAN EX-LEADER HUSSEIN BIN ONN DIES  </P> <P> Hussein Bin Onn, prime minister of Malaysia from 1976 to 1981, died Monday at a  California hospital after suffering a heart attack. He was 68.  </P> <P> Hussein died at Seton Medical Center in Daly City near San Francisco. He had  undergone triple heart bypass surgery there April 14 and was readmitted for  additional heart and gall bladder surgery.  </P> <P> A heart operation in 1981 had forced his resignation.  </P> <P> Hussein was Malaysia's third prime minister after the country gained  independence from Britain in 1957. He became prime minister after the death of  Abdul Razak in 1976. Hussein had been Abdul Razak's deputy and his  brother-in-law.  </P> <P> Hussein was a member of the United Malays National Organization Party, which  has ruled the country since independence in a coalition with Chinese and Indian  parties.  </P> <P> Hussein selected the present prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, to succeed him  in 1981. But the two broke with each other in 1987-88 when Mahathir sacked  Malaysia's highest-ranking judge, arrested 106 people and detained them without  trial. Mahathir's actions resulted in formation of a rival party.  </P> <P> During the past 18 months, Mahathir and Hussein were said to have reconciled  their differences.  </P> <P> Hussein's son-in-law, Yahya Awang, said the Malaysian Embassy was making  arrangements for the body to be flown back to the Southeast Asia nation where  an official funeral is planned.  </P></p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bilston Enamels in profit midway A return to more normal trading enabled Bilston &amp; Battersea Enamels, the USM-quoted maker of enamel boxes, to turnround from a Pounds 186,000 loss to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 33,000 for the first half of 1994. Turnover grew 40 per cent to Pounds 2.49m and earnings per share came to 0.1p (2.7p losses). Mr Roger Foster, chairman, pointed out that because of the importance of pre-Christmas trading, the company's profits were primarily obtained in the second half. 'Sales and orders in the third quarter indicate that the full year should end satisfactorily,' he added.</p>

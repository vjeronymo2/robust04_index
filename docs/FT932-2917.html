			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (15): Latching on to demand - Syncordia and the emergence of global supercarriers 'OUTSOURCING' is now all the rage among international telecoms companies. Most state telecoms companies are in or entering the business of providing a 'one-stop shop' for companies, servicing and managing as much of their telecoms needs as they are prepared to put out of house. In the UK, both Mercury and BT have managed services divisions. Last month, BT named its domestic outsourcing unit 'Communications Management', targeted at companies with large and complex private networks, on the day it announced a Pounds 5m five-year contract to take over the ownership and management of Thorn EMI's internal UK telephone network. However, BT's outsourcing strategy does not stop at the Channel: one of its over-riding ambitions is to become a leading 'global outsourcer'. It faces stiff competition for the title from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US operator. BT and AT&amp;T have latched on to a demand - part evident, part anticipated - from the world's 2,500-odd multinationals for a 'one stop' global provider able to do everything from maintaining private networks to sorting out customer requirements with local telecoms companies in several countries while providing single billing and a single telecoms port of call. Add into the equation the capacity of the international telecoms operator to provide the latest in network features, billing, servicing and high-speed data transmission facilities, and that makes your global outsourcer. As Mr Vic Pelson, president of AT&amp;T's communications services group, puts it: 'Multinationals want communications services that give them global capabilities. And they want them now.' There is nothing new in partnerships between telecoms companies to provide international services. So-called 'correspondent' arrangements to inter-connect virtual private networks across borders, and to provide services such as abbreviated direct dialling and single billing for traffic carried between two operators, have been in place for years. AT&amp;T's Global Software Defined Network (GSDN) gives it a correspondent link with 21 other international carriers, including BT; BT's counterpart, FeatureNet, embraces 14 carriers and has more than 100 customers. However, the latest outsourcing ventures by the two companies - AT&amp;T's Worldsource launched last month and BT's Syncordia, started in 1991 - are far more ambitious. Designed both to enhance the range and quality of existing services, their aim is to provide a truly one-stop international facility for multinationals. Initial Worldsource services, available later this year, will include virtual network services for voice and data communications, upgraded private-line services, frame relay service for high-speed data transmission and 'one-stop shopping' for ordering, maintenance and billing, with bills consolidated in a customer's choice of country and currency. Although AT&amp;T and BT are marketing similar services, and both are investing heavily in upgrading overseas facilities, the strategies of Syncordia and Worldsource are starkly at odds. Syncordia, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was originally intended to be a strategic partnership with Germany's Deutsche Telekom and Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. But neither proposed link-up came off, with Deutsche Telekom breaking away and forming a rival enterprise with France Telecom. Syncordia will in due course be subsumed in a new Dollars 1bn joint venture formed with MCI, the second-largest US carrier. The deal with MCI marks the end of BT's 'go-it-alone' approach, and its attempt - presently before the Federal Communications Commission - to become a public operator in the US in its own right is expected to be quietly dropped. AT&amp;T, on the other hand, intends vigorously to pursue its application for direct access to the UK public networks. Syncordia now has nine takers worth Dollars 200m a year. These include a five-year contract managing BP's voice, data, video and messaging services among five sites in the UK and Stavanger, Norway; and the communications network of BP Chemicals among 11 sites in seven European countries. It is hardly taking the international telecoms world by storm - but then, says BT, 'multinationals cannot be expected to outsource overnight.' By contrast, AT&amp;T's Worldsource was launched in Japan with two partners (Kokusai Denshin Denwa of Japan and Singapore Telecom) and the strong likelihood of three others joining soon (Unitel of Canada, Telstra of Australia and Korea Telecom). An entry into Europe is critical if Worldsource is to succeed. AT&amp;T is budgeting to spend Dollars 350m over the next five years providing facilities and upgrading equipment in Europe. Mr John Foster, director of AT&amp;T's communications services in Europe, professes himself keen to talk to 'almost any' of Europe's telecoms operators about a link-up, and expects to launch Worldsource in Europe next year. Because Worldsource does not give AT&amp;T exclusive rights over its partners, most of Europe's state telecoms operators appear to have little to lose from participation. Unless, that is, they want to be global outsourcers themselves, and are anxious to give no succour to AT&amp;T. For companies such as Deutsche Telekom and Telecom France, AT&amp;T's move is a challenge to them to clarify their international strategies and link up with partners. BT has already shown its hand, which could give the US operator problems in the UK. But AT&amp;T is not restricted to BT: Mercury and Energis are potential partners. How many of the 2,500 multinationals are in the market for the outsourcers? At Worldsource's launch, AT&amp;T presented a formidable group, including Unisys, Honeywell, Motorola and United Parcel Service. Its decision to launch first in Asia-Pacific is significant: the region has the world's fastest-growing telecoms sector, wide open to outsiders with cash and expertise - and is replete with multinationals demanding better services. However, one-stop shops and fancy services alone will not be enough to attract the multinationals. They already have top-notch telecoms managers. The bottom line will be critical.</p>

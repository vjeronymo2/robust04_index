			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: MB-Caradon/RTZ Caradon's apparent difficulty in spending its cash shows how unwise it is to conclude deals by means of semaphore. When MB - Caradon realised Pounds 473m from selling its 25 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox in April, it flagged its intent to reinvest the money in building materials products. Its predatory presence steepened the cyclical upturn in the sector's shares. Those of Marley, for example, widely tipped as a likely target, have shot up from 58p last September to 166p. It therefore comes as little surprise that MB - Caradon is trying to buy an unquoted package of assets from RTZ, although it is not clear how much it hopes to buy or what price it is prepared to pay. The 6 per cent rise in MB  -Caradon's shares shows the market's faith that it will not do anything silly. But it also reflects relief that the meagre returns earned from leaving Pounds 370m on deposit may soon be ending. Failure to secure an agreement could now result in some damage to MB - Caradon's shares but this is no reason to press ahead if the terms are not right. Reuters has made it respectable to return surplus cash to shareholders. It would be no shame on MB - Caradon if it were to conclude the same. As for RTZ, changes to the ACT regime may have reduced its need to preserve UK earnings. The company is under no pressure to sell but the disposal would usefully reduce gearing and may facilitate another big acquisition. Those Whitehall boffins working out how to sell British Coal would doubtless be delighted. They may have a hard job tempting RTZ, nonetheless.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Denmark issues warning to Efta's EU applicants THE FOUR Efta countries applying to join the European Union could lose their chance of gaining membership if they do not complete accession negotiations by the beginning of March next year, Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, warned yesterday. He said any delay beyond that date of the negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden could lead the EU to shelve their applications, leaving the four, scheduled to join the community in 1995, to take their chances 'the next time around' when expansion to include central and east European countries was considered. 'That is why I say to them 'the time is now, the door is open. Don't hesitate because you might not find the door being that open after March 1.' Speed and determination in these negotiations I think are all important. I would hate to see this opportunity being lost,' Mr Helveg Petersen told the FT in an interview. He said the beginning of March was the latest date that would allow time for the present European parliament to ratify the four accession agreements before new parliamentary elections in June. The community did not want the negotiations 'dragging on' beyond then. 'Those less enthusiastic about enlargement than others will ask 'when will this end, will it ever end?',' he said. Denmark is worried about recent opinion polls in Sweden and Norway showing majority opposition to EU membership. However, Mr Helveg Petersen praised Norway's minority Labour government which is facing strong hostility both within the party and from the main opposition Centre party. The Norwegian government has previously been accused of foot-dragging by EU officials. 'The reaction from the Norwegian government has been heroic. There is no hesitation on their part. The community realises the Norwegian government faces an uphill battle.'</p>

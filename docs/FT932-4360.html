			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Blows to drugs sector THE DRUG stocks sector acted as a major dampener on the UK equity market as a series of unrelated developments drove share prices of most of the leading drug issues sharply lower. Comments from the US Food and Drugs Administration on Boots' heart drug Manoplax, renewed weakness in Zeneca shares in the US overnight, and bearish views on Wellcome's anti-Aids drug Retrovir at a Berlin conference on Aids, combined to leave the sector in disarray. Also important was the belief that the outcome of the Clinton administration's review of the healthcare industry may not be known until September. Dealers said the sector could remain under pressure until the review is made public. Wellcome was the main casualty, sliding 25 more to 728p as the Berlin conference's main session got under way. This was believed to involve criticism of Retrovir by the Anglo-French 'Concorde' study group. Analysts said 'nothing new' had emerged during London trading hours and that much of the increased activity in Wellcome during the day reflected marketmakers 'churning' the stock - actively buying and selling without taking a decisive position on the shares.</p>

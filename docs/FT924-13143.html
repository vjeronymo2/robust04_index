			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Banco Popular income slips in third quarter BANCO POPULAR, Spain's most profitable commercial bank, yesterday reported a fall in third-quarter income, indicating that most groups in the sector are likely to suffer declines as the domestic economic slowdown begins to bite. Popular reported a 12.7 per cent rise in net income to Pta40bn (Dollars 385m) over the first nine months of the year against the same period in 1991. The figure contrasted with a net income rise of 18.9 per cent to Pta27.8bn in the first six months of this year, and it reflected a 10.4 per cent drop in net profits between July and September against the second quarter. Customer funds grew by 3.5 per cent over the first nine months but by only 0.2 per cent in the third quarter. Loans and discounts grew by 10.3 per cent and by 2.8 per cent respectively. Non-performing loans, which were brought down from a 2.21 per cent high of total risks in March to 2.02 per cent on June 30, had risen again to 2.20 per cent. Net return on average assets stood at 2.11 per cent over the first nine months against 1.92 per cent in the same period last year and average return on equity was up from 26.73 per cent to 27.10 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Sarmiento from the Chamber of Deputies </F> in Mexico City]    [Text] No one should speculate, so that the economic and  political problems in the country do not worsen. This statement  was made by Gonzalo Altamirano Dimas, a deputy from the National  Action Party [PAN] and party president in the Federal District.  He added that although the Mexican Stock Exchange [BMV] has  experienced some drops, this is something natural due to the  recent murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio. In an interview, Gonzalo  Altamirano Dimas said that the stability of the BMV will depend  on immediate actions by the authorities.    [Begin Altamirano Dimas recording] We must be prudent, the  country's interests must prevail over all other interests,  regardless of how legitimate these may be. The death of Mr.  Colosio must be cleared up. We join this clamor for a thorough  investigation and that the persons responsible for the attack be  arrested and punished with the full weight of the law. [end  recording]    Meanwhile, the parliamentary group of the Party of the  Democratic Revolution [PRD] has also rejected all ties with  violence. In a news conference, the PRD wing at the Chamber of  Deputies sent condolences to the family of Luis Donaldo Colosio  Murrieta. The party demanded a thorough investigation and  clarification of the presidential candidate's murder.    PRD Deputy Alejandro Encinas announced the commission to  investigate the attack on Luis Donaldo Colosio has begun to work  and will be in Tijuana early Saturday morning to meet with the  highest federal authorities, study the area where Colosio was  killed, and prepare a detailed report that will be presented on  Monday to the Permanent Commission of the Congress.</p>

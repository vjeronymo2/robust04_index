			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Consolidation in Italian banking The shape of Italian banking changed yesterday with a merger and takeover which will further strengthen the private sector. Ambroveneto is being taken over by Banca Commerciale Italiana (Comit) to create the country's second largest banking group. Comit last night said it wanted 51 per cent of Ambroveneto but would aim initially for 29 per cent of the stock held by the core of controlling shareholders. It offered L7,000 a share for the 144.4m shares among these shareholders. Meanwhile Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), a Bologna-based bank, is merging with the Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna group (Caer), a regional savings institution, to fight off the hostile bid by recently privatised Credito Italiano. The Rolo-Caer merger came as a surprise and will create Italy's tenth largest bank. It comes less than a month after the two had abandoned year-long talks on a smaller-scale merger. The defensive move by Rolo, controlled by a core of shareholders led by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, will have to overcome complex legal considerations, centring on whether a merger could occur while a takeover bid was in progress. The formal takeover by Credito Italiano cannot be launched until the prospectus has been approved by Consob, the stock exchange watchdog. This is unlikely to be completed until November 15 and could mean that the first extraordinary meeting of Rolo shareholders will vote not on the takeover offer but the merger. Rolo's big shareholders, including France's BNP and Mr De Benedetti, have yet to comment on the merger plan. The L2,010bn (Dollars 1.3bn) Credito bid for 48.2 per cent of Rolo's stock, valuing each share at L19,000, was launched last Wednesday and is the largest in Italy since new takeover rules were introduced in 1992. It followed three weeks of heavy trading in Rolo shares which rose more than 30 per cent. But the Bologna bank denied any prior discussions with Credito, claiming the bid was hostile. Rolo's decision comes after the appointment of foreign advisers Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley to assess the takeover. Rolo said yesterday the merger, which would be cashless, would be on the basis of 1.31 of its nominal L1,000 shares for every nominal L10,000 Caer share. Rolo said it was currently valued at L4,895bn. This is a premium of about L3,000 a share on the Credito offer and applies to all the shares, not just 48.2 per cent. Caer was valued at L2,397bn.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Composites falter The imposition of a 3 per cent duty on premiums on general insurance, excluding reinsurance and marine and aviation business, triggered a general markdown of the composite insurers. However, Mr Peter Constable, insurance specialist at Robert Fleming Securities, said the Budget, overall, would have only a minimal impact on the composites, which would be boosted by positive implications for gilts and equities from the chancellor's assumptions on GDP. 'The sector has had a good run and may possibly give back some of those gains,' he added. The recent spate of buy recommendations in the composite sector continued to drive General Accident shares, which settled 20 1/2 higher at 667 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 2.1m. Commercial Union, however, closed marginally easier at 606 1/2 p, while Guardian Royal Exchange could manage only a 1 1/2 gain at 208 1/2 p. Royal Insurance settled 6 up at 305p, and Sun Alliance was similarly firmer at 369 1/2 p. Confirmation of recent market speculation that there would be no big shift on pensisons and life assurance was seen as a further big plus for the life stocks, where Legal &amp; General moved up 4 1/2 to 521p.</p>

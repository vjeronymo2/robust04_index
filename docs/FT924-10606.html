			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Confusion over Danish treaty move FRESH ammunition for opponents of the Maastricht treaty came yesterday when a Foreign Office official admitted that it was unclear what the implications of accommodating Denmark's objections will be for the treaty's ratification in other European Community countries. Mr Michael Jay, a senior Foreign Office official responsible for European Community policy, told the Commons foreign affairs committee that it was uncertain what form any deal to help Denmark would take. He went on: 'Until one is clear what the document that comes out at the end of it will be, it is very hard to know what the implications will be for other member states so far as ratification is concerned, or for us.' Denmark released proposals on Tuesday for ending the deadlock resulting from its rejection by referendum of Maastricht. The UK government has been embarrassed by the leaking on Wednesday of a memorandum written by Mr Jay which warned of 'difficult' negotiations ahead between Denmark and the 11 other EC countries over the plans. Euro-sceptics and Labour believe ministers cannot claim that the way ahead for Denmark is clearer and that the government's case for bringing Maastricht back to the Commons next week has been undermined. Mr James Cran, Tory MP for Beverley, asked: 'Why is parliament wasting its time on something which is now hypothetical or at least conditional?' Mr John Smith, Labour leader, challenged Mr John Major in the Commons over 'undertakings' he gave in September not to proceed with the Maastricht bill until the terms for Danish ratification, and a clearer definition of subsidiarity (the principle of decisions being taken at the lowest possible level) were agreed. Mr Smith said the Foreign Office document confirmed that the prime minister 'cannot possibly discharge the undertakings' before December's Edinburgh summit. The government says there is no question of the Maastricht treaty being renegotiated. Denmark's identified areas of concern - on defence, internal justice policy, economic and monetary union, and citizenship - could almost certainly be resolved without fresh UK legislation, one Whitehall official said. In the unlikely event of a separate, free-standing treaty being needed, it would not impinge on the contents of the Maastricht Bill to be considered by MPs, he added. The Commons foreign affairs committee has also been told by Mr Jeremy Lever QC, a specialist in European law, that provisions in Maastricht on subsidiarity may prove ineffective in areas such as employment and the environment without stronger agreement on implementation. Mr Jay sought to counter such fears with figures showing that the number of legislative proposals from the European Commission has fallen from 162 in 1990 to 118 proposed during 1992, of which only 48 have actually been brought forward.</p>

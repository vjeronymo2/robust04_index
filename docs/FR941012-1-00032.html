Included is the income disregard provided under section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which amends section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. This income disregard is effective January 1, 1994. This amendment provides that up to $2,000 per year of income derived from interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered in determining assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal or federally assisted program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, we propose to incorporate the resource disregard provided under section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as added by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458, effective January 12, 1983. This provision requires that interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered a resource in determining eligibility for assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal or federally assisted program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons and agencies are invited to submit written comments concerning the proposed regulations no later than December 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Mack A.

L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, amends section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134 to provide that up to $2,000 per year of amounts derived from interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be counted as income. The Conference Report identifies ``leases on individually-owned trust or restricted Indian lands'' as such interests [H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;111, 103D Cong., 1st Sess., 494&hyph;495 (1993)]. The income generally comes from interests in lands allotted to individual Indians many years ago. Income to individual Indians generated by these interests is likely to be quite small because many of the original interests is allotted lands have fractionized over time due to the inheritance of multiple heirs over several generations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed regulations, the disregard of up to $2,000 per year would be applicable only to income. Any disregarded amounts retained by an individual after the month in which they are received would be counted as a resource. We also propose to give States the flexibility to define the yearly period for applying the income disregard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 233.20 would be amended by redesignating paragraph (a)(4)(i) as (a)(4)(i)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and adding a new paragraph (a)(4)(i)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) to incorporate the income disregard required by section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Disregard of Individual Indian Interests in Trust or Restricted Lands From Consideration as a Resource <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 93&hyph;134, enacted October 19, 1973, provides for the use or distribution of certain Indian judgment funds. Public Law 97&hyph;458, enacted January 12, 1983, made several amendments to Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. One amendment made by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458 was the addition of a new section 8 to Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. Section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134 requires that interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered a resource in determining eligibility for assistance under the Social Security Act of any other Federal or federally assisted program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this provision was effective in 1983, it was not incorporated in the regulations at that time because it was considered unnecessary. Interests in trust or restricted lands are not considered a resource under the definition of available income and resources in existing regulations at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D). These regulations provide, in pertinent part, that income and resources are considered available both when actually available and when the applicant or recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available for support and maintenance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, we now propose to incorporate the resource disregard in order to prevent any confusion that may result were we to incorporate only the income disregard provided under section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. Therefore, we would further amend section 233.20 by adding paragraph (a)(4)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> v <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) to incorporate the resource disregard required by section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as added by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

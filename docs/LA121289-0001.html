			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDSHIP  </P> <P> As I was drinking my morning coffee, I read Al Martinez's column about the  friendship of a blind woman and a gay man that began in their high school days  and ended with his tragic death in an auto accident ("Time and the Deep  Winters," Metro, Nov. 28). The beautifully written article brought tears to my  eyes and reminded me of the verse a friend recently enclosed in a little  thank-you note: "If we had all the earth's riches we could never spend enough  to buy the treasures the heart finds in a friend."  </P> <P> Thank you, Mr. Martinez, for reminding me what this time of year should really  be about: extending the hand of human kindness instead of those needless, mad  dashes to shopping malls for unappreciated Christmas gifts.  </P> <P> ROBERT LITMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

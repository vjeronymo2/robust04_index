			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Salomon warns of Dollars 100m post-tax loss in third term Salomon said yesterday it would report an after-tax loss of about Dollars 100m for the third quarter because of another poor performance from its Wall Street securities broking unit, Salomon Brothers. In the same quarter a year ago, the group earned a profit of Dollars 20m. It is the second consecutive quarter that Salomon has posted a big loss because of the sharp downturn in business conditions on Wall Street. Salomon has always been more vulnerable than most securities firms to volatile swings in earnings because a large part of its business involves risking the firm's own capital in the global financial markets. It was this proprietary trading business which was once again primarily to blame for the losses, Salomon said. It said it had suffered a loss in its other activities, due to the general decline in underwriting activity and securities trading that has affected the whole of Wall Street. The news prompted Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, to put the bank's long-term debt rating of A3 under review. A downgrade would rob Salomon of its single-A standing, potentially adding to its debt costs, since many investors only buy paper issued by companies rated single-A or higher. The rating agency added, though, that Salomon's liquidity remained strong and it was not reviewing the banks short-term credit rating of A2. Salomon said its client-driven business still performed better than in the second quarter, when a sharp drop in the value of securities it holds left the group with a loss of Dollars 204m. The firm said its Phibro oil trading unit would report a 'modest' pre-tax loss for the July-September period. In spite of its losses in consecutive quarters, some analysts warned against taking too negative view of the bank's earnings. The figures reflected difficult trading conditions, said Mr Michael Flannagan at Lipper Analytical, adding: 'Over the longer term, Salomon's earning power remains very much intact.' The poor results at Salomon are likely to be echoed by other publicly-quoted Wall Street firms, which are due to release their third-quarter earnings over the coming weeks. On Wall Street, Salomon shares fell Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 37 7/8.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As the war continues in the country, a sense of  insecurity has gripped the nation. Many people continue to die  under the hands of the Presidential Guards, the MRND-CDR  [Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] youth  wingers and some elements of the Rwanda Army. So far the death  toll is exceeding 26,000 people. Yesterday, reports said that  Dr. Theoneste Gefaranga was murdered in his hiding place. Dr.  Gafaranga was the second vice president in the PSD [Social  Democratic Party]. In Commune Rukira, about 800 people were  found by RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] soldiers locked in one  place since the death of President Habyarimana. Some had died,  and others were badly injured due to grenades that were thrown  at them regularly. Others were dying of hunger. Those who were  survived were rescued by the RPF troops. Reports say that the  road from Kigali to Gitarama is ringed by dead bodies and  starving refugees. The government is using trucks to clear the  bodies.    Another incident took place at the Zaire Embassy in Kigali,  where 22 people were killed. Some of these people could have  been Zaire nationals. And, in another turn of events, people in  Commune Bicyumbi [Kigali Prefecture] have started defending  themselves against the killers. They use traditional weapons  like spears, bows and arrows, and pangas.    Meanwhile, the Belgian foreign minister expressed fear that  all the Belgians remaining in Rwanda were in imminent danger.  He had information that the Rwanda Government soldiers had  plans to kill Belgian soldiers who were part of the UN mission  in Rwanda. Yesterday 440 Belgian soldiers were still stranded at  the Kigali Airport. The foreign minister, Mr. Willy Claes,  continuously appealed to his government to do all possible to  evacuate them.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: MAS falls 90% to MDollars 16.1m Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the country's national carrier, has been through another tough year but sees a brighter future. Group results, released yesterday, show a pre-tax profit for the year ending March 31, 1994 of MDollars 16.1m (USDollars 6.2m), a 90 per cent drop on the previous year. The airline pointed out that pre-tax figures for the past two years were not strictly comparable. The 1992-93 pre-tax profit of MDollars 157m included a profit of MDollars 337m from sales of aircraft. If this had been stripped out, MAS would have suffered a pre-tax loss of MDollars 180m. In 1993-94, MAS made profits of only MDollars 11.8m from the sale of aircraft and spare parts. 'Group profit before tax and before profit on sale of aircraft and spares was MDollars 4.3m, compared with a loss of MDollars 179.2m in 1992-93,' the company said. 'This represents an improvement of MDollars 183.5m or 102.4 per cent.' Turnover for the year improved by 9.2 per cent to MDollars 4.1bn. The board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of two Malaysian cents, compared with 10 cents the previous year. MAS has become known as one of the world's most ambitious airlines. In the course of its present five-year plan to 1996-97, it has orders for 72 aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn. Over the last year the airline has taken delivery of 27 aircraft. When many other airlines are pruning their services, MAS's route network has been expanding rapidly. It has recently launched services to Buenos Aires, Cape Town and Rome. Passenger growth has kept well ahead of increases in capacity, resulting in an improvement in the overall load factor to 63.9 per cent. Yields have decreased - by 3.8 per cent on international routes and 3.9 per cent on the loss-making domestic network. Analysts said that though there had been some improvement, many problems remained. MAS, more than 50 per cent controlled by the government, is still regarded as an excessively bureaucratic, overstaffed airline. MAS said there had been a small reduction in staff numbers over the past 12 months.</p>

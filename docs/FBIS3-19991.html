			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christine Richter: "The Governing Mayor With the </F> Best Image; Infas-Poll: Berliners Rate Senate Members; CDU Would  Lose 8 Percent in Elections"]    [Text] The Berliners rate their senators very  differently. The greatest confidence is enjoyed by Mayor  Eberhard Diepgen (CDU) [Christian Democratic Union].    Fifty-three percent of the Berliners rate his performance as  "good," 39 percent as "more poor than good." This is the result  of a representative poll that the "infas" public opinion  institute was commissioned to take by the BERLINER ZEITUNG.  "Notable in this case," the pollsters say, "is that the mayor  gets predominantly good ratings not only within his own camp,  but from supporters of the coalition partner SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany] as well." In second place on the  popularity list is Senator for Juvenile Affairs Thomas Krueger  (SPD): 38 percent rate him positively, while one in four views  his image as negative. Almost identical ratings are given to  Senator for Women's Affairs Christine Bergmann and Senator for  Social Affairs Ingrid Stahmer (both SPD): 36 percent of those  polled rate them as "good," 27 percent as "poor."    Cultural Affairs Senator Ulrich Roloff-Momin (unaffiliated)  is the recipient of more criticism than favor (27 to 37  percent), and things look even worse for the rest of the team.  Approximately half the population gives a predominantly poor  rating to Construction Senator Wolfgang Nagel (SPD) and to his  colleague, Urban Development Senator Volker Hassemer (CDU), with  whom he is currently locked in a violent dispute over the  construction plan for Alexanderplatz. The same is true for CDU  Senators Elmar Pieroth (Finance), Dieter Heckelnmann (Internal  Security), and Herwig Haase, who is responsible for bus lanes,  the 30-kilometer speed limit, and the "right turn on red"  system. Most Berliners either cannot, or do not want to, give  their opinion on the other senate members.    If the election were held now in Berlin, the CDU would  suffer  significant losses (see table below). Eight percent fewer than  four years ago would vote for the Christian Democrats. The SPD  would be unable to profit from this. It would get 30 percent of  the votes, so that the two governing parties would be locked in  a neck-to-neck race. Considering the distribution of the balance  of the votes, a continuation of the grand coalition would appear  likely. The FDP [Free Democratic Party], which at the moment is  waging its struggles for power in unadorned fashion, would no  longer be represented in the House of Deputies. The Alliance  90/Greens would receive 12 percent. The undisputed winner--and  third-strongest caucus--would be the PDS [Party of Democratic  Socialism] with 15 percent.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Elections to the House of Deputies(in percentage of votes received)          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Voter Preference in Feb 1|Election Results on 2 De-|  |                         |994                      |c 1990                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CDU                      |32                       |40.4                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SPD                      |30                       |30.4                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |FDP                      |4                        |7.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Alliance 90/Greens       |12                       |9.4                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PDS                      |15                       |9.2                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Republikaner             |4                        |3.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Others                   |3                        |0.5                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: infas Berlin                                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

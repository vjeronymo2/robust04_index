Taking part in the meeting were Tajik  Foreign Ministry officials, members of the Parliamentary  Commission on Tajik Refugees' Repatriation and representatives  of Afghanistan's National Islamic Movement, led by General  Abdurashid Dustum.    The influential general controls large areas in northern  Afghanistan on the border with Tajikistan.    His envoys are reported to have informed the other side of  Kabul's readiness to put him in charge of Sherkhan.    His emissaries assured their Tajik counterparts that Dustum  would do all he can to restore a transit camp for Tajik refugees  at Sherkhan. In their words, Dustum's units will guarantee the  safe return of Tajik fugitives to their homeland.    More than 50,000 Tajiks fled into Afghanistan at the peak of  military hostilities there in 1992.</p>

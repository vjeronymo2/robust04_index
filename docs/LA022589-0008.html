			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IACOCCA ON THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN LOBBIES IN WASHINGTON  </P> <P> Iacocca neatly sidestepped a couple of subjects in his column. He offers no  explanation of why truck tariffs are 10 times greater than car tariffs.  Obviously, there would be no incentive to avoid this excessive (25%) tariff if  it was anywhere near the level imposed on cars (2.5%).  </P> <P> He also claims we don't send people to foreign countries to influence their  governments. We just send clandestine CIA operatives to foment uprisings,  influence elections, and incite assassinations. That's real meddling! Compared  to that, foreign lobbyists are benign.  </P> <P> JAMES R. CLARK JR.  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

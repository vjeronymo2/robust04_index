			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Observer: Pips squeak Who says the trade unions have lost their muscle? Barclays Bank's top brass must be quaking at the knees at the threatened response by the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union to the bank's plans for compulsory redundancies in London and the south east. Having failed to win support for a strike, the union is rolling out its secret weapon, an 'Admobile'. It's a lorry with a sign on the back telling Barclays, in no uncertain terms, that it must stop its sacking plans at once. It will circle Parliament Square several times next Thursday before making a ceremonial drive past Barclays new head offices. Managers had better duck down or it might sound its horn.</p>

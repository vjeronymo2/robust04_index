			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Report card on the Tecs Despite nearly 18 months of falling unemployment, the issue of jobs and skills remains close to the top of the nation's agenda. The Training and Enterprise Councils, the private sector-led bodies which run UK training, carry an important part of the responsibility for handling the issue with care and competence. As they meet in conference in Birmingham today, the report card - after four years and nearly Pounds 2bn per annum of public money - is mixed. About one quarter of young people leaving Youth Training go straight on to the dole, and less than one-third of adults leave the Training for Work scheme for a job. These programmes are achieving better results than in pre-Tec days, but the results are still not good enough and Tec directors should be pressing their organisations to do better. One reason that they are not doing so is that directors' real concerns tend to lie in the more glamorous, but thinly funded, areas of local economic development and training the already employed. On the positive side, the message from the survey of Tec directors published in today's Financial Times is that the organisations are developing a sense of their own collective identity, and are thinking their way forward in a constructive manner. They seem to recognise, for example, that the problem is not simply a matter of an inadequate supply of skilled people, but also a result of unambitious company strategies which are not placing sufficient emphasis on improving employees' skills. Hence their legitimate interest in economic development and in achieving something akin to the financial and institutional clout of German chambers of commerce. Our Tec survey shows strong interest in compulsory registration of companies with the local Tec, in mergers with chambers of commerce, and in some independent funding via a levy to promote in-company training. Much of this is not yet on the government's agenda, but persistent pressure from the Tecs could help to put it there. In the meantime, the Tecs are right to call for better incentives to take up Investors in People, now three years old, which acknowledges the connection between skills and the broader world of products and markets. IIP has attracted disappointingly few companies to date, although there has been a welcome pick up in recent months. Whether bodies which regard themselves as devoted to raising business quality in general, and in-company training in particular, should also have a monopoly in running large-scale training schemes for the unemployed remains an open question. For the time being the arguments for continuity should prevail. Britain's training infrastructure has suffered from too much rapid change and, in any case, the best training providers tend to be organisations which conduct both in-company training and schemes for the unemployed. Tecs need appropriate public scrutiny - and it is unsettling to see how many private sector directors are opposed to greater openness - but the government should listen carefully to the Tecs' continuing complaints of muddle and bureaucracy. It should also ensure that as the economic recovery becomes better established, the urgency does not seep out of the training debate. The government might, indeed, set an example by bringing forward its own welcome proposals for a modern apprenticeship scheme, along with the consultations on universal training and education credits for 16 to 19 year olds.</p>

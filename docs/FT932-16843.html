			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Supremely mysterious: Robert Thomson explains the obscure workings of Japan's highest court Without fuss, and with a fanfare of small and obscurely placed newspaper reports to greet him, Mr Masao Ono has just become one of Japan's most influential individuals. Appointed this week to the Japanese supreme court, he shares the ultimate right to define what his fellow citizens can read or watch, and has the power to determine when life ends. Supreme Court appointments in the US, which must be approved by Congress, may provoke months of public debate and raise fears about a shift to the left or a veer to the right. In Japan, the highest court in the land prefers private appointments of largely anonymous, if experienced, practitioners, who are expected to maintain a low public profile after their promotion. There are 15 justices on Japan's supreme court, which has the power to interpret the constitution and is the final court of appeal. The judges' chambers have one of the best views in Tokyo, overlooking rows of cherry blossoms in spring and the deep moat around the Imperial Palace. In theory, the palace's tenant, Emperor Akihito, appoints the judges, but his approval comes after a selection is made by the legal bureaucracy, which is a law unto itself. 'Appointments are a bit of a mystery. It's difficult to say who is actually responsible,' explained Mr Eiki Endo, vice-president of the Second Tokyo Bar Association, which proposed the newly-appointed Mr Ono, a 65-year-old lawyer who replaced another former lawyer who retired compulsorily at 70. There is no rule demanding that there be four lawyers among the 15, or six career judges, two ex-bureaucrats, two prosecutors and one law professor; but there is a tradition of maintaining those ratios and tradition weighs very heavily on the court. The traditions are observed faithfully by the Cabinet, which plays a nominal role in approving selections already made by the court. But recent controversial judgments have prompted debate on whether the supreme court is attempting to petrify an image of Japan far from the modern reality. Reformist lawyers complain that the judges are embarrassed by their constitutional power and retreat into ambiguity because they are too scared to establish a clear precedent or to challenge the government's authority. The court's sometimes strange ways were highlighted recently by a 31-year-old dispute about the power of the ministry of education to censor textbooks. Most cases are decided on written evidence submitted, without calling witnesses. And so it was for Professor Saburo Ienaga, whose book, A New Japanese History, was rejected as a school text by the ministry in 1962 for a blunt account of Japanese military aggression in Asia during the second world war. Prof Ienaga, now 79, had climbed through the court hierarchy, winning compensation in one case, only to lose it again on appeal. But when the supreme court finally delivered judgment, after seven years, neither the professor nor his representatives were present. Unannounced, the judges had filed into an empty courtroom, delivered the verdict to the court recorders, and filed out again. 'They didn't even tell me it was going to happen,' the distraught professor complained on the day, drawing much public sympathy. The court ruled that the ministry is entitled to alter any textbook as long as its concerns are 'reasonable', giving the bureaucracy broad powers, which the ministry later said would be used 'appropriately'. Appropriate use of wide bureaucratic powers has been a characteristic of Japan's post-war economic success, and has its origins in the Confucian ideas of hierarchy and harmony, influential since the sixth century. One reason for not appointing a brilliant, idiosyncratic lawyer is that he or she might disrupt the harmony of the bench. In assessing Mr Ienaga's complaint about changes to his text, which dared to describe the Japanese army as 'reckless', the court considered his constitutional right to be published. But it found this right was outweighed by the need to preserve the government's right to intervene to maintain a collective harmony - a concept not defined in the constitution. The direction of the Japanese court bemuses US jurists because the constitution was rewritten after the second world war by US specialists with their own Supreme Court in mind. Under Articles 76 and 77, the judiciary was clearly separated from the government and the judges were to be 'independent in the exercise of their conscience', a quality more evident in the 1950s than the 1990s. Mr Seiichi Yoshikawa, an attorney who has studied the two supreme courts, said the Japanese version was dynamic in the years immediately after the war. Since then the court has gradually become less questioning. Most verdicts are unanimous and the rights of the bureaucracy are repeatedly asserted: 'In the US, you have a sense that the courts are resolving the great economic and social issues of the day - you can't feel that here.' But public opinion has been stirred by the ordeals suffered by Prof Ienaga and by the realisation that the country now has a justice minister in favour of hanging, Masaharu Gotoda, who signed orders for the execution of three prisoners last week - the first executions since 1989. In a previous decision on the death penalty, the supreme court ruled that hanging is constitutional as long as it is not 'cruel'.</p>

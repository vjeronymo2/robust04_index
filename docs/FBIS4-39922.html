			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin article: "Persian Gulf: New Exacerbation </F> of Iranian-Saudi Relations"]    [Excerpts] It has become a bad tradition that relations  between Iran and Saudi Arabia, those two leading forces in the  region today, become exacerbated with the onset of the season of  pilgrimage to the places in Mecca and Medina which are holy to  every Muslim. A majority of observers link -- quite reasonably  -- the cyclical growth of tension in this already unquiet corner  of the globe with Tehran's attempts to politicize religious  ceremonies for its own political and propaganda purposes.  [passage omitted]    We should not expect a lowering of the level of rivalry  caused by the two countries' desire to occupy the leading  position both in the region and throughout the Islamic world.    Tehran, which aspires to the role of the expresser of the  interests of all Muslims, will hardly resign itself to the fact  that Riyadh, the "imperialists' accomplice," retains the title  of custodian of Islam's main holy places. The contradictions  between Tehran and Riyadh also concern a wide range of  international problems, including the Near East settlement.  Iran continues to deny the possibility of reaching agreement  with Israel and advocates its destruction.    Under these conditions Moscow's position with regard to  Tehran and Riyadh appears delicate, to put it mildly. On the  one hand, Saudi Arabia is one of the greatest states of the Arab  world, in which it objectively plays an increasingly weighty  role by virtue of its financial, economic, and geostrategic  potential and resources. True, cooperation between our  countries has not enjoyed the necessary development, and the  arms market is in the hands of Western companies -- above all,  U.S. ones -- and will most likely be entirely geared to them for  the next five to 10 years. On the other hand there is Iran,  which borders on the southern underbelly of the CIS and with  which traditional ties have long existed. In this situation  there is no alternative but, at best, to urge the sides not to  work toward something sinful, i.e. an altercation involving  weapons.</p>

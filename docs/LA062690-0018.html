			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS TO VOTE ON TESTING CONTRACT  </P> <P> Ventura County is likely to receive a $1.2-million contract to continue testing  underground gasoline tanks and monitoring any needed cleanup, according to  county officials.  </P> <P> The state contract would continue a program begun in 1988.  </P> <P> It would pay for 10 staff members, said Janis Bassett, supervising accountant  at the county's Resource Management Agency.  </P> <P> County supervisors are to decide today whether to agree to a three-month  extension of the contract, which expires Saturday.  </P> <P> The county has earned the renewal by being quick and effective in heading off  potentially cancer-causing leaks of gasoline into ground water, said Hank  Yacoub, director of the state water-quality toxics program in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The county has approved cleanup at 88 sites and is working on cleanup plans at  another 440, county officials said.  </P> <P> Like the rest of the state, however, Ventura County missed 1985, 1986 and 1987  deadlines for issuing permits to all operators of underground tanks.  </P> <P> The permits require operators to monitor existing tanks for leaks or replace  them with leakproof tanks. All or nearly all underground-tank operators in  Ventura County now have permits, Yacoub said.  </P> <P> Tanks in the city of Ventura are not covered by the county effort. The city  applied for a contract but was rejected because it has few tanks, said Brian  Clark, who heads the city's locally funded program. JOANNA M. MILLER  </P></p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Grim prognosis on UK recovery BRITAIN is expected to experience below average growth as it emerges from recession, the International Monetary Fund reported yesterday, writes Peter Norman. The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook predicts that the UK will have the slowest growth rate of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries this year. The 0.8 per cent increase in GDP projected for 1992 compares with an average growth of 1.8 per cent forecast for all industrialised countries and the Treasury's March Budget forecast of 1 per cent growth in the UK. Growth in Britain will quicken as the year progresses, with GDP projected to be 2.1 per cent higher in the fourth quarter of this year, compared with the final quarter of 1991. But the 3.1 per cent growth rate forecast by the IMF for 1993 will also be below the 3.3 per cent average forecast for the industrial nations next year. Elaborating on the projections, Mr Michael Mussa, director of the IMF's research department, said that UK output growth in the opening quarter of this year was close to zero and might have been 'slightly negative'. But a modest recovery should be beginning 'right about now'. He noted that high German interest rates effectively put a floor under UK base rates at 10.5 per cent. But the UK government had allowed the automatic fiscal stabilisers to work and had taken additional discretionary action in last November's Autumn Statement and March Budget. The IMF thought that these actions were 'probably appropriate' even though it now expected the UK's general government deficit to expand to 5.7 per cent of GDP by 1993, from 5.1 per cent in 1992 and 2.3 per cent last year.</p>

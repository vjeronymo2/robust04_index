			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tax credit and lower minorities aid LMS London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company, suffered a 20 per cent fall in profits at the pre-tax level in the year to March 31 from Pounds 27.8m to Pounds 22.3m. However, a tax credit of Pounds 569,000 (Pounds 8.53m charge) and a Pounds 500,000 reduction in minority interests to Pounds 2.03m resulted in a net profit of Pounds 20.8m, up 24 per cent from Pounds 16.8m last time. Shareholders' funds were 24 per cent higher at Pounds 319.2m (Pounds 258.2m), excluding the Pounds 33m by which the market value of listed investments exceeded the balance sheet figures. The company's properties increased in value by 16 per cent to Pounds 379.8m, adjusted for sales and acquisitions. Lord Rayne, chairman, said that there was a 'perceptible' increase in tenant interest. 'Although this fragile recovery appears to be progressing, creative investment possibilities with significant growth potential remain rare, but efforts continue to be focused on identifying suitable opportunities,' he said. LMS said a number of unusual factors had contributed to the results. Gains from property disposals and venture capital investments, together with the release of prior years' provisions for corporation tax, more than offset the Pounds 2.7m negative effect of ceasing to treat First Leisure Corporation as an associated undertaking; the non-recurrence of the British Sky Broadcasting Holdings guarantee fee received in 1993 (Pounds 2.9m); and the fall in interest income from the group's cash resources of Pounds 2.7m. The associated undertakings, which last time produced an attributable pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.43m, had incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 631,000. The main reason was the change in treatment of First Leisure Corporation because LMS's holding fell below 15 per cent. US venture capital investments produced gains of Pounds 4m, despite the varying fortunes of the individual enterprises. Net rental income from investment property increased from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 30m. LMS made a net gain on property disposals of Pounds 6.2m in 1994, compared with Pounds 2.24m. Cash and listed securities totalled Pounds 190m on March 31; net borrowings amounted to Pounds 70.7m, making gearing 22 per cent of shareholders' funds. Earnings per share increased from 7p to 8.59p. The dividend is increased by 0.2p to 4.2p via a 3.4p final.</p>

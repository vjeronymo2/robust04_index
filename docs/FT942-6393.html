			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Unit trust sales at record for April Net unit trust sales fell last month to Pounds 976m but this was still the second highest monthly figure this year and the best April figure on record, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. Strong sales of unit trust personal equity plans (Peps) had contributed to making March the best month ever, with net sales of Pounds 1.37bn. But April 5 signalled the end of the rush to buy tax-free Peps for the last financial year. Private investors accounted for 73 per cent of overall net sales last month. UK equity income and international growth were the most popular sectors for private investors, while institutions preferred the fund-of-funds and UK growth sectors. The two sectors which fell most out of favour were Europe and the Far East excluding Japan. Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, said: 'Investors are buying unit trusts for the long-term, irrespective of short-term trends in the stock market.' Gross sales of unit trusts in April were Pounds 1.77bn, while the value of funds rose to Pounds 97bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Latvia Submits a Note to the </F> United States"]    [Text] Riga, 8 Mar -- On Monday [7 March], Latvian  Ambassador to the United States Ojars Kalnins submitted a note  from the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the U.S.  Department of State, with the aim of obtaining an explanation of  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's statement before a  Senate subcommittee on 2 March regarding Latvia. This was  reported by the press center of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its  incomprehension of W. Christopher's statement that "there are  about one million Russians in Latvia who are deprived of voting  rights," because, in fact, 278,087 out of 722,468 Russians  residing in Latvia are citizens of the Latvian Republic.    The chief U.S. diplomat pointed out twice that the presence  of the Russian Army at the Skrunda radar base is essential.    The note states that W. Christopher has accepted Russia's  rights "to stimulate the Latvians to broaden their circle of  citizens and to grant voting rights to Russians who want to live  in Latvia." The Latvian Foreign Affairs Ministry is alarmed  that Russia might interpret these remarks as acceptance of  Russian attempts to dictate Latvian citizenship and  naturalization policy. In the end, the note says that  Christopher's remarks, unless they are explained, can be  tendentiously distorted in Latvia as well as in Russia, and this  could seriously interfere with the efforts of the Latvian  Government to resolve important issues related to citizenship,  Russian military withdrawal, and the status of the Skrunda radar  station.    The note expresses amazement over the fact that the U.S.  secretary of state did not mention any of the progress which has  been achieved in Latvia in working out a citizenship law in line  with international standards, as well as the fact that one third  of ethnic Russians in Latvia are already Latvian citizens. The  Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has proposed a meeting of  diplomats from both countries.</p>

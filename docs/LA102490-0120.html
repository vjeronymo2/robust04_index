			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSHUA'S FLOCK;  </P> <P> NOVELS HELP FATHER JOSEPH GIRZONE REACH THE FAITHFUL -- AND NONBELIEVERS  </P> <P> Standing at the lectern at St. Timothy Roman Catholic Church, Father Joseph  Girzone was telling the story of how Jesus performed the miracle of turning  water into wine to save the wedding party at Cana the embarrassment of running  out only three days into the eight-day marriage feast.  </P> <P> "It makes you think," the soft-spoken priest said, peering owlishly at his  mostly teen-age audience through large-framed glasses. "There were probably an  awful lot of people at that party who were more than three sheets to the wind.  </P> <P> "I would have thought twice about doing something . . . and here the Son of God  gives them another 150 gallons of wine."  </P> <P> It is Girzone's view of Jesus -- open and caring and having an "uncanny ability  to accept human nature as God fashioned it" -- that has made the retired parish  priest from Altamont, N.Y., a publishing phenomenon. He is so much in demand as  a speaker that he jokes, "I now live on USAir."  </P> <P> Girzone, 60, the author of "Joshua" and "Joshua and the Children," two  best-selling religious novels that place Joshua (Jesus in Hebrew) on the  contemporary scene, can barely keep up with the nearly 200 lecture requests a  year.  </P> <P> Girzone, who retired from the active ministry in 1981 for health reasons, is an  unlikely literary success story.  </P> <P> Girzone wrote and self-published "Joshua," the story of a mysterious woodcarver  who shows up in an eastern U.S. village and captivates the townspeople with his  simple and loving ways, in 1983.  </P> <P> By the time Girzone had sold the paperback rights to the Gospel-oriented novel  in 1987, he had already sold 40,000 hardcover copies, largely by word of mouth.  Since then, "Joshua" has sold 750,000 paperback copies, and the novel has been  translated into five languages. And, according to his publisher, it is still  selling an impressive 20,000 to 40,000 copies a month.  </P> <P> "Joshua and the Children," a sequel that places Joshua in a fictional country  similar to Northern Ireland where people are warring in the name of religion,  was published by Macmillan in 1989. The sequel, which addresses the question of  forgiveness, spent 11 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, landed on  the Publishers Weekly list of the top 25 hardcover fiction best-sellers of 1989  and has been optioned for a feature film.  </P> <P> Now, Girzone has combined a cross-country publicity tour with his lecture  schedule to promote "The Shepherd" (Macmillan; $15.95), the latest installment  in his Joshua series.  </P> <P> "The Shepherd" is the story of a newly ordained bishop who has always adhered  strictly to church rules. But after praying for guidance the night of his  ordination, he has nightmares about the damage his rigidity has caused in  parishioners' lives.  </P> <P> In this one, Joshua plays a supporting role, serving as the bishop's mentor as  he makes decisions to do things the way he thinks Christ would do them.  </P> <P> Among the contemporary issues "The Shepherd" addresses are:  </P> <P> * The shortage of priests: "We will in a short time be faced with a priestless  church, at a time when people need good priests more than ever." The fact that  a qualified person is married, the book contends, should not be a barrier to  the priesthood.  </P> <P> * Celibacy: "It is a clear violation of a basic human right. Even Jesus made  celibacy optional: 'Let him who can take it, take it.' He himself picked  married men as his first priests."  </P> <P> * Confession: "When people stop accepting forgiveness in traditional form, it  expresses a clear message: That form has lost meaning for them. The whole  Christian world can't be wrong. Find another way."  </P> <P> * Homelessness: "If people starve, it is because others don't care. Do you  think it will go well on Judgment Day with those who have built their casinos  and their castles and amassed their riches by shutting their hearts against the  hurting masses of humanity?"  </P> <P> "The Shepherd," Girzone acknowledges, is his hardest-hitting novel yet.  </P> <P> "It addresses practically all the issues we're not supposed to talk about," he  said in an interview before his talk. "It's sort of a blueprint for the radical  reconstruction of the church."  </P> <P> It is radical, he added, "but not in the bad sense of the word: There's nothing  in it that is against the Catholic doctrine, but it hits very, very hard at  archaic laws and an archaic way of doing things in the church."  </P> <P> Girzone, however, does not consider himself a radical.  </P> <P> "I'm very rational," he said. "If anything, I tend to be more conservative. But  in working with people, I've always tried to be very realistic, and to have  laws that are archaic and no longer work and not to reconsider those laws to me  seems to be totally irrational."  </P> <P> Of the small number of successful priest-authors, Father Andrew Greeley is  probably the best known. (The best-selling Greeley writes far more secular,  some say steamy, novels.) Among writers of contemporary religious fiction,  industry sources say, Girzone is one of the most popular.  </P> <P> "I think Father Girzone's deceptively simple novels have succeeded for the same  reason their source material has succeeded," said Bill Rosen, Macmillan  publisher and Girzone's current editor. "All Father Girzone is really saying is  pretty much what Jesus said and what people said about Jesus. And that seems to  have an awful lot of power."  </P> <P> And it's not just Catholics who are reading Girzone's simply written tales of a  compassionate modern Christ. The books have had extraordinary  interdenominational appeal.  </P> <P> Girzone has been invited to speak to groups of Southern Baptists, Pentecostals,  Presbyterians, Methodists, Episcopalians and even Jews who have read his books.  "Usually," he notes, "they develop Joshua clubs -- Friends of Joshua they call  themselves."  </P> <P> Girzone also has been told that a Hindu swami in New York, believing "Joshua"  to be divinely inspired, urged his disciples to follow Joshua's teachings. And  psychiatrists, observing the calming effect "Joshua' has on many readers, have  given the book to troubled patients, he said.  </P> <P> Girzone's fan mail attests to the profound effect "Joshua" has on readers, many  of whom say they were so deeply touched by the book that they now live their  lives more simply.  </P> <P> A Texas millionaire who was suicidal, for example, credited "Joshua" with  having given him a reason to live: He moved to Washington, D.C. to help build  homes for the homeless.  </P> <P> "I'm sort of flabbergasted by the way people respond to it," Girzone said. "I  think the underlying thing is what some Southern Baptists once told me -- that  the reason they loved the book so much is because I give them a Jesus that  makes sense, a Jesus they can fall in love with."  </P> <P> Even non-believers have been affected.  </P> <P> "I get letters from people saying, 'I really don't believe in God, but I read  'Joshua,' and it gave me such a tremendous sense of peace that it was the most  powerful argument for faith that I've experienced."' Girzone said.  </P> <P> Such testimonials, he said, "make me feel my retirement, my ill health, was  worthwhile."  </P> <P> Girzone, who was born in Albany, N.Y., and ordained in 1955, spent his early  years working with Bronx street gangs, counseling Pennsylvania coal miners and  teaching high school before being assigned as pastor of several parishes in the  Albany diocese in the '60s and '70s.  </P> <P> Then the stress began to mount.  </P> <P> At one large parish, Girzone was in charge of organizing religious education  for some 2,000 children. Also during that time, he was made head of a local  Human Rights Commission, and when there were riots in the jail and public  school system he was put in charge of both investigations.  </P> <P> When he completed that assignment, he was transferred to another parish "where  they had a big crisis going on, and then my last parish was a place where the  people were extremely depressed and disillusioned with the church and I had to  try to get them all back in shape."  </P> <P> "All that pressure," Girzone said, "was just devastating."  </P> <P> In 1981, Girzone discovered that he had a high cholesterol count, high blood  pressure and a dangerously elevated red blood cell count, a deadly combination  resulting from stress.  </P> <P> His doctor warned him that if he continued working at the parish, he could be  dead of a stroke within a year.  </P> <P> The more relaxed lifestyle of a writer seemed the perfect antidote. Girzone  already had written one book, "Kara, the Lonely Falcon," an allegory on human  beings' search for peace, which was published in 1979 by a subsidy press.  </P> <P> Girzone worked out an agreement with his diocese for an early retirement in  which he would support himself. Then he moved into a sparsely furnished house  provided at low rent by a friend and began writing.  </P> <P> During the first two years of his retirement, Girzone wrote two religious books  -- "Gloria: A Diary," about a popular teen-ager who gets cancer, and "Who Will  Teach Me?" a religious handbook for parents. Both were published by his own  small publishing house, Richelieu Court, named after the 17th-Century cardinal  who used the press to shape public opinion.  </P> <P> His retirement also gave him time to do something he had wanted to do for  years: reread the Gospels.  </P> <P> "I was able to see things that I didn't see before." A whole new Jesus jumped  off the pages, he said.  </P> <P> He used the Gospels as the basis for his story of Christ in modern setting, and  coupled that with the idea that people have not changed much since Christ's  time. Girzone "just let the book take its course," he said. "It's almost as  though God wanted this image of Himself out."  </P> <P> Girzone's straightforward, unadorned prose has been criticized as "simple and  childlike." Girzone says he has taken his "lumps" for that but that the style  is intentional.  </P> <P> "I never looked upon myself as a writer," he said. "I just had a lot of ideas I  wanted to get out to people. So I tried to write as simply as I possibly could  because I wanted everybody, even little children and old people losing their  powers, to be able to read the books and get something out of them. And so  simple, ordinary people love Joshua."  </P> <P> Girzone's substantial income from his books has allowed him to buy a 21-room  mountaintop house outside Altamont, where he occasionally holds informal  retreats. He also has bought land on a mountaintop in Northern California where  he plans to build his first Joshua House, a retreat for people of all  denominations.  </P> <P> Although he still must take blood-pressure medication, and although his hectic  lecture schedule prevents him from spending much time at home relaxing, he has  no intention of slacking off.  </P> <P> Says Girzone: "I reach more people and have done more priestly work in the past  eight or nine years than I've ever done in my whole life."  </P></p>

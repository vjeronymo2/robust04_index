			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Restoration of Nearshore Breeding Seabird Colonies on the Central California Coast <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Between January 28 and February 4, 1986 the transportation barge  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Apex Houston <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  discharged an undetermined amount of San Joaquin Valley crude oil while in transit from San Francisco Bay to the Long Beach Harbor. The oil spill caused damage to natural resources from San Francisco to the Big Sur coast. Approximately 9,000 seabirds were killed, including 6,000 common murres ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Uria aalge <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), in addition to other aquatic life in and around the coastal waters of central California. State and Federal personnel responded to the spill and assessed damages as a result of the spill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State and Federal natural resource trustees commenced litigation in this matter against potentially responsible parties in January 1989. The complaints alleged claims for natural resource damages, costs, and penalties pursuant to the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. &sect;1251 et seq., Title III of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, 16 U.S.C. &sect;1431 et seq. (formerly the National Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, ``MPRSA''), the California Harbors &amp; Navigation Code &sect;&sect;293 and 294, and other State Law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August, 1994 the parties settled this matter in a Consent Decree entered by the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California for $6.4 million. As part of this natural resources damage settlement, approximately $4.92 million has been allocated for the restoration of common murres. An additional $500,000 has been allocated for the acquisition of habitat for the Federally endangered marbled murrelet ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachyramphus marmoratus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), another species impacted by the spill. The marbled murrelet project will be the subject of future restoration planning efforts in this case and is not included in this plan. The remainder of the $6.4 million collected in the settlement is for penalties and costs incurred as a result of the spill. A Trustee Council, comprised of representatives of each Trustee (California Department of Fish and Game, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) was established to review and select restoration actions. This Trustee Council will meet regularly during the duration of the project to review progress and make necessary changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The goal of this effort is to restore common murres in areas where colonies were extirpated or severely depleted by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Apex Houston <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  oil spill. Social attractants (decoys and recorded vocalizations of common murres) will be used to attract common murres to nest at historic nearshore colonies in the vicinity of San Francisco and Monterey. Behavior and phenology of common murres will be monitored at these sites and at reference sites at Point Reyes and the Farallon Islands to determine when the goal has been met. This project may take approximately 10 years to achieve success because common murres have inherently low reproductive rates and do not breed until they are several years old <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

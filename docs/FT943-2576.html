			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Societies watchdog softens on new code The Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, has softened its guidance on how the Cadbury code of corporate governance should apply to societies. The new guidance, which was sent to society chief executives on Friday, comes before government suggestions on ways in which society boards should be more accountable to their millions of members. These are expected to be published next week as a consultation paper which makes up the second stage of the Treasury's review of building society legislation. The proposals will include reserving a small minority of board places for non-executive directors elected by society members without a contest involving candidates nominated by the board. Provisional guidelines on corporate governance which were published last year in the form of a draft prudential note were severely criticised by many societies, which said they went beyond the Cadbury committee recommendations. Prudential notes have a particular status in the regulation of building societies. Any society that does not comply with such a note normally has to explain itself to the commission and might also find its credit rating affected. The final guidance still runs to almost 20 pages, but the commission now says that only the three pages of the code of best practice will count in terms of the requirement to offer an explanation to the regulator of any failure to comply. There are also some concessions in the substance - such as removal of the requirement that boards include at least one member with relevant professional expertise to direct a society's non-core activities.</p>

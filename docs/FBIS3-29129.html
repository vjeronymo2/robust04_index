			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe said Monday [14 February] the United States will  take retaliatory action against Japan for the failure over the  weekend to reach agreement on the bilateral trade "framework."    Watanabe, head of one of the major factions in the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party, said, "we cannot make such  an easy-going remark that (U.S.-Japan) relations are mature ones  between adults."    "The other side will surely take retaliatory action" against  Japan, he said.    Watanabe, speaking at a lecture in a Tokyo hotel, said he is  opposed to the setting of numerical targets as demanded by the  U.S. to gauge the openness of Japanese markets.    He said Washington has been preoccupied with the idea that  Japan will not give in to U.S. demands unless threatened.    Watanabe was deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign  minister under Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa between 1991 and  1993.    On Friday, trade ties between Japan and the U.S. suffered a  sharp setback after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on a new  "framework" to slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the  share of imports in its markets.    Japan has rejected a U.S. demand to set up numerical targets  to measure the openness of Japanese markets of three sectors --  autos and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of  telecommunication and medical equipment.</p>

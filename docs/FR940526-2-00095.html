			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under OPM regulations, federal civilian employees who have unlimited access to commissaries and post exchanges due to their employment by the government may receive a different allowance rate than other federal employees. This regulation does not apply to federal employees who have limited access or unlimited access for other reasons_e.g., being married to active or retired military personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Task 2 of the OPM contract also required Runzheimer International to calculate comparative living costs in the areas listed below and the Washington, D.C., area for federal civilian employees who have access to military commissaries and post exchanges. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Since the Sears catalogs have been discontinued. Runzheimer has researched hundreds of catalogs to determine which are most appropriate. Runzheimer researchers found that most catalogs have uniform shipping charges. Only catalogs that sell merchandise in the allowance areas and the Washington, D.C., area were used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix 3 identifies Goods &amp; Services, Miscellaneous Expense, and Housing Related pricing changes. Current housing data can be found in appendix 9A and Appendix 9B. Other changes are discussed where applicable in the report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1.3&blank;Pricing Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with last year's tropical-area surveys. Runzheimer collected data for the Hawaii, Guam/CNMI, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands allowance areas (and the Washington, D.C., area) in August, September, and October of 1993, pricing most items during August. Also during August, our research associates priced durable goods, such as cars, and, in October, items such as homeowner insurance, which depend on the pricing of other items (i.e., housing). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure consistent seasonable catalog pricing, Runzehimer used spring/summer catalogs for the catalog items covered in these surveys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1.4&blank;Living Cost Components <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with federal regulations, expense components Runzheimer costed to develop analyses, comparisons, and the report were: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Housing and Housing Related Expenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Transportation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Consumption Goods &amp; Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Miscellaneous Expenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Runzehimer factored sales, excise and property taxes into the analysis where applicable. However, in keeping with previous reports, we did not factor federal, state and local income taxes into the analysis. Because income taxes significantly affect living-cost analyses, Runzheimer and OPM are researching the issue of including income taxes in future surveys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Educational opportunities vary significantly among locations in terms of availability, quality, and other factors. Runzheimer analyst and OPM officials agree that, without additional information, attempts to measure cost differences in education in the selected areas would be highly subjective and would not add to the integrity of the model. Therefore, education expense is not included in the model or surveys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

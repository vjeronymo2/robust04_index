			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Secret world of the penniless emperor: Japanese politicians fear more disclosures in a trucking scandal JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party is braced for embarrassing disclosures as the public prosecutor's probe continues into the Sagawa Kyubin affair - involving links between gangsters, politicians and a trucking company, Sagawa Kyubin. So many financial and political scandals have surfaced in Japan in recent years that new allegations have lost some of their capacity to surprise. But the Sagawa Kyubin affair is attracting attention for the scale of alleged wrong-doing. The public prosecutor's office is investigating alleged breach-of-trust offences involving Y528bn (Pounds 2.2bn), dwarfing the 1989 Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal and the Lockheed bribery affair of the 1970s. The affair shows how a fast growing cash-rich company can attract the attention of politicians and gangsters alike. In the tightly regulated trucking world, companies often call on politicians for help in negotiating red tape. Yakuza (gangsters) hover around the margins, preying on companies, hoping to extract money for 'settling' disputes arising from traffic accidents. At his peak, Mr Kiyoshi Sagawa, the group's 70-year-old founder and a former building site foreman, dined with prime ministers and wrote a grandiose autobiography entitled The Penniless Emperor. Now he is sick - too weak, he has claimed, to give evidence before a Diet committee. His most powerful aide, Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, 57, is under arrest, as is Mr Jun Saotome, Mr Watanabe's lieutenant, both on charges of embezzling Sagawa Kyubin funds. Mr Sagawa drove himself and others relentlessly. Drivers were expected to work up to 18 hours a day and to act as salesmen and account managers. Experienced drivers could earn much more than manual workers. But the penalty for failure was the sack. Starting in Kyoto, Mr Sagawa expanded across Japan mainly through acquisition, which enabled him to circumvent some trucking regulations. Until a rule change in 1990, companies needed two kinds of licences. One allowed long-haul operations on a set route, the other permitted deliveries within a region. The transport ministry took up to 12 months to process licence applications but a company that took over another's operations could also take over its licences. Mr Sagawa's most important deal was struck with Mr Watanabe, then head of a large Tokyo trucking company, who in 1974 merged with Mr Sagawa in return for continued control over Tokyo operations. Mr Sagawa achieved his ambition of building a national network. He toured the country, often in a red Rolls-Royce, talking of little but work, money and sex. In his autobiography he wrote: 'This is a one-man company. My decision is absolute and perfect.' In fact, he owed more than he would admit to Mr Watanabe, whose Tokyo business accounted for a quarter of the group. Mr Watanabe proved adept at handling the company's complex relations with banks, financial companies, gangsters and politicians. But, the smooth-talking Mr Watanabe eventually came to resent playing second fiddle to the brash Mr Sagawa. As it grew into Japan's second biggest delivery group, Sagawa Kyubin ran foul of the authorities. The transport ministry warned it repeatedly about drivers' hours for fear of traffic accidents. In 1986 it was banned from trucking for 25 days after its practices were criticised in a Diet transport committee. It also twice paid fines for tax offences. Sagawa Kyubin tried to improve its record. It cut drivers' hours and increased holidays. But like many Japanese companies, it came to rely on politicians to help smooth relations with officialdom. Like other groups, it rewarded helpers with political donations. Mr Sagawa's political links date back to the 1960s, when he hired the speaker of the Diet's upper house as an adviser. By the mid-1970s, with Mr Watanabe's aid, he had won the favour of Mr Kakuei Tanaka, then prime minister, who also became a Sagawa Kyubin group adviser. Mr Watanabe never looked back. According to Japanese newspapers, Sagawa Kyubin supplied up to Y80bn to over 100 politicians, including Mr Tanaka and other past and present ministers. Stories of deals between Mr Watanabe and top politicians abound. But very little evidence of wrong-doing has emerged, despite efforts of the public prosecutor's office. Sagawa Kyubin's links with yakuza originate in the practice of employing gangsters to settle disputes over traffic accidents. Perpetrators of accidents are expected to pay compensation to a victim, separately from any insurance payments. Yakuza frequently act on behalf of victims and take a cut for their services. The public prosecutor's office is investigating allegations that Sagawa Kyubin bought off yakuza en bloc by making payments to their national bosses  -especially to Mr Susumu Ishii, former head of Inagawakai, the country's second largest crime syndicate. As Sagawa Kyubin prospered, so did the relationship with Mr Ishii. Using dummy companies, Mr Watanabe channelled a total of Y528bn in loans and loan guarantees out of the company for speculative property and stock investments. The biggest share, Y114bn, went to Inagawakai. According to the public prosecutor's office, a further Y59bn went to companies in which Mr Watanabe had a personal interest and Y85.7bn to companies linked to his lieutenant Mr Saotome. The links were exposed by the 1990 crash in Japanese stock prices. With the value of their assets plunging, recipients of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin's largesse could no longer repay their debts. Mr Watanabe might have hoped to conceal some of his secrets. But, say former employees, a row erupted between Mr Watanabe and Mr Sagawa. Mr Sagawa was shocked by the extent of Mr Watanabe's financial operations and he postponed his planned retirement to ensure the group did not fall into Mr Watanabe's hands. Mr Watanabe and Mr Saotome resigned last summer and were arrested. Sagawa Kyubin fears much of its loans may never be returned. It plans to merge Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin into other group companies so as to spread the financial burden. The political party bosses have found alternative sources of funds, but few will supply money as freely as Mr Sagawa and Mr Watanabe.</p>

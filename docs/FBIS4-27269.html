			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan's Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the European  Commission on Wednesday [1 June] announced a joint program to  boost Japan's imports from European Union (EU) countries.    The plan is designed to maximize effects of trade promotion  campaigns currently being undertaken by each party, a MITI  official told a news conference.    Specifically, MITI and the Japan External Trade Organization  (JETRO) will support the EU's "gateway to Japan" three-year  export promotion scheme from 1994 by sponsoring trade fairs and  seminars.    The Japanese side will also offer training to European  corporate managers planning to launch businesses in Japan  through acceptance of trainees and dispatch of Japanese experts  to the EU, MITI said.    The program also calls for interchange of information to  facilitate European exports to this country, MITI said.    These assistance programs are contained in a market-opening  package released by the Japanese Government at the end of March,  MITI said.    In order to smooth implementation of the set goals, MITI and  the European Commission agreed to create a joint committee.    The committee will hold consultations twice a year in Tokyo  and Brussels alternately, with the first meeting taking place  here in September, MITI said.</p>

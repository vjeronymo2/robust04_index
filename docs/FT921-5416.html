			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING in stock index futures was volatile with few features on which to focus in thin trading, writes Joel Kibazo. The day's business in March started at 2,569, but the contract immediately ran into sellers. A leading securities house which sold 150 contracts sent March trading down to 2,563 by 9am as traders digested the overnight falls in Tokyo. March gently crawled back to reach the day's high point of 2,583 by mid-session. A further bout of selling was curtailed by Wall Street's firm opening, though weakness before the close was noted. March finished at 2,574, at a premium of only 9 to the underlying cash market and some 3 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover of just over 4,000 contracts was again judged poor. In traded options, weak turnover of 24,774, saw Asda accounting for a large part of the day's volume. Turnover reached 7,223 lots, the October 40 puts the busiest series, after James Capel carried out a large trade in which it crossed 5,000 contracts at 6p. This was followed by Abbey National, which released results yesterday, trading 1,570 contracts, the March 280 calls busy.</p>

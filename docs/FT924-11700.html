			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wiltshire Brewery losses rise to Pounds 1.4m THE Wiltshire Brewery Company, the shares of which are suspended pending a share subscription and placing, yesterday belatedly reported increased losses for the 14 months to November 30 1991, writes Richard Gourlay. Pre-tax deficit rose from Pounds 578,380 to Pounds 1.39m on sales that doubled to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.25m). The figure was after an exceptional provision of Pounds 460,241 against its investment in County Inns. Mr Graham Axford, chairman and a former managing director of corporate finance at James Capel, said the group continued to suffer from its high gearing. Net interest charge in the period doubled to Pounds 705,000 (Pounds 342,000). Wiltshire has been in discussion with its bankers since late last year. As a result of the placing and subscription control of Wiltshire is expected to pass to Mr Vijay Mallya, one of India's largest distillers and brewers, whose family controls UB Group. A prospectus is expected shortly.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Josef Joffe commentary: "Those Who Fail Against Serbia..."] </F>   [Text] In 1936 the League of Nations, the world's greatest  hope after the slaughter of peoples in World War I, committed  suicide. In a fatal way, the cause of the suicide resembles the  failure of the United Nations and the superpowers in Bosnia. In  October 1935, Mussolini's Italy invaded Abyssinia and a few days  later the League of Nations put its spluttering machinery of  sanctions into operation. Oil in particular was not on the  list; Nazi Germany supplied large amounts of war materiel; under  cover of official indignation, England and France virtually gave  the Italians a free hand because they hoped to win Rome for an  anti-Hitler alliance. In May 1936, after a cruel war, Abyssinia  no longer existed and the League of Nations was in a coma from  which it was never to wake up.    Since April 1994, its successor, the United Nations, has  gone  off the rails in the same way and is heading straight for  disaster. Gone are the days of the post-postwar era  (approximately 1990-94), the times of high hopes and good  intentions, where world powers, more or less in harmony, aimed  at a world order where the violation of peace and genocide had  to be prevented. This worked in the case of Saddam Husayn, but  not in Somalia and Haiti, and even less in Sudan, the CNN-less  and thus forgotten war.    So far, at least good intentions, accompanied by endless  diplomatic interferences, the employment of latent military  power in the form of 14,000 blue helmets, and even the  half-hearted use of real force in the form of a handful of  bombs, have been valid in Bosnia. And now that the Serbs have  softened up Gorazde and can take it anytime? In view of the  "catastrophe" (UN General Rose), it is not only the humanitarian  impulse that fails, but also mere vanity, which normally plays  the stronger part in the lives of people and nations.    After all, the Serbs staged the greatest of all provocations  in Gorazde. With their hypocritical cease-fire promises, they  fooled UN chief civilian officer Akashi twice. They took blue  helmets hostage and attacked the Britons on land and in the air.  They brought a UN protection zone under area fire -- which not  even Saddam dared to do in northern Iraq. And finally they even  duped the Russians, that is, their halfwilling protecting power,  who are risking their relations with the West for the benefit of  a wild rabble of soldiers and their masterminds in Belgrade.    Let us hear what excessively smooth mediator Vitaliy Churkin  meanwhile has to say about the Serbian friends: "It is high  time for Russia to break off the talks with the Bosnian Serbs.  Moscow has to decide whether it may permit a group of  extremists to rope in Great Russia for its objectives. Our  answer is clear: Never."    And what about Bill Clinton, the successor of Jimmy Carter  in  the art of "zigzags and flipflops?" Sometimes bombs are  dropped, sometimes talks are held. Now Defense Secretary Perry  holds forth: "We will not enter into the war to prevent that  (the fall of Gorazde)," then Clinton's security adviser Lake  threatens: One has to make it clear to the Serbs "that the  costs of continued stubbornness are high."    However, the costs -- the Serbs have meanwhile learned this  as did formerly the Italian fascists -- are not high at all.  The reasons for it can be counted on the fingers of one hand.  The United States is still trying to digest the disgraceful  withdrawal from Somalia and to avoid a confrontation with the  Russians. Hard national interests are neither at stake for  Washington nor for London or Paris, and the Germans do not  participate anyway in actions where politics requires the  addition of bullets.    Solid interests -- do they really exist? They also did not  seem to be at work in Abyssinia's case, but afterward it was  shown that the Italian machine guns had mowed down more than  only Abyssinian warriors with bows and arrows. The belief in  the international institutions' power to maintain order was  broken; all those who hoped to implement their objectives with  sheer force were spurred on. The fact that Serbian imperialism  is meanwhile raging within the European civilization makes the  matter even worse.    The last chance has not yet been missed. Bill Clinton,  former governor of Arkansas, can still live up to his  responsibility as a great power, Washington and Moscow can still  combine their joint interests against the Serbs, who present  both of them as paper tigers. Well-measured, but decided force  can still play an important part in the Balkan war -- not as a  peacemaker per se, but as a handyman of diplomacy. For: Always  when the Serbs felt the firm hand of the big ones, they  yielded....    And if not, what then? Then the United Nations can relapse  again into its old role of a debating society, then NATO can  limit itself to cleaning guns, and then the United States can  prepare itself for the long farewell to power in Europe. Those  who fail against a third-rate power like Serbia will neither  show the courage nor the wisdom to face a more powerful  challenger.</p>

Documents obtained by THE GUARDIAN show elaborate procedures  are being put in place to guard the confidentiality of papers on  foreign policy and police co-operation -- subjects which the  Maastricht Treaty brought for the first time within the ambit of  the European Union [EU].    The proposals amount to a blueprint for an EU official  secrets act. They include all the paraphernalia of  counter-espionage, such as codes for the electronic transmission  of sensitive information, perforation numbers to personalise  each copy of written material, and a classification hierarchy to  distinguish between top secret, secret, confidential, or merely  restricted.    The changes relate to work done by the secretariat of the  council of ministers, where the collective decisions of national  governments are prepared and executed.    Niels Ersboll, its secretary-general, has told  representatives of his 2,200 staff that he expects 370 will need  positive vetting. They will be assessed by the security services  of their own country. Most will be lawyers and translators.    The plan has caused uproar among secretariat personnel who  think vetting unnecessary since staff regulations already allow  for violations of secrecy to be punished by dismissal and loss  of pension rights.    Gunther Lorenz, vice president of the staff association,  said  yesterday that his members particularly objected to the lack of  opportunity for an appeal against a negative security report  which might blight an official's career.    Staff considered themselves to be members of a European  civil  service which proudly resisted national interference. Now they  might be refused clearance because of behaviour in their home  countries during their youth.    Staff wanted minimum guarantees, including an appeals  procedure. They might be balloted on a strike.    "We feel we are not strong enough to stop the vetting  completely, but we want some minimum guarantees," Mr Lorenz said.    "If a member state's security service writes a negative  report, it must give reasons against which the official can  appeal.    "If we do not obtain satisfaction, we will be obliged to  convene a general meeting and, if necessary, call a general  strike."    Senior officials believe a full strike is unlikely, but they  are aware of the danger of a work to rule. In previous disputes  staff have come close to immobilising the council of ministers  by refusing to work in any language other than their mother  tongue.    In the face of this threat, diplomats from the member states  have made a few concessions, but it is understood they are being  resisted by hardliners on the K4 committee of senior  representatives from the Home Office and EU interior ministries.    The fourth draft of the plan will be discussed today in  Brussels.    Before the Maastricht treaty came into force co-operation  between member states was handled outside the Community  framework.    Alex Falconer, Labour MEP for Mid-Scotland and Fife, who led  the parliament's successful campaign to quash previous attempts  to introduce a Community official secrecy regime, said the  council of ministers was trying to bypass democratic control.    Diplomats are aware that the issue could have serious  repercussions in Sweden, Norway and Finland, whose governments  are negotiating membership of the EU.    The proposals are likely to meet opposition in the European  Parliament.</p>

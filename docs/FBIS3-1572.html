			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Third Plenary  Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection  [CCDI] of the CPC opened in Beijing this morning. The main  items on its agenda were: to comprehensively implement -- under  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the  party -- the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to  review and sum up -- in accordance with the principle of  "seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability" that serves as  the general requirement for the work of the whole party and  pursuant to the Central Committee's requirements for deepening  the drive against corruption -- the implementation of the  decision of the Central Committee on the tasks of the  anticorruption drive in the near future since the CCDI Second  Plenary Session; and to study and make plans for the tasks of  the anticorruption drive in 1994. On behalf of the CCDI Standing  Committee, Wei Jianxing, member of the Political Bureau and the  Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the  party CCDI, delivered a report entitled: "Conduct In-Depth and  Persistent Struggle Against Corruption and Make the Drive Serve  Reform, Development, and Stability."    Wei Jianxing first reviewed and summed up the implementation  of the anticorruption drive since the CCDI Second Plenary  Session. He said: In accordance with a directive of the  Central Committee, the CCDI Second Plenary Session set out the  specific tasks of stepping up the anticorruption drive,  improving the party's style of work, and building a clean and  honest government in the near future. In taking the  anticorruption drive seriously, party committees and government  at all levels have immediately swung into action and have done a  great deal of work. Over the past six months, we have made fair  progress in implementing the anticorruption drive and have  achieved varying degrees of success in the three tasks set by  the Central Committee. Some of the regions and departments that  have been more conscientious have achieved marked results in  some areas. Many negative and corrupt practices have abated  somewhat. All in all, the momentum of the anticorruption drive  is good, and progress has been healthy. We have, by and large,  achieved the results expected of us by the Central Committee.  Our efforts have been quite helpful to safeguarding political  stability, to advancing reform and opening up, and to  guaranteeing the execution of the tasks of macroeconomic  regulation and control.    Wei Jianxing said: Following the CCDI Second Plenary  Session, party committees and government at all levels have  conscientiously implemented -- and scored fairly good successes  in -- the five-point regulations for observing clean standards  and self-discipline by leading officials at and above the county  (division) level in party and government organs. The provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the  central government as well as the various ministries and  commissions -- state organs at the central level -- have  convened meetings on democratic activities. By carrying out  self-examination and self-rectification, the overwhelming  majority of leading cadres have enhanced their sense of  observing clean standards and self-discipline. The problems  uncovered by many cadres themselves through self-examination  have been handled in accordance with the relevant regulations.  Some localities and departments have even formulated rules and  regulations in regard to observing clean standards and  self-discipline. During this time, localities and departments  have concentrated their resources on the investigation of a  number of major cases. Compared to the corresponding period in  1992, the number of major bribery cases involving over 10,000  yuan that were investigated nationwide from September to  December last year rose by 2.1 times, the number of cases  involving economic offenses by leading cadres at the county  (division) level rose by 6.8 times, and the number of cases  involving cadres at the department and bureau level rose by 11  times. From September to December last year, 42,195 persons  were punished by party sanctions and 16,169 were punished by  administrative sanctions nationwide. The masses became more  aware and took a more active part in the anticorruption drive,  resulting in a sharp increase in letters and visits to  authorities reporting irregularities. Compared to the  corresponding period in 1992, the number of such letters,  visits, and tips received by the nation's discipline inspection  and supervision departments between September and December last  year rose by 78.5 percent. Many of the informants used their  real names, and many of the reports targeted leading cadres, key  departments, and major irregularities. Localities and  departments have also made progress in handling special projects  and in rectifying various unhealthy trends. With the approval  of the State Council, the Finance Ministry and the State  Planning Commission have, in two separate pronouncements,  abolished 143 illegal fees. The 30 provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities directly under the central  government have announced the abolition of 5,227 illegal fees.  The localities and departments have also cracked down on  government-funded sightseeing tours abroad and have stopped some  1,600 unqualified groups from taking tours abroad. Competent  departments in many key sectors took steps to deal with the  major problems in their respective sectors; some sectors such as  the railways have done comparative well and have made rather  remarkable progress. Many other negative and corrupt  manifestations -- such as using public funds to entertain guests  and give presents -- have also been curtailed somewhat.    Wei Jianxing said: Judging from the country as a whole,  the anticorruption drive has developed unevenly, with some  localities failing to achieve concrete results. While affirming  the achievements of the drive so far, we must also notice that  negative phenomena and corruption remain serious and require us  to continue to make painstaking efforts without the slightest  lowering of our guard.    Wei Jianxing said: The implementation of the anticorruption  drive so far has fully testified that the Central Committee's  plans to fight corruption are entirely correct. In the course  of practice, we have explored a number of effective measures,  which can be summarized mainly as the following: We must  understand and grasp the importance of the anticorruption drive  from the height of reforms, development, and stability; although  the anticorruption drive is a protracted strategic task which  cannot be accomplished in one stroke, we must imbue ourselves  with a realistic sense of urgency and carry out the drive step  by step to continuously score periodic achievements; we must  adopt an overall view of the anticorruption drive and adhere to  the pattern of the three tasks set out by the Central Committee  in order to achieve the comprehensive effects of the drive; we  must not only clearly and specifically decide on the tasks and  goals for the various stages of the anticorruption drive but  also must strengthen the supervision, inspection, and guidance  from the top and from below; the whole party membership and both  party and government organizations must be mobilized in the  anticorruption drive; and to create a macroclimate, the  anticorruption drive must be strongly supported by public  opinion.    In discussing the tasks for 1994, Wei Jianxing said: This  year will be crucial for comprehensively implementing the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and expediting  the establishment of a socialist market economic structure to  bring about the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy. It will also be a year in which we will see  the largest-scale reform measures launched in more than a decade  and in which we will face arduous tasks in reforms, development,  and stability. The new situations will require us to more  steadfastly implement the strategic principle of grasping two  links at the same time, more firmly and thoroughly carry out the  anticorruption drive, and step up the efforts to improve the  style of the party and promote clean government, so as to  provide the conditions and a guarantee for reforms, development,  and stability.    Wei Jianxing pointed out: In line with the Central  Committee's instruction, the overall pattern of the three  anticorruption tasks will remain unchanged but will be enriched  with new content based on the special features of circumstances.    As far as requirements for leading cadres to be honest and  self-disciplined are concerned, leading cadres at and above the  county (division) level in party and government organs must  strictly observe the various regulations formulated by the party  Central Committee and the State Council for improving the  party's style and promoting clean government, and must continue  to unremittingly implement the five regulations on the honesty  and self-discipline of leading cadres formulated by the Central  Committee last year. In addition to these regulations, the  following requirements for this year are listed and reiterated:  1) Nobody is allowed to violate regulations and to buy or  change to imported and luxury cars; or to use one's power to  exchange and borrow cars from subordinate enterprises and units,  or to collect money from them to buy cars; nobody is allowed to  buy cars for leading cadres with loans, money collected from  people, and funds for special projects; county (city) leading  party and government organs and units which still owe wages to  staff members are not allowed to buy cars. 2) Nobody is allowed  to operate counter to the regulations of the State Council on  reforming the housing system and to buy houses at prices lower  than promulgated; or to abuse power to provide preferential  treatment for spouses, children, relatives, or friends to buy  houses; or to decorate private houses lavishly with public  funds. 3) Leading cadres should attend domestic public  activities without fanfare; their accommodations should not  exceed the local criteria for being received; and no special  dance parties should be organized for them. 4) Nobody is allowed  to organize lavish activities and to spend without restraint on  occasions of marriages, funerals, changes of jobs, birthdays,  and moving to new housing, either for oneself or family members.  Using public funds and materials for such activities or earning  money through these occasions are especially forbidden. 5)  Nobody is allowed to abuse power and to refuse to return public  funds; or to buy or build houses with public funds for oneself,  one's relatives and friends, or to engage in profit-making.    In investigating and handling cases, this year attention  should continue to be focused on violations of the law and  discipline by leading party and government organs and their top  officials, by judicial and administrative law-enforcement  departments, and by economic management departments and their  functionaries. Efforts should be concentrated on probing and  handling major and serious cases, paying particular attention to  leading cadres who embezzle, take bribes, or abuse power for  personal gain; and law- and discipline-enforcement personnel who  bend the law to benefit relatives and friends or who take  bribes, or who violate the law and discipline while enforcing  them; as well as to violations of the law and discipline by  corporations. It is necessary to select typical cases and to  publish the results of investigations for the benefit of the  masses so as to improve the social benefits of investigations.    This year we shall focus attention on strengthening  supervision over the work of rectifying unhealthy practices  found in government departments and in trades and professions  and shall vigorously carry out this work. First, we shall  continue to vigorously stop the unwarranted collection of fees.  Meanwhile, we shall earnestly solve the problem of the abuse of  power by party and government organizations and by their working  personnel to requisition enterprises' vehicles, computers, and  communications equipment without making payment for them and to  transfer enterprises' funds under various pretexts to their own  small coffers and to provide services to their staff members and  workers. The unhealthy practice of exacting donations from  enterprises under various pretexts must be stopped resolutely.  We must continue to do a good job of lightening peasants'  burdens. Second, we must continue to rectify the unhealthy  trend of using public funds to go abroad for reasons of tourism,  and we must put an end to going abroad on routine official  business and for routine training. Third, all areas and  departments must continue to make efforts to succeed in handling  the task of rectifying unhealthy trends and to solve one or two  conspicuous problems in a down-to-earth manner. While rectifying  unhealthy trends, we must address the problem by looking into  both its root cause and symptoms; attach importance to studying  how to solve the profound problems involved with the  rectification of unhealthy trends and the consolidation of  discipline; persist in closely integrating the anticorruption  drive with deepening reform, improving the party's style, and  strengthening the building of a clean and honest government; and  persist in closely integrating honesty with industriousness in  the performance of official duties.    Wei Jianxing stressed: This year's task of fighting against  corruption is still arduous. It is very difficult. Party  committees and governments at all levels must conscientiously  strengthen leadership and expend time and effort on guiding the  drive to unfold in depth and on producing concrete results in a  bid to achieve phased successes.    Wei Jianxing pointed out: While paying attention to  successfully launching the anticorruption drive, discipline  inspection organs at all levels must further strengthen  supervision over law enforcement, conscientiously supervise the  implementation of democratic centralism, strictly enforce  political discipline, and ensure the smooth transmission of  government decrees. They must carry out supervision over law  enforcement at focal points and in a planned way by making their  efforts revolve around the implementation of a series of  important policies and measures adopted by the CPC Central  Committee and State Council on deepening reform, developing the  economy, and maintaining stability.    Finally, Wei Jianxing pointed out: This year is important  for our implementation of the resolution adopted by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee to enable  China's economy to maintain a good momentum of development. It  is a crucial year for us to shift the economic system to a new  track. As such, our tasks are very great. The broad masses of  cadres of discipline-inspection organs shoulder a glorious and  sacred mission and face a good opportunity to temper themselves.  They must rally closely around the CPC Central Committee with  Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, surmount difficulties, work  hard, and make positive contributions to more effectively launch  a sustained, in-depth anticorruption drive; to improving the  party's style and strengthening the building of a clean and  honest government; to promoting economic construction, reform,  and opening up; and to maintaining political stability in a  sense of urgent political responsibility and under the guidance  of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as well as of the party's basic line.    CCDI Deputy Secretary Hou Zongbin presided over today's  meeting. Altogether, 103 CCDI members attended the meeting.  Persons in charge of discipline inspection organs in all  provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, all the  departments under the central authorities; the People's  Liberation Army, and armed police forces, together with persons  in charge of relevant departments, attended the meeting as  observers.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Benetton grand prix team changes gear Benetton Formula, the leading grand prix racing team this year, is ending its eight-year partnership with Ford, its engine supplier, in favour of Renault. The French carmaker announced yesterday it had reached agreement to supply Formula One engines to the Benetton team for the next three years starting in 1995. The deal comes only two weeks after the British Williams racing team renewed its contract with Renault to supply engines for three more years. The Renault coup of securing contracts with two of the leading F1 teams is a considerable blow to Ford and to Cosworth Engineering, a subsidiary of Vickers, which builds the engines for Ford. The Benetton team, with its German driver Michael Schumacher, is currently leading the 1994 Formula One world championship having won seven of the season's first 10 races. Despite its success with the Ford Zetec-R V8 engine built by Cosworth, Benetton has decided that its fortunes next year will be enhanced by using the same Renault engines as the Williams team, its arch rival. Mr Flavio Briatore, managing director of Benetton Formula, said he was confident that the new partnership with Renault would 'enhance the performance of both parties.' Renault said that the deals with Benetton and the Williams racing team underlined its resolve to maintain a long-term presence in Formula One. 'The objective is to win grand prix and to be champion of the world,' said Mr Patrick Faure, director of Renault Sport. 'Our presence in Formula One is only justified by winning.' Renault said nothing had been hidden from the Williams team. 'At the beginning they were not very enthusiastic. But they understood our arguments,' the company said. Benetton and Williams would be supplied with identical engines in 1995. The attraction for Renault is to be teamed with Michael Schumacher, who has emerged as the leading Formula One driver this season, ousting Williams from the head of the championship. Ford, which mounts one of the biggest motor sports programmes of any of the world's carmakers, sought last night to put a brave face on the loss of the Benetton contract. Mr Peter Gillitzer, director of Ford Motorsport strategy in Europe, said the company was 'presently reviewing' its plans. 'The success of the Ford Zetec-R engine is unquestioned and it still has substantial development potential. It is a very competitive unit. We are currently talking to a number of people about our future strategy.' Ford Cosworth engines are being used by five teams in this year's championship, including Minardi, Arrows Footwork, Simtek and Larrousse, but the Benetton team is its key contract.</p>

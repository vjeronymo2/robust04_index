			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam and  members of the National Security Council [NSC], agreeing that  international sanctions against North Korea are unavoidable,  discussed measures Wednesday to ensure the country's security.    The Kim administration's first meeting of the National  Security Council was convened by the president, as stipulated by  the Article 91 of the Constitution, in order to handle the North  Korean nuclear row "at the pan-national" level.    The council discussed steps to ensure national security and  the survival of the entire Korean people, government officials  said.    In addition, the government decided to firm up the  cooperative arrangement with the United States, Japan, China and  Russia to resolve the nuclear dispute, they said.    "North Korea has begun changing nuclear fuel rods  one-sidedly, ignoring repeated warnings by the international  community," Kim told the meeting. "The action seriously damaged  the prospects for ascertaining the country's nuclear program."    As a result, sanctions by the U.N. Security Council against  North Korea appear to be unavoidable, Kim said.    "The target of North Korea's nuclear weapons is us," Kim  declared. "We have to stop North Korea from developing them at  any cost."    Moreover, Pyongyang is heightening tension on the Korean  peninsula by threatening to regard U.N. sanctions as a  declaration of war, Kim charged.    "Tension on the Korean peninsula will continue for the time  being," he said.    "Our firm belief is that North Korea should not have even  one-half of a nuclear bomb," the president said. "This is our  position and it cannot be revised."    Asserting that North Korea's unflagging determination to  build nuclear weapons is abnormal, Kim instructed Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae to make sure that the nation's military is  on alert against possible North Korean provocation every minute  of the day.    "The transparency of North Korea's nuclear program has to be  maintained at any cost," Kim said.    "We have to convey our message (to Pyongyang) that we would  never tolerate North Korea's nuclear arms development plan," the  president said.    North Korea, ignoring the new world order, is challenging  the  "conscience of the international community," he said. "But  there is a limit to it (international tolerance)."    "Today's (NSC) meeting is attracting great interest among  our  people," Kim noted. "And the meeting should serve as an  occasion to send a clear signal to North Korea as well."    Kim declared that today's NSC session is different from all  previous security meetings.    One Chongwadae [presidential offices] official said the  Seoul  government has tried to resolve the issue through dialogue, but  now "we have reached a point from where our basic policy toward  North Korea has to change."    In the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku submitted a  report in which he charged that North Korea is skillfully using  the South's efforts to avoid war for the purposes of maintaining  its establishment, fomenting unrest in the South and as a card  in international negotiations.    Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kon-u reported on the position of  each of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council  with regard to sanctions against North Korea.    "The cooperative system between South Korea and the United  States against North Korean moves is firm," the vice minister  said.    Defense Minister Yi analyzed all possible North Korean  military provocations and explained the government's measures to  counter each of them.    Kim Tok, director of the Agency for National Security  Planning, told the meeting that North Korea's economy has  registered "minus growth" in the past four years. It is now  suffering acute food and energy shortages.    Although the Pyongyang government is whipping up war  hysteria, there appear to be no unusual activities, Kim said.    The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok,  Deputy Prime Ministers Chong Chae-sok of the Economic Planning  Board and Yi Hong-ku of the National Unification Board, Home  Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u, Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong  and Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae.    Other officials attending were So Chong-won, first state  minister for political affairs; Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kon-u  on behalf of the foreign minister; director of the Agency for  National Security Planning Kim Tok; chief presidential secretary  Pak Kwan-yong; Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff; Chon Yong-taek, chairman of the Emergency Planning  Committee; Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for  foreign and national security affairs; and presidential  spokesman Chu Ton-sik.</p>

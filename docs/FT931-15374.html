			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: BR sell-off may take a decade - Proposals for railway safety arrangements and pension provisions outlined MR John MacGregor announced more details of the government's rail privatisation proposals yesterday, while appearing to acknowledge for the first time that the process might take at least a decade to complete. Using a Labour-initiated debate to refute recent charges of a rail privatisation U-turn, the transport secretary undertook to implement all 38 recommendations in a Health and Safety Commission report published yesterday, examining the safety implications of the government's plans. Mr MacGregor also announced proposals for a joint industry pension scheme for rail workers to succeed the British Rail arrangement. He said: 'There is not a shred of a policy that is dead and buried and not a shred of a U-turn in this.' But in responding to taunts from Labour backbenchers of 'twelve years', relating to the expected time frame of the recently announced German rail privatisation, Mr MacGregor seemed to concede that reform of the railways in Britain would also be a slow process. 'Our timescale to complete our whole privatisation process will be about the same,' he replied. The transport secretary declined Labour's invitation to give an assurance that no lines would be closed as the proposed reforms took effect. Mr MacGregor said BR's existing safety organisation would be maintained as a unit and transferred to Railtrack, the proposed track authority. He said Railtrack would also be responsible for providing a national timetable. He said the planned joint pensions scheme should not be compulsory for future industry employers for all time but future pension benefits should be no less favourable than in the present scheme. The portion of the current fund relating to railway pensioners would either be set aside and administered separately with no guarantee as to future benefit levels or taken over by the government, which would undertake to pay index-linked pensions. He undertook to publish the main privatisation bill 'just as soon as' the paving legislation secured royal assent 'which I hope will be very soon.' Mr Robert Adley, Tory chairman of the cross-party transport select committee, criticised the government's plans on a number of counts, claiming the bill was on 'a political timetable based on purely electoral considerations. He urged a plan which would end the freight monopoly, then the passenger monopoly, then create integrated railway companies, and introduce private sector capital and management, if appropriate. A buoyant Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, opened proceedings for Labour said privatisation would mean the doubling of fares. The issue at stake was not ownership but the modernisation of the rail system, he said, warning that the cost of the new bureaucracy would be paid by sacking 'professional railwaymen desperately trying to provide a service.' A Labour motion opposing rail privatisation fell by 309 votes to 270, a majority of 39.</p>

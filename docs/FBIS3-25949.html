The development zone and the real estate boom, that emerged  in the province last year, have been brought under control.  Forty-five development zones in the province have been reduced  and 1,000 mu of land occupied by the development zones have been  withdrawn. The trend in which development zones wantonly occupy  and build cultivated areas has basically been brought under  control. In the latter half of last year, the province also  generally straightened out the land occupied by the on-going  projects, carried out the land registration work, and  straightened out the real estate companies of the land  departments. The province has straightened out 18,000 cases  relating to the land occupied by the on-going projects,  investigated and handled 3,000 cases of illegal use of land, and  withdrew 2,070 mu of land. Simultaneously, the system of paid  use of land has been carried out across the province. As of the  end of last year, the rights to using 19,000 mu of state-owned  land were sold and 1.8 billion yuan were earned from this. This  has become the new financial resources for local governments.    Last year, the province cut trees and developed land on  250,000 mu, including 130,000 mu of cultivated areas. This  figure is roughly equal to that of the land for construction.  Thus, the good trend of balancing the increase and the decrease  in the cultivated areas has continuously been maintained.    At the conference, Xiao Zuofu, standing committee member of  the provincial party committee and vice governor of the  provincial government, made a speech entitled "Strengthen Land  Management, Deepen the Reform of the Land Utilization System,  and Accelerate the Inspection of the Land Development Situation."    He set forth: In 1994, we should comprehensively carry out  the paid utilization of the urban state-owned land; and  gradually expand, on a trial basis, the paid utilization of the  rural collective-owned areas. The enterprises that carry out  the shareholding system on a trial basis should embody the  principle of paid use of land. The land for construction use  should gradually be distributed according to the orientation of  the market. The land marketing forms should be dominated by  inviting tenders and auctioning. We should try by every  possible means to reduce the negotiation of land forms.</p>

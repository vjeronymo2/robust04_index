			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / CSO combats leaks of official statistics MINISTERS and officials will have their access to economic data restricted ahead of official release, government statisticians said yesterday. The changes will reduce the number of those who receive figures before publication and the length of time statistics are available to departments in advance of publication. The move, presented as part of the government's drive for greater openness, reflects a desire to boost the integrity and independence of the statistics, which are felt to have suffered from leaks. Even where details of market-sensitive information are not made available, its general tenor can emerge. On Tuesday night, for example, Mr John Major hinted that the official figures for retail sales, published on Wednesday, would confirm a sustained upturn in consumer confidence. Under plans announced by the Central Statistical Office the independent body which issues most government economic statistics, ministers and officials will usually have only 1 1/2 days to view data ahead of publication - instead of up to nine days as at present. In addition, the number of government employees with advance access will be sharply reduced although ministerial access will be less affected. The provisional retail prices index is now given to the chancellor and other officials nine days before publication, and export figures six days before publication. Producer prices figures, which are circulated to nine ministers and 22 officials, are released up to three days before publication. The move marks an attempt to exert tighter control over release of market-sensitive trade and business information. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, agreed the change with Mr Major, and other ministers were informed at cabinet on Thursday. The main initiative has come from the CSO, which has been stung by allegations of leaks and statistical massaging. 'There is certainly a very bad public perception problem,' Mr Bill McLennan, director of the CSO, said yesterday. He said he hoped that the changes would lead government departments to tighten their practices but said the CSO was powerless to force the government to curb leaks. A provisional estimate of GDP will be published 3 1/2 weeks after the end of the quarter - four weeks earlier than at present. The Treasury said yesterday it broadly supported the proposals although they could cause 'mild inconvenience'.</p>

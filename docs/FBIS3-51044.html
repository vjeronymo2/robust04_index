			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Enrique Medeot; copyright by CLARIN: "The Fight </F> To Become the Third Force"]    [Text]  <H5>  Realignment in the Chamber of Deputies </H5>   Playing on the same field with Peronists and Radicals, two  groups are waging a pitched battle to become the standard-bearer  of the third force in the new Chamber of Deputies. They are the  so-called Parliamentary and Provincial factions. The latter has  taken the lead and already won recognition from Chamber  President Alberto Pierri. The third force is the key to making  up a quorum and passing any complex law when Peronists and  Radicals cannot agree.    Maneuvering on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies has  recently risen in intensity, but it is now taking place between  elements that are not part of the majority blocs (the PJ  [Justicialist Party] and UCR [Radical Civic Union). The internal  struggle involves lawmakers of a different stripe belonging to  the so-called Provincial and Parliamentary groups. Both factions  naturally lay claim to the banner of the "third force," a banner  which, whether real or imaginary, may be of some bargaining  value or when it comes time for give-and-take. Such an occasion  will present itself whenever there are unresolvable differences  between Justicialists and Radicals.    The Provincial Group has taken the lead and was clearly  recognized by the government when all of its members went as a  nice little group to talk--over lunch--with Minister of Interior  Carlos Ruckauf. The ministry dining room played host to 12  lawmakers with a mandate from parties that generally have  complete control of their respective provincial governments.    Together they represent the interests of the People's  Movements of Neuquen, Tierra del Fuego, and Jujuy, joined by the  Salta Renewal Party, the Chaco Action Party, and the Bloquista  Party of San Juan. Furthermore, the Provincial Group already has  officers, who were introduced to Chamber of Deputies President  Alberto Pierri. They are: Jorge Folloni (Renewal Party), Enrique  Sanchez Galdeano (Tierra del Fuego), and Carlos Gomez Centurion.    The Parliamentary Group includes deputies from the  Progressive Democratic Party, the Liberal Party of Corrientes,  the Autonomist Party, the Democratic Party of Mendoza, the San  Juan Renewal Crusade Party, the Republican Force of Tucuman, and  the Integration and Development and Jujuy People's Movements.    Are the people of Jujuy putting their eggs in both baskets?  Indeed they are, in this case because the two deputies belonging  to the bloc are engaged in a petty quarrel with no solution in  sight: Cristina Guzman vs Pedro Figueroa, the latter preferring  to align himself with the Provincial Group.    The Parliamentary Group says the UCD deputies are all  united.  At least they claim that Alvaro Alsogaray, German Kammerath  Gordillo, and Jose Maria Ibarbia have more or less given their  word. They look askance at Francisco de Duranona y Vedia,  however, labeling him--no value judgment intended--as a true  Menemist lawyer.    At one time, they were all part of the Center Interbloc.  Actually, the Interbloc never got any further than good  intentions because, when it came time to vote in the Chamber,  each one heeded his own interests, which were often political!    For example, Renewer Folloni maintains that he came to the  Provincial Group naturally: "The Interbloc never developed any  united action." More specifically, he recalls that those now  aligning themselves with the other band hobbled government  proposals, as in the case of laws privatizing the YPF  [Government Oil Deposits], the State Gas Company, and social  security reform.    Pierri has recognized the Provincial Group as the third  force. At least this is the general impression left by the last  two sessions, during which its representatives spoke third,  following the Peronists and the Radicals. It should be noted,  however, that they reject the idea of making up a true bloc.    No matter how the lead has changed hands, the Parliamentary  Group has not stood idly by. Authorized spokesmen say its  members are well organized and that "things are going quite  well." They also claim to be willing to act independently of the  Radicals and Peronists in the Chamber, adding that the one thing  they have in common is their agreement on the government's  program. Emerging as standard-bearers of the group are Ricardo  Leconte (Liberal from Corrientes) and Progressive Democrat  Alberto Natale.    Commenting on the Provincial maneuvering, members of the  opposing faction could not resist: "They thought we would not be  able to respond. The Provincial Group thought they would have a  majority, but it took only a weekend to fix everything."  Actually, it will take a few--but not many--more sessions to see  how it all turns out in the movie about those who are trying to  take advantage of the differences between Justicialists and  Radicals. In the meantime, the two sides will continue to eye  one another with distrust.  <H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5> <H5>  A Matter of Numbers </H5>   The two factions fighting over the title of "third force" in  the Chamber of Deputies are well aware that the "weakness" of  the Justicialists resides precisely in the fact that they do not  have the quorum they need to force their political position on  the Chamber with ease.    The members of the Provincial and Parliamentary factions  base  their hopes on the fact that, when the time comes, the  Justicialists will be forced to seek their support when the  Radicals and other parties resist passage of a proposal dear to  the ruling party.    The Justicialist Party has 128 deputies of its own, one less  than a quorum and the majority needed to get a law passed.  However, in practice, the justifiable absences and inexcusable  cuts of deputies mean that the number drops to unacceptable  levels.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Balance of Power                                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PJ                                    |128                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |UCR                                   |81                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Provincial Group*                     |12                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Parliamentary Group*                  |17                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Others**                              |19                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Quorum                                |129                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* Both groups were part of the so-called Interbloc.                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |** Includes the Broad Front, Socialist Unity, MODIN [Movement for Dignity an-|  |d Independence], and the Intransigent Party.                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

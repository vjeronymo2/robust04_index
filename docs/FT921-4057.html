			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Industry Investors will be hard pressed to draw up a long or convincing list of stock market winners. The lack of any change in the capital allowances regime disappointed some expectations, while apparently generous reductions in the uniform business rate and concessions to the motor industry are likely to have only a marginal effect. The UBR, for instance, raises Pounds 14bn-Pounds 15bn a year for local authorities, which puts Mr Lamont's Pounds 480m giveaway for 1992-93 into context. Brewers and distillers, hotels, and retailers - whose assets are predominantly land and buildings - will be obvious beneficiaries. But the chancellor's hope that the property market can be unlocked with the help of transitional relief for new occupiers looks wishful thinking. Smaller, nursery style, units may well receive a boost but the main problem for the property sector remains one of chronic oversupply. Property shares have been ravaged in the last year, but they still look vulnerable if bad poll news were badly to unsettle the gilts market. The stimulus to the motor trade, meanwhile, was largely as predicted, though Lucas followers should be pleased by the surprise decision to calculate car scale charges by reference to the value of the vehicle rather than its engine size. The car tax reduction should at least tempt consumers who have deferred purchases, though much will depend on how far it is passed on. Elsewhere, there is some comfort to be drawn from the long-term commitment to address the problem of advance corporation tax, to fight the good fight for Scotch whisky and cider makers in Brussels, and to improve payment terms for sub-contractors. The imaginative requirement that companies publish how quickly they pay their bills in annual reports, indeed, may be one of this Budget's more enduring legacies for the City. Smug boasts about 30 days sounds like the signal for a stockbroker's Sell.</p>

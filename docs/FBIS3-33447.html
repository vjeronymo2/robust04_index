			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Asuncion ABC COLOR in Spanish on 22  February publishes on page 6 a 700-word article by Carlos  Mariano Godoy and Noelia Villalba describing a police clash with  peasants near Simon Bolivar, in Caaguazu Department.    The authors say that "several peasants were beaten with  truncheons and four policemen were injured with stones" during a  confrontation between the departmental National Police and  peasants closing Highway 3. The article says the peasants were  protesting for better prices for their products and against the  arrest last week of some peasants in Campos Morombi, San Pedro  Department.    The article states: "About 50 policemen arrived in the area  at 1045 and disbanded the demonstrators occupying the highway  without using any type of arms." However, the peasants began  throwing stones when police removed tree trunks from the  roadway. Police then reacted and beat some of the peasants with  truncheons. The peasants, however, closed the road again soon  afterward and threw stones at some passing vehicles.    The authors say the impasse continued until Caaguazu  Governor  Mario Soto Estigarribia and national Deputy Silvio Ovelar came  to talk with the peasants, promising to address their grievances  and to arrange a meeting with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy.    The authors say peasant leader Jose Ruiz Diaz addressed his  fellow peasants, saying: "We will leave the highway now and go  home to take our arms in order to get ready for tomorrow,"  because if President Wasmosy does not agree to our demands "we  will close the highway again" and "we will fight the police with  the same weapons they use against us."</p>

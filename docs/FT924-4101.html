			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: K mart sales down but Wal-Mart does better AFTER two encouraging months, US retailers yesterday reported a diverse sales picture for November. The figures cast fresh doubts over the Christmas season - reported to be off to a good start after Thanksgiving - and caused retail stocks generally to ease on Wall Street. Among the biggest retailers, K mart, which takes in specialty chains and a discount store operation, saw total same-store sales fall by 1.1 per cent in November. This masked a 2.3 per cent decline in general merchandise, partly offset by a similar rise in the specialty store division. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer in sales terms, also reported more modest sales growth. Same-store sales were up by 7 per cent, which compares with double-digit growth rates seen by the Arkansas-based retailer for much of this year. Same-store sales growth for the first 10 months of the fiscal year was 12 per cent. Woolworth was another loser, with comparable domestic sales falling by 1.1 per cent, while - among the specialist retailers - The Gap reported an increase of just 1 per cent in same-store sales last month. More positively, Sears, Roebuck posted a 5.1 per cent gain in same-store domestic sales. Some major department store groups also fared well: Federated, saw a 5.3 per cent increase in November same-store sales, Neiman Marcus saw a 7.5 per cent rise, and May Department Stores enjoyed a 3.6 per cent advance. At JC Penney, there was a 5.1 per cent gain.</p>

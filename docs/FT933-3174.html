			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Observer: Bock and tackle Lord Palumbo says his father gave him a maxim, which was 'only do one thing well'. This may explain the chairman of the Arts Council's 35-year obsession to redevelop the site adjacent to the Bank of England. Now joining Palumbo in the parade ground of Mansion House square is Dieter Bock, joint chief executive of Lonrho, whose own property company is putting money into the scheme. Bock's father probably passed on a different motto. Recently hard at work refocusing Lonrho in tandem with his Tiny Rowland, Bock is perhaps trying to do many things well. Lonrho remains the priority, he says, but his assertion that his involvement in Palumbo's project would only occupy a couple of days a year touched Palumbo's perfectionist streak. How could Bock resist straying on to the site each day, given he passes it en route to Lonrho HQ in Cheapside?</p>

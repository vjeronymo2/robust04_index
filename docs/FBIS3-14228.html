			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Major General Dani Yatom, commander of the Central  Command, has said that the operation in Hebron is still under  way and that the search of the house in which the terrorists  entrenched themselves is not yet over. He said that in the  course of the battle he spotted the bodies of three terrorists  through his binoculars, while another soldier reported that he  had killed a terrorist on the first evening of the battle.    Maj. Gen. Yatom added that the troops are operating  carefully  to avoid hitting local inhabitants and exposing IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] soldiers to unnecessary danger. He pointed out  that antitank rockets were only fired at the building occupied  by the terrorists. He further told our correspondent Moti Amir  that the three soldiers who were lightly injured two days ago  had been hit when a soldier accidentally dropped his machine gun.    [A report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin on page A2  of  Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 24 March adds that Maj. Gen.  Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of IDF troops in the West Bank, and  Colonel Me'ir Kalifi, commander of the Hebron Brigade, were  wounded in the operation yesterday. Mufaz, who commanded the  operation, was injured "very lightly," while Kalifi sustained  "light" injuries. Both of them were hit by shrapnel ricocheting  from a door frame. The report goes on to say that a total of  seven soldiers were lightly injured in the operation by bullets  and shrapnel.]    Gen. Yatom went on to say that none of the terrorists turned  themselves in despite repeated pleas by Hebron notables.</p>

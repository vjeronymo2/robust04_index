			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Leonid Kotov, Vladimir </F> Shvedov]    [Text] New Delhi 19 April, TASS -- Ukraine and India are  prepared to contribute to the strengthening of peace and  cooperation in South Asia, jointly seek universal and complete  nuclear disarmament and to eliminate existing hot beds of  tension through political means, this was underscored during  talks today between Prime Minister of India P.V. Narasimha Rao  and Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko who is here on an  offical visit.    The head of the Ukrainian foreign affairs department  expressed support for India's fight for strengthening its  national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Zlenko  emphasised that Indian leadership's stand for the destruction of  all nuclear arsenals in conformation with the plan of action for  the creation of a nuclear- free world, which was worked out by  former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, is regarded with  understanding in Kiev.    P.V. Narasimha Rao expressed support for practical steps  taken by Ukraine to achieve non-nuclear status. The head of the  Indian Government highly appreciated Kiev's contribution to  strengthen stability in the world and the development of equal  and partner-like relations between all members of the world  community. The two sides reaffirmed their interest in the  continuation of consultations between the two countries on  questions of bilateral and international issues on a permanent  basis.    The same day Zlenko held talks with Indian Foreign Minister  Dinesh Singh. It was stressed during the meeting that India  attaches great importance to relations with Ukraine which bear a  progressive character, especially in the sphere of economics.  Dinesh Singh, in particular, expressed India's readiness to  provide necessary assistance to Ukraine in the implementation of  its wide- ranging economic reform programmes and transition  towards a market economy.    India and Ukraine signed today agreements on setting up a  Ukrainian-Indian intergovernmental commission for trade,  economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation, a  protocol on consultations between Foreign Ministries of the two  countries and other documents.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Company anger at results penalties Companies House, the government's corporate information depository, is still receiving more than 1,000 calls a week about its late-filing penalty regime, Andrew Jack writes. It has handled 65,000 disputes since the regime was introduced in July 1992, Mr David Durham, chief executive, told the Commons committee on the parliamentary commissioner for administration. Mr Durham admitted that the volume of calls and letters was greater than the levels he had anticipated. Mr William Reed, the parliamentary commissioner - or ombudsman - said he had completed examinations of two cases concerning Companies House in 1993 and a further six were still under investigation. His report on one case - which led to Companies House paying compensation and costs of Pounds 2,500 - referred to 'a chain of errors' from the agency. Mr James Pawsey, Conservative chairman of the committee, said: 'There seems to be a serious problem. This is an extraordinary number of complaints.' Following changes to company law in 1989, Companies House began imposing fines with a minimum of Pounds 100 for businesses failing to file their annual accounts on time. To date, 164,000 penalties have been imposed on companies, generating fines of Pounds 33m, which are remitted to the Treasury. The annual administrative cost of running the late penalty regime is Pounds 1.3m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Canada has warned the Bosnian Government that it  might withdraw its peacekeepers. Prime Minister Jean Chretien  says Canada will scale back or cancel its peacekeeping effort if  there is no progress toward peace or if the arms embargo on  Bosnia is lifted. Mr. Chretien made the warning yesterday while  visiting Canadian peacekeeping troops in Visoko, Bosnia. Canada  has 800 soldiers there and another 1,100 in neighboring Croatia.    Mr. Chretien and other Western leaders discussed troop  withdrawal earlier this week during D-Day ceremonies in France.  He said a final decision on the peacekeeping force will be made  in September when the Canadian peacekeeping mission expires.    The prime minister arrived home to Ottawa today after making  the first ever visit to a war zone by a serving Canadian prime  minister. Meanwhile, a one-month UN-sponsored cease-fire in  Bosnia has gone into effect.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / US banks cut prime rates to 8 1/2% BIG US banks cut their prime lending rates by half a point to 8 1/2 per cent yesterday amid mildly encouraging economic news and a prediction by Mr Michael Boskin, chief White House economist, that 'the economy is about to turn around'. The reduction in the benchmark lending rate, led by Morgan Guaranty, the New York bank, came in quick response to Tuesday's easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve when it cut the discount rate by half a percentage point to 5 1/2 per cent. President George Bush reiterated his view that the recession would be neither long nor deep. He said falling interest rates would stimulate growth. The cut in prime rates, the third in the past year, should reduce the cost of many consumer and corporate loans. The banks' move was appreciated on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 42.33 points higher at 2,930.20. Bond prices and the dollar were also firmer. The White House was cheered by several economic reports released yesterday. The latest 'Beige Book' - the Fed's regional survey of economic trends - said activity remained weak in much of the nation but there were 'some indications that the decline may be bottoming out'. The survey noted stable or improving conditions in manufacturing industry in many areas and pointed to signs of revival in residential real estate markets. The Commerce Department said the composite index of leading indicators - the main guide to future turning points in the economy - rose 0.5 per cent in March to register its second consecutive monthly increase. Index rises usually precede economic recoveries by about three months. Indicators measuring the industrial economy's strength, however, continued to point to recession.

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (9): Important to go upmarket - Tony Hawkins notes that EPZ growth has slowed to a crawl AFTER five years, during which growth in the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) averaged a remarkable 26 per cent, manufacturing in Mauritius can no longer claim to be the leading sector of the economy. Indeed, in the last three years, EPZ growth has slowed to a crawl - at least by Mauritian standards - with its output rising by a very respectable 6 per cent a year. The slowdown reflects a combination of demand and supplyside factors. On the supply side, full employment, higher inflation and reduced investment has undermined growth. At the same time, demand in the island's crucial European markets has been hit both by the recession and by intensified competition. Export growth, which averaged 35 per cent in the mid-1980s, is down to single-digit levels, though the EPZ's export role continues to grow in importance and it now accounts for 63 per cent of total export earnings. Investment in manufacturing in the last two years fell below the levels of the late 1980s, but this has been partly offset by the marked improvement in labour productivity. Productivity in the EPZ, fell more than 20 per cent in the early 1980s as employment grew far faster than output. It has since recovered strongly, increasing 20 per cent since 1988. This is an encouraging development - and one which suggests that Mauritius employers are responding to their eroding margins by squeezing extra output from the island's workforce. Indeed, between 1987 and 1991 value-added per worker in the free zone increased 27 per cent. Opinion is divided on the future of what has become the model for export-led growth in Africa. Since 1987, Mauritian ministers and business leaders have been pushing for diversification out of clothing and textiles; two industries which, between them, account for 85 per cent of EPZ production. Their efforts are directed towards diversifying into jewellery (whose current output share is 3.5 per cent), watches, optical goods (5 per cent), leather goods and electronics. But there is a growing feeling that Mauritian exporters should focus on moving upmarket in the clothing industry rather than seeking to develop new sources of competitive advantage. Mr Jean Claud de l'Estrac, the industry minister, says that while he favours diversification, 'the choice is not ours to make.' He has a foot in either camp, arguing for the modernisation of the clothing sector so that it can exploit its experience to advantage, and its present foothold in world markets. 'By global standards, we are still a low-cost producer of textiles,' he says, adding that the textile sector has a future so long as it adapts to changing conditions at home and abroad. There is general agreement that urgent action is essential; a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks would, within a decade, torpedo the EPZ's largest single export, the T-shirt industry, which would lose its preferential edge relative to other third world manufacturers in the European market. EPZ exports totalled MR12.1bn last year. Of these, France took almost 29 per cent of the total, Britain 16.5 per cent, and Germany 16.3 per cent. The island's only significant non-European Community market is the US, which buys 16.6 per cent of EPZ exports. But there is no consensus in Mauritius on precisely where the EPZ should now be heading for. Some, such as Mr Arif Currimjee of the Bonair clothing group, one of the zone's top quality players, argues that there is scope to expand value-added very considerably by focusing more on design and marketing skills, seeking competitive advantage through differentiation rather than cost leadership. His company has achieved a 70 per cent value-added factor compared with an EPZ average of only 32 per cent. Furthermore, he highlights the need for closeness to the market. Bonair has a Paris office from which it monitors Euro-market trends in fashion design and retailing - pointing to the shortening of product life cycles and lead times, and the need for greater production flexibility. Others are approaching the problem by a different route. The Floreal group, which alone accounts for a tenth of EPZ exports, and is the world's second largest manufacturer of Woolmark garments after Benetton of Italy, went offshore in 1989, opening a factory in nearby Madagascar which currently produces 30 per cent of its woolmark items. Floreal, a middle-market player which will be hard hit by the abolition of the MFA, is investing heavily in new technologies. Like Bonair, it emphasises the need for greater flexibility, shorter production runs and, above all, improved quality. But quality gains are difficult against a background of full employment. Similarly, the days of a single-shift textile production, with expensive capital equipment lying idle for 12 hours and more, are gone. Mr Daniel Giraud, chief executive of Floreal, echoing a pervasive theme evident in almost all sectors of the economy, stresses the need for a new and different culture, both on the part of workers and management. Some Mauritian policymakers believe the EPZ's longer-term future lies in a consolidated, though smaller clothing and textiles sector, alongside electronics, watches, leather and optical goods manufacturers. The establishment of an informatics park, which is scheduled to open by the end of 1993, and the rejuvenation of the EPZ development authority, spearheaded by entrepreneurs from the private sector, underline official determination to regain the EPZ momentum of the mid-1980s. But whatever the disagreement on the extent of diversification versus consolidation, there is unanimity on one aspect. That is the need to move upmarket, reducing dependence on cost-leadership 'commodity' products, such as pullovers and T-shirts, and developing new expertise in high-tech capital-intensive operations.</p>

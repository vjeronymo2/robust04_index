			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Austrian power group lifts hydro-electric output Verbundgesellschaft, Austria's largest electricity and power group, has reported a 30 per cent rise in profits for 1993, but will keep its dividend unchanged at 16 per cent. Group pre-tax profits were Sch1.51bn (Dollars 129m) compared with Sch1.15bn in 1992. Sales rose slightly from Sch19.4bn in 1992 to Sch19.5bn last year. Mr Johann Haider, chief executive, said results were boosted by favourable climatic conditions that helped raise hydro-electricity output and reduce imports. He added that prospects for 1994 looked good, with hydro-electricity output rising by 17 per cent in the first quarter. The company which is 51 per cent state-owned, plans further rationalisations to improve efficiency. The 5,300 workforce will be cut by 700-800 by the end of 1997. It has requested authorisation from the government to raise electricity prices by 6 per cent, but this is still under review. It plans to invest Sch5.8bn from cash flow this year, following investments of Sch4.1bn in 1993.</p>

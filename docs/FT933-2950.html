			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Technology: A robot that makes the coffee Science fiction often features machines which respond obediently to orders barked out by humans. In the imaginary world, robots fetch slippers, cook dinner and perform the role of high-technology 'slaves'. A robot which can perform complex tasks still exists only in the realm of dreams, but scientists say we may not be far from the day when we can wake up, shout out 'Temperature 72`F] Coffee-maker on] Toaster on]' and get up 15 minutes later to a warm house, fresh coffee and breakfast. What might make this dream reality is the development of 'voice-recognition' technology, which enables machines to understand spoken commands. Bringing voice-activated devices to the mass market is the mission of Voice Powered Technology. The group already produces a VCR programmer which operates by voice command, and will launch another speech-activated device, a 'date-reminder', in the autumn. Just how many people will prefer to use their voice instead of their fingers in operating home appliances is not yet certain, but the new VCR programmer has caught the attention of Philips Consumer Electronics. The US subsidiary of the Dutch electronics giant has contracted with Voice Powered Technology to use the voice-activated programming device in two of its Magnavox VCR models, and as a stand-alone remote control accessory. 'An overwhelming number of consumers still have trouble programming their VCRs,' says Jim Newbrough, vice-president of marketing at Philips, 'and the use of voice enables us to differentiate our products.' The VCR programmer prompts the user by flashing questions on the television screen. In response to the question 'Which?', for instance, the user would say a number. The user can also make the programmer skip over commercials in a recording by saying 'Zap it]' The 'date-reminder' device, which will come out this autumn, works in the following manner: the user says a phrase such as 'Don't forget to call John Doe, Monday at 9.00 am'. The date-reminder recognises the words Monday and 9.00 am, and records the rest of the message. On Monday at nine, the machine will beep and spit out the recording. The technology used in these devices is relatively simple. The video programmer, for instance, has a vocabulary of just 31 words. Both are operated by an eight-bit microprocessor, instead of the heavy digital signal processor that most voice-recognition technology relies on. 'This enabled us to offer the product as a battery-operated device,' says Jerry Gutterman, of Voice Powered Technology. The group hopes the simplicity of its technology will allow it to be applied to a number of domestic appliances. 'We are taking voice-recognition to the masses,' says Gutterman, 'and this technology can be applied to a number of products, including CD players, coffee machines and microwaves.' The day a machine can be commanded to cook a meal may not be so far off, after all.</p>

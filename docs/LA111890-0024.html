			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> BOINGO BOOMERANG: After six years (and four albums) at MCA Records, L.A. fave  Oingo Boingo is leaving the label and looking for greener pastures. Expect an  avid bidding war for the popular local band, which is already being courted by  Epic Associates and Charisma Records.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Boingo leader Danny Elfman, Hollywood's reigning movie-score wizard,  is putting the finishing touches on his score for Tim Burton's upcoming film,  "Edward Scissorhands." And thanks to MCA Records, you can now hear Elfman's  greatest film-score hits. Titled "Danny Elfman: Music For a Darkened Theatre,"  the new compilation (due out this week) features excerpts from such movie  themes as "Batman," "Dick Tracy," "Pee Wee's Big Adventure," "Dark Man,"  "Beetlejuice" and "Midnight Run." The package also offers previously unreleased  material from "Scrooged" and such TV projects as "The Simpsons," "Tales From  the Crypt" and "The Jar," a Tim Burton-directed episode from "Alfred Hitchcock  Presents."  </P></p>

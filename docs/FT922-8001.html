			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: No early decision on Macmillan disposal PLANS FOR the disposal of Macmillan and Official Airline Guides will not be determined before June, creditors to Maxwell Communication Corporation were told yesterday. A group of 200 creditors overwhelmingly endorsed proposals for the future changes at MCC in their first meeting since the group went into administration under UK insolvency law last December. Mr Mark Homan, a partner with accountants Price Waterhouse and one of the joint administrators, told 200 creditors at the Cafe Royal in London that he was considering legal action against past and present directors of MCC. He said two further small European subsidiaries will be sold in the next few weeks. Nimbus, the Wales-based manufacturer of compact disks, is to be sold by the end of this month, and Panini, an Italian manufacturer of stickers, by early June. The administrators, in consultation with JP Morgan, the merchant bank appointed recently to advise them, had not yet decided how to sell Macmillan and Official Airline Guides, Mr Homan said. They are still trying to decide whether to use two large sales, dispose of the underlying assets of the two groups piecemeal, or reorganise the group and distribute their shares to creditors. Asked about possible legal action, he said investigations on the recovery of 'mis-applied' assets were continuing. 'We are not ruling out legal action but it is too early to say who we would be taking action against.' There are about 3,000 creditors and 7,000 bondholders to MCC, owed a total of Pounds 1.5bn. A five-strong creditors' committee was formed at the meeting, comprising representatives from the Bank of Novia Scotia, Chase Manhattan, Credit Lyonnais, Fuji Bank, and Bayerische Vereinsbanke - which represents a number of bondholders.</p>

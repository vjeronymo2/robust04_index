			<p>BFN     [Text] RIGA, Apr 07, BNS - Latvian Prime Minster Valdis  Birkavs downplayed Russia's allegation that the mentioning of  Latvia among the projected 30 locations for Russian "near  abroad" military bases was merely "a technical mistake."    "Such technical mistakes almost never occur in the world,"  Birkavs told BNS. Consequently, the motion should be a  deliberate action, he noted.    Moreover, the interpretation of the incident does not affect  the Latvian stance, the premier stressed.    "Russia has unveiled plans to establish military bases here.  Latvia needs additional guarantees from Russia and from other  countries that the bases will not be set up," Birkavs added.    "The issue of deployment of any Russian bases on the  territory of Latvia is not being raised and does not exist,"  Yeltsin's spokesman, Vecheslav Kostikov, said in a formal  statement, according to The Associated Press.    Birkavs predicted that the incident would show the world  community how real the threats to the Latvian security are and  how much the Baltic country needs international security  guarantees.    Simultaneously, Birkavs conceded that no country or  organization was likely to assume for responsibility for  Latvia's security in the near future. It is a gradual process in  which Latvia is trying to integrate by safeguarding its  security, first of all, itself, the prime minister said.    Defense Minister Valdis Birkavs told BNS that Yeltsin's  resolution was tailored to find out Latvia's views. Russia  stepped back after it sensed the sharp counter reaction, he  said. Similar tactics has become traditional for Russia,  Pavlovskis said.    Russia has said several months ago that it, like the United  States, needs military bases abroad but Latvia was never before  enclosed in the list of "eligible countries."</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Perrier It looks as if the Agnelli family has fallen foul of the French establishment after all in its attempt to take over Perrier. The fact that Perrier may instead go to a Swiss company is apparently secondary. The Agnelli decision a few weeks ago to make a full bid for Exor, the holding company which controls Perrier, was an attempt to mollify powerful minority shareholders like Banque Indosuez. Now that Suez has joined forces with Nestle in a rival but direct bid for Perrier, such displays of politeness are presumably over. It is hard to see Saint Louis, which bought a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier at the start of the year and was until yesterday an Agnelli ally, turning down a capital gain estimated at more than Pounds 40m. Whether the Agnellis then accept the Nestle/Suez offer and realise their own capital gain remains to be seen. But the Italian family's ambitions in the European food industry have suffered an embarrassing setback. Arguably the eminence grise of the whole affair is BSN, which stands to gain the Volvic brand as its price for helping to deliver Perrier to Nestle. The Agnellis could perhaps make trouble by pursuing their previous desire to increase their stake in BSN. But that would doubtless involve a battle with the French establishment as well. Unless Brussels intervenes, the clear winner is Nestle, which has emerged as a master of European takeover strategy. It presumably intends eventually to buy out Suez and run Perrier for itself. As with its bid for Rowntree four yearsago, it appears to have outflanked the opposition when it looked as if the game was up.</p>

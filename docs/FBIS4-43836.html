			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Aho's EU Line Won a Clear </F> Victory"]    [Excerpts] Jyvaskyla -- The Aho government's line on the  European Union [EU] issue received clear support at the Center  Party congress in Jyvaskyla yesterday. A vote of 1,607 against  834 approved a resolution, which means that the government can  continue to work on the EU process that is aiming at EU  membership from the beginning of next year. [passage omitted]    At a news conference afterward Prime Minister Esko Aho  himself said that the figures were not dramatic. They  correspond to the relative strengths that were to be found in  the party delegation and the Riksdag group when the Center Party  decided to support an EC membership application just over two  years ago, he said.    The result means that the authority to sign the EU agreement  can be granted tomorrow without a government crisis and also  that Esko Aho does not need to carry out his threat to resign as  party chairman.    The resolution does not mean that the congress gave its  express support to EU membership. It expressed its support for  Esko Aho's government and its line on the EU question. [passage  omitted]    However, the speech that attracted most attention yesterday  was not by Aho but by Paavo Vayrynen who lost the vote and  consequently suffered a new loss of prestige. Vayrynen  explained why he does not approve of the EU agreement.    "It was a major strategic mistake to approve so poor a  negotiated package. An even bigger -- fateful -- mistake will  be made if the Center Party congress approves this agreement  here today," Vayrynen said.    He said that the congress is of crucial importance.    "If this congress allows the EU train to travel onward to  the  granting of approval for the authority to sign the agreement, to  a referendum, and to discussion by the Eduskunta it will be  almost impossible to stop it any longer," he said.

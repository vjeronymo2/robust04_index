			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Management: In pursuit of a lean machine There is increasing worry in Britain about the effect of low levels of education and training - employers are often criticised for not spending enough on training compared with their German counterparts. Yet a new US study* suggests some of this criticism may be misplaced. The study of productivity in 56 car plants owned by 24 companies around the world reaches a surprising conclusion: that European car workers may be over-educated. It finds that European workers are better trained than American ones, yet are still far less productive. The authors argue that European car plants are not managed well enough according to the principles of flexible - or lean - production to make the best use of their well-educated workforce. Conversely, US plants are relatively good at extracting value from poorly-prepared workers. 'European plants appear unable to exploit the potential of their relatively well-educated and highly-trained workforce,' concludes the study by academics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On a training index which ranged from 1 for very little training to 4 for a lot, Japanese plants in Japan scored the highest at 3.6. Japanese-owned plants in the US scored 3.5, while European plants scored 2.9, and US-owned plants in the US scored only 2.3. Japanese plants in Japan were better organised for lean production, making more use of techniques such as team working and just-in-time inventory control. They scored 83 on a flexibility index of 0 to 100, compared with 39 for US plants in the US, and 35 for European plants. But although the US plants scored poorly on these measures, they were considerably more productive than European ones. *Does the US Underinvest in Human Resources?; By John Paul MacDuffie and Thomas Kochan (unpublished).

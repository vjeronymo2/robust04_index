			<p>BFN     [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk told newsmen after the  Ukrainian parliament closed session in Kiev, that both a Russian  and Ukrainian presence in Sevastopol offered the best solution  for the problem of the Black Sea Fleet.    However, Kravchuk felt the Russian and Ukrainian vessels  must  use different naval facilities. The Ukrainian fleet could be  based in Balaklava.    Kravchuk said he kept in touch with the Ukrainian delegation  to the Sevastopol negotiations. He said the Russian and  Ukrainian Defense ministers had agreed on a formula for the  solution of the existing problems on the basis of the Yalta,  Zavidovo and Massandra decisions.    In Kravchuk's view, both the Russian and Ukrainian fleets  must make use of Sevastopol's repair docks given that 82 percent  of the Black Sea's infrastructure is in that city.    If, however, the two Defense ministers failed to reach  agreement, Kravchuk said he would meet to resolve the problem  with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin. The problem of the  Black Sea Fleet is to be resolved at any cost, said Kravchuk.</p>

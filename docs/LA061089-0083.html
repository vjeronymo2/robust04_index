			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DR. RUTH' TO HOST TALK SHOW FOR TEEN-AGERS  </P> <P> Dr. Ruth Westheimer, who has been dispensing sexual advice to adults for years,  is now going to host a cable-TV talk show for teen-agers.  </P> <P> "Sex is not the main thrust," Westheimer said of the weekly series that debuts  today at noon on the Lifetime channel. "What I'm really after is a celebration  and an exploration of the teen-age years. . . . I hope adults watch it: They  are going to learn how great our young people are despite the pressures."  </P> <P> The main purpose of "What's Up, Dr. Ruth?," she said, is to help teen-agers  overcome the conflicts and questions they encounter during their often intense  and confusing adolescence.  </P> <P> "Adolescence is a very stressful period," Westheimer said. "Many (teen-agers)  experience the height of their sex drive, and they have anxiety about what to  do with their lives."  </P> <P> It's a new twist for the internationally known psychosexual therapist, who in  the past has directed her sexual advice to adults through a variety of outlets,  including her now defunct radio show "Sexually Speaking," the TV series "Good  Sex!," the board game "Terrific Sex" and her most recent book, "Sex and  Morality: Who Is Teaching Our Sex Standards?"  </P> <P> She is no stranger to teen-agers, however: In last year's Heroes of Young  America poll of 8th- through 12th-graders, the 61-year-old Dr. Ruth was named  favorite female news maker.  </P> <P> She said her own children -- Mariam, 32, and Joel, 25, whom she raised alone  for about six years before she married Fred Westheimer -- played a large part  in preparing her to host a teen show.  </P> <P> The sex talk in her new show, the German-born therapist claimed, will be  mitigated by an exploration into a wide variety of subjects -- from how  teen-agers cope with living in broken families to steroid abuse and the  pressures they face trying to achieve high scores on their college entrance  exams.  </P> <P> Lifetime says it has not heard from anyone complaining because it was using a  sex therapist to host a show for teen-agers.  </P> <P> "We feel the program is providing a valuable service to today's teens and a  forum for their special concerns," senior vice president Pat Fili said.  "Parents can actively use the program as a starting point for conversations  with their teen-aged children. We support the program wholeheartedly and do not  feel that it is offensive."  </P> <P> On the first of the 26 shows that Lifetime has ordered, Dr. Ruth will talk  about how teens and their parents react to heavy-metal music. Members of the  heavy-metal band "Anthrax" will be on hand, along with their mothers, to  discuss their music.  </P> <P> "How does a mother react when her child joins a heavy-metal band?" Westheimer  asked. "I probably would hit the roof, but the parents (on the show) said they  know they have to leave some freedom to the kids."  </P> <P> Though guests will occasionally appear, she said, the series will consist for  the most part of discussions among the teen-agers in the audience.  </P> <P> On next Saturday's program, Westheimer focuses on peer pressure, discussing  with the audience how to respond to sexual pressure on dates, the differences  between sex and love, and roles in relationships.  </P> <P> "I don't have the answers," she said. "I just raise the issues. . . . Well,  maybe I have some answers."  </P> <P> She said that her stand on abortion, for example, will never change: "Abortion  must remain legal. Especially for kids who can't afford to fly to Europe. I  don't believe in it as a contraceptive, but when there is a contraceptive  failure, the decision should be left up to the individual."  </P> <P> Another public stand she has taken is the matter of premarital sex: She said  she believes in it only in loving and committed relationships.  </P> <P> Westheimer said that she is not worried that young viewers with emotional  problems might be left hanging at show's end: "If they are truly unhappy, I  stress ongoing therapy," she explained. "I tell them to go and look for help."  </P></p>

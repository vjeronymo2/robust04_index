			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Royal Mail sale set to go ahead: Heseltine announces plans to sell off majority stake in postal service The government appears set to go ahead with legislation to privatise the Royal Mail in next year's parliamentary session after Tory backbenchers gave a broad welcome yesterday to proposals for the sale. The proposal to sell off 51 per cent of the state postal service is contained in a green paper published yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. If enacted, the legislation would lead to the largest privatisation since the sale last year of the government's remaining stake in British Telecommunications. The sale, which may raise more than Pounds 1bn, would probably take place in 1996, in the run-up to the next general election. Mr Heseltine said the sale of a majority stake in the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, the Post Office's parcel delivery subsidiary, was the government's 'strongly preferred option'. He said: 'To survive and prosper, the business needs greater commercial freedom to seize new opportunities and to meet greater competitive challenges in the communications market.' Under Mr Heseltine's scheme - one of three included in the green paper  - the Post Office's counters division, which oversees its 20,000 post offices, would remain in public ownership as a separate entity. There would be statutory guarantees for the continuation of nationwide deliveries and a single national tariff. An independent regulator would be responsible for overseeing the privatised Royal Mail. In an attempt to reassure the public and Tory backbenchers, Mr Heseltine carefully pitched partial privatisation between the other two options in the green paper: continued state control and a 100 per cent sale. He said the first course offered Post Office managers insufficient commercial freedom, while the second might not reflect 'the important role which Royal Mail plays in our national life'. Mr Michael Heron, chairman of the Post Office, said Mr Heseltine's plan was 'a real winner for Britain'. 'This shareholding partnership option is . . . in tune with the public's desire to see a strong link maintained between government and Royal Mail,' he said. The government's endorsement of the 51 per cent share flotation was seen at Westminster as a victory for Mr Heseltine against cabinet colleagues who had urged a more cautious approach. At the same time, the document's proposals appear to have been astutely designed to appease the few Tory backbenchers who fear that privatisation might undermine rural postal services. One minister suggested that the government could now confidently announce a bill to privatise the Royal Mail and Parcelforce in the Queen's speech in November. The consultation period outlined in the green paper is due to end in September, and work on a bill is already well under way. However, some Tory backbenchers continue to express doubts about the plans. Ms Anne Winterton, Tory MP for Congleton, was concerned that the government's stake in the Royal Mail would not be guaranteed in the long term. She said: 'If it is not Mr Heseltine's intention to sell off the remainder of the shares, why doesn't he just come out and say so?' The Labour party and the 160,000-strong Union of Communications Workers pledged opposition. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said: 'As a private business, the Post Office would focus not on how it could serve the public but on how it could make money.'

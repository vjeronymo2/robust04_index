			<p>BFN     [Text] Spanish sources in Washington told Radio Nacional  that the military junta in Haiti could be granted political  asylum in Spain if the United States were to request it.  President Bill Clinton has admitted implicitly that one of the  possible solutions for the current crisis in Haiti -- and its  return to democracy -- would be that the military leaders who  took part in the coup d'etat be exiled in Spain or in France.  Our correspondent in Washington Luz Rodriguez has the story.    Spanish sources have confirmed to Radio Nacional de Espana  that our country would be willing to receive the three Haitian  military leaders for which the United States is looking for a  golden exile.    The leaders they are talking about are Commander in Chief  Raoul Cedras; Michel Francois, the head of Port-au-Prince  police; and Philippe Biamby, the chief of Army general staff.    We have not been able to confirm that the United States has  made a formal request to Madrid because it is still not clear  whether the three Haitian leaders are willing to go into exile  even though this exile would be in the best of circumstances.  The aim of this operation would be to allow the return of Jean  Bertrand Aristide.</p>

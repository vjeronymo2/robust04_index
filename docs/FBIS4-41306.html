			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy intends to have the document  on Russia's participation in the NATO PFP [Partnership for  Peace] program annulled. According to the leader of the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the document has no legal  force. Zhirinovskiy again confirmed that he will demand the  resignation of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, in this  case, for signing the framework document with NATO. Kozyrev had  no right to sign this program since the State Duma was  categorically against, Zhirinovskiy said.</p>

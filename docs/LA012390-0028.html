			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: MAKING NO BONES ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY  </P> <P> An assistant secretary came into the State Department kitchen and said, "Old  Mother Hubbard, we need 5 billion bones for East Germany."  </P> <P> Mother Hubbard replied, "My cupboard is bare. Hungary cleaned me out last  week."  </P> <P> The secretary sounded grim. "Nation after nation is achieving independence, but  they can't do it without bones. Have you looked carefully?"  </P> <P> Mother Hubbard told him, "I know a bare shelf when I see one. If I were you,  I'd inform the next country asking for bones that they are barking up the wrong  tree."  </P> <P> "We can't do that," the secretary said. "We've been telling the people of every  enslaved country that if they break the chains that bind them, we will supply  them with everything needed to become a democratic nation."  </P> <P> "Look, I just store the bones. I don't make them. Before the White House tells  Bulgaria to jump over to our side, they could at least check to see how many  bones are left in the cupboard."  </P> <P> The secretary became agitated, "What's going on today is bigger than a bread  basket. We thought that only one country would liberate itself this year -- and  perhaps another country would do the same next year. How could we have known  that they would all torch their governments at the same time? If you don't have  any bones in the cabinet, do you have anything that Romania can chew on?"  </P> <P> Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard and opened the doors wide. "Do you see  something that I don't? And why the pressure?"  </P> <P> "Guess who's coming to dinner? Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia."  </P> <P> "You're kidding."  </P> <P> "And Chile."  </P> <P> "Tell Chile to cool it -- at least until we find some bones for Panama. Why  don't we just issue junk bonds to the liberated countries and charge it to  Bloomingdale's?"  </P> <P> An intern came in and announced, "Mr. Secretary, the Polish ambassador is out  in the hall. He says that the President promised Lech Walesa 6 billion bones  when he toasted him at the White House. He was wondering if he could have them  now."  </P> <P> The secretary responded, "I was there and the President promised no such thing.  Why is it that every time some freedom fighters liberate themselves, they come  to us for aid?"  </P> <P> Mother Hubbard added, "Someone should tell Poland that knocking off communism  does not guarantee them a Rose Garden. In any case, when it concerns bones, I'm  not going to give any to El Salvador. Doesn't the President know that the  cupboard is bare?"  </P> <P> The secretary said, "He does and he doesn't. Every time we tell him we have no  bones, he says, 'We would if we cut the capital gains tax.' "  </P> <P> Mother Hubbard sounded upset, "Do you know what really gives me nightmares? I  am so afraid that someday you will come into the kitchen and inform me that the  Chinese have overthrown their leaders, and we have to give them bones."  </P> <P> "I don't see that happening soon," the assistant secretary assured her.  </P> <P> "I'd trust you more, but you are the person who declared that the Berlin Wall  would never come down," Mother Hubbard reminded him.  </P> <P> "Can we talk about Central America?" the secretary asked.  </P> <P> "We can talk about it as long as we don't have to give them any bones," Mother  Hubbard declared.  </P> <P> "We have to. None of those countries is going to come over to our side for  peanuts."  </P></p>

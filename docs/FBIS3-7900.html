The prime minister illustrated his statement, among other  things, with the fact that half of foreign direct investment in  East Central Europe landed in Hungary, whose inhabitants make up  merely 10 percent of the population of the region.    Replying to viewers' questions about Hungary's relations  with  its neighbours, Boross said that the talks on concluding basic  treaties with these states should focus on improving the  situation and enforcing the rights of ethnic Hungarian  minorities rather than declaring the existing borders again.    As for minority rights, Boross termed the implementation of  the Council of Europe recommendations as a priority. "On this  basis, we can negotiate on other issues, too," he said.    Asked about Hungary's recent opening towards Serbia, the  prime minister said, "there lives a large community of ethnic  Hungarians in Vojvodina. We must maintain goodneighbourly ties  with Serbia even in the future. We cannot wait until the  weapons become silent. If we can pave the way for a peaceful  settlement and the solution of disputed issues through  negotiations, we must not hesitate," he said.    Addressing home policy issues, Boross ruled out the  possibility of any coalition to be formed between his party, the  Hungarian Democratic Forum, and the largest party of the  parliamentary opposition, the Alliance of Free Democrats, after  the May elections.    "Even a deadlock might emerge after the elections, with no  parties being able to form a parliamentary majority. In this  hypothetical situation, the best solution would be the calling  of new elections," the prime minister said.</p>

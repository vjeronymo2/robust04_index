			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, 12 Feb (TANJUG) -- The republic of Srpska  [RS] delegation at the Geneva talks today distributed its  platform to reporters. It outlines the delegation's further  activities in the course of future peace negotiations on Bosnia,  in a situation where the Bosnian Muslims have rejected the  European Union [EU] plan.    The five-point document states that the RS assembly has  withdrawn the territorial concessions it initially offered  because the Muslims have rejected the EU action plan as a  formula for resolving the crisis, according to which they would  get 33.3 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory.    In the continuation of the peace process the RS delegation,  the platform points out, will proceed from the real state of  affairs -- on the basis of the EU plan -- and the concept of a  union of three republics in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The RS is a sovereign and independent state constituted in  line with the universal right of a people to self-determination  and it reserves the right to enter unions with other states.  According to the published platform, the capital of the RS is  Serbian Sarajevo (new Sarajevo). A separate peace agreement for  the Sarajevo area, as envisaged under the peace plan, should be  promptly signed in order to facilitate the talks on placing the  city under UN administration.    The RS borders, the platform says, will correspond to the  factual situation on the ground, and also the RS would have an  outlet to the Adriatic Sea (according to international law - the  Corfu Declaration [1917], the Saint-Germain Charter [1919], and  other international treaties), while some territories can be  considered to be disputed and under a special regime.    The borders between the Serb and Muslim states can, for the  purpose of creating unified territories, be established by  political dialogue, taking communications and other factors into  consideration, and in this way a solution to the disputed  territories might be found in a peaceful way.    The borders between the Serb and Croat states in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be defined in the framework of a  comprehensive Serb-Croat solution.    The RS delegation proposes that the three warring sides  immediately sign a peace agreement and enable a modus vivendi in  the expectation of a final solution.    The RS will, the platform says further, continue to take  part  in the peace negotiations on the basis of the EU plans, but it  requests equal treatment in the negotiations. This means the  abolition or suspension of the sanctions and the cessation of  all threats against the Serbs.    Finally, any violation of the integrity of the RS will be  considered as an act of aggression, the platform unveiled by the  RS delegation at the peace talks says.</p>

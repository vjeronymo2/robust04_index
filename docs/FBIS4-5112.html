			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The Korea-Russia Far East  Siberia Association met Monday morning at the Korea Chamber of  Commerce and Industry Building to discuss boosting cooperation.    The association is led by Maritime Province Governor  Yevgeniy  Nazdratenko of Russia and Chang Chi-hyok, chairman of South  Korea's Kohap Group.    At the meeting, the association agreed to construct an  industrial complex for Korean-Russian cooperation and an  exclusive quay for South Korean ships at Vostochny port in the  Nakhodka special economic zone.    The association will also recommend that the Governments of  South Korea and Russia designate small special economic zones  elsewhere in the Russian Far East and Siberia.    The association plans to obtain permission to establish a  regular direct line between Seoul and Vladivostok and study ways  to open another direct line between South Korea and Irkutsk,  Novosibirsk and Kamchatka Provinces.    Meanwhile, the association decided to hold regular  exhibitions of Korean goods in several Siberian and Far Eastern  cities including Khabarovsk and Yuzhno Sakhalinsk as well as  seminars and working-level talks between South Korean and  Russian businesses.</p>

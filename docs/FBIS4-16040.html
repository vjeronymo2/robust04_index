			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Snoshchekov] </F>   [Text] Strasbourg April 12 TASS -- A raid on Russian naval  ships in Odessa should not be viewed as a sign of the conflict  between Russia and Ukraine. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of  Russia's Federation Council, told this a news conference here.  He stressed that the events had "manifested the will of some  politicians to capitalise on some differencies between the two  states in the interests of their own career."    The events in Odessa have been above all a manifestation of  Ukraine's political problems and should not be classed with  interstate relations, Shumeyko said. He believes that they are  connected with political manoeuvres of one of Ukrainian groups  that are ready to go any lengths to prevent a rapprochement  between Ukraine and Russia. "In any case the incident should be  approached with calm. There is no need to aggravate the  situation. The way out will be found," said the speaker of the  upper house of the Russian Parliament.    Shumeyko is staying in Strasbourg at the invitation of the  Council of Europe at the head of a Russian parliamentary  delegation that participates in a regular session of the  parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe.</p>

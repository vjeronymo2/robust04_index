			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT  </P> <P> A summary of Southern California-related business litigation developments  during the week of Dec. 18.  </P> <P> AIDS Discrimination Case Reversed on Appeal: A state appeals court has ruled  that a West Hollywood nail salon violated the city's anti-discrimination law by  refusing to give a pedicure to a person with AIDS, the man's attorney said  Thursday. The case, decided by a panel from the 2nd District Court of Appeal,  was the first court test of the West Hollywood ordinance, which prohibits  discrimination by businesses against persons with AIDS, said lawyer Gloria  Allred, who represented the patient. Paul Jasperson, who filed the suit after  being denied a pedicure at Jessica's Nail Salon in 1986, died in May of AIDS.  In its decision, issued Wednesday, the 2nd District Court of Appeals ruled  2-to-1 that the West Hollywood ordinance should apply to the Sunset Boulevard  salon. The third justice, Jack Goertzen, dissented, saying the case should have  been dismissed because Jasperson had died. The attorney for Jessica's Nail  Salon was not immediately available for comment. (Filed Jan. 13, 1987, Case  Nos. WEC109666, B035646.)  </P></p>

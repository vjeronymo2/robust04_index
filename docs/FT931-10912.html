			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Observer: Vazillating In the way that accountants know best, Touche Ross has hit back at a group of disgruntled creditors to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, whose cheerleader is Keith Vaz MP. Vaz had called for the removal of partners in the firm as liquidators to the bank, criticised their fees, the pace and the small size of the payout. But in rigorous bean-counter fashion, Touche has retorted that without Vaz's vacillations, payouts would already have commenced, and would have been gathering Dollars 1m a week in interest. Thanks to the complainers, Touche has been forced to call a creditors' meeting in Wembley stadium at a staggering cost of Pounds 900,000. Meanwhile, the firm insists that it is not still charging Pounds 1m a week in fees, as Vaz alleges - just a modest Pounds 700,000.</p>

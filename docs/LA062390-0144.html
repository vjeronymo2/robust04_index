			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HE TAKES ROAD LESS TRAVELED, AGAIN;  </P> <P> ROCK: IN THE 1970S, TODD RUNDGREN SPUN OUT MUSIC IN HIGH-TECH SOLITUDE. NOW,  AMID AN ERA OF SAMPLERS AND SYNTHESIZERS, HE'S FOCUSING ON LOW-TECH, NON-DUBBED  RECORDING. HE PLAYS THE COACH HOUSE BEGINNING TONIGHT.  </P> <P> Back in the 1970s, Todd Rundgren didn't hesitate to weave an aura around the  fact that he was one of rock's first do-it-yourselfers.  </P> <P> He dubbed himself "Wizard" in one album title and "Hermit" in another. Fans  could picture Rundgren as a skinny, long-faced studio gnome, an eccentrically  humorous guru of recording technology, huddled alone in high-tech solitude as  he spun out crafty pop unaided by other human hands. Rundgren created almost  all of his landmark 1972 album, "Something/Anything," working by himself in a  studio rigged up in his living room.  </P> <P> Lately, though, Rundgren has taken off the mask of a technological Lone Ranger.  Last year, the "Nearly Human" album consisted of live-in-the-studio  performances by Rundgren and a large backing ensemble of singers and players.  Now, the erstwhile hermit is about to step out of the studio entirely. Next  month, Rundgren and his 11-member band are scheduled to record an album of new  songs in a series of five theater shows in San Francisco. The idea is to get a  strong performance of each song, without overdubbing. If there are any flubs,  Rundgren will call another take and start over from the beginning.  </P> <P> The need to minimize flubs is what brings Rundgren and band to the Coach House  for a series of shows beginning Saturday night. The aim is to perfect the new  songs in time for those San Francisco recording dates.  </P> <P> Speaking recently from his home in Marin County, where he was busy writing his  new material on deadline, Rundgren said that his own contrarian impulses play a  large part in his recent emphasis on real-time performances. Being a  techno-wizard may have been a novelty in the early 1970s, but now digital  technology has become the dominant force in pop record making. With so many  sounds available from samplers and synthesizers, interaction between  flesh-and-blood musicians is being supplanted more and more by  computer-generated "performance."  </P> <P> "Once everybody starts doing a certain thing, I feel inclined to do things the  other way," Rundgren said. "I started to miss the performance element, the  awareness that there were people playing to each other. I wanted to recapture  it. My records are a forum for the things I want to hear, but don't hear  elsewhere."  </P> <P> Ever since the late 1960s, when he led the Nazz, a Philadelphia-based  psychedelic rock band, Rundgren has shown a knack for the sort of catchy  tunefulness that is the raw material of most pop hits. But Rundgren's music  only occasionally has intersected with a mass audience. Over a 22-year career  dating back to the Nazz, he has placed six singles and four albums (including  recordings by his now-defunct rock band, Utopia), in the Billboard Top 40.  </P> <P> Rundgren, who celebrated his 42nd birthday Friday, says he is content with his  cult status. His creative juices aren't stimulated by the idea of concocting a  new pop hit.  </P> <P> "There is absolutely no juice, none of that juice, particularly considering the  criteria for a hit single nowadays," Rundgren said, interrupting his urbane  conversation with a chuckle. "I feel no loss at not being in the same  (category) as Milli Vanilli. Pop music is at a creative nadir nowadays, and it  doesn't concern me that I'm not successful. I don't want to devalue some  legitimate artists who by some quirk have gotten a good piece of music up in  the lofty reaches of the pop charts, but there's something devaluing about  being up there with Paula Abdul and Madonna."  </P> <P> Rundgren says the lofty reaches he wants to explore with his music don't  involve anything as tangible as a high chart position. Instead, he probes for  meaning in the mystical, searching current running through many of his recent  songs. "Hawking," from the "Nearly Human" album, is a particularly inspired  example. The song is a meditation on human frailty and aspiration, based on the  example of Stephen Hawking, the best-selling British author and astrophysicist  who reaches out to chart the universe with a mind trapped in a paralyzed body.  </P> <P> "The inspiration (for "Hawking") was not anecdotal -- one person with a disease  -- so much as the concept of what bravery is and what humanity is," Rundgren  said. "So many people waste themselves. They just kind of fall into an average  consumerist existence, and life is an endless round of the latest TV show and  the latest movie. They forget the greater questions of what existence is about,  why these things are here for our benefit."  </P> <P> In searching through those big questions, Rundgren often resorts to soul-styled  vocals. With his flexible but thin-bodied voice, Rundgren isn't the likeliest  soul singer in the world, and his vocal reach sometimes exceeds his grasp as he  tries to trace the soul tradition's demanding, gospel-derived swoops, stretches  and spirals of voice.  </P> <P> "It is a musical style appropriate to a lot of ideas I want to convey,"  Rundgren said of his decision to scale soul's peaks when he could comfortably  master the easier grades of conventional rock singing. "It's designed to  emotionally sensitize an audience. I'm not especially trying to be comfortable.  Every so often you have to sing a comfortable song, so you can rest. For me,  the value in the performance is to sort of empty yourself and to not feel that  you've held back."  </P> <P> "My favorite singer of all time is Marvin Gaye," Rundgren said, continuing his  explanation of why he likes to overreach his technical limits. "Sometimes on  record his voice cracks or he goes for notes he doesn't hit. If there's an  element of what seems like physical strain in it, sometimes that's desirable to  convey the urgency of what goes on. That's what makes him for me the best of  the Motown singers. I always hated Diana Ross. To me, Diana Ross was the  essence of lazy. I don't get off on the people who are comfortable and safe. I  get off on the ones who are striving, and you can sense the urgency of what  they are doing."  </P> <P> Rundgren says his own artistic striving is aimed these days at preserving the  sort of nonconformist ethic of the 1960s that helped spur his own career.  </P> <P> "When Reagan got elected, it really woke me up. I thought, 'God, the yahoos are  out of the box now.' It's the responsibility of artists or people of any  avocation to preserve that alternative society, where money is of secondary  importance, and day-to-day appreciation of the gift of life is of prime  concern."  </P> <P> All this sounds like awfully lofty talk from a rocker who, in his younger days,  seemed to delight in cracking smirking jokes in songs like the singles bar  epic, "Slut," the scatological school-days reminiscence, "Piss Aaron," and the  absurdist rocker, "Just Another Onionhead."  </P> <P> Rundgren said his snide side may have been submerged lately, but it isn't  missing. Last year he wrote some humorous songs for "Up Against It!" a musical  adaptation of a film script that British playwright Joe Orton originally wrote  for the Beatles in 1967. The production had an off-Broadway run in New York.  That has led Rundgren to begin work on another musical -- the script as well as  the songs.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping that will be a bigger part of my musical life," said Rundgren, who  joins the Kinks' Ray Davies in the ranks of rockers who have written a full  production's worth of songs for the musical theater (Rundgren said he wasn't  interested in seeing Davies' musical adaptation of Jules Verne's "Around the  World in 80 Days," because he thinks the rock Hall of Famer has fallen into  "lazy" songwriting habits).  </P> <P> Rundgren said that he is thinking of working humor back into his rock songs as  well.  </P> <P> "One concept in the back of my mind is to do an album that's meant to be funny.  I will tend toward the ridiculous, probably. My sense of humor depends on a  certain amount of things being bizarre."  </P> <P> Todd Rundgren plays tonight at 9 p.m. and Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 8  p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano.  Tonight's show is sold out. Tickets: $25. Information: (714) 496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

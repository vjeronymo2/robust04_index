It is recognized in  Yerevan that this document is aimed at developing cooperation  and creating conditions for strengthening confidence measures on  the continent of Europe, Aram Safaryan, press secretary of  Armenia's Foreign Ministry said at a briefing here. At the same  time he stressed that the NATO document needed further  consultations within the framework of the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council. These were made necessary by a number of  circumstances, including the situation in the Transcaucasus.    The spokesman of Armenia's Foreign Ministry stressed the  Republic's constructive and many-sided involvement in the  activity of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. He recalled  that Armenia's Foreign Minister Vagan Papazyan is going to take  part in the meeting of heads of the foreign policy departments  of the member countries of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, which is due to take place in Istanbul at the beginning  of June.</p>

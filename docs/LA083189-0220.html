			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MURDERS PROMPT ENTERTAINMENT FIRM TO ORDER INTERNAL REVIEW  </P> <P> The execution-style murders of entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his  wife have prompted his company, LIVE Entertainment, to hire an outside law firm  to conduct an internal review, the company said today.  </P> <P> "All who worked with (Menendez) find it inconceivable that he was involved in  any unsavory dealings that might have led to this tragic event," the company  said in a prepared statement, adding that "many of the rumors which are the  subject of press speculation are frankly absurd."  </P> <P> Menendez, 45, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were found dead Aug. 20 in their Beverly  Hills mansion.  </P> <P> Although police have refused to disclose details of the slayings, The Times  reported Wednesday that sources close to the case said the couple were killed  by at least two people who fired more than a dozen blasts from 12-gauge  shotguns, including a coup de grace shot to Menendez after he was dead.  </P> <P> In its statement, LIVE said it is cooperating with police and has retained the  law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison "to assist us in  conducting an internal review."  </P> <P> The company did not specify what areas of its business will be reviewed.  </P></p>

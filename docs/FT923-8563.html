			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sabena reduces half-year operating loss to BFr300m SABENA, the Belgian state airline, made an operating loss of BFr300m (Dollars 9.87m) in the first half of 1992, a sharp improvement on its performance in early 1991. Sabena did not reveal directly comparable figures for its operating results, but a year ago it said it had an operating loss of BFr2.16bn for the first four months of 1991. This year's losses were the result of world overcapacity and airline price wars, said Sabena, 37.5 per cent owned by Air France since earlier this year. It said that the second quarter of 1992 'had not followed the positive trend of the first quarter'. Both the yield, revenue per aircraft or passenger, and the total revenue fell between the first and second quarters. It warned that results for the second half were uncertain, depending on the progress of the recession and the strength of the US dollar, which affects ticket revenues, and fuel and aircraft costs. The first-half performance was patchy, with some operations doing well. Passenger traffic increased by 10.3 per cent in Europe, compared with the first half of 1990 - the last comparable period unaffected by the Gulf war which drove passengers away from air travel. Traffic on the African network was up by 5 per cent against the first half of 1990, but transatlantic passenger traffic dipped by 16 per cent and Asian traffic by 7.8 per cent. In 1991 the group made an operating profit of BFr2.13bn following a 1990 loss of BFr7.15bn. A link-up between Sabena and Air France was finally signed in April, but is still subject to approval by the European Commission competition authorities. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, said last month he expected the deal - a BFr6bn cash injection in exchange for the stake - to fall under EC merger regulations.</p>

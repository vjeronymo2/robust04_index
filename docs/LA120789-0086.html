			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> INVOICES TO BE REVIEWED  </P> <P> The City Council has asked the city attorney to review $23,960 worth of  invoices submitted by Land Design for construction projects along Holt and  Garey avenues.  </P> <P> D. Rodney Tapp, owner of Land Design, says the city has withheld payments to  him since he publicly criticized the council for firing former City  Administrator A. J. Wilson.  </P> <P> Acting City Administrator Tom Fee said he reviewed the invoices submitted by  Land Design dating to April and has had "a very hard time following the basis  for compensation" for some of the work.  </P> <P> Fee recommended delaying some payments, but the council decided to delay all  payments while the city attorney conducts a review.  </P></p>

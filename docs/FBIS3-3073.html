			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shenyang, March 10 (XINHUA) -- The adoption of a  new rice growing method has caused the water consumption of rice  farms to drop almost by half and the yield to rise remarkably in  Dashiqiao city, in northeast Liaoning Province.    Wang Chaoyang, the city's top agricultural official, said  that since the new water-saving method was adopted, the average  production of the city's 34,700 ha [hectare] of rice farms has  increased from 7,500 kg to 9,750 kg per ha.    The water consumption for each ha of rice farm has dropped  from some 27,000 to 15,000 cubic meters, the official said.    What is specially important about the new method, said the  official, is that without it, nearly half of the city's  rice-growing land would have been simply left wild for lack of  water.    He said that each year the city has 2.4 million cubic meters  of water available for its rice farms, while some four to five  million cubic meters would be needed if the new method had not  been adopted.    Experiments with the new method started in 1989, after a  severe drought struck the area in the previous year and caused a  large decrease in rice production, Wang recalled.    The water-saving method begins with the growing of rice  seedlings. They are grown on dry nursery beds, rather than in  the water as the old method requires.    The official said the new method grows seedlings with  stronger roots and also saves labor.    There is also a change in the method of raking. Instead of  raking after watering, rice fields are now raked while they are  dry.    The new raking method can save 1,200 cubic meters of water  on  each ha of rice field. Besides, this makes the soil loose and  warm, so that seedlings can grow faster, he said.    Another major change is the method of irrigation. Instead of  keeping the land in water all the time, watering is done every  six days and only after the land has dried up.    While saving water, the new method also saves the  consumption  of electricity and fuel, thus making rice growing more  profitable for farmers, the official added.</p>

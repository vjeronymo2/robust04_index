			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Thames plan falls short of ambitions A scaled-down plan to regenerate the east Thames corridor, a 30-mile swathe of land on both sides of the Thames from Docklands to Tilbury and Sheerness, was published yesterday by the environment department. The corridor, renamed Thames Gateway, is expected to provide a total of more than 110,000 new homes, 70,000 of them by 2006. These figures cover all sites, irrespective of size. It identifies 10,000 acres of land scheduled for development, including large areas of London's docklands. The plan falls short of the ambitious proposal for a string of new towns along both banks of the Thames outlined by Mr Michael Heseltine when, as environment secretary, he launched the concept of a corridor in 1991. Mr Heseltine envisaged a 'linear city' to the east of London, providing many of the 575,000 homes needed in the south-east in the medium-term. Last year Mr Michael Howard, his successor as environment secretary, unveiled plans to create 182,000 jobs in the area. Yesterday Mr David Curry, urban regeneration minister, would say only that he was 'pretty certain' that up to 100,000 jobs would be created. The new plan brings together existing development plans for the area to provide a framework for future development. No new government money is promised, although transport projects worth Pounds 4.5bn are either under consideration or have been approved. Mr Curry said: 'It will set the framework for development of the whole area for a generation. Thames Gateway must no longer be regarded as London's backyard. As it is through the area that Europe comes to London, it is a place to take care over, where first and lasting impressions are gained.' Mr Curry said development in the area would be to the same high standards expected in other parts of London and the Home Counties. 'This is not the cheapo end of the market. We will insist on the same environmental standards in Ebbsfleet and Erith as apply in Esher, the same in Dagenham as in Dorking,' he said. There was a cautious welcome for the plan from Mr Bill Higham, deputy chief executive of Redbridge council, a London borough on the north bank of the Thames. He said: 'It brings the area into sharper focus. Our major concern is that most of the development envisaged is dependent on private-sector investment. 'Experience has shown that without government commitment to prime the pump, private-sector investment is usually not forthcoming. There is no sign of new public-sector investment in this project.' The Labour-run Association of London Authorities said that the government had missed an opportunity to build 'affordable homes' and create jobs. Private-sector developers were enthusiastic. Mr Mark Pennington, project director of Blue Circle Properties, which owns 5,000 acres of land in the area, mostly in Kent, said: 'This is definitely a first - the first time the area has been looked at strategically.' Consultation ends in November. Once it is finalised, local planners will be required to fit their planning decisions to it. Separately, the transport department announced a public consultation on additional river crossings in the east Thames area. The proposals include a third crossing at Blackwall to relieve pressure on the two tunnels and two more crossings to the east. Thames Gateway Planning Framework.

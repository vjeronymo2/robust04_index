			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 24 (AFP) -- Defence Minister Francois  Leotard said on Thursday [24 February] that France would likely  resume nuclear testing in the Pacific after the presidential  elections of May, 1995.    Speaking on French state radio, Leotard said he personally  backed resumption of tests "at the right time," either in 1995,  1996 or 1997.    Leotard said that the question of resuming tests would arise  only after the presidentials because President Francois  Mitterrand, who has exclusive powers to order tests, wanted to  stand by a moratorium observed by all the United Nations  Security Council members, except China.    The defence minister said France's nuclear deterrent would  be  "perfectly effective until the year 2010" and would not be hurt  by the lack of testing.    On Wednesday, speaking after publication of a government  white paper on defence policy for the next 20 years, Leotard  said tests were necessary both to modernise nuclear weapons and  to develop a capacity to simulate tests in the laboratory. The  aim of simulation is to obviate the need for field tests  altogether.</p>

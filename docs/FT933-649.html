			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Barclays' German arm loses Pounds 24m MERCK, FINK, the German banking subsidiary of Barclays Bank of the UK, lost DM59m (Pounds 23.6m) last year, it has emerged. This amounted to more than a quarter of the Munich-based bank's equity and obliged it to make a highly unusual formal announcement of its losses to the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur Kreditwesen (BFK), the federal banking authority in Berlin. This came to light over the weekend as details of the correspondence between the bank and the BFK appeared in the German press. The correspondence took place in January this year but no mention of the scale of the bank's losses was made at its annual press conference this summer, where journalists were left with the impression that the bank had made a profit in 1992. Barclays, which bought Merck, Fink in the autumn of 1990 for an undisclosed amount, said yesterday that it had made good the losses and that it was happy with the performance of the bank. This month it invested a further DM100m to take the German private bank's equity capital from DM200m to DM300m. Mr Geoffrey Kelly, a spokesman for Barclays in London, said last year's losses were largely due to one-off factors, such as the costs of opening new offices and provisioning for restructuring. Another factor was conservative provisioning for bad and doubtful debts, Mr Kelly said. In the first half of the current year, Merck, Fink made an operating profit of DM15m. This figure is, however, calculated before provisions for bad and doubtful debts - likely to be extensive given mounting credit risks amid Germany's worst recession since the second world war. Merck, Fink is one of a number of German private banks owned by UK clearing banks. Midland Bank owns Trinkaus &amp; Burckhardt and Lloyds owns Schoder, Munchmeyer, Hengst. This summer Merck, Fink said it was planning to cut staff by 12 per cent from 650 by the end of next year. Merck, Fink said it expected profitability to be maintained in the second half and it expected a satisfactory result for the full year. It said the figures for the first half made it 'unmistakeably clear' that reports of business difficulties at the bank were groundless.</p>

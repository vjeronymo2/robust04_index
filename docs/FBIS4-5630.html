			<p>BFN     [Text] The American commander in the Pacific, Admiral  Charles Larson, has declared New Zealand a friend and ally of  the United States, saying bilateral relations are improving.    Admiral Larson, who made his comments in Wellington, is the  first senior American military official to visit New Zealand in  almost 10 years. In that time New Zealand adopted anti-nuclear  laws, which the Admiral said remained a barrier to military  exercises between the two countries. But he added, the  objective of his visit was to begin a dialogue and lay out a  framework for common interests.    The New Zealand prime minister, Jim Bolger, told reporters  that most of his discussions with Admiral Larson had centered on  peacekeeping around the world.    Relations between New Zealand and the United States  deteriorated in the mid 1980s after the adoption of the  anti-nuclear laws. The American president at the time, Ronald  Reagan, prohibited military contacts and all exchanges between  senior officials, but earlier this year President Bill Clinton  announced the restoration of high-level contacts.</p>

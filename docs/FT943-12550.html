			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Blair launches strong defence of the family Mr Tony Blair yesterday eschewed the leftwing liberalism of Labour's past in favour of a strong defence of the family as a central component of social cohesion. In a further step towards repositioning his party in the political middle ground, the Labour leader said that 'common sense' rather than ideology would be the driving force behind its approach to social policy. But he found himself under strong attack from the Conservatives over education policy, with ministers saying that Labour would ignore the wishes of parents by returning grant-maintained schools to the control of local authorities. Mr John Major, the prime minister, intends to use a speech later this week to argue that Mr Blair's election has not closed the gap between the Conservatives and Labour on the key issues of individual choice and responsibility. Mr Blair, in comments likely to irritate the left wing of his party, emphasised the need for government to recognise the family as 'the essential, stable social unit'. He attacked the Conservatives for 'stigmatising' single parents, most of whom had not chosen to bring up their children alone. But in an unapologetic defence of what he termed 'commonsense' values, Mr Blair said adults should not choose to have children outside stable relationships. The small group of women who did so were 'wrong'. In his first full-length television interview since his election as leader last week he told Mr Brian Walden on London Weekend Television: 'The family is important because it is the social unit where people learn the boundaries of decent conduct and behaviour and where people are brought up.' Mr Blair added that social, education and training policies under a Labour government would be geared to supporting and sustaining the family unit. But parents would be obliged to recognise they had responsibilities as well as rights. His remarks came as Labour's plans to overturn many of the Conservatives' education reforms were attacked by ministers. Mr Blair will launch proposals tomorrow to end the centralised funding of grant-maintained schools, abolish A-levels in favour of a broader qualification for 18-year-olds and modify the present system of schools testing. He intends to underline a new emphasis on driving up educational standards, extending nursery education and promoting discipline and pupil assessment. Ministers seized on the issue of grant-maintained schools to say that Labour was committed to reducing choice. Mr Blair has said the schools must be put back under local control but has refused to say if this would mean their reversion to councils.</p>

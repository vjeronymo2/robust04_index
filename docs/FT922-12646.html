			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T rises to Dollars 883m in quarter AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), the biggest US long-distance telephone carrier, yesterday reported a 17 per cent rise in its first-quarter net profits to Dollars 883m or 67 cents a share, from Dollars 758m or 59 cents a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 15.38bn, compared with Dollars 15.27bn in the 1991 first quarter. All the figures include NCR, the large US computer manufacturer AT&amp;T acquired last September. AT&amp;T's sales of products and systems dipped 6 per cent to Dollars 3.45bn, after falling 7 per cent to Dollars 4.4bn in the fourth quarter, although sales of microelectronics components, consumer products, wireless and cable systems and undersea cable rose in the quarter. Revenues from computer products and systems sales tumbled 16 per cent in the quarter. NCR, as a separate division, had operating income of Dollars 46m on revenues of Dollars 1.54bn. Its results include extraordinary charges from the company's merger with Teradata. The recession in Europe and lower sales to some US telephone companies were blamed for a 7 per cent decline in revenues from telecommunications network products and systems business, which fell to Dollars 1.68bn. Long distance calling volume rose 8 per cent in the quarter, while revenues from financial services jumped 32 per cent, reflecting growth from AT&amp;T's Universal Card. On Wall Street, shares in AT&amp;T rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 42 7/8 at midday. Shares in Sprint climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 23 1/4 after the third biggest US long-distance carrier turned in first-quarter earnings of Dollars 136m or 62 cents a share, against Dollars 84m or 38 cents in the same period of 1991. Stripping out the impact of accounting changes, net income was Dollars 100m in the latest quarter, while earnings per share rose 18.4 per cent to 45 cents. Operating income from Sprint's long-distance operations rose to Dollars 67m on revenues of Dollars 1.36bn, compared with income of Dollars 52m on revenues of Dollars 1.34bn a year earlier. Local operations had a record first quarter, with operating income of Dollars 178m on revenues of Dollars 714m, against Dollars 167m on revenues of Dollars 688m a year ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara, Feb 12 (A.A) -- Turkey on Saturday [12  February] decided to reinforce its F-16 warplanes, which were  stationed in Italy's Ghedi base, in a bid to control  Bosnia-Herzegovina airspace.    Turkey said it took the decision after NATO's Southern  European Allied Forces Commander Micheal Boord's call that an  air operation will be launched against Serbia if it fails to  withdraw its forces from Sarajevo in ten days.    The 16-membered NATO earlier agreed to order air strikes  against Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo unless they  withdraw artillery and other heavy weapons at least 20 km (12  miles) or put them under U.N. control within 10 days.    General Staff spokesman Dogun Silahcioglu told an AA  reporter  that with the reinforcement Turkish Air Forces will have 18 F-16  type warplanes in Ghedi base that will be ready for the air  operation.    Meanwhile, AA learned that Greece did not give permission  for  the eight F-16 warplanes to pass through Greek airspace.    Officials said Turkish warplanes will pass to Ghedi base  over  the Mediterranean Sea on Feb 14.</p>

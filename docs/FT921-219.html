			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Pacifists try to block Swiss plan A PACIFIST group has launched a campaign to block the Swiss government's plan to buy 34 McDonnell Douglas F-18 fighter aircraft for Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.32bn). Normally, military programmes in Switzerland are sacrosanct, but the F-18 project has aroused considerable opposition, partly because of its high cost and partly because of doubts that such a sophisticated aircraft is the right weapon for the country's future security needs. A recent opinion poll in the French-speaking part of Switzerland indicated that 76 per cent of the population opposed the purchase, although 60 per cent thought an airforce was still necessary. The government has just approved a new security policy, refocusing the Swiss Army on international peacekeeping and maintaining order at home in the event of natural catastrophes or shock-waves from conflicts or disasters in neighbouring countries. The possibility of having to repel a determined aggressor is considered extremely remote. Two weeks ago, the council of states, the parliamentary chamber reflecting the views of the 26 cantons, approved the F-18 project. In June, the more representative national council will have the final say. Last weekend, the Group for an Army-Free Switzerland set out to raise - within a month - the 100,000 signatures needed to force a referendum on the purchase. It is almost certain to succeed and then it would demand that the cabinet express its opinion on the referendum before the F-18 issue comes before the national council. The referendum itself would have to be held within two years.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of the commenters suggested that a reference to footnote 2 be added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the upper left-hand block of illustration 1, which refers to non-selective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrichment broths. Because footnote 2 to illustration 1 contains pertinent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information concerning non-selective enrichment, we agree and have added a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to footnote 2 in the upper left-hand block of illustration 1. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same commenter noted that we had omitted the word ``broths'' after the word  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``enrichment'' in footnote 1 to illustration 1, and also suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first sentence of footnote 2 be revised for the sake of clarity. We agree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with both of these points and have added the word ``broths'' to footnote 1 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have revised the first sentence of footnote 2 to read ``Beef extract or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infusion broths and plates are preferred.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that illustrations 1 and 2 are difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follow and that wording should be added to the illustrations to indicate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella pullorum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is a slow grower and produces a smaller colony than other  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> salmonellae,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that the production of H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> S is delayed or absent, and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of gas is weak or absent. We believe that the illustrations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easily understood and that the additional information suggested by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter is unnecessary. Each illustration contains a block referring to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of ``additional identification media and diagnostic systems,'' which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes means of biochemical identification and differentiation of bacteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, we believe that a person conducting such tests would be familiar with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the isolation of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> including the identification of characteristic colonies of pullorum and other  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> salmonellae  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on various media. Therefore, we have made no changes in response to the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, paragraph (a)(2) of our proposed amendment to &sect;147.14 stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that culturing for the dependable recovery of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> salmonellae  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> should include the use of preenrichment broths supplemented with ferrous sulfate. One of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters noted that there is debate regarding the usefulness of adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ferrous sulfate to overcome the inhibitory effects of conalbumin, and pointed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out that the egg culture protocol included in recently published APHIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (``Chicken Disease Caused by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella Enteritidis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '') does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the addition of ferrous sulfate. The ``regulations'' to which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter referred were actually proposed regulations published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41048&hyph;41061, Docket No. 91&hyph;016&hyph;1) and, as such, have no regulatory effect. The protocols included in that proposed rule are still under review and will not become effective until a final rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published. We believe that the ability of conalbumin to chelate metallic ions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as Fe <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> + or Cu <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> + has been clearly demonstrated by both Gelb and Harris  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1980) and Tan and Woodworth (1969). Additionally, Board  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1991)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated that the addition of iron to preenrichment broth aided in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella enteritidis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from eggs. Therefore, we have made no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in response to the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the changes discussed above, we are making two other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes. First, we are adding Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers to &sect;&sect;147.1, 147.2, 147.3, 147.5, 147.11, 147.12, 147.13, and 147.21.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing paperwork requirements contained in those sections_not any new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that may be contained in this final rule_were approved by OMB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the proposed rule was published, so the control numbers must be added to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of each of those sections. Second, we are correcting an out-of-date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference in &sect;147.43, which contains provisions regarding the Plan's General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conference Committee. In that section, there is a reference to the Assistant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Transportation Services. In 1982,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Marketing and Transportation Services division was reorganized and renamed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marketing and Inspection Services, so we have corrected the reference in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;147.43 to reflect the current organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the changes discussed in this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes contained in this document are based on the recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of representatives of member States, hatcheries, dealers, flockowners, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breeders who took part in the Plan's 31st Biennial Conference. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Plan is voluntary, individuals are likely to remain in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program as long as the costs of implementing the program are lower than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the added benefits they receive from the program. The changes in this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule will keep the provisions of the Plan current with changes in the poultry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, will allow the use of state-of-the-art laboratory and testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, and will allow the Plan to better respond to disease emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the changes contained in this final rule, only two are expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have more than a negligible economic effect on Plan participants. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment that will allow, in certain cases, a 500-bird sample to be tested in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lieu of the entire flock will result in a cost savings for affected Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants because fewer tests will be required to qualify certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiplier breeding flocks and succeeding flocks for participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plan's pullorum-typhoid program. It is likely, however, that those savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be offset by the amendment that increases testing requirements by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing, for all poultry except turkeys, provisions that allow two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consecutive generations of breeding flocks to go without testing for pullorum-typhoid. The remaining items, because they are either administrative or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedural in nature, will not have a significant economic impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file suit in court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this final rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 9 CFR Parts 145 and 147  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Animal diseases, Poultry and poultry products, Reporting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 5 April, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] decided to include, in a list of unfair trade  practices in a report to be compiled in May, U.S. accusations  against foreign countries of dumping which are based on its  customs act clause concerning multinational corporations. In  the "report on unfair trade practices," MITI will also refute  the provisional finding of the U.S. Department of Commerce at  the end of March that the Fuji photo film company's Dutch  subsidiary is dumping color photographic paper on the U.S.  market. Because the random use of the clause may affect  Japanese companies' inroads [setting up factories] into foreign  countries, MITI will consider making a complaint to Washington  about the unfairness of the dumping accusation after seeing what  action the Dutch Government and the EC Commission take.    The clause on multinational corporations is special  legislation attached to the customs act that allows for the  imposition of dumping charges on goods produced by multinational  companies and imported to the United States. When it is  impossible to compare a multinational company's sales in the  United States to sales in the country of origin, the clause  allows the U.S. Government to make dumping accusations based on  production costs in the company's home country or any other  country where the company sells the same product.    In the case of Fuji photo film's subsidiary, the U.S.  Department of Commerce provisionally ruled on 30 March that "the  Dutch company has sold a small amount of its photographic paper  in the Netherlands." And based on the clause on multinational  corporations, it used Fuji photo film's own production costs in  Japan and calculated that the dumping rate for the goods  produced by the Dutch subsidiary was 321.23 percent.    In refuting the decision, Fuji photo film said, "The Dutch  subsidiary sells goods throughout Europe, and the small amount  of sales in the Netherlands is due to the country's small  market." The Dutch Government also protested unofficially to  the U.S. Government over its decision.    The Dutch company was the third Japanese subsidiary charged  under the clause. A Japanese subsidiary in South Korea was  charged in 1982 for dumping steel wire and a Taiwan subsidiary  in 1989 for dumping telephone receivers. However, because this  was the first time for a European subsidiary to be charged, MITI  is more cautious in the Fuji case. A MITI official said, "The  random use of the clause may affect Japanese companies' inroads  into foreign countries which have been boosted by the yen's  appreciation." Thus, MITI has decided to include the case in  its report on unfair trade practices.    The report is to be compiled by MITI's Industrial Structure  Council (an advisory panel to the international trade and  industry minister) to investigate whether Japan's main trading  partners' trade policies and practices violate international  rules such as those of the GATT. It is a Japanese version of  the annual U.S. National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade  Barriers.</p>

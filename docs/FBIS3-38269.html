			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "J.M.": "In 1993, Recession Did Not Curb </F> Inflation, Which Exceeded Government Target by 0.4 Percent"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- A whole year of economic crisis did  not serve to curb inflation. Despite last year's recession and  the fall in demand, the 1993 consumer price index released by  the National Statistics Institute (INE) yesterday totaled 4.9  percent -- 0.4 percent above the government's latest target. In  December alone, prices rose by 0.5 percent -- the largest  increase recorded in that month in the past five years. "It is  a bad figure," according to the experts, who forecast a revival  of inflation in 1994 if Spain finally succeeds in emerging from  the recession.    The considerable increase in prices in December -- 0.5  percent, as against the 0.3 percent recorded in the same month  last year -- was clearly due to the poor performance of foods.  The food price index rose by a spectacular 1.5 percent last  month, more than in the 12 months of 1992 put together, when it  rose by 1.2 percent.    "The performance of unprocessed foods was surprising, and  clearly reflects the devaluations suffered by the peseta,"  according to Belen Mateos, head of International Financial  Analysts' economic trends department.    The only moderately good figure among the figures that  became  known yesterday is the performance of underlying inflation --  that is, excluding unprocessed foods and energy products --  which rose by 0.2 percent in December. This figure is the same  as the one recorded in December 1992, and leaves the annual rate  at 5 percent.  <H5>  Reduction of Underlying Inflation </H5>   "The only interesting thing about inflation in 1993 is that  underlying inflation is on a par with the general rate,"  according to economist Jose Antonio Herce of the Fedea  foundation. For instance, in 1992, underlying inflation (6.9  percent) ended 1.5 percent above the general rate (5.4 percent).    "The fall with respect to last year is perhaps not very  much,  in the context of the present recession," Mateos reflected with  respect to underlying inflation, "but it shows some flexibility  in the services sector, something we did not see very clearly at  the beginning of the year."

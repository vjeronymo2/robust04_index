			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Letter: Perhaps UK should contemplate a future with Nafta Sir, If you will permit this intrusion from a Yank, may I make a suggestion for Mr John Major? Perhaps, while the UK reviews the structure of power in the European Community and contemplates the future, it should consider joining the North American Free Trade Association (Nafta). The Nafta agreement has not yet been initialled, and it will be several years before it has a significant impact on the economies of its member countries. The long-term plans for Nafta, however, include alliances with countries based on common economic goals, not geographic proximity. To have the UK as a member of Nafta would surely benefit us all. For the US, we would be helped by having another strong partner, offsetting some concerns - particularly from Canada - about our domination of the pact. It would also alleviate some of our concerns about job losses to Mexico with the possibility of new investment from the Brits, already a significant factor in our economy. Your presence would enhance the treaty's chance for success, both in its initial years and in realising its potential for worldwide growth. For the UK, there would be new opportunities for trade and new access channels to the booming economies of South America. To the extent that Nafta would enhance the UK's economic vitality, you would be better equipped to negotiate with the Franco-German alliance which, it seems, has definitively taken over the leadership of the European Community. I believe that including the UK in Nafta would greatly enhance the members' comparative strengths in telecommunications and computer technologies, medicine, and financial services, for example, as well as improving productivity and growth in manufacturing sectors.

"These elections have been tainted," Culhaoglu said.    In a statement from his party's headquarters, Culhaoglu said  that they have received claims that the results of local polls  have been distorted.    He said that they have received great numbers of ballots  casted for his party that were found in trash cans and that they  found a printing house in the central Anatolian city of Kayseri  which was printing ballots.    Culhaoglu said that the SDPP applied to the Prosecutor's  Office, claiming fraud and petitioned the High Election Board.    "Fraud claims are pouring in from all over the country," he  said. "These claims show that an organized action has been  carried out throughout the country." [passage omitted]</p>

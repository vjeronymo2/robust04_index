			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] It is regrettable that some of our Palestinian  brothers think that politics and oratory are one and the same  thing. Given that oratory is ever capable of working miracles  in a dream world, this section of our Palestinian community  seems to judge any political action that falls short of set  objectives or does not end up fulfilling aspirations in one fell  swoop to be absolutely conspiratorial and capitulationist. For  them, political action consists mainly in rhetoric that sets out  their objectives.    We had believed that the last few years saw us,  Palestinians,  cast off this one-dimensional, starry-eyed approach, when we  began to talk in terms of political thought, political  education, a phased struggle, and the need to pursue our main  objectives in stages each requiring a certain shape of struggle  and a language suited to changing circumstances. We must now  admit that we have been proved wrong. Nearly 14 years since the  first and oft-discredited rejectionist experience of the  Palestinians, here we are again experiencing the same verbal  negative experience. This is not to say that we have anything  against the right to dissent and rejection. Indeed, this is a  sacred right that should not be undermined as long as it is  exercised to advance [words indistinct]. We ourselves are now  exercising this very right. Our sole aim is to correct the  course of the militant march and safeguard the Palestinian  household and strengthen the foundation of Palestinian unity.  It is just an attempt we are making from this forum to caution  against the risks inherent in the rejectionist rhetoric that  never advances beyond lip service. Indeed, these naysayers say  nothing of merit, aside from pointing accusing fingers and  raising doubts. They also fail to recognize new facts and their  implications for the Palestinians and Arabs, and globally. Far  from leading to a grasp of new facts and how to handle them,  such an approach inevitably leads us away from hard realities.  Those who point accusing fingers and pass ready-made judgments,  in effect, gradually close the doors before a national dialogue  and promote discord and consequently jeopardize our national  unity. The naysayers even do not view stepped up struggle  against occupation and forcing new facts on the ground as the  road to topple the declaration of principles agreement. For  them, the only means to topple the agreement is to topple  Palestinian legitimacy and the historic leadership of the  Palestinians. In other words, the rejectionists are not coming  up with any plan of action to dislodge occupation. They have  nothing to offer save the same revolutionary statements and  slogans they have raised over the past 20 years. Thus, instead  of proposing national action to upgrade the revolution and  resistance, they are seeking the aggrandizement of factional  interests that, if allowed to grow and take hold, carry dire  consequences for the militant march of our people. [words  indistinct] Are our people's national interests and objectives  thus served? We hope this question will be weighed before it is  too late.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (23): Comeback by US carmakers - Motor industry / Kevin Done explains why the tables have been turned The tables have been turned in the world motor industry. After several years of intense pain and record losses the big three US carmakers had moved strongly back to record profits by the second quarter this year. Earnings at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are continuing to rise strongly, while several of their European and Japanese rivals are still struggling to fight their way out of recession and away from the red ink, that has washed over their operations. Sales of cars and light trucks in the US are now in the third year of recovery and are forecast to rise by 12 per cent this year to more than 15.5m. In Europe the tide also appears to have turned this year, while in Japan the signs of a turnaround remain fragile, although the most recent sales figures suggest that demand is no longer falling. New car sales in western Europe fell by more than 15 per cent last year to 11.45m, the sharpest annual decline in the post-war period, while new car sales in Japan have fallen for three years in succession. The recession has bottomed out in western Europe with sales in the first seven months rising by an estimated 6 per cent year-on-year to 7.42m, but there are fears that the rate of improvement may weaken in the second half of the year. New car demand worldwide fell last year to the lowest level for six years, but the recovery this year has ended three successive years of falling sales, and the outlook for the medium term is promising. The latest study by DRI/McGraw-Hill, the London-based automotive analysts, forecasts that a sustained period of growth is in prospect with worldwide new car sales rising gradually to reach record levels throughout the second half of the 1990s. Sales worldwide are forecast to increase by 6.4 per cent this year to 35.3m from the low point of 33.1m last year. The recovery was driven first by the strong rise in demand in North America and by continuing significant growth in the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan). 'Global car sales could rise by 6 per cent or more this year as Europe pulls itself out of recession, joining the expanding markets of North America, Latin America and Asia/Pacific,' says the latest DRI report. 'There nevertheless remain problem areas with Japan still in recession and the economic crisis of Turkey producing something close to a collapse in the market.' The rate of growth will gather pace in 1995 as both the German and Italian markets emerge from recession, and sales in western Europe are forecast to rise by around 5 per cent a year in each of the four years from 1994 to reach a record level of 13.7m in 1996 and 14.4m in 1997. New car sales worldwide are forecast by DRI to rise by close to 30 per cent to 42.6m in 1999 from 33.1m last year. However, much of this growth will originate outside the traditional car consuming nations of western Europe, North America and Japan. South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and eastern Europe offer the best outlook for growth for the 1990s and beyond. The world's leading carmakers are united in the view that the Asia/Pacific region holds the brightest prospects, and automotive sales in Asia (excluding Japan) are expected to triple during the next 15 years. According to Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, the world's second largest vehicle maker, around 80 per cent of the world's population lives outside the traditional automotive markets of western Europe, North America and Japan, but the number of cars and trucks sold in these regions represents only about 8 per cent of the world's total. The European industry is in the midst of hectic transition, as the European Union moves to become an open car market by the end of the decade with the removal of all quota restrictions on car and light commercial vehicle exports from Japan at the end of 1999. Several of the first wave of Japanese car plants in Europe - built by Nissan, Toyota and Honda - are now in production and Mitsubishi Motors is due to open its first European car plant next year in a joint venture with Volvo. Four of the big six volume car producers in western Europe, the Volkswagen group of Germany, PSA Peugeot Citroen of France, the Fiat group of Italy and Ford of Europe, were in loss last year, while profits declined steeply at Renault of France and General Motors Europe (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK). The pressure of recession and the need to rationalise has forced all vehicle makers in Europe to reduce their workforces. The deep recession in Europe and Japan has slowed the previously inexorable advance by Japanese car producers into the world market. Under heavy pressure from the rising value of the yen, Japanese carmakers have been forced to raise their prices in the US and in Europe faster than their American rivals, which has begun to bite into their market share abroad. At home Japanese carmakers have suffered an unprecedented period of three successive years of falling demand. Several producers have fallen into loss, most notably Nissan, the country's second largest vehicle producer, and Mazda. The Japanese industry is being forced to restructure at a time when it is burdened by high fixed costs and high depreciation following recent years of heavy capital expenditure and the building of new assembly capacity in Japan. It no longer enjoys the advantages of earlier years of an undervalued yen and cheap money. In contrast to the dramatic proliferation of new products at the end of the 1980s, Japanese carmakers are now having to cut the number of model variants and types of options offered, which have 'proliferated excessively' in recent years, according to Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan. Difficult times have called for some drastic re-thinking of corporate strategies.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD CAR SALES FORECAST (000s)*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1993       1994       1995       1996       1997  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD             33,134     35,253     36,377     38,042     39,903 West Europe       11,450     12,181     12,743     13,692     14,362 Germany            3,194       3,215     3,306      3,425      3,638 Italy              1,890       1,858     1,948      2,075      2,191 UK                 1,778       1,978     2,074      2,236      2,303 France             1,721       1,989     2,051      2,184      2,302 Spain                743         849       867      1,056      1,054 East Europe***     1,334       1,366     1,472      1,550      1,675 Turkey               443         252       287        331        420 North America      9,441      10,245     9,950      9,779     10,150 US                 8,702       9,424     9,044      8,822      9,147 Japan              4,199       4,203     4,398      4,628      4,780 Asia Pacific****   2,848       3,155     3,509      3,831      4,027 South Korea          963       1,072     1,167      1,256      1,315 China                430         481       618        758        791 Latin America      1,867       2,051     2,058      2,216      2,404  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD CAR PRODUCTION FORECAST (000s)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1993       1994       1995       1996       1997  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD (net)**     33,887     35,059     36,554     38,550     40,203 West Europe       11,372     12,102     12,847     13,823     14,206 Germany            3,794      3,946      4,085      4,310      4,391 France             2,836      2,996      3,138      3,332      3,384 Spain              1,505      1,661      1,776      1,801      1,808 UK                 1,375      1,433      1,565      1,840      1,918 Italy              1,117      1,213      1,314      1,457      1,558 East Europe***     1,800      1,780      1,920      2,100      2,294 Turkey               348        234        258        297        378 North America      7,329      7,961      7,968      7,758      8,042 US                 5,982      6,745      6,750      6,463      6,660 Japan              8,499      7,942      8,266      8,723      9,018 Asia Pacific****   2,807      3,154      3,542      3,914      4,342 South Korea        1,512      1,791      1,962      2,150      2,389 China                241        216        335        451        563 Latin America      2,214      2,423      2,339      2,603      2,651  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    * 1993 actual, 1994-1997 forecasts.   ** Excluding traceable double counting.  *** Including Commonwealth of Independent States. **** Excludes Japan.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: DRI World Car Industry Forecast Report - August 1994.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN CLEMENTE MAYOR TO SEEK A REVIEW OF ONOFRE STUDY  </P> <P> Citing his concern over atomic plant safety, San Clemente Mayor Brian J. Rice  said Monday that he will ask the City Council to review a controversial report  on the environmental impact of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.  </P> <P> "This situation with the nuclear power station is something that should concern  the city," Rice said. "Its effect on the environment will have an effect on us  in the future."  </P> <P> The power station is four miles south of the city in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Rice said he will ask the council on Wednesday to review a 15-year, $45-million  study of San Onofre's impact on the ocean environment. The study, performed by  three biologists appointed by the California Coastal Commission and released  last week, says the nuclear plant has done some damage to the ocean area but  doesn't pose a major environmental threat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assurances Are Doubted  </P> <P> However, Rice said he had doubts about the report's broad assurances about the  plant's overall environmental safety. He said by putting the environmental  report on the council agenda, council members can discuss it and consider  inviting plant officials to San Clemente to answer questions about  environmental damage.  </P> <P> "We've been constantly reassured that these things are safe," Rice said. "But I  think the record of nuclear generating stations is less than reassuring about  their being a safe method of providing energy."  </P> <P> San Onofre opened its first generator in 1968 and now has three nuclear  reactors designed to produce about 2,625 megawatts of electricity. Operated by  Southern California Edison Co., the plant is capable of producing about 21% of  the utility's total electrical output for the 50,000-square-mile service area  from Kern to San Diego counties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Zero Radiation'  </P> <P> "We have used very sensitive radiation tests around the plant, and we've found  almost zero radiation caused by the plant," said Byron Mechalas, the utility's  manager for environmental research. Mechalas said San Onofre poses no health  hazard to humans and has a very small impact on the sea environment.  </P> <P> The biologists' study said the nuclear station has killed about 21 million tons  of fish a year and has reduced the amount of kelp in the ocean. Because the San  Onofre reactors are cooled through a procedure that draws water through the  plant at almost 2 million gallons per minute, fish often get sucked into the  pipes. And after cooling the reactors, the water is returned to the ocean at a  higher temperature.  </P> <P> "Basically they're talking about 21 tons of fish, and that's a lot of fish,"  Rice said. "Then there's the effect on the kelp. So now there's danger to fish  and kelp, and it makes me wonder what will be next. These people keep telling  us there is no health hazard from a nuclear generating plant. But these people,  from the very first, said nuclear generating plants are safe, efficient and  low-cost, and they've been wrong on all three counts."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from his Rosemead office, Mechalas argued that the  biologists' study confirms that the San Onofre plant has caused little damage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kelp Reduction  </P> <P> "We've got the biggest kelp beds down there in 25 years," Mechalas said. "The  report only said that there was a reduction in what there might be in the  amount of kelp."  </P> <P> Mechalas agreed that 21 tons of fish are killed yearly because San Onofre  water-cooling pipes pull in ocean water. But Mechalas said San Onofre uses a  "fish elevator" system that saves 80% of the sea life pulled into the pipes.  Mechalas said the system diverts most of the sea life from the pipes into a  holding area and then elevates it to a higher water area, where another pipe  pumps it back to sea.  </P> <P> "The impact of the (San Onofre) plant is so small that if anybody didn't know  the plant was there, he could never tell from inspecting the environment that  there is anything different about that part of the coast," Mechalas said.  </P> <P> Rice, however, said he is not convinced by Southern California Edison's  reassurances.  </P> <P> The council meeting will begin at 7 p.m. at San Clemente City Hall.  </P> <P> </P></p>

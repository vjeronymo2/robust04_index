			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (6): The power of sausages - Profile: Ukrainian entrepreneurs THE success of the Kyryshko brothers, a trio of bearded giants, each 6ft 6in tall and weighing in at more than 250lb, is one of the most hopeful signs that 70 years of Soviet rule has not snuffed out the entrepreneurial instinct of the Ukrainian people. From their home base in Bila Tserkva, a provincial city 100km south of Kiev, the three brothers have built up a food processing empire which achieved a turnover of Dollars 1m and 1.5bn roubles in 1992. The biggest obstacles the Kyryshkos face are the endless changes to Ukrainian law and the breakdown in trade with the former Soviet republics. The collapse of the inter-republican banking system, and the difficulties of trying to pay for raw materials with Ukraine's new currency, have persuaded the Kyryshkos to revert to barter in almost all of their trade outside Ukraine. 'We produce sausage' explains one of the brothers, Mr Ivan Kyryshko, 'and in the uncertain economic conditions of our country, sausage is better than money.' To obtain glass jars for his vegetable canning factory last year, Mr Kyryshko was forced to journey to the distant forests of Siberia in order to buy lumber in exchange for sausage and a cash payment. The lumber was sent to Kazakhstan, so that steel could be made and shipped to Tiumen so that caustic soda could be sent to Kiev where Mr Kyryshko's glass jars were produced. Building on the power of sausages, the Kyryshkos have created a business which has a staff of 175 and an additional 150 part-time workers. The brothers have a contract with farmers in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv - chosen because the land there has not been seriously affected by Chernobyl - to produce vegetables for their canning factories and feed for their 2,000 cattle and 600 pigs. Altogether Mr Ihor Kyryshko, another brother, says the business produces as much meat and vegetables as the entire Bila Tserkva region. The Kyryshkos also operate a textile factory, have shares in a leading Ukrainian bank and commodities exchange, and own three Ukrainian newspapers, a local TV station and a volleyball team. The Kyryshkos bring a religious zeal to business. 'I only found real personal fulfilment after perestroika, when I could become a businessman,' says Mr Ihor Kyryshko. This attitude seems to be shared by the Kyryshkos' employees. Mr Serhii Kasianov, manager of the Kyryshko canning factory where 36 workers produce 8m cans a year, explained that he has developed a new work ethic since he left his job at a state canning factory, not surprisingly as his salary is now triple the average Ukrainian wage. Despite the many frustrations that Ukraine's fledgling entrepreneurs face every day, the Kyryshkos are cautiously optimistic about Ukraine's reform-minded government. They describe Mr Leonid Kuchma, prime minister and himself a former factory director, as a man who can get things done. Businessmen are the people who should be running Ukraine, in the view of Mr Ihor Kyryshko, who does not rule out a political career for himself. 'If not us then who?' asks the man whom Ukrainian newspapers have dubbed 'The Capitalist of Bila Tserkva.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Kamal] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mustafa Mashhur, the strong  man in the Muslim Brotherhood, denies any link between the group  and violence. In an interview with ROSE AL-YUSUF, he said: Our  method since we came out of prison has been not to participate  in any incident. Our connection with any extremist group has  not been proven, from Shaykh al-Dhahabi [killed by the  Repudiation and Renunciation group], the Military Technical  School incidents, the assassination of al-Sadat, to the Asyut  incidents. We in fact have issued several statements  criticizing violence.    [ROSE AL-YUSUF] The repentant al-Shawqiyun Group leader has  accused you of supporting terrorism with money.    [Mashhur] I have no knowledge of that. Let them  investigate. If it is proven that Ahmad 'Ubayd (the man named by  'Adil 'Abd-al- Baqi in his confessions) or any one else has done  so, let them bring them to account. But the Muslim Brotherhood  has nothing to do with this.    [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Don't you have any connection with Ahmad  'Ubayd?    [Mashhur] I mean that we have nothing to do with the money,  and Ahmad 'Ubayd has not informed us that he gave money.    [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Does the Muslim Brotherhood intend to  escalate the situation and declare civil disobedience in the  professional unions?    [Mashhur] Our method is moderation, and not violence,  capitulation, and weakness. We are carrying out a message.  This is the right of every citizen. It is my right to say that  Islam is the solution, just as others say socialism is the  solution. Actually, we exist legally, but it is they [the  government] who do not want to recognize us.    [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Can any professional union undertake any  measure without your decision?    [Mashhur] Yes. We only give general guidance and do not  interfere in all matters.    We are not against dialogue with the officials. It is they  who are against dialogue with us. Our work is done in the open.  There is no secret organization, as some people claim.    [ROSE AL-YUSUF] If a dialogue takes place, what are the  issues on its agenda?    [Mashhur] Emissaries from Al-Ahram Research Center came to  see us. We said we do not object to dialogue, provided the  government allows political rights to the people, a party, the  publication of a paper, and free elections.    [ROSE AL-YUSUF] So what is required to end the confrontation  is a party and a newspaper.    [Mashhur] What I mean is freedom of expression--instead of  licensing parties that have no assets and claiming that the  establishment of a Muslim Brotherhood party will lead to  sectarian strife. Our relations with the Copts since the time  of al-Banna have been good.    [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Is there an intention to put up candidates  in the next elections?    [Mashhur] Of course, unless they prevent us.    [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Some people say that the Labor Party has  sacrificed the Muslim Brotherhood in order to attend the  National dialogue meetings.    [Mashhur] I do not think this is correct. The alliance  between us continues. [passage omitted]</p>

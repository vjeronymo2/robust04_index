			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / The great mediator returns to base with offer for US strikers The Man has done it all this season. No matter what they threw at him in Pyongyang, Port-au-Prince and Pale - dictatorial curve balls and sliders and sneaky Balkan change-ups - he hit them all out of the park, the trademark toothy grin getting wider with each victory. The crowds loved him for bringing peace to their troubled lives, even if his technique seemed sometimes unorthodox. But now The Man wants to take on the ultimate Mission Impossible - and on his home ground, too. He has told the White House and the warring factions that he is ready yet again to step up to the plate. It all happened in a rush late on Thursday. Jimmy Carter - for who else could it be but the former president? - let it be known that he was ready to intervene in the US baseball strike. His offer came just hours before the owners of the 28 major league teams voted to declare an impasse in their negotiations with the players in a dispute that cut last season short in August and threatens the existence of the next one. The statement from the Carter Centre in Atlanta was carefully guarded. 'Our mediation services are available only when both parties genuinely want a settlement and desire us to be of assistance,' it said. And therein lies the rub that yesterday morning suggested he might this time not get even the chance to star. For Mr Bud Selig, an owner who also serves as acting commissioner of America's national sport, said after talking to Mr Carter: 'No, thanks.' The owners' argument was that if Mr Bill Usery, one of the best and most experienced federal labour mediators in the business, could not get the two sides to agree, there was no reason to believe Mr Carter could. The strike has arisen because the owners want to put a ceiling on team payrolls so as to level the competitive playing field between the richer and poorer sides. The players, whose earnings range from Dollars 109,000 (Pounds 69,800) for the 162-game season to more than Dollars 32,000 a match, want nothing to do with a salary cap. They think it smacks of the indentured servitude from which they have worked over the last 25 years to escape. This being America, the dispute will now go to court. The owners will also go ahead with plans to start next season with minor league players, including, possibly, Michael Jordan, the retired basketball superstar who enjoyed only modest success last season as an outfielder in Birmingham, Alabama. But the players have already gone to court to stop the import of foreign professionals from south of the border and Asia. Owners have also advised the sport's umpires, involved in a separate contractual dispute, that they will all be fired on January 1. If they are deemed disposable, then who needs Jimmy Carter?

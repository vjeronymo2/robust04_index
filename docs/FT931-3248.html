			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Digital looks to PCs to rekindle the flame - US group aims to be one of the top five global suppliers by 1995 DIGITAL Equipment has seen better days. Apart from superfast microprocessors, the US group, once second only to International Business Machines, leads in hardly any area of the computing business. Dr Juan Rada, economist, academic and, since May 1992, Digital's head of strategic alliances, explains his company's dilemma: 'Digital has succeeded as a company when it has invented the future. Its people are not good followers; it is difficult to get them enthused when they are not leading.' The company failed to exploit the industry's two most important developments: the personal computer (PC) and the move to 'open' or industry-standard systems. In 1992, it lost money for the successive second year; Dollars 2.8bn, or 20 per cent of revenues, proportionally far worse than International Business Machines, whose Dollars 4.9bn loss, an industry record, amounted to only 8 per cent of sales. Can Digital rekindle the spark that took it to number two among the world's information technology suppliers? Dr Rada believes that Digital's mistakes have presented it with a clean sheet in three important areas: management, organisation and technology. Management: Mr Robert Palmer took over as chairman from Digital's founder, Mr Kenneth Olsen, last year. He has since named a new senior management team, appointing several top managers from outside the company. Organisation: the company has been restructured into nine business units, each responsible for its financial performance. Technology: Digital is pinning its hopes on its Alpha microprocesssor chip, the first to process information 64 bits at a time. Much will depend on whether Digital can catch industry leaders, such as IBM and Compaq in personal computers. Customers spend more on PCs than on any other computer hardware, but net profit margins are small. Success in PCs means combining high volumes with low prices and excellent distribution. Digital is starting in PCs with a more or less clean sheet. It failed first time round because senior management did not take PCs seriously; now Mr Palmer has set the company the goal of becoming one of the top five global suppliers by 1995. The aim is to earn about 20 per cent of revenues - perhaps Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn - from PCs by that date. To implement the strategy, Mr Palmer appointed Mr Enrico Pesatori as head of Digital's PC business unit. Mr Pesatori, 52, spent 21 years with Olivetti, Europe's largest PC manufacturer, before two years as chief executive of Zenith Data Systems, the PC arm of Groupe Bull of France. Digital's PC strategy is a rag-bag of solutions. PCs for Europe are made by Olivetti; Intel builds machines for the US. Notebook PCs and some workstations are supplied by other manufacturers. In addition, Digital designs and manufactures its own PCs. In spite of this haphazard approach, according to Mr Pesatori, Digital has moved from 22nd to ninth among global PC suppliers in the past 12 months. 'Without a real strategy, but with some sound products, Digital has been able to achieve impressive results,' he says. His first job is to create a coherent PC strategy: 'My goal is to have taken all the strategic decisions before the beginning of our fiscal year, in July. Implementing the strategy will take a further year.' That will involve the creation of a single product family, which will mean changes in the arrangements with Olivetti and with Intel. Mr Pesatori insists the relationships will be improved rather than severed: 'We have to move to another level of co-operation to meet what is required today,' he says. He also intends to appoint professional PC managers to oversee the all-important distribution strategy. It could be argued that Digital has left it too late in PCs, but Mr Pesatori argues that the company's legacy gives it significant advantages. First, there are its existing customers, which include most of the world's blue-chip companies. Less than 5 per cent use Digital PCs; by comparison, 48 per cent of IBM customers have at least one IBM PC. If Digital's penetration rate were raised to only 20 per cent, it would make a considerable difference. That large customer base also makes the company attractive to dealers who would see a sales agreement with Digital as a passport to lucrative new business. Second, the Digital brand name. Mr Pesatori accepts that names like IBM and Compaq can no longer command a premium, but notes that if products are priced sensibly there is advantage in owning a brand synonymous with quality. Third, the company is an acknowledged technology leader; its Alpha chip will eventually be used in its PCs, giving customers a choice of 64-bit or 32-bit technology. Digital faces an uphill battle, but Dr Rada believes the industry's turbulent state will be an advantage. He quotes a Spanish proverb: 'When the river is turbulent, the fishermen are the winners.'</p>

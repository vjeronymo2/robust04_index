			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, Mar 23 -- Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime  minister, today denied information that has appeared in the  media that Russia has started the construction of a new  cosmodrome in the Far East. "The matter was not discussed in  the government," he said. "We are unable to ensure the normal  functioning of the available launch pads, not to mention  building a new one."    Yuriy Semenov, general designer of the "Energiya"  scientific-industrial association, supported the position of the  first deputy prime minister. He deeply believes that Russia, if  it aspires to the status of a space power, will not be able to  do without the Baykonur cosmodrome. In this connection, he  described the current situation at Baykonur as catastrophic.  The social sphere has not been provided, heating is not  working, and people have not been paid wages for the previous  month. Practically, he said, the whole thing runs entirely on  people's enthusiasm. At the same time, one should be reminded  of the fact that the cosmodrome that took 30 years to build is  worth an estimated 13 trillion rubles, including worn out assets  [at 1991 prices].    If we do not start restoration work before April, we will  soon lose Baykonur, he said.    Oleg Soskovets expressed confidence that at the upcoming  meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev in Moscow  they will adopt a political decision on the status and  functioning of the Baykonur cosmodrome.</p>

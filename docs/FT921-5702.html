			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Yamaichi losses will exceed Y10bn YAMAICHI Securities, one of Japan's Big Four brokers, said yesterday it would report a loss for the year to the end of March, the first since the company was restructured in the mid-1960s during a stock market crisis. Mr Atsuo Miki, a Yamaichi vice-president, said the company would report a pre-tax loss of more than Y10bn (Pounds 44.64m). Other reports have put the likely loss at Y17bn. Yamaichi had pre-tax profits of Y67.5bn for the previous year. Yamaichi's earnings have been undermined by the problems facing Japan's leading houses: low volumes and weak prices on the Tokyo stock market. It is expected that about 10 of the largest 14 Japanese brokers will report losses for the current year. The company reported a pre-tax loss of Y5.4bn in the first half, its first for 27 years. It suffered a Y12.3bn loss on its own securities trading and a 25.1 per cent fall in commission income, which had been eroded by a 34 per cent decline in Tokyo market turnover during the first half. At the time, it forecast a full-year profit. Yamaichi estimated that the measures imposed by the Ministry of Finance after last year's stock market scandals had cost the company between Y2bn and Y3bn. But the indirect costs of the effects on investor confidence are likely to be greater, as Tokyo prices have remained low and exchange officials are still discussing ways of attracting individuals back to the market. In previously forecasting a full-year profit of Y20bn, Yamaichi had been apparently hoping for a daily average turnover of about 300m during the second half, but first section turnover has remained weak, and last week saw an average 189.08m shares, down from 201.18m in the previous week. The lack of new money in the market has been highlighted by the change in fortunes of investment trusts, which have been net stock sellers for eight consecutive months. The industry reported yesterday that net share purchases last month totalled Y354.2bn, against net sales of Y527.6bn. Japanese brokers expect the market to remain weak until the end of the financial year, which is often marked by companies selling off shares to cash in unrealised gains. However, brokers are generally confident that investor sentiment will turn in the second half.</p>

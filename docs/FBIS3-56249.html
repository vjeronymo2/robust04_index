The Jewish community said the Vilnius-based RESPUBLIKA  newspaper uses every opportunity to slander Jews. The  statement's authors said the way RESPUBLIKA treats the Jewish  nation often resembles statements by the leader of the Russian  liberal democrats, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.    No specific examples are indicated in the letter, but the  community said it is not the first time that shades of  anti-Semitism appear in the Lithuanian press.    RESPUBLIKA is the second biggest newspaper in Lithuania with  a daily circulation of around 80,000.</p>

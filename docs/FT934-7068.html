			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Miners accept deal to close Yorks pit Miners at Bentley Colliery in South Yorkshire have accepted management plans to close the pit next month, British Coal said yesterday. It said the National Union of Mineworkers had accepted an improved redundancy package on behalf of its members at the colliery. Production will cease on December 3 and miners will receive redundancy payments of up to Pounds 44,000 each. British Coal blamed the closure on reduced demand in a 'highly competitive market place'. The pit, which employs 450 people, is one of 12 for which the government announced a reprieve in March. Bentley's pithead stocks of 600,000 tonnes are equivalent to more than six months' production, and about three-quarters of the pit's weekly output of 20,000 tonnes is being added to the stockpile. British Coal wants to close two other Yorkshire pits, Hatfield in Doncaster and Frickley in Pontefract, by the same date. Silverdale Colliery in Staffordshire will stop production on December 3, subject to the agreement of its 400 miners. The future of three other pits - Littleton, near Cannock in Staffordshire, Ellington in Northumberland and Wearmouth, Tyne and Wear  - will be reviewed this week. British Coal will be left with about 16,500 miners by next month if the programme of closures is accepted.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SIGNS OIL CLEANUP, TANKER BILL SPURRED BY EXXON SPILL  </P> <P> President Bush on Saturday signed a bill requiring double-hull construction of  oil tankers and authorizing a $1-billion fund to cover cleanup costs and  damages not paid by the spiller.  </P> <P> The bill, spurred toward passage by the 11-million-gallon spill by the Exxon  Valdez in Alaska, also sets new crew licensing and staffing requirements for  oil ships.  </P> <P> Bush complained that the measure contained a "highly objectionable" moratorium  on exploration for oil and natural gas off the coast of North Carolina's Outer  Banks.  </P> <P> "Such a moratorium is ill-advised in view of recent events in the Persian Gulf,  where I have found it necessary to deploy American soldiers 7,000 miles from  home to protect our vital national interests," the President said.  </P> <P> He said his Administration would seek repeal of the ban.  </P> <P> Saying that gas exploration carries little environmental risk, Bush said: "It  is shortsighted to restrict exploration for this relatively clean energy  source."  </P> <P> The President said the $1-billion trust fund will be available to cover cleanup  costs and damages not compensated by the spiller. However, he said the  spiller's "financial responsibility requirements are greatly increased."  </P> <P> In another legislative action Saturday, Bush signed a bill to combat AIDS. The  act authorizes up to $881 million in grants next year, and a total of $4.5  billion in grants through 1995, for medical assistance in areas with  disproportionately high numbers of AIDS cases. It is named in honor of Ryan  White, the late Indiana boy who became a symbol of discrimination against AIDS  victims.  </P></p>

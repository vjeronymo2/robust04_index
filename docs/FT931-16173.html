			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Tonight, and for the next two nights, Arena's The Graham Greene Trilogy (BBC 2, 9.30) offers the unmissable opportunity to become immersed in the conscience-ridden torments of Greene-land. Greene, who died in 1991, called writing his disease. The first instalment narrates his career as far as Mexico and The Power and the Glory. I suspect that the main effect of 'how to' gardening programmes on TV is to sow disillusionment. Novice gardeners wonder gloomily why the muddy, bug-eaten reality never corresponds to what they saw being effortlessly accomplished on the box. BBC 2's Front Gardens (8.30) invites garden designers to transform tiny off-street patches according to their owners' hearts' desires. On C4 at 9.00 there is the other kind of gardening programme. In A Count of Flowers, ace garden-presenter Roy Lancaster begins the first of a two-part exploration of the fabulously lovely gardens of La Mortola in Italy. Joanna Kanska, so memorable as the Polish heroine of 'Very Peculiar Practice', returns to the screen as a sexy Russian in Love Hurts (BBC1, 9.30)</p>

To raise the quality of rural laborers, Guangdong, a rising  area in South China, has exerted big efforts to popularize  nine-year compulsory education and promote anti-illiteracy  programs among adults.    By the end of 1993, nine-year compulsory education was  implemented in the province's 48 counties and prefectures. In  the 17 pilot counties and cities for rural education reform, the  enrollment rate of middle school students reached 95 percent in  1992.    In rural education, priority is given to technical training  in rural primary and middle schools so that the students can put  their knowledge immediately into use.    Some 134 vocational schools have been set up in the 17 pilot  counties and cities, which have helped trained 60 percent of the  rural enterprises' employees.    Rural education has always stressed the combination of  education, production and scientific research.    The ten vocational schools of Shunde Counties have opened 18  courses in line with the needs in the development of rural  enterprises and agricultural modernization.    In the past ten years, the schools have trained more than  8,000 students who have become an important force in  agricultural production and rural industry.</p>

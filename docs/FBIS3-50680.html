			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] The Foreign Ministry has released a document saying  that Bolivian foreign policy with Chile and the United States  will straighten up because the attitude of "reciprocal  suspicion" will be replaced by an attitude of cooperation,  exchange, and integration.    Just as the document says, these are changes that current  Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar intends to implement and that  will affect the traditional way Bolivia has faced and carried  out the nation's foreign affairs.    This is one of the new Foreign Ministry conclusions provoked  by the realization that "the world is going through a process of  a general reorganization of relations between countries,  regions, continents, and hemispheres."    The document says this period is characterized by a growing  interdependence that "is not always free of asymmetrical  situations that sometimes are quite contrasting" and usually are  not mentioned.    The document says Bolivia must adopt, now and in the future,  positions that have been proven successful recently and were  based on peace policies implemented after World War II.    Aranibar's administration admits that since the recovery of  democracy in 1982 the country has made "significant political  and economic progress, which are determinant factors for  Bolivia's insertion into the international community and reflect  "an understanding of generalized trends."    The document points out that, consequently, the government's  foreign policies are based on respect for the democratic system  and human rights, preservation of and respect for the  pluralistic identity of peoples, and the need for economic  cooperation between nations.    These decisions have paved the way for "the logic of  coalition and integration," replacing "the logic of  confrontation. The latter being the basic tone that  characterized "Bolivia's old international policy," which must  be overcome.    The document also points out that the Foreign Ministry has  embarked on the task of "professionalizing" its services in  order to overcome "improvisations" as part of the new Foreign  Ministry responsibility to help attract investments and  establish beneficial trade agreements.    The document finally lists Foreign Ministry goals based on  reality and "operational" possibilities as follows: 1) Give  preference to relations with neighboring countries and the other  Latin American and Caribbean nations and 2) Participate in the  reconstruction of relations with the United States.    The third point refers to improving relations with the EC.  The fourth and last point refers to national participation in  subregional integration efforts, as well as in GATT and other  international organizations.    The document cites the United States and Chile as areas of  crucial problems for the country. It indicates that the "basic  guidelines have the purpose of replacing the concept of  'reciprocal suspicion' with a more cooperative concept and to  diversify, with a true and advantageous number of issues, the  possibilities for exchange and integration beyond the issues of  drug trafficking and the landlocked problem, which have become  real obsessions."</p>

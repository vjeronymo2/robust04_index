			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Co-operation on an ad hoc basis Mr John Bacchus, Rover's head of collaborative strategy, was in Tokyo yesterday seeing the corporate umbrella over his Honda projects snatched out of his hands. He has been Rover's point of contact with Honda as the two companies worked together over new models and fostered co-operative manufacturing. Although Rover and Honda exchanged board members, the arrangements for collaboration under that level were loose. Rover never had a group of people who spent all their time collaborating with Honda. The role of Mr Bacchus was to facilitate contacts whenever they were needed. And he has been making about 18 trips to Japan every year to that end. Another frequent visitor to Tokyo has been Mr Alan Curtis, managing director of product supply at Rover and responsible for bringing new models to market. But neither side ever had a permanent presence in the plants or offices of the other. At working level the Rover and Honda executives who came into contact most frequently were the designers and engineers. Rover formed teams to undertake projects and tasks. When the work was complete the team would be dissolved, its members moving on to something else. Practically, the collaboration of the two companies was done on an ad hoc basis - 'as the need arose - interface at any level,' as Rover put it yesterday. As an example Rover designers spent considerable time in Tokyo when they were developing the 600 model. The changes in Rover's manufacturing processes over the last 15 years have been helped by a running series of visits to Honda factories, but executives learned more from the Honda plants in the US than they did from those in Japan. 'In the US you could see how the Japanese adapted to western structures,' Rover explained. The contacts have resulted in a growing network of executives across the two companies accustomed to co-operating with each other, which has so far been unaffected by the BMW purchase. 'Many friendships will continue regardless,' said one Rover executive.</p>

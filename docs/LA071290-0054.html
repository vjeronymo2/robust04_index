			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: CELLO SETS TONE OF RICHARD BARONE SHOW;  </P> <P> HIS ROCK BAND EXPERIMENTED WITH SONIC SYNTHESIS IN A HIGHLY MELODIC, DYNAMIC  PERFORMANCE AT THE COACH HOUSE.  </P> <P> You don't typically see "cellist wanted" listings in the classified sections of  rock magazines, but perhaps Richard Barone and his band can start a new trend.  </P> <P> With Jane Scarpantoni wielding the bow, Barone's show Tuesday night at the  Coach House benefited from shadings and textures seldom encountered on a rock  concert stage.  </P> <P> This was not the sort of rock-meets-the-classics gimmick listeners learned to  expect from the Electric Light Orchestra, which massed cellos and violins for  the sake of pomp and flash. Scarpantoni, seated just to the side of bandleader  Barone, didn't come to the ball to dress it up in a little high culture. She  came as a fully engaged rock musician, ready to serve as an integral part of a  band. Scarpantoni hardly ever stopped playing, and her playing never stopped  making sense.  </P> <P> She was central to the band from the show's very first driving riff, in which  the cello doubled the electric bass. Scarpantoni was often "it" in games of  interactive tag in which the cello would spin and twine in response to Barone's  twisting electric lead guitar parts. But she was no less a presence when  jumping into the rhythm section in a supporting role that lent both power and  nuance. When the situation called for a delicate change of pace, Scarpantoni  was ready with the sort of thing one expects from a cello: a broad, classic  tone full of warmth and grace.  </P> <P> With bass, drums and acoustic guitar laying down basic rhythms, Barone,  Scarpantoni and percussionist Valerie Naranjo dabbed in the sonic colors in an  exceptionally melodic 70-minute show that included 11 of the 12 songs from  Barone's new album, "Primal Dream," plus quiet covers from the Beatles ("Cry  Baby Cry") and the Velvet Underground ("I'll Be Your Mirror").  </P> <P> Barone's voice was consistently appealing with its reedy quality offset by a  husky grain, although he occasionally strained for a note. His guitar work,  emphasizing distortion effects that didn't part with melody, was the main  driving force in the six-piece ensemble, which kicked in tightly after a few  rough spots early on.  </P> <P> Stormy music predominated, but Barone inserted several interludes in which  drums and bass sat out, leaving a chamber-pop quartet. One song, "Flew a  Falcon," had it both ways. Naranjo, a vibrant performer given to dramatic  flourishes, would bang out crashing kettle drum rolls with her mallets, then  stop and let the cello answer in a quieter, more understated way that built  tension until the next dynamic drum surge.  </P> <P> Barone did play a spirited rocker, "Barbarella," for sheer dumb fun (it was a  number from his old band, the Bongos). But most of the show took on an attitude  of earnest searching and striving -- a sense of wavering warmth amid darkness  that had its emotional echo in the tonality of the cello itself.  </P> <P> The performance got the response it deserved from a small but fully  appreciative audience that was delighted to hear a pop-rock band deliver more  than the usual thing.  </P> <P> THE BEAT GOES ON: The Vandals have a new drummer, Josh Freeze, who at 17 is a  veteran of touring with Stacey Q and Michael Damian. The Orange County  teen-ager also recently played on sessions for Dweezil Zappa's next album. As a  result, Dweezil and his sister, Moon Zappa, plan to appear on the Vandals' next  album. Bob Casale of Devo is producing the record, which is tentatively  entitled "Fear of a Punk Planet."  </P></p>

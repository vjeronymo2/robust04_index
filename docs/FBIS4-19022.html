			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Social Movement ideologue Domenico </F> Fisichella by Paola Di Caro in Milan; date not given:  "Fisichella: National Alliance Did Not Give In to the League"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Di Caro] Professor, following  your meeting with the League leaders, what looked like  insurmountable differences between the Bandwagon [League  nickname] and AN [National Alliance] have apparently been  overcome. Is this so because AN "converted" to the League's  position that the prime minister should be elected directly?    [Fisichella] We did not submit at all to the League's will.  In fact, the MSI's long-standing presidentialism eventually  allowed for two different possibilities: either the direct  election of the head of state or the direct election of the  prime minister. Both options have been taken over by AN and,  personally, I have been advocating the usefulness of electing  the premier directly for the past 10 years, at least.    [Di Caro] However, Urbani, one of the people involved in  drafting Forza Italia's platform, stated a rather different view  to CORRIERE, suggesting that the prime minister be elected by  parliament, and speaking of a "soft" form of presidentialism....    [Fisichella] Urbani said that the matter must be carefully  considered. I am saying the same thing. So far, the two groups  have met, a method rather than the substance has been agreed on,  we have cleared the ground for constitutional reform. This is  an important result, because the League and AN were the two  groupings that were furthest apart.    [Di Caro] Far apart, particularly as regards federalism. Or  have you also reached an agreement in this respect?    [Fisichella] I am saying that, if we want to achieve common  objectives in government, we must all avoid setting impossible  conditions. One of the impossibilities would have concerned  asserting a double sovereignty: Well, on this count I found no  objections. As for the rest, we did not speak of cantons or  republics. In any case, also within the League there is more  than just one project. In this respect, [League Chairman]  Rocchetta said that the League is federalist also internally....    [Di Caro] To return to Urbani, he also said that the 12  macroregions mentioned in the Agnelli Foundation's project could  be a starting point.    [Fisichella] I repeat, we must meet and talk things over.  If, on one side, they are proposing the existing 20 regions  and, on the other side, they are demanding three, then perhaps  the 12 macroregions may be a possible solution.</p>

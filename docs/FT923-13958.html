			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Reg Vardy slips to Pounds 4.11m but raises pay-out REG VARDY, the multi-franchise motor dealer, lifted its dividend by 11 per cent for the year to April 30. Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said this reflected the board's confidence despite a slip in profits from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 4.11m pre-tax and in turnover from Pounds 182.6m to Pounds 177.5m. Again the best news came from the after-sales operations. Service, parts and bodyshops contributed 46 per cent to group gross profits, up from 43 per cent last time. The long-predicted revival in new car volumes 'failed to materialise', he said. The company sold 23,090 cars in the period - 150 more than previously  -and 63 per cent of these were volume used cars. It sold 14,540 new volume cars. However, Mr Vardy said used car sales had been hit by the drop in new car sales in the past two years which had limited supplies. October's Pounds 12.9m placing and open offer - reducing Mr Vardy's stake to 53 per cent - enabled the company to acquire more dealerships. It now has 21 representing 13 franchises as well as two MotorZone used car centres. Gross profits rose to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 23.1m), but were more than offset by operating expenses up Pounds 2m at Pounds 19.5m. Interest charges fell to Pounds 826,000 (Pounds 1.24m). The final dividend is lifted to 2.7p for a total of 4p (3.6p), payable from earnings of 7.8p (9.4p), diluted by the increased number of shares in issue.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The return to Germany of the 1,300  Bundeswehr servicemen still in Somalia is to be accomplished by  a combined air-sea operation for security reasons, German  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe decided today, a ministry  spokesman announced. The operation is to start at the beginning  of February and -- just like the return of the Americans -- be  completed at the end of March.    The Defense Ministry's plans currently envisage first of  all,  transporting German servicemen from the Somali capital of  Mogadishu by German naval vessels, probably to Mombasa (Kenya).  The return flight to Germany will then be from there.    According to the ministry, Ruehe intends to avoid the  possible risks of transporting them by air in the Mogadishu  area, and thus to aim for a higher degree of security for the  servicemen. The plans were closely connected with the U.S.  Government decision to transport its personnel initially by sea.</p>

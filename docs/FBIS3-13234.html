			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Regarding last Monday's [7 March] operation and the  pro-Israeli militiaman who was captured by the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PLFLP-GC], an  official spokesman for the front has made the following  statement in reply to accusations by the Zionist enemy and its  agents that the PFLP-GC's fighters killed civilians while they  were carrying out their heroic operation on the  al-Rayhan-al-'Ayshiyah Highway last Monday:    If our fighters had actually wanted to kill civilians, they  would not have allowed civilian cars to pass by safely on the  highway, on which our fighters had set up their ambush for the  enemy's patrols and its military agents. While we clarify this  matter for public opinion, we assert that it is the Zionist  enemy's forces that killed the civilians while they were coming  on the scene of the heroic operation in order to chase our  heroic comrades. The PFLP-GC will turn the captive, who was  brought by our comrades, over to the Islamic Resistance after  questioning him.</p>

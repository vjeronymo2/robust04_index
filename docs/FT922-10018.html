			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (10): Coming clean on hazards to life - Hong Kong faces a vast and uniquely complex set of environmental challenges A SHORT walk down Wong Chuk Hang road in Aberdeen should be enough to convince even the most hardened sceptic that Hong Kong faces a vast and uniquely complex set of environmental challenges. Along both sides of the street, a score of high-rise factories produce a terrible clatter and pollute the air with noxious fumes. The continual chatter of nearby construction works and the flow of traffic adds to the cavernous din. But just behind, a string of flats run up the hill and local residents scurry across the road, hands clenched firmly to their noses and ears. Such scenes are typical in Hong Kong where the dense urban population, a virtual absence of planning restrictions and the colony's explosive industrial growth have combined to produce environmental problems which are not just aesthetically displeasing but life-threatening. 'In Hong Kong we had industrial chimneys located five metres from someone's bedroom window. I have no doubt that people were sent to hospital and some even died because of sulphur dioxide poisoning,' says Robert Law, deputy-director of the Environmental Protection Department. The great challenge has been to identify the most serious of the multitude of environmental threats and determine who should be responsible for addressing them. So far there has been a surfeit of bickering between government, business and environmental groups but a shortfall of effective action to tackle the issues. Certainly, the government has appreciated the scale of the problems and has begun to construct a framework for their resolution. In June 1989, the government issued a White Paper on Pollution which catalogued the main threats to Hong Kong's environment. It identified the fact that each day the colony generated 5,000 tonnes of garbage, 2m tonnes of sewage and industrial waste water, 600 tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 200 tonnes of carbon monoxide, and 300 tonnes of nitrogen oxides to say nothing of noise and other wastes generated by industry. The White Paper sketched out a 10-year strategy for dealing with these environmental problems by a combination of persuasion, legislative enforcement, and investments in infrastructure projects, such as a massive scheme which will pipe treated sewage out to sea instead of dumping it in Victoria Harbour. The Environmental Protection Department, which was entrusted with implementing the legislation, has seen a substantial increase in its budget and staffing, which has grown in 10 years from 20 to 1,000. The government can point to some conspicuous successes. Sulphur dioxide emissions have been cut by more than 80 per cent since the introduction of fuel regulations in July 1990. The amount of pig effluents contaminating the water supply has reduced sharply following a policy of buying out polluting farms. But in spite of such efforts, the government has continued to attract fire from industry and the environmental lobby groups who argue it lacks the resources and aggression to do an effective job. Mr Peter Illig, director of the local branch of Friends of the Earth (FoE), says the government is nowhere near stringent enough in enforcing its policies. 'I see a lot of carrots but not enough of the big stick which compromises the integrity of the legislation. 'Why have these issues been around for so long and addressed in the West but not tackled by the most dynamic city in Asia? The government is always behind the eight ball,' he says. Other organisations have also been critical of the policies and have attempted to tackle some problems themselves. One is the Private Sector Committee on the Environment, a group of 16 companies which aims to promote 'market environmentalism'. Local legend has it that the initiative stemmed from William Purves, the chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, who decided 'something must be done' about the environment after being appalled by the mass of floating rubbish in Victoria Harbour which he could see from his office window. But since its establishment three years ago, the committee has broadened its remit by setting up a Centre of Environmental Technology which provides advice on pollution control equipment for small businesses and supplies venture capital funds for various environmental projects. Mr George Cardona, from HKSBC who chairs the committee, says: 'The underlying theme of this organisation is that if you can harness the profit motive you can clean up the environment a lot faster than by government action. Many things done elsewhere by governments are done by business in Hong Kong. It is quite natural for the corporate sector to take a lead.' But such initiatives cut little ice with the FoE, which views market environmentalism as an inherently flawed concept. 'The market will not solve the problem; the market is one of the problems. Pollution is one of the direct effects of the industrial process which functions in a market,' says Mr Illig. He believes it is essential to maintain the pressure on industry and government by raising awareness of environmental issues among Hong Kong's inhabitants. 'If there is no governmental environmental priority it has to come from the local population. Everything that happens between now and 1997 is critical,' he says. Although FoE's 1,600 members are primarily from the expatriate community, other environmental organisations, such as Green Power and the Conservancy Association, have been more active in stirring up the consciences of the Hong Kong Chinese. But Mr Law, of the EPD, believes attitudes have already changed substantially over the past few years and there is now more of a consensus for tough action. 'Everywhere around the world you see that as disposable income grows so do expectations about the quality of life,' he says. In the meantime, the sewage bubbles through manhole covers after heavy rain, teachers still use megaphones to talk to their classes, and local residents say you can tell the season's fashions by the colour of the dyes leaking into the rivers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. State  Department today denied a report that the United States will  seek economic sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea (DPRK).    "At this point, there has not been any U.S. decision taken  about those next steps because we want to work in tandem with  the international community on this and hear back from the IAEA  (the International Atomic Energy Agency)," Department  Spokeswoman Christine Shelly said at a regular news briefing  here.    The WASHINGTON POST today reported that a group of senior  U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and Defense Secretary William Perry, met yesterday at the White  House to prepare for formal diplomatic consultations about  sanctions.    This report was published as the DPRK and IAEA remain  deadlocked over the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsular. The  IAEA wants to conduct further inspections of DPRK's principal  nuclear reactor, but differs with the DPRK over how such  inspections should be conducted.    "Certainly we have looked into the issue and about what kind  of form that might take," Shelly said, but "We are not ready to  actually move to the issue of sanctions yet." "So far, the  IAEA has not informed us that it would be impossible to carry  out analysis of the fuel to determine the reactor's operation  history," she added.    "We're really waiting to hear from the IAEA," Shelly noted,  "We will then be able to make a decision about what is the  appropriate U.S. response."    On Monday [30 May], the U.N. Security Council urged the IAEA  and the DPRK to start immediate consultations over measures  necessary to resolve the issue.</p>

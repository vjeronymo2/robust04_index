			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Rate cut hopes support Dow after poor data Wall Street ANOTHER modest improvement was scored yesterday by the Dow Jones Industrial Average as investors' hopes for a reduction in interest rates were boosted by unexpectedly bad economic data, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow blue chip indicator ended 5.08 firmer at 3,290.70, although below the high for the day when the index momentarily breached 3,300. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, lost a slight 0.21 on balance at 403.83, while the Nasdaq composite index was finally 1.97 off at 551.39. Turnover on the New York SE was 194m shares. The news from the Commerce Department, that durable goods orders fell 2.4 per cent in May, would normally have depressed market sentiment. Analysts had expected a modest rise in May orders, and the reported decline suggested yet again that the economic recovery is extremely sluggish. The market rose on the news because investors interpreted the data as increasing the chances of an easing of policy by the Federal Reserve. If the economy remains weak, analysts believe that the Fed may cut interest rates once more to boost business activity. These hopes were also buoyed by the latest call for lower rates from the White House: President Bush said yesterday that, because of low inflation, there was room for another cut. Tobacco shares fluctuated wildly after the Supreme Court ruled that smokers suffering from cancer can sue cigarette makers under state injury laws. The Court rejected the tobacco industry's argument that all such lawsuits were precluded by federal tobacco-warning requirements, which initially sparked heavy selling, but when the market realised that the Court had restricted the types of claims that can be pursued by litigants, stocks recovered sharply. RJR Nabisco fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 8 3/8 but rallied to end just Dollars  1/8 off at Dollars 9 3/8 in very heavy turnover, and Philip Morris, the other big cigarette group, rebounded from a more than Dollars 2 decline to finish a net Dollars  5/8 up at Dollars 73 3/4 . IBM rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 97 5/8 in busy trading on a press story that several senior board members of the computer group have recently purchased large amounts of IBM shares. Syntex lost Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 on reports that broking house Merrill Lynch had downgraded its rating on the stock. Weyerhaeuser, said to be benefiting from rising lumber prices, caused by logging restrictions related to conserving the natural habitat of spotted owls, put on Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 . Canada TORONTO marked another dull session in the countdown to the end of the second quarter by recording slight losses in slow trade. The composite index shed 3.4 to 3,339.6.</p>

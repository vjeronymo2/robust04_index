			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Arts: Fascinating look at academic dance - Ballet Abandoning fond thoughts of an igloo, we went to the Coliseum on Monday night to be lightly broiled, and to watch the start of English National Ballet's summer season. Dancers like and need heat, their muscles responding gratefully to temperatures that make the rest of us steam. (The sweat spins off the men in pirouettes as from a shower-head.) The programme was the all-dance triple bill on which I reported from Edinburgh's Festival Theatre last week. I think it a good choice, for it shows the company as stronger than for several years. The two opening items - The Kingdom of Shades scene from La Bayadere and XNTricities, that recent Italian acquisition - provide a fascinating display of what has happened to academic dancing from Imperial Petersburg in 1877 to London in 1994. The fourth act of Petipa's great Indian spectacular was the ballet blanc expected by his audience. Moonlight (ENB's lighting wrong on this count: too glaring) and a cohort of women as ghosts, with the ballerina as focus and spiritual heart of the event. Long chains of movement, technical display at its sublimest, and a frisson of emotion to trouble this nocturnal set-piece. ENB's corps looked very good as Shades, moving with the proper inevitability and sense of exultant spirituality. I was less happy about the three soloists - their variations are jewels of the rarest quality, and they seem to think them paste, and dance accordingly  -and Margaret Illman cannot find that transcendent grace and spirituality which lie at the heart of everything Nikiya, the ghostly heroine, does. Her role is a statement about enduring love and about the need for Solor, her beloved, to be true to her. Miss Illman is an able dancer, but the role is not about that. The chief joy of the staging is that it shows Thomas Edur yet again as the finest classical danseur we have. Every canon of academic art is satisfied in his performance. His style is pure, the dance set out with utter integrity, with no concessions to applause-catching. The role lives, and Edur finds its poetry, its character, in the movement - there is a lift, an exultant grace to each step, an inborn dignity to the least gesture. We understand Solor (who is the conventional hero of such ballets) and we understand the unique and hard-won glories of classical technique, in the grand curve of a leap, the lift and grace of a pose. Here is noble dancing - in the greatest traditions of ballet - and it is worth travelling a long way to see. Mauro Bigonzetti's picture of academic dancing in XNTricities (and my admiration of the piece stops short at this stupid title) is frenetic, sexually blatant, and altogether of its time, as was Petipa's moonlit drama. Its merits are Bigonzetti's sense of choreographic progress, his ability to use a clanking electronic score and not be driven mad by it in front of our eyes, and the splendid performances he has inspired from his cast. The spectral bayaderes of half an hour before become predatory, strutting women who pose and kick and twist as they face men no less eager for the battle of the sexes. It is like Petipa's display in providing fantasy images, and like Petipa, Bigonzetti knows how to shape movement. I would admire the piece even more were it ten minutes shorter, but it is compellingly well danced - the cast enlarged since it was first seen earlier this year - and admirably lit. The evening ended with Etudes, that 'Forty-minute Louvre' rush round the dancer's daily labours. It will always delight audiences, who love its sure-fire combination of pirouettes and triumphant smiles, but both production and performances need a sharper edge and greater authority than was manifest on Monday. But with ENB on its present upward path to glory - and long may that continue - these qualities will come. I would like to see the company's account of Etudes in a year's time. English National Ballet's summer season is sponsored by Nomura. The Sleeping Beauty is at the Coliseum until Saturday July 30. ENB continues at the Festival Hall from August 2 to August 13 with Beauty and Coppelia.</p>

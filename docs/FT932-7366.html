			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on D-Mark THE D-MARK weakened inside the European exchange rate mechanism last week and dealers will focus in the next few days on indicators that test the D-Mark's strength against the dollar and other currencies, writes James Blitz. One reason for the softening of the D-Mark is that currency dealers continue to think that the Bundesbank is set to cut short term rates further. This week's provisional data for consumer price inflation in Germany should indicate by how much they intend to do so. The market is expecting another monthly rise in the German CPI, by about 0.3 per cent. This would help to bring down the headline rate of inflation, from 4.3 per cent in the year to April to 4.1 per cent in the year to May. Anything higher than this might alter the Bundesbank's perception of how quickly it should ease monetary policy, keeping the D-Mark firm. The outlook for the dollar/D-Mark rate swill also depend on economic data in the US, including the Conference Board's consumer confidence figures (due tomorrow), the Michigan University consumer confidence figure (due Friday) and the Revised First Quarter GDP figure (also due Friday). Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, believes these figures are likely to underline the sluggishness of the recovery, proving to be dollar negative. In Europe, the key question will be whether sterling, the French franc and high-yielding currencies can consolidate last week's gains against the D-Mark. There are strong expectations, in particular, that the Bank of France will cut its intervention rate today, pushing its repo rate below Germany's for the first time since the winter of 1991. The intervention rate is currently at 7.75 per cent.</p>

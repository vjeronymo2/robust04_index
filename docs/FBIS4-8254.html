			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- The speech delivered by  Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus at the union congress today  did not satisfy the congress participants too much, according to  a mini-poll conducted by CTK.    The delegates expressed their disapproval mainly of what  they  called Klaus's effort to "atomize the unions and force them  merely to the enterprise level". The unionists already  expressed their disapproval when Klaus was speaking. In one  moment a slight whistle could be heard.    Andreas Botsch, an aide to the general secretary of the  Trade  Union Advisory Committee affiliated with the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (TUAC-OECD), called Klaus's  speech an address of a "neoliberalist economist listening with  one ear and seeing with one eye only." Botsch was loudly  applauded for his statement.    According to Botsch, Klaus said that it would be necessary  to  "tighten belts" even in the future. When Botsch finished his  speech, one of the delegates proposed that his address be  adopted as the congress's official response to Klaus's speech.    Some delegates expressed their displeasure at the fact that  Klaus had not apologized for his comparing the union  demonstration on March 22, 1994, with the communist putsch of  February 25, 1948.    In the morning Vladimir Petrus, chairman of the Bohemian and  Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS) said Klaus apologized  by his participation in the congress. "Klaus would have  definitely not attended a conference of participants in a new  February putsch. He came to the congress of his own trade  unions in the Czech Republic and I am personally fully satisfied  with such an apology," Petrus said.</p>

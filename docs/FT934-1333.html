			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Curriculum under further attack Attacks on the framework of the national curriculum are made today by rightwing critics and a leading teachers' union. The Centre for Policy Studies warns that schools forced to work to a detailed national curriculum will be put in a 'straitjacket of dull mediocrity'. Their opposition comes on the day Mr John Patten, the education secretary, is due to receive the final report on the curriculum review by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority. Rightwing educationalists and teachers' unions believe that Sir Ron has not gone far enough in allowing schools extra discretion over what is taught in classrooms. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers says the national curriculum should not be allowed to take up more than 70 per cent of teaching time for any pupils up to the age of 14, at which point it should be scrapped. Sir Ron's provisional recommendations, announced in August, would devote between 75 per cent and 90 per cent of teaching time to the curriculum.

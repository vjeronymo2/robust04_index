			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said he will  come to Athens on Thursday [17 February] in an effort to  convince Greece to support NATO's threat of bombing raids  against the Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo. Claes told  Belgian Television it is sad that Greece has the presidency of  the European Union [EU], which is in danger of losing its  credibility if our country is not convinced to give priority to  the Yugoslav crisis during its term.    Replying to the Belgian foreign minister's statement, Greek  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas stressed that  Greece has given top priority in its EU presidency to settling  the Yugoslav crisis. And added: The Greek position is that  issuing ultimatums to the involved parties in Sarajevo is not  necessary and entails dangers of the spread of the crisis. This  position is well-founded and we believe it will be justified by  developments.</p>

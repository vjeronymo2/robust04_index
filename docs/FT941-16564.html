			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Inquiry stokes Italian political fires Italy's fragile eight-month government headed by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi faces one of its sternest tests this week as parliament votes on a no-confidence motion on Wednesday which could determine Mr Ciampi's future and the timing of new elections. The political tension rose over the weekend after magistrates started interrogating Mr Maurizio Broccoletti and Mr Luigi Bisignani, two central figures in the long-running political corruption scandal, who returned to Italy last week. Both are believed to have access to important evidence which could affect the future of the present government and influence this week's parliamentary debate. The most explosive testimony is expected to come from Mr Broccoletti, a top secret service administrator, extradited from Monaco on Thursday. He has claimed a string of senior ministers regularly received payments from the secret services over the past decade. Mr Broccoletti's allegations include two previous interior ministers, administratively responsible for the secret services, and the present incumbent, Mr Nicolo Mancino. His claims, which come as Italy's political parties manoeuvre frantically for advantage ahead of the no-confidence vote, could provoke further ministerial resignations. They also involve Mr Vincenzo Parisi, head of the national police force. His offer to resign at the weekend was rejected by the government, and he is expected to make a statement to magistrates this week. Allegations of high-level corruption by Mr Broccoletti before he went into hiding rocked the political establishment last November and triggered an unprecedented television address to the nation from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Mr Broccoletti has now raised the stakes by accusing several ministers, and Mr Scalfaro, a former interior minister, of covering up the evidence. The claims, however, have been treated with caution amid a stream of conflicting allegations, including suggestions that some secret service members have been conducting a disinformation campaign against the government. Mr Bisignani, one of the six remaining suspects in hiding in the corruption scandal, surrendered to Milan police on Friday. Magistrates believe he played a vital role passing illegal payments from industry to senior politicians. A former Rome correspondent for the Ansa news agency, Mr Bisignani had high-level political contacts, notably in the Christian Democrat party. He is also believed to have played a central role in transferring large kickbacks from the Montedison chemicals group, where he was head of external relations, to the parties during negotiations to dissolve the Enimont chemicals joint venture in 1990.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Letter: Stand up for copiers Sir, Re your article on the excessive amounts being paid by British business for copiers under some copy plan agreements ('The costly image in the corner of the office', November 2), it is suggested that the Department of Trade and Industry is soon to raise the issue with the Office of Fair Trading. Laudable as this is, if the DTI is serious in its concern for users of copiers, it should also be prepared to stand up to the European Commission as it moves (if history is any guide) inexorably towards imposing hefty anti-dumping duties on all copiers imported from Japan. Canon is not alone in endorsing copy plan contracts which it regards as fair. Minolta has introduced a code of conduct for all its dealers obliging them to let their customers know precisely where they stand whenever they buy a Minolta. Simon Holmes, Theodore Goddard, (solicitor to Minolta), 150 Aldersgate Street, London EC1A 4EJ</p>

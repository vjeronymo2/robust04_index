			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Wasserstein founder goes back to CSFB Mr Charles Ward, one of the founding partners of investment banking firm Wasserstein Perella, has rejoined CS First Boston, marking the latest in a run of senior defections in the mergers and acquisitions sector in the US. Mr Ward was one of four senior First Boston executives who founded the advisory boutique in 1988, along with co-heads of investment banking Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, at the time the two most celebrated M&amp;A advisers on Wall Street. He is now rejoining the bank (since renamed CS First Boston) as joint head of investment banking and head of the investment banking business in Europe. Mr Ward was made president of Wasserstein Perella's advisory unit last July, after Mr Perella defected to join Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley itself had earlier lost Mr Bob Greenhill, one of Wall Street's top advisers, to Smith Barney Shearson. Wasserstein Perella, which has experienced a dearth of M&amp;A business compared with its prominent role in the late-1980s, played down the significance of the departure. 'Chuck got offered a job that was too good to be true,' one senior executive said, adding that the move did not reflect any dissatisfaction with Wasserstein. The executive added that the bank had seen a pick-up in M&amp;A work, including advising Bell South on its investment in QVC to back the home-shopping company's bid for Paramount. Mr Ward, 41, joins CS First Boston as it is trying to build a more broadly based international investment banking business. It has been held back in the past by rivalries between its strong London and US-based operations. The competition for M&amp;A specialists has intensified in recent months, signalling a belief by investment banks that the business will continue to rebound after a three-year lull.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'KING OF THE RIGHT' HEADED THE WRONG WAY  </P> <P> As a 19-year-old, maybe I have luckily escaped the scheme of William F. Buckley  Jr. (a.k.a. Dr. Pangloss) to force 18-year-olds into some sort of an  indoctrination program a la the Chinese Communists so they can learn the error  of their ways and dutifully worship their country.  </P> <P> Having grown up with The Great Communicator, I find I now must cope with The  Great Hallucinator.  </P> <P> You state: "William F. Buckley Jr. . . . is best known for sparking an  intellectual movement that eventually swept Ronald Reagan into the White House.  . . ."  </P> <P> Any teen-ager who can read should know that with Reagan came deregulation and  with that (came) Michael Milken and lesser lights, and $500 billion kind of  disappeared from the savings and loan associations. I disagree that this  generation has not been called upon to make sacrifices. We'll have to cough up  that $500 billion for one thing.  </P> <P> If any generation needs reorientation in its sense of values, it would seem to  me to be Buckley's.  </P> <P> Why doesn't he organize a senior citizens' corps (with appropriate sanctions,  of course, for noncompliance). If grabbing a shovel and attempting to  ameliorate the damage his generation is doing to our environment is not to his  taste or physical condition, maybe he can use his vast mental powers and  vocabulary to sway the Charles Hurwitzes of this country not to saw the  nation's redwoods and the Neil Bushes not to give away other people's money.  </P> <P> NATHAN GOFF  </P> <P> Reno, Nev.  </P></p>

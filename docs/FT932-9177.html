			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia tries to shore up sagging coffee market COLOMBIA, THE world's second biggest coffee producer, yesterday tried to put a floor under the world's sagging coffee prices. But many analysts were sceptical that the attempt was strong enough to have much effect. After opening more than 1.5 cents higher, the New York nearby arabica contract fell back to 58.80 cents a lb in late trading, just 0.40 ahead. In London, the July robusta contract tested the Dollars 900 barrier again, but closed at Dollars 881, a rise of just Dollars 6 on the day. The markets had expected something from Colombia but appeared to be disappointed at the action taken. The country has set an effective floor of 60 cents a lb, below which it will not sell coffee. 'We were expecting them to say they would not sell unless the price went up,' said one analyst yesterday. 'Instead they have said they will not sell if the price falls further. It's an anti-climax.' London traders said the market had not even moved above its recent narrow trading range. 'Colombia doing something on a unilateral basis does not preclude other countries selling into any rally,' one pointed out. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, said the Colombians had very little coffee left to shift, demand was low in the run-up to the northern summer and western consumer stocks were high. 'If they had done this last November it might have been a different story.' ED&amp; F. Man, the London broker, this week pointed out that Colombian exports in the last two months had fallen to 1.2m bags (60 kgs each) compared with an average 1.5m bags in the first five months of 1992-93. Man also put world consumer stocks at 20.5m bags - a level equal to the previous peak last September. Mr Eagles believed high stocks and an expected increase in Brazil's crop would be enough to push the nearby New York contract back below 50 cents this summer. Last year the market hit a low of 48.10 cents a lb in August.</p>

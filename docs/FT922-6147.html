			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: JS Pathology in possible bid talks JS Pathology, the clinical laboratory, yesterday said it was in talks which could lead to a bid, following a 33 per cent jump in its share price to 153p. Mr Eric Rothbarth, finance director, said the talks were friendly although they had been instigated by the other party, believed to be a medical services corporation. The subjects discussed did not necessarily mean a bid, he added. An announcement is expected within the next few weeks.</p>

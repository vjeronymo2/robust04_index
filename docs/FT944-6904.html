			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Faint green light for privatisation: Investors' hopes For two years Mr Serhii Oksanich was a capitalist in waiting. He and a group of friends established Kinto, a Kiev investment and securities fund, in the spring of 1992, but for the first two years there were no securities for them to trade. 'Our main activity for the past two years has been waiting for privatisation,' Mr Oksanich said. The failure of Ukraine's first post-independence government to launch serious economic reforms, including a mass privatisation programme, meant months of frustration and false starts for Kinto and the other 400 registered security traders in Ukraine. Over the past few months, however, things have finally began to change. Over the summer, 150 large and medium-scale enterprises were privatised using the certificates granted, with a system of daunting complexity, to each Ukrainian. In a series of closed tender bids to be closed by the end of this month, 300 more factories have gone on the block this autumn. But Ukraine's nascent privatisation is one of eastern Europe's best kept secrets. In Russia and the Czech Republic, committed governments launched carefully structured, highly publicised mass privatisation programmes. In Ukraine the sell-off of factories is happening not with a bang but with a whimper. It has been not a product of policy at the highest levels but the quiet result of grassroots enthusiasm. 'They've finally let the genie out of the bottle,' Mr Oksanich said. 'The process is rotten and they've only let a little bit of privatisation happen, but now that it's started there's no way to stop it. The only question is the details and the speed of the process.' The government of former President Leonid Kravchuk, which authored the current programme, was at best a luke-warm supporter of privatisation. As a result, the existing plan is awkward and the bureaucracy has held the process back. Western aid officials in Kiev describe the existing programme as 'a disaster'. 'You cannot speak about meaningful mass participation in the privatisation process,' says Ms Roberta Feldman, of the International Financial Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank. 'The programme is complicated and the government did not take a leading role.' Western officials are optimistic that under the new leadership of President Leonid Kuchma things will change. They hope that in the new year Ukraine will begin a public, well-publicised privatisation programme similar to that of its neighbours. Businessmen like Mr Oksanich are equally hopeful that, at last, they now have a government willing to support the development of a market economy rather than block it. But, like many Ukrainians, who are estimated to obtain two-thirds of their income outside the official economy, Ukrainian investment funds are not waiting for the green light from Kiev. Instead, they have displayed remarkable ingenuity in navigating a multitude of official road blocks. 'De jure you cannot buy and sell certificates and foreigners cannot participate in the process,' Mr Oksanich says. 'But de facto it's easy to get around.' He estimates that about 6m privatisation certificates have already been invested in Ukraine either in worker buy-outs or by the investment funds. A fledgling secondary market in shares in some of these privatised companies already exists, he says, and he expects about 30 companies to be freely traded by the end of the year on what he calls 'our baby Nasdaq system' pioneered a few weeks ago. Ukraine's subterranean privatisation has already caught the attention of a few western investment banks active in eastern Europe and Russia. Several bankers said they were considering setting up operations in Ukraine in the next few months. But if privatisation in Ukraine, potentially the largest market in eastern Europe, has been so devious as to escape the attention of most official western observers, they are not alone. Mr Oksanich concedes that for most ordinary Ukrainians 'privatisation certificates remain largely a myth'. He says he has avoided paying speeding tickets for the past year by explaining to policemen how to use their privatisation bank accounts. 'They tell me they didn't know about this, thank me for the explanation and let me drive off,' Mr Oksanich says.</p>

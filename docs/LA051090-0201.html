			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CSUF WINS GRANT FOR FIBER OPTICS LAB  </P> <P> The National Science Foundation has awarded Cal State Fullerton $47,451 to  equip a laboratory for undergraduate training and research in fiber optics and  lasers.  </P> <P> It would be the first such project in California for undergraduate students,  said Keith H. Wanser, an assistant professor of physics who sought the grant.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton is matching the foundation's grant, and an additional  $30,000 is being sought from private industry.  </P> <P> "The University of Southern California has a center like this for graduate  students, but there is nothing like this for the undergraduate," Wanser said  Wednesday. "It will give the students a . . . 20th-Century experience that will  take them into the 21st Century."  </P> <P> The major focus of study will be in high-speed communications and how to make  fiber optic sensors.  </P> <P> "Fiber optics is going to be a very dominant thing in the future," Wanser said.  </P> <P> Preparing Fullerton's physics and engineering majors to work with the latest  technology is essential, he said.  </P> <P> "Ninety percent of our graduates go straight into industry, and they need that  lab experience with modern instrumention and equipment."  </P></p>

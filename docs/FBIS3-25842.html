The buildings, providing 17,000 square meters of space, are  designed for the study and residence of the 163 overseas  students at the college.    The college is the chief educational center of traditional  Chinese medicine in China. The overseas students who have  enrolled since September 1992 come from 18 countries and regions  in the world, including the United States, Germany, Denmark, the  Republic of Korea, Japan and Singapore.    Yu Tiecheng, assistant to the president of the college, said  that with more and more people becoming interested in  traditional Chinese medicine, the college will expand its  enrollment of overseas students.    He said that the students to be enlisted into the college  next year will reach 500. Last year there were more than 400  overseas applicants for study at the college. But the shortage  of buildings limited the capacity of the college, which took on  only 70.    The construction project includes 12,000-square-meter  residential buildings and a 5,000-square-meter classroom  building.    Sponsored by the Tianjin Traditional Medical College, the  International College of Traditional Chinese Medicine offers  undergraduate and post-graduate courses of traditional Chinese  medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese pharmacy.</p>

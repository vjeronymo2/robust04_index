			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Article [Article by Sergey Gulyy, under rubric "Analysis and </F> Forecast": "Not Quite Statesmen: In Exchange for the Full Price  the Voters Got Only an Empty Derzhavnaya Bottle"]    [Text] A Pioneer is a good example for all children. And a  deputy is the same kind of mirror of society. Under communism,  the party used to select the deputies: so many bachelors, so  many representatives of national minorities, so many women,  retirees, milking-machine operators... You were supposed to be  able, on the basis of "the poeople's choices," to judge the  quality of the initial raw materials. The mirror could also make  slight improvements. But now anybody can become a deputy.    It is curious to compare what the "people" and its best  exemplars think about one and the same question. If their views  coincide, that means that something is wrong with the "people."  So let's take advantage of Citizen Pashkov's Mneniye [Opinion]  service. A survey involving "international" questions was  conducted among 211 members of the Duma, who represent all the  parliamentary factions, and also among ordinary Muscovites and  other Russians. The results were rounded off to entire  percentages.    Test for "presence of lice." Should Alaska belong to Russia  or the United States. Exactly half of both groups responded: to  the United States.    What about Crimea? It should belong to us, according to 51  percent of the deputies and 61 percent of the other inhabitants.  An additional 40 percent of the parliamentarians agree to a  compromise. Among the civilian population the number of people  unwilling to make a compromise is twice as large -- only 18  percent are in favor of a compromise.    "Is Russia threatened by an aggression against it by the  year  2000?" "Completely possible" -- 26 percent of the Duma deputies,  but only one percent of the Muscovites. "Unavoidable" -- one  percent of the Duma deputies and 22 percent of the Muscovites.  It turns out that, among one-fourth of the city dwellers,  including the parliamentarians who are temporarily registered in  the capital, there is something wrong with the "roof."    There is somewhat of a lack of coincidence with regard to  Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, the longtime  favorite of Yeltsin's opponents. His resignation is supported by  17 percent of the Muscovites and by 3 times as many deputies.  The spread among the various factions is astonishing: 100  percent of the Zyuganovite Communists vote in favor of  elimination; and 100 percent of the liberals from 12 Dekabrya  [12 December] support Kozyrev. The respondents who are closest  to the Muscovites' opinion are Shakhrayites from PRES.    When we evaluate the deputies' attitude to the possible  secession of the South Kurile Islands and East Prussia from  Russia, it turns out that, as compared with the evicted  Khasbulatovites, the Rybkinites, even if they have begun to be a  bit more tight-fisted, have done so only barely. Thus, four  years ago 20 percent in one form or another agreed with the need  to expand Japan at the expense of the "northern territories,"  but now only 17 percent do. Only a slightly larger number of  Duma deputies are tied to Kaliningrad: 6 percent in 1990 were in  favor of returning it, but only 2 percent today.    In conclusion, the deputies' opinion concerning Yeltsin's  foreign policy and certain sharp questions about the state  system. It turns out that they are much less decisive about  these matters than one would assume. Only 58 percent are in  favor of cutting off economic aid to other countries; and only  56 percent are in favor of reinforcing the customs system in the  CIS, by closing only the transparent borders. An entire fourth  -- 24 percent --are in favor of letting Chechnya go with our  blessing, and an additional 21 percent are in favor of letting  the Dniester region go also (that is, are in favor of the  withdrawal of the 14th Army).    In general, if one believes Mneniye, the members of the  State  Duma, 1993 convocation, proved to be much lesser statesmen that  one could have assumed by listening to their campaign promises.  They voted, in order to annoy Yeltsin, in favor of outright  loudmouths who did not necessarily share their views. And with a  consideration of the deputy metamorphosis, practically speaking,  they got themselves. The voting "against," plus the  counterdeception of the people's choices provided the  preservation of the status quo and the more than adequate  representation in the Duma of the moods of the "masses," at  least with regard to international matters. So, children, do not  become deputies. They are dishonest, they do not love their  Homeland sufficiently, and, in addition, they secretly support  Uncle Yeltsin.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |In your opinion, is there a threat that there will be military aggression ag-|  |ainst our country before the year 2000?                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |State Duma               |Moscow                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Impossible               |23.0                     |30.1                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Not very probable        |45.9                     |28.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know               |3.8                      |18.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Completely possible      |26.3                     |1.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Unavoidable              |1.0                      |21.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Japanese government insists of the resolution of the territorial problem,|  | that is, the return of the "northern territories."

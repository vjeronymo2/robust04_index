			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indians press for ban on chrome ore export INDIAN producers of charge chrome have decided to resume the campaign for a total ban on ore export, although the country has one of the largest reserves of chrome ore (chromite). Their earlier efforts resulted in the government restricting the export of certain grades of ore. The producers are aware that the government, faced with the worst foreign exchange crisis in memory, will be in no mood to accept the suggestion of a total ban. They are expected to concentrate on getting lump ore and ores with chromium content of more than 42 per cent removed from the export list. The country has total proven reserves of more than 150m tonnes, with about 100m tonnes at depths of less than 100 metres. Producers want the government to direct mining companies to raise only enough ore for domestic requirements. What they, however, have not taken into account is that mining can become uneconomical if the level of activity is drastically reduced. India exports nearly 300,000 tonnes of chrome ore a year out of total raisings of about 1m tonnes, mostly to Japan and Europe. There is a value addition of more than 100 per cent when the ore is processed into charge chrome. Depressed international and domestic market conditions mean that the charge chrome units are not able to utilise even 50 per cent of their installed capacity. Most of the marginal units have already gone out of business. Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys, Indian Charge Chrome and Ferro Alloys Corporation - all big exporters - are struggling. More than 90 per cent of Indian chrome ore is found in the Sukinda belt of Orissa. Tatas, India's largest industrial house, and Orissa Minerals Corporation (OMC) , a state undertaking, between them have leasehold more than 90 per cent of established ore deposits in India. The charge chrome producers complain that because of this monopoly situation, the prices of ore charged by mine owners have no relation to the cost of raisings , but rather to what the processors can bear.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Palestinian police enter Gaza Strip Israel began a long-delayed transfer of authority to the PLO in the Gaza Strip last night, handing over the first military base to Palestinian police officers, Reuter reports. The handover in the town of Deir al-Balah came hours after a first group of 157 policemen had moved into Gaza from Egypt. Gaza's streets were filled with thousands of excited Palestinians witnessing the transition into the early hours of this morning. Under the terms of the peace accord, Israel will transfer all civilian and policing authority to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho within weeks. A senior adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said 1,800 policemen would be deployed in Gaza and 400 in Jericho by Friday. The policemen who arrived yesterday were unarmed and dressed in olive-drab uniforms. They brought in 24 jeeps. They were stuck for hours at the Rafah border terminal in southern Gaza, apparently delayed by bureaucratic snags.</p>

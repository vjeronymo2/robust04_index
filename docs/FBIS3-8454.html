It considers his claim about the Association's almost  illegal conduct to be, to say the least, false. This statement  is contained in a letter handed to TA SR by ASV Chairman  Lieutenant-Colonel Milan Stegena.    According to the letter, the ASV Presidium has weighed the  reasons and circumstances associated with them for the planned  nationwide commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the  repulsion of Hungarian aggression in March 1939 and, after  taking all of them into consideration, especially the  organizational requirements, has decided to hold the event on 26  March.</p>

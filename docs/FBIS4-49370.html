			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Shu (3769 2992): "Is the U.S Strategic Focus </F> Shifting Eastward?"]    [Text] There are different ideas on whether or not the  United States is changing its strategic focus (some call it the  diplomatic strategic focus). Some say its focus is still  Europe, while others say its focus has already switched to the  Asia-Pacific region (or East Asia), and still others say its  focus is in the process of switching from Europe to the  Asia-Pacific region. I would like to express my views on this.    Unquestionably, after Clinton assumed office, the U.S.  Government laid more emphasis than in the past on strengthening  its economic and trade relations with the Asia-Pacific region.  To put it more accurately, it will, as some Western academics  said, strengthen its economic and trade relations with the East  Asian region, where "economic miracles have appeared." The  United States has always maintained close relations with Japan,  Austria, and Canada, and regarded Japan as an important pillar  supporting its Asia policy. In the last few years, East Asia has  made rapid economic development, expanded its market, and  performed what many Western academics call "East Asian miracles."    According to an estimate, the Asian "four small dragons'"  GNP's increased by 5.6 percent last year and are expected to  increase by 6.5 percent this year; ASEAN's GNP increased by 6.4  percent last year and is expected to increase by 7.2 percent  this year. China became the "locomotive of the East Asian  economy" and registered a 13.4 percent growth last year. Aiming  to "invigorate the U.S economy," the Clinton administration is  trying to cure its economic sickness, which has disturbed the  United States for a long time, to cope with the  ever-intensifying world competition and preserve its leading  position in the world. This being the case, the United States  of course wants to seize the so-called "newly emerging  opportunity" to explore East Asia -- "a market full of vitality"  -- and to compete against other developed nations for a  favorable position in this market.    But in developing economic cooperation with the East Asian  region and taking this region as a diplomatic focal point, the  United States does not mean to switch its strategic focus from  Europe to Asia. Similarly, the United States, Canada, and  Mexico have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement and  are trying to expand this plan to all of Latin America. This  only indicates the U.S. effort to strengthen economic  cooperation with American nations and does not mean that the  United States wishes to switch its strategic focus from Europe  to the American nations. Europe has always served as the corner  stone for U.S. strategy. Despite the disintegration of the  bi-polar pattern and the Soviet Union, Europe still remains  unsettled. As many Western academics point out, Europe is the  region with the most developed economic, scientific, and  technological foundation in the world; the United States has  major economic, political, and strategic security interests in  Europe; and Europe is an important investment region for the  United States; so to maintain its leading position in the world,  the United States, as always, will need the support and  cooperation of developed European nations. The end of the Cold  War and East-West confrontation has not changed the fact that  major U.S. interests are in Europe or that Europe is  strategically important to the United States. Moreover, the  change in the international situation has caused many new  problems and contradictions to become more complicated. The  United States and Russia are on guard against each other and  suspicious about each other. Examples are a recent exposure of  Russian spies in the United States and expulsions of one other's  diplomats. A Russian leader said that Russia is a big country,  not a small companion. The turbulent political situation in  Russia, the deterioration of its economic difficulties, the  fluctuations of its reform measures, and, particularly, the  growth of extreme nationalists and rightist forces, have all  made the United States uneasy. There are many economic,  political, and social difficulties in republics of the former  Soviet Union and conflicts are serious between these republics,  as well as between these republics and Russia. Some of them  have resorted to the use of arms. East European nations are  facing great internal and external difficulties and unstable  situations, fear the reemergence of Russian chauvinism, and are  not sure how important the role of their "peaceful partnership"  with NATO will be.    In addition, since the disappearance of the Soviet Union --  this common enemy -- the coherent force of Western nations,  particularly that of NATO, has become tremendously lax,  nationalist feelings and the wish for independence are  escalating, and differences and conflicts between various NATO  countries -- as well as between NATO and the United States --  are increasing along with frictions and contradictions in their  economic and trade relations. And following the rapid  development of information technology, Western developed  countries are facing intense global competition in this field.    Following the disintegration of the bi-polar pattern and  the emergence of a multipolar world, the previously suppressed  and concealed nationalist and religious feelings have strongly  risen, broken out, or aggravated ethnic conflicts and clashes,  seriously affecting the stability of regional situations and  social progress. The ethnic armed clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the so-called "powder keg" of the Balkan peninsula, which is  populated with many different nationalities, are particularly  intense and cruel. Refugees are flooding developed European  regions and are expanding to larger regions. In addition, there  are many ethnic problems in Europe and other countries, and  because of economic difficulties and serious unemployment,  nationalism is rising and rightists' and new fascists'  activities are increasing. This has found expression in  Russian, German, and Italian elections. The deterioration of  ethnic and religious disputes and armed conflicts in Europe's  surrounding regions, such as the Middle East, North Africa, and  west Asia, has also caused concern. Western newspapers pointed  out that most of the explosive points and tense regions in the  world are in Europe and its surrounding countries.    Viewing all these, we can say that the situation in Europe  is  not stable. In the present-day world, it is not easy for the  United States to maintain a balance and stability between all  forces in Europe or to preserve its leading position and  strategic interests there. Such being the case, it is quite  hard to presume that in the predictable future the United States  will switch its strategic focus (including its diplomatic  strategic focus) from the turbulent Europe to the comparatively  stable Asia-Pacific region or East Asia. Of course, the view  that the U.S. strategic focus is still in Europe does not hamper  us from assuming that it values and is strengthening economic  cooperation with Asia-Pacific or East Asian nations; developing  economic cooperation with them will be favorable to  strengthening its strategic position in Europe. Even during the  previous period of U.S.-Soviet tense confrontation and  contention the United States never overlooked the changes in  other regions' situations. For the United States, Europe's  strategic position is more important than Asia's. Although East  Asia is making fast economic development, it is still far behind  developed European regions in terms of economic and  technological foundation, nor can its capital and personnel be  compared with these regions'. For a long time to come, East  Asia will not be able to surpass Europe. At present, the United  States is strengthening its relations with the Asia-Pacific  region, but it is impossible and unnecessary for the United  States to switch its strategic focus from Europe to the Asia-  Pacific region now. As President Clinton said not long ago,  "Europe is still where U.S. interests lie" and the U.S.  "security nucleus is still in Europe."</p>

Participants of international meetings including the  international hearing on sexual enslavement by the Japanese Army  and the 49th session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights  denounced the crimes of the Japanese imperialists in driving  millions of Korean young and middle-aged people like beasts of  burden and murdering over a million Korean people and making  fortunes by carrying away a large amount of resources and  valuable cultural relics.    At a meeting of the sub-commission on prevention of  discrimination and protection of minorities, a representative of  the Liberation Organization said that the Japanese imperialists  had drafted over six million Korean young and middle-aged people  to work them hard and its government and military deprived the  Koreans of their language and names and forced them to worship  the Japanese emperor.    Lourder Indai Sajor, coordinator of the Asian women human  rights council task force for Filipino victims of military  sexual slavery by Japan, said that the crimes of the Japanese  imperialists in depriving women of their rights and reducing  them to sexual slaves were most hideous anti-human,  special-class crimes without parallel in history, that they were  heinous crimes against human rights and humanity in view of  international law. Campton Makamure, chairman of the Zimbabwe  Association of Democratic Jurists, said that the Japanese  imperialists established a medieval colonial rule after  occupying Korea and murdered over a million Korean people in  cold blood and drafted nearly 200,000 innocent Korean women as  sexual slaves of the Japanese Army.    "If Japan really has the intention to improve its relations  with the DPRK and contribute to world peace and security, it  must repent of and apologize for its past crimes and show its  sincerity in practice," he urged.</p>

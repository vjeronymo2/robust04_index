			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Blueprint for Hong Kong: 'Not far enough' say colony'sliberals MR Patten's proposals for democratic reform have angered the colony's liberals who argue the changes do not go far enough. Liberals were particularly angered by Mr Patten's announcement that the colony's quasi cabinet, the Executive Council, would be closed to all party politicians and that the executive and legislative councils would be split. Mr Martin Lee, Hong Kong's prominent democracy activist, said splitting the councils was 'the easy way out for the British government. It is a retrograde step. 'What he should have done was do the right and honourable thing by giving us full democracy now and using the next four-and-a-half years to convince China. Poll after poll shows that the people want democracy although they know China would not approve. 'I can't think of a single proposal he made that the last governor could not have done.' Professor Peter Harris, a political scientist at the colony's university, explaining the negative reaction to Mr Patten's proposals said: 'The constitutional changes are going to hit a lot of people who had a lot of power in this town for a long time. They're going to lose a lot of face.' However, business analysts welcomed Mr Patten's blueprint - but said investors should wait to see the extent of China's anger before loosening their purse strings. 'The mood in the trading room was very relaxed after the speech,' said Mr Howard Gorges, managing director of South China Securities. Mr Paul Cheng, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce welcomed the framework of an executive-led 'yet more accountable government'. He also said the chamber applauded the governor's Business Council, 'which provides an opportunity for a direct dialogue and close co-operation between the business community and the governor'.</p>

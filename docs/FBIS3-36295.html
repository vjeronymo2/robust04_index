According to the law, after the elections, which will be held on  June 26 simultaneously with presidential elections, the  Ukrainian law on presidential representatives will become  ineffective.    Under the law, chairmen of local councils of people's  deputies are elected by the population of a region and become  heads of executive committees of the corresponding councils.  They are subordinate to the corresponding local councils.    In issues related to authorities of the state and executive  powers, local councils are subordinate to the Cabinet and  executive bodies of superior councils.</p>

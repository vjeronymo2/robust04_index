			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUIT CHARGES CINEPLEX BACKED OUT OF 25  FILMS  </P> <P> Cineplex Odeon Corp. and its Los Angeles-based subsidiaries have been sued by a  director and two entertainment executives who allege Cineplex backed out of a  deal to produce 25 films. The suit was brought by two executives of New Vision  Entertainment Corp., co-chairman Samuel Schulman and chief executive Irvine  Levin, and director Angelo Drossos.  </P> <P> Cineplex's alleged actions caused Carolco, a movie producer and distributor, to  back out of negotiations with the plaintiffs to produce the movies -- an  agreement that would have brought the plaintiffs about $11 million, according  to the suit.  </P> <P> It seeks unstated damages plus punitive damage.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Cineplex, a theater operator and entertainment company based  in Toronto, said that she had "no information" about the suit, which was filed  Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

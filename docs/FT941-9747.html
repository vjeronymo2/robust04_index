			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Pru takes a new line An early sign of the sort of product innovation that is likely to be a feature of the life assurance sector over the coming months because of commission disclosure has been given by the Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer. Prudential will launch a single recurring premium pension - called Premium Option - in March, aimed at the company's sales through independent financial advisers. The new product will offer advisers several ways to choose how they take their commission (from 0 per cent to 5.2 per cent of each contribution each year, and up to 20 per cent up-front as a lump sum payment in respect of the first five years' commission). It is also intended to improve early surrender values for customers. The proposals from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, to ensure that sales agents tell customers how much they will be paid in commission for selling a particular product, are due to come into effect from the start of July. There will be a six-month transitional period before every company and adviser must comply with the requirement. Several life companies are planning new product ranges with differing structures so that customers and IFAs can choose from a variety of commission arrangements once the disclosure provisions come into effect.</p>

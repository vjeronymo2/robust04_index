In the course of registration that lasted from March 22 to  25, 3,684 registration questionnaires were fulfilled. In  addition, a list of 892 Russian military and their families is  in the possession of Estonian Government. Children up to 16  years were inscribed in the questionnaires of their parents and  their exact amount, estimated at about one thousand, will be  clear after the questionnaires are analysed. Another thousand  people did not, for some reason, appear at the registration.  Olesk added that people that did not register themselves will  have difficulties in moving in the town when the dismantling  work of the nuclear reactor at the former military base will  start and people that do not have a registering inscription in  their documents or do not possess a special permission to be in  the town, will be detained until their identification is  determined.    Up to now the exact number and composition of population in  Paldiski, largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and  Russian military, was not known, for the former town  authorities, subject to Russian military authorities and  dissolved by a law adopted by Estonian Riigikogu [parliament] on  March 9, refused to hand over data on the subject.</p>

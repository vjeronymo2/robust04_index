			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow defies jobs data to post modest gains Wall Street AFTER threatening in the morning to break below a key support level for the Dow index, US stock markets defied disappointing employment news to end the day with modest gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow was up 14.99 at 3,249.11, having been more than 20 points down at midday. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 staged a similar turnaround, finishing up 1.06 at 401.56. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, however, fell 3.81 to 590.01. Turnover was 189m shares. The keenly awaited March employment report showed a 19,000 rise in non-farm payrolls and a 34 per cent downward revision in the initially estimated 164,000 rise in February payrolls. Although the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.3 per cent last month, the data overall were a blow to hopes that the economic recovery was well under way. Disappointment at the jobs news unleashed immediate selling, and pushed the Dow near to 3,200 at midday. The morning's declines created buying opportunities, however, and the market rebounded in the afternoon with most of the gains coming in the final hour. The employment data were welcomed by the Treasury markets and in late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 101 7/16 , yielding 7.867 per cent, and the two-year note was up  7/32 at 100, yielding 5.363 per cent. CMS Energy eased another Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 15 5/8 in turnover of 3.7m shares after Michigan regulators rejected a proposal on how much the company's consumer power unit should pay for electricity from a power generation venture half-owned by CMS. Broking stocks remained under pressure on fears that the recent boom in stock and bond offerings was over. Merrill Lynch fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 51, PaineWebber lost Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 19 1/8 and AG Edwards slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22 7/8 . Canada TORONTO stocks closed lower in moderate volume of 26.25m shares, the 300 composite index falling 10.43 to 3385.48.</p>

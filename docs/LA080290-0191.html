			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER RESIGNS OVER ILLEGAL USE OF LICENSE TAG  </P> <P> A veteran Ventura police detective and community college instructor has  resigned from the force after pleading no contest to illegally displaying on  his 1965 Cadillac a license tag that was stripped from an abandoned automobile,  authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Officer Ronald L. Wyatt, 45, was sentenced to one year's probation and fined  $210 by Municipal Court Judge Herbert Curtis III, who on May 23 found Wyatt  guilty of a misdemeanor involving personal use of a license stick-on tag that  had been assigned to another vehicle, court records show.  </P> <P> A 1990 license for the 25-year-old Cadillac, which Wyatt told investigators he  was buying from a friend, would have cost about $30, a spokeswoman for the  state Department of Motor Vehicles said.  </P> <P> Wyatt, of Moorpark, could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Charles  Goldwasser, declined comment.  </P> <P> Lt. Pat Rooney, spokesman for the Ventura Police Department, would not discuss  the case except to confirm that Wyatt had resigned recently after about 20  years on the force.  </P> <P> Wyatt, a former narcotics officer, was assigned to general investigations at  the time of his resignation, according to the department.  </P> <P> Wyatt has also taught criminal justice courses at Ventura College for several  years, including two classes -- Introduction to Criminal Justice and  Fundamentals of Law Enforcement -- this past spring, the college confirmed.  </P> <P> The Police Department became aware of the illegal tag on Wyatt's car on April  16, nearly one month after he left the vehicle in the department's parking lot,  according to police investigative reports on file with the Municipal Court.  Another officer assumed that the car had been abandoned and began an  investigation.  </P> <P> Wyatt promptly moved the vehicle from the parking lot. When it was seized as  evidence the next day, the sticker had been removed, the reports said.  </P> <P> In an interview with police Sgt. Bob Anderson, Wyatt twice denied that he had  placed the illegal tag on his car, Anderson reported.  </P> <P> But Wyatt acknowledged that he was familiar with the abandoned vehicle from  which the tag had been taken, saying the vehicle was kept at a Santa Paula  storage yard operated by a friend from whom Wyatt had arranged to buy the  Cadillac, the report said. Wyatt also acknowledged knowing the combination to  the lock at the storage yard.  </P> <P> Wyatt reportedly said he believed that the 1990 sticker on his Cadillac was one  of several he had checked out from the Police Department. It is common  department practice for officers on undercover and other special details to  check out tags from seized vehicles to cover the law-enforcement plates and  tags on their automobiles, the report said.  </P> <P> The department forwarded the results of its criminal investigation to the  district attorney in late April, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim Gibbons filed the  misdemeanor count May 15, records show. Eight days later Wyatt entered his  no-contest plea.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINDS FAN BLAZE IN BRITAIN'S MOORS  </P> <P> More than 100 firefighters worked around the clock Thursday battling a blaze  that swept across about 1,000 acres of the dry, heather-covered moors of a  national park.  </P> <P> The fire threatens some of Britain's most valuable grouse moors and one of the  loveliest valleys in the North Yorkshire Dales, a region known to the world  from James Herriot's descriptions in "All Creatures Great and Small."  </P> <P> Additional firefighters were called in late Thursday to reinforce those who had  been trying to contain the blaze, which began Wednesday.  </P> <P> Firefighters and officials of Dales National Park urged people to stay out of  the area. The blaze, which firefighters believe was ignited by a discarded  burning cigarette, is being fanned by winds sweeping across northern England.  </P></p>

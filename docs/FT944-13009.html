			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kawasaki does better than most - Mixed first-half results for Japan's heavy industry groups Japan's heavy industry manufacturers and shipbuilders reported mixed first-half results due to the yen's sharp appreciation and a weak domestic economy in the first half of 1994. Fortunes were divided, depending on the different mix of businesses each is involved in, but sales from shipbuilding, large power plants and steel structures for the private sector were generally lacklustre. On the other hand, the government's public spending programme increased sales from waste disposal facilities, now becoming a growing business for heavy machinery makers. While the companies said the yen's sharp appreciation had not yet affected sales - as large orders, particularly for ships, that are being translated into sales now are yen-denominated - it was biting into profits. A one-yen rise against the US dollar has the effect of wiping of Y1bn off profits, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries indicated. At the same time, private capital spending has remained weak in Japan, and not all companies were able to balance this with firm orders from the public sector. But on the whole, shipbuilders were able to cut costs and raise profitability through increased procurement of lower-priced parts from overseas and reductions in fixed costs. One of the better performers in the half was Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Japan's second largest shipbuilder. Its shipbuilding division enjoyed a 42 per cent rise in sales. Sales in its industrial plant and steel division rose 36 per cent while its environmental and power plant unit rose by 30 per cent. But its motorcycle business was hit by the yen's appreciation, forcing it to revise its full-year forecast for total sales by Y10bn (Dollars 103m) as it expects the impact of the strong yen to continue to put pressure on motorcycle sales. At the other end of the scale was Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding which reported a 69 per cent drop in recurring profits and passed its interim dividend. Mitsui suffered from a sharp 50 per cent fall in its industrial plant division. Mitsui, Hitachi Zosen and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the country's biggest shipbuilder, alike saw weak sales in their shipbuilding divisions. Mitsubishi said compared with the same period a year ago, the first half was also devoid of major building projects such as the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Osaka and a huge leisure park in Miyazaki prefecture which boosted the steel division last year. At the same time, sky-park parking lots suffered a downturn in demand amid Japan's still weak economic condition while an absence of new thermal and nuclear power plants depressed sales in its power systems division. Ishikawajima-Harima HI was likewise affected by the lack of nuclear power plant sales, which was the main factor behind its 16 per cent fall in mid-term sales. While the companies have managed to keep orders relatively stable, there was general concern that the yen's strength would begin to show through in the next fiscal year as shipbuilding orders are increasingly denominated in dollars and other currencies rather than in yen.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994 interim results and forecasts for year (Y m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                Sales        Recurring profits*    Net profits  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    1994    1993        1994    1993      1994    1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hitachi Zosen   135,689   138,459     7,585   7,232     4,175   3,805  Forecast       420,000    23,000    11,500 IHI             380,266   453,380    10,931  13,362     5,331   7,062  Forecast       800,000    23,000    11,000 Kawasaki HI     408,079   369,049    11,223   6,081     5,423   5,381  Forecast       960,000    22,000    10,132 Mitsubishi HI 1,000,848 1,056,482    62,758   61,001   43,562  42,353  Forecast     2,520,000   140,000    80,000 Mitsui Zosen    106,782   122,668     1,318   4,291       575   2,634  Forecast       330,000     1,000     1,000 Sunitomo HI     111,361   109,840      -200  -1,002    -1,135  -1,720  Forecast       280,000     1,000       500  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  * = before extraordinary items and tax  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company reports  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

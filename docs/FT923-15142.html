			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (5): Valuable lessons learnt - Germany The difficulties begin, as the finance ministry points out, with the decisions on which should be restructured and how; who takes responsibility for old debts and who cleans up the mess left behind after decades of failed or non-existent environmental policies The case of eastern Germany, once rated as the strongest economy in the communist bloc, has given a valuable, if chilling, insight into the difficulties confronting other east European countries trying to establish market economies. Treuhand, or the job-killer as Germany's privatisation agency is widely known in the eastern provinces - is no model for them, insists Ms Birgit Breuel, the agency's president. Nor is the German experience directly applicable anywhere else. The established social economy of western Germany provided the five new states with a proven blueprint for their conversion. It also provided funds at a level and a speed unimaginable further east, and extended a stable, experienced government and a tested legal system. The re-absorbed provinces had access to a ready supply of management and supervisory skills and easy access to other western capital and know-how. North-Rhine Westphalia has seconded 1,000 civil servants temporarily to Brandenburg state to help set up a workable administration. 'These advantages are not available to other former communist countries. Each one must find its own way to a new economic system,' Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, told a recent east-west conference in Berlin. 'But they share many similar problems, and our experience with these can help.' The common problems include rotting infrastructures and companies cobbled together from hundreds of disparate elements. Such an organisation in the former GDR might commonly have manufactured boilers, deck chairs, cutlery, milk bottles and engine parts under one corporate umbrella. Other issues common to all former socialist states include defining ownership of land, buildings and other assets, corruption, the almost total ignorance of meaningful book keeping, and over-manning at every level. The German experience indicates that the first step is for the government to state clearly at the outset the main elements in its restructuring policy. Bonn did this only weeks after unification. The Treuhand, effective controller of the whole of east German industry, was up and working before it had proper offices, with a staff of just 50 people. 'Privatisation should begin as soon as possible with selected targets. The people must experience quickly that changes are under way,' Mr Waigel said. It took Treuhand just nine months to sell off 15,000 small businesses: snack bars, kiosks, garages, restaurants and shops. As for group structures similar to east Germany's Kombinaten, they should first be unbundled or broken up into coherent business units to form the basis of a configuration similar to the federal republic's Mittelstand, the mass of small and medium-sized private companies on which national economic success was founded. The Treuhand has sifted enterprises into three groups: Profitable and sellable Unprofitable but salvageable Hopeless cases. Take the case of the east German textile industry. There were 330,000 textile workers when the Treuhand was set up 18 months ago. At the end of this year there will be about 30,000. According to Mr Hermann Beck, head of Treuhand's Potsdam branch, the situation is hopeless. Not quite. Just as the former West Germany found new jobs for most of its own 400,000 displaced textile workers, now it has come to the aid of those cast adrift by the post-unification collapse of the industry in the east, aggravated by the almost total loss of its markets in the former Soviet Union. With training, early retirement, work creation schemes and the dole, it has ensured that the personal economic suffering has been minimised. There are even some companies, such as the Branka spinning works in Brandenburg, considered still to have a chance. The company was singled out at the start as fit for restructuring, in agency jargon. Annual capacity has been more than halved and the workforce has dropped from 750 people to 145. The works doctor, dentist and physiotherapist have gone freelance. The creche and kindergarten have been closed. The party hacks and Stasi secret police spooks who used to manage the entire east German spinning industry as a single Kombinat have disappeared. Even now, Branka's relative disadvantages seem overwhelming. It has no financial history, no profits, few customers. Its relative advantages - restructuring, continuing management advice and investment at the hands of Treuhand and at the expense of the west German taxpayer - may save it. Like the 5,500 companies and 25,000 other properties still on the Treuhand's books, all it needs is a buyer. The difficulties, as the finance ministry points out, begin with the decisions on which should be restructured and how; who takes responsibility for old debts and who cleans up the mess left behind after decades of failed or non-existent environmental policies. Restructuring in east Germany has typically reduced company workforces by up to 75 per cent. It has also strained management resources unused to such monumental tasks. The past 18 months have shown that potential investors consider that most of the dirty work is a matter for government or government-sponsored agencies such as the Treuhand. Ms Breuel and her 3,500 team plan to wind up their activities by the end of 1994, acting on the belief that the quicker privatisation is achieved the better. After that, it is for private enterprise to take up the reins. 'Experience teaches that privatisation is the best form of restructuring. The private investor takes over all the risks and opportunities when he buys a company. He will try, through investment, modernisation and realisation of market opportunities to increase the earning power of the business and with it the job security for his employees,' says Mr Waigel. 'In this way the interests of the new owners tally precisely with the overall economic interests of the country,' he concludes.</p>

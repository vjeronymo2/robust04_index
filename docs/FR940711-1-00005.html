			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed special conditions. All comments submitted will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this proposal will be filed in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;18.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 16, 1991, General Electric Aircraft Engines applied for type certification of Model(s) GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B turbofan engines. These engines incorporate a first stage fan blade manufactured using carbon graphite composite material. This unusual design feature results in the GE90 fan blade having significant difference in material property characteristics when compared to conventionally designed fan blades using non-composite materials. For example, the probability that a composite fan blade will fail below the inner flowpath diameter is highly improbable, making inappropriate the requirement contained in &sect;33.94 paragraph (a) subparagraph (1) to show blade containment after a failure of the blade at the outermost retention feature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current requirements of &sect;33.94 are based on metallic blade characteristics and service history and are not appropriate for the unusual design features of the composite fan blade found on the GE90 series turbofan engines. The FAA has determined that a more realistic blade retention test will be achieved with a fan blade failure at the inner flowpath diameter (complete airfoil) instead of the outermost retention feature as is currently required by &sect;33.94 paragraph (a) subparagraph (1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has also determined that the composite fan blade construction presents other factors that must be considered. Tests and analyses must account for the effects of in-service deterioration of, manufacturing and materials variations in, and environmental effects on the composite material. Further, tests and analyses must show that a lightning strike on the composite fan blade will not result in a hazardous condition to the aircraft and that the engine will meet the requirements of &sect;33.75. Therefore, these Special Conditions are proposed which define the additional requirements which the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the Airworthiness Standards of part 33.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: TWO GRIM, INSIGHTFUL LOOKS AT LIFE BEHIND BARS  </P> <P> Bill Dunne and Wilbert Rideau are scheduled to spend the rest of their lives in  prison but under radically different conditions.  </P> <P> Dunne is an inmate at the U. S. Penitentiary at Marion, Ill., "America's  toughest prison," according to the September WigWag.  </P> <P> Rideau, a celebrated prison journalist, is housed in the Louisiana State  Penitentiary and profiled in the October Details.  </P> <P> Together, the articles, and the prisoners' lives, provide interesting insight  into the existence of the 700,000 men and women incarcerated in the nation's  prisons, and into the penal system itself.  </P> <P> Rideau has been imprisoned for almost 30 years for the cold-blooded murder of a  Louisiana woman. In that time he has become editor and publisher of The  Angolite, a prison publication nominated for two National Magazine Awards last  spring. His reputation as a muckraker has afforded him the chance to leave the  prison on lecture tours and appear four times on ABC's "Nightline."  </P> <P> Rideau would seem the model of rehabilitation. Even behind bars, his good  behavior and political clout provide him with considerable leeway. He dresses  as he likes and calls the warden at home. There is considerable pressure in  Louisiana for the governor to grant Rideau clemency.  </P> <P> Yet the Details piece hints that Rideau has not changed completely after all.  As a 19-year-old murderer, Rideau had the power of life and death, Peter  Wilkinson writes. As a prison journalist, he discovered "the power to bring  change as well as the power to intimidate and manipulate through what one said  -- with the right documentation -- in the press."  </P> <P> The most privileged prisoners at the U.S. Penitentiary at Marion probably  cannot imagine the sort of freedom Rideau is allowed. Marion is the "last stop"  in the nation's system of 711 prisons.  </P> <P> Housed at Marion are criminals so vicious that even the guards at San Quentin  and Attica don't want to deal with them. Also housed here, Susan Lehman  reports, are those whose crimes dictate that they receive special protection,  such as convicted spies John Walker and Jonathan Pollard. But Lehman also  suggests that some prisoners at Marion are there for political reasons -- are,  in fact, political prisoners.  </P> <P> With the exception of 50 or so prisoners who are allowed to dine together and  work in the prison factory, most Marion inmates are locked in their cells at  least 22 1/2 hours a day.  </P> <P> "Alone in their cells, inmates can take a step in one direction and two steps  in the other," Lehman writes. "Meals arrive through a slot in the door.  Prisoners dine on the floor; they have no chairs or tables. Most . . . live in  cells without windows."  </P> <P> These conditions do not make the prisoners happy. Inmate Dunne wrote to WigWag:  "There are indications that the hall screaming and cell talking (talking and  singing in the isolation of a cell, particularly when it is dark and quiet and  psycho demons have free reign to roam the mindscape) are evidence of  psychological trauma."  </P> <P> As Lehman points out, Marion seems to reflect the future of prisons in America.  This disturbs her. She and others want reforms at Marion. Her conclusion is  that society, as well as these inmates, would be better served by a program of  productive activity.  </P> <P> She makes her case well, although she does not iron out the finer points, such  as what to do with the folks such as Matthew Granger, who came to Marion  because he killed a guard in another prison, smashing his skull, shoving his  keys down his throat, then cutting off his head with a piece of glass.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REQUIRED READING  </P> <P> * Just starting to sleep soundly again now that the threat of global  thermonuclear war no longer seems quite so acute? Well, wake up! There's a  whole universe of potential apocalypses in the form of asteroids. If one of  those puppies beans the Earth it could be curtains for Homo sapiens. The  September California magazine presents an entertaining, informative look at the  people who track asteroids and at plans to fend off an asteroid in the  relatively unlikely event that one gets us in its sights sometime soon.  </P> <P> * Girl Scouts can now attend a "High Tech Computer Whiz Camp." Kids go hunting  or fishing or mountain climbing in a video game, unconcerned about mosquitoes  or sunburn or the other annoyances of the great outdoors. Have these visual  temptations divorced children from nature? In an evocative, sometimes nostalgic  and finally optimistic essay in the September-October Sierra, Richard Louv  examines how children of this generation and others feel about the wilds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAGAZINE VS. MAGAZINE  </P> <P> * Anyone who thinks of Cosmopolitan as a sort of Penthouse for women had best  turn to Kathryn McMahon's article, "The Cosmopolitan Ideology and the  Management of Desire," in the August issue of UCLA's Journal of Sex Research.  "The immense popularity of Cosmopolitan," McMahon found, "may be attributed to  the powerful contradictions the magazine represents and contains through  strategies of self-management. . . . The text offers the fantasy of revenge for  class and gender subordination through images of women's sexuality used to  dominate and control men on their own turf."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHREDDER FODDER  </P> <P> * From the moment it arrived in the United States, AIDS was a disease destined  to inflame the worst impulses of conspiracy theorists. Now one of the theories  concocted about AIDS appears on the cover of a national magazine. The question  mark in the headline -- "AIDS: Is It Genocide?" -- does nothing to mitigate the  story's sensational, irresponsible tone.  </P> <P> The article, in the September Essence, takes a through-the-looking-glass  approach to reportage. Credentialed, reasonable scientists are allowed to  dispute the notion that AIDS was somehow introduced by someone to do something.  </P> <P> But the piece makes no distinctions about the credibility of its sources. It  allows conspiracy theorists to espouse half-baked ideas, backed up with only  such flimsy, alleged evidence as a 1969 issue of the Congressional Record and  newspaper stories.  </P> <P> And while the scientific community, the piece asserts, remains "unclear" about  where the disease came from, some "experts" -- physicians trained in  pharmacology, gastroenterology and dermatology, a black studies professor --  "claim to have a concrete theory about exactly where the virus began . . . ."  As one of the alleged experts claims: "There is a possibility that the virus  was produced to limit the number of African people and people of color in the  world . . . ."  </P> <P> There is also a possibility that Elvis is circling the Earth in a spaceship.  </P> <P> AIDS remains a tough enemy. To defeat it, it will require clear thinking and a  unified effort. Mushy tabloidism only hurts the cause.  </P></p>

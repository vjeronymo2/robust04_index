			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Kuwait cashes in on its Dollars 10bn defence prize - But the emirate's insistence on reinvestment is taxing foreign contractors THE Arabian peninsula has become, since the Gulf war, the most lucrative arms market in the world, but it is also becoming the toughest. Kuwait, alone, is proposing to spend more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) on arms procurement by the end of the decade. But, faced with a rash of other spending needs, it is insisting that 30 per cent of the value of any defence contract be reinvested in the emirate. Defence contractors will not be alone in searching out investment openings, since Kuwait wants all contracts worth more than KD1m (Pounds 2.1m) to return 30 per cent in reinvestment. That would generate investment exceeding Dollars 3bn over the next seven years, making the 'offset' scheme the biggest such programme anywhere. By comparison, the offset target set by the Saudi Arabian government for the al-Yamamah project, a deal worth Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn, is Dollars 1bn of reinvestment by British Aerospace and other contractors over a decade. Even this target is proving hard to meet. After five years, 12 projects have been approved but just one implemented - a Pounds 10m Glaxo pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. It is not surprising that Kuwait's offset proposals are boggling the minds of defence contractors. 'It's a phenomenal task,' says one western official. 'There's very little here to invest in.' Kuwait's ability to absorb foreign investment has been further diminished by the effects of the war. According to local economists, wartime damage to Kuwaiti businesses, the government's decision to cut the state's population from 2.2m to 1.4m, and low business confidence have seen the non-oil economy shrink by as much as 40 per cent. The National Bank of Kuwait, the emirate's biggest, concluded in its latest economic bulletin that 'given the new realities of reduced size of population, high priority assigned to rebuilding defence infrastructure and restoration of the oil sector, businessmen dealing with Kuwait will have to scale down their expectations of upcoming major projects, at least for the coming two years'. But Kuwait's government hopes the offset programme will make up for the paucity of locally-inspired investment. In particular, the scheme aims to encourage investment in education and training for Kuwaitis, high-technology industries, and joint venture manufacturing and assembly plants capable of exporting throughout the Gulf. After the war the government allowed Kuwait's non-oil industries to lie moribund. It has now changed tack and reverted to its pre-war policy of seeking to diversify as much as possible away from oil. Accordingly, the offset scheme's architects at the Finance Ministry have devised a 'multiplier' system as an incentive to steer investment into target areas. Any sum invested, for instance, in a training project would be multiplied fivefold so that a Dollars 10m investment would count as Dollars 50m worth of offset. Investment in research and development carries a multiplier of three. Recognising that few contractors relish the administrative burden and complexity of offset programmes, the ministry has added other incentives. The scheme will in some cases permit foreign companies to set up majority-owned joint ventures in the Gulf state; the government has hitherto insisted that Kuwaiti interests in any joint venture must always exceed 50 per cent. In the end, however, the incentive for foreign contractors is simply the huge bounty offered by Kuwait's defence programme. 'Companies will sign up readily because they want to do the deal, then worry about the problems of finding investment later,' says a US official. Hughes Aircraft Systems, the US defence group, has been first to bite. Last month it undertook to find reinvestment worth Dollars 27.6m on a Dollars 93m contract to supply an early warning system. Raytheon, which has a Dollars 370m contract to supply five Patriot missile batteries, is discussing a Dollars 120m offset commitment. So far neither company has submitted specific investment proposals. Kuwait's biggest arms deal since the war, General Dynamics' Dollars 2bn contract to supply 236 M1A2 Abrams battle tanks, will not carry a full 30 per cent offset quotient, though, as the deal falls under the auspices of the US foreign military sales structure, whereby Kuwait will receive the equipment at the same price as would the US military. Kuwait's next large military purchase is likely to be armoured personnel carriers, a deal British officials hope GKN will secure, with a possible Dollars 1.2bn order for up to 300 Warriors. British Ministry of Defence officials are already looking at ways to set up a structure to manage the offset, perhaps through an assigned offset office in Kuwait or London. But, as one US official remarks, British, French and other international defence groups competing for a share of Kuwait's Dollars 10bn defence prize should not spend too much time examining potential offset deals. 'The US firms were wise to get off the mark first,' he says. 'Kuwait is going to run out of investment opportunities pretty quickly.'</p>

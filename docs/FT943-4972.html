			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Casino posts threefold profits rise to FFr56m Casino, the French super-market group, yesterday announced a threefold increase in interim net profits to FFr55.9m (Dollars 10m) for the first half of this year from FFr17.6m in the same period of 1993 due to a general improvement in trading activities. Mr Antoine Guichard, chairman, said Casino was changing its status from a partnership to a public limited company. This reflects a long-term trend in French industry. Several large groups have made similar changes by abolishing the old commandite actions system under which small groups of shareholders in effect control the company. Casino has been controlled by Eurosia, a legal vehicle belonging to the Guichard family and institutional investors. Mr Guichard said such a structure had played a critical role in the company's development since its foundation in 1898 but the commandite actions concept had since become 'less and less valid or justifiable'. Casino reported a modest improvement in trading activity during the first six months of the year. Interim sales rose 1.6 per cent to FFr29.38bn from FFr28.92m with operating profits up 26.7 per cent at FFr331.5m from FFr261.8m. Casino attributed the increase in trading margins to the benefits of the merger with Rallye supermarkets group and to general improvements in cost control.</p>

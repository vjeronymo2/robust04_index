			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Personal View: Misleading portrait of the poor 'Income of poorest families down 17 per cent since 1979 as richest gain 62 per cent' was the shocking headline which followed the recent publication of a UK Department of Social Security report on low-income families*. A third of British children were declared to be living in poverty and the Child Poverty Action Group said 'we should be deeply ashamed'. It is true that the gap between the incomes of rich and poor has widened a lot under the Tories. But the headline statistics are creating a false - and in some cases dangerous - impression. Many of those who appear to be trapped in poverty are not as badly off as appears at first sight. On the other hand, the official statistics overlook the particular needs of some vulnerable groups who need additional support - notably pensioners and lone parents. There are three main ways in which the headline figures are misleading. First, poverty is often defined as being below half of average income. When this definition is used, people can fall into 'poverty' even when their income rises - if average incomes rise faster. A third of children may now be living below the poverty line, but it is the 1991-92 poverty line and this is much higher in real terms than that for 1979, the base year for many comparisons. Second, there is evidence that the very poor are richer in absolute terms than the poor of 1979, despite their 17 per cent fall in reported income. The same government report on low-income families showed that the average expenditure of the poorest 10 per cent ('decile') is actually higher than that of the next decile up. And some people in the bottom decile spend as much as those in the top decile. Some of these are the self-employed, who notoriously show up in statistics as spending more than their reported incomes. But the spending habits of the bottom decile indicate that only about a third are actually as poor as their reported income suggests. People on low incomes may be living off capital or borrowing; they may not report black market income; and some people are counted as low-income because they happened to earn little or nothing during the short data-collection period. More than half the bottom decile have cars, and their ownership of other consumer durables is much closer to average than in 1979. About half the bottom decile own their homes, well up on 1979, though fewer own them without a mortgage. As for the 17 per cent fall in real income, that is 'after housing costs'. Before allowing for housing costs, the reported income of the poorest decile has not fallen below 1979 levels, even at the peak of unemployment in 1991-92. Today's higher housing costs at least partly represent improved housing quality. As the reports says: 'There are indications that the bottom deciles experienced improvements in housing conditions, both absolutely and relative to the rest of the population.' Finally, and more controversially, the report fails to identify as poor some of those most in need of extra help. The statistics omit all those living in cardboard boxes or bed and breakfast accommodation, some of the poorest in society. They also do not allow for the extra needs of the old and people bringing up children alone, a high proportion of those on low incomes. Groups such as these get extra means-tested social security benefits. In practice, these help with the additional costs they face to maintain the same standard of living as fit young adults. Pensioners, for example, need more heat. Their failing teeth and eyes require hundreds of pounds of extra spending each year. They must pay for help with tasks that fit young adults can do themselves. Holidays can no longer take the form of humping rucksacks and sleeping rough. On the income side, earning opportunities are fewer. But the extra these groups get in social security benefits has the effect of making them appear better off in the statistics than they are in reality. If the social security department published an extra set of statistics which reflected those additional needs, the composition of the poorest sections of society would be more accurately determined. The rates used for the main means-tested benefit, income support, provide an easy basis for compiling such figures. In their present form, the statistics suggest that the elderly are no longer poor. The danger is that they could be used to argue for cuts in benefits for pensioners. An additional set of figures would avert this danger. Two other quick-and-easy policy changes would also help in narrowing the gap between the richest and poorest. One would be to restrict all tax allowances to the standard rate - including pension contributions and lump-sum pay-outs. The other would be to increase child benefit and make it taxable as part of the caring parent's income. These measures would bring down the income of top-rate taxpayers without increasing tax rates. They would help parents pay for the kind of childcare which best suits them, including the often neglected option of daytime care by parents themselves. And they would push families with children up the income scale even when temporarily unemployed. The other top priority shown up by the statistics should be to sort out the housing subsidy system - but that is another and even more complicated story.

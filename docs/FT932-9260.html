			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Britons 'not playing cricket' in Danish Maastricht campaign THE intervention of British politicians and newspapers in Denmark's Maastricht referendum campaign is both unwelcome and unfair, Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, said yesterday. 'I simply believe we should be left to fight our own campaign,' he said yesterday. 'We do not interfere in the British campaign (on Maastricht). Let the British fight their own battles in Britain and not here.' Mr Helveg Petersen was echoing a growing sense of irritation in Denmark about the role of outsiders in the referendum to be held next Tuesday. Speaking a day after Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister, and Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP, traded insults in Copenhagen, the foreign minister criticised the Sunday Times newspaper for what he said were deliberate attempts to encourage a No vote. 'To use the British expression, it is not cricket,' he said. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Helveg Petersen's predecessor, also expressed irritation over anti-Maastricht newspaper advertisments paid for by Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier. Mr Ellemann-Jensen said these had wrongly accused him of stopping Mr Willy De Clercq, the former Belgian minister, from coming to Denmark for a debate. In an interview with the FT, he took a more relaxed view of British visitors, saying Danes were likely to react to Lord Tebbit by voting against him. 'The more the better,' he declared. 'I'm just sorry Lady Thatcher doesn't show up. I would have paid her to come. That would really have boosted the Yes campaign.' Britons have not been alone in irritating the Danes. Earlier this month, Mr Martin Bangemann, the European Community industry commissioner, enraged treaty supporters by saying Maastricht could become the vehicle for a European federation, a central concern among Danish voters. Mr Helveg Petersen denied that Copenhagen had ordered EC commissioners to desist from such public statements before Tuesday's vote, which the government hopes will overturn the rejection of Maastricht in last June's referendum.

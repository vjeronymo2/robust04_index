			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong gains as the last equity account closes - Market report The last equity trading account in London equities closed with the market in good form yesterday as share prices rose sharply for the third successive trading session. Trading volume showed a further increase, boosted by a large trading programme from a US investment bank. The FT-SE Index closed 24.4 up at 3,074.8, having achieved most of its gain within the first hour of the market's opening. Traders were pleased to see the index convincingly extend its gain above the 3,050 hurdle. Profit-taking ahead of the close of the account, a London phenomena now consigned to the history books, proved no check to a market which has risen by 110.9 points on the Footsie over the past three trading sessions. The tone of the market appeared very confident at the close of business and was supported by favourable comments in weekly reports to clients by several leading securities houses. The Footsie has risen by about 4.7 per cent over the two-week account, with the greater part of the rise taking place this week as concern over the dollar has subsided, bringing a rally in bond markets and returning investor attention to the economic recovery and low inflation in the UK. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 21.6 to 3,551.3 yesterday, bringing the advance over the account to nearly 4 per cent. The financial sectors, with balance sheets filled with assets in the form of market securities, stood out strongly in the market advance. Dollar-earning stocks remained less active than the rest of the market, with oil shares failing to keep pace as some profits were taken after the strong run earlier this week. Traders identified further share buying from overseas investment institutions. The lead was reportedly taken by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, with a programmed buying operation across both Footsie and non-Footsie stocks. Consumer stocks were again enlivened by the implications of the Tesco offer for William Low, which is now widely regarded as the opening shot in a potentially far-ranging battle. Building and contracting stocks, which have been held back by the fears over prospects for a rise in base rates, continued to recover ground yesterday. Companies with German involvement were particularly firm on the back of persistent support from European institutions. Equity volume, as reported through the Seaq electronic network, jumped to 856.4m shares, the highest total for several months and a 17 per cent increase on the previous session. A recovery in trading volumes, which had slipped away during the period of concern over bond markets, was borne out by Thursday's total of Pounds 1.51bn in retail, or genuine investor business. This was the sixth successive day of Pounds 1bn plus business, contrasting sharply with totals below this benchmark number at the beginning of last week. The gilt-edged market traded firmly for most of the day but turned less certain following the announcement that the next auction of government bonds, scheduled for Wednesday July 27, will be of conventional stock in the 2007-2011 maturity range. Some bond trading houses were believed to have expected a variable rate issue and had to reshuffle their market positions following the auction announcement. However, traders agreed that, 'It was Friday afternoon, and not the best time to measure the market's response.'</p>

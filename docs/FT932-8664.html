			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Letter: Ridiculous notion Sir, The next time readers rebuke Edward Mortimer for 'going on about Bosnia', to the relative exclusion of other areas of communal conflict such as Armenia and Tajikstan ('Twin track to Bosnia peace', May 12), he should respond by pointing out that Bosnia actually lies closer to the 'heart of Europe' than Britain does. So, even if one sets aside all moral considerations, the notion that the area can be neatly quarantined and then conveniently ignored is ridiculous. Monson, House of Lords, London SW1A</p>

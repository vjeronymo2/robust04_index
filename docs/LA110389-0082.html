She said some players who participated in the  1988 Fiesta Bowl had flunked out of school the previous semester.  </P> <P> In a lawsuit against the university, Visser is seeking damages for lost wages  and emotional distress along with reinstatement to her job.  </P> <P> University officials contend Visser was fired after 19 years on the Nebraska  payroll because of poor job performance. They contend she began to investigate  student records only after her work habits were criticized.  </P></p>

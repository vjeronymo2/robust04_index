			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Argos Market research is no substitute for a good idea - as Argos's foray into furniture demonstrates all too clearly. Chesterman was only a four-store pilot venture, yet it managed to cost Argos Pounds 21m in its brief passage from cradle to grave. The company argues that there was too big a gap between the research being done and the stores opened. It seems more likely that the management's good use of research in the main Argos chain - a business it knows well - blinded it to ambiguous answers about a business it did not know at all. The high exit cost also indicates that the management had not seriously considered that the project might fail. More happily, Argos is blessed with a flourishing core business. Floor space will grow by around 6 per cent this year, and total sales may be up over 10 per cent. Calls for more rapid development are sensibly being resisted, and the format still has several years of expansion, so earnings growth seems assured. That, however, is amply reflected in Argos's premium rating. And Chesterman has delivered a nasty knock to the management's reputation. The market's relief that Argos has decided against moving into Europe is evidence enough of that.</p>

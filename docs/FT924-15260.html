			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Conditions spelled out on overseas aid policy THE Japanese government yesterday set out a specific code which will guide its huge overseas development aid programme, linking aid to a country's record in promoting democracy, human rights and market economics. The Foreign Ministry report on development aid policy is the furthest the government has gone in detailing its revised policy. In the past aid was not tied to overt political conditions. Last year the ministry issued guidelines for aid policy partly in response to criticisms from overseas that Japanese policy priorities were not clear. The new code follows a similar switch in aid policy, led by Britain and the US The report said Japan would not continue to give aid to countries where there was excessive military spending. Japan's net assistance to developing countries rose by 31 per cent last year to a record Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14bn), mainly because of a sharp rise in aid to south east Asian countries. The Ministry of Finance said the aid amounted to about 0.73 per cent of Japanese gross national product. Official development assistance rose by 19.6 per cent to Dollars 11bn, while flows of private funds to developing countries grew by 77.9 per cent to Dollars 11.1bn, mainly because of a rise in export credits linked to a rise in Japanese direct investment in the region.</p>

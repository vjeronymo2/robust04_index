			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hasan Cemal in the "From the Columns" column: </F> "What does `the state' think in Diyarbakir?"]    [Text] From a Mar. 23 article by SABAH's Hasan  Cemal: A long table on the eighth floor of the police  officers' club in Diyarbakir. Along two sides are sitting the  entire "state". State of Emergency Region Governor Unal Erkan,  Diyarbakir Governor Ibrahim Sahun, Diyarbakir Mayor Turgut  Atalay, Turkey's Director General of Security Mehmet Agar,  Commander of the Seventh Army Corps Gen. Metin Saglam,  Gendarmerie Law and Order Commander Gen. Hasan Kundakci, Second  Tactical Force Commander Gen. Ergin Celasun, prosecutors, deputy  provincial governors, high level security and intelligence  officers.    They are having dinner. There are television sets at both  ends of the table. As they sip their raki, they watch the news  bulletins from various TV stations. At the same time Mehmet  Agar gives a live interview by telephone to the Show TV news  program. Everybody is happy that the Newroz day passed without  incident and make remarks in the vein of, "The separatist  organization is no longer able to rally the people for mass  action." TV programs in which the fact that there were no  incidents is not underlined strongly enough, upset the viewers.  After hearing the news about village guards celebrating Newroz  in Cizre, they say, "Do not forget that until a few years ago  those village guards were unable to go out on the street in  Cizre. If they did, they were liable to be hanged upside down  from the trees." In today's article I will not make any  comments. I will simply sum up part of my impressions under the  headline, "What is the state thinking in Diyarbakir?"  <H5>  Ozal Criticized </H5>   Former President Turgut Ozal is being criticized for having  prevented the state from taking strong enough action against the  "Separatist organization" in the past, or for having failed to  take it seriously, saying that they were "a handful of  highwaymen". These words are quite interesting: "Remember the  March 21 1991 Newroz day in Sirnak. From morning to evening it  was impossible to remove the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party)  colors from the flag post in the city square. And the things  that were done to the Ataturk statue there! Then came the 1992  Newroz. Demirel's prime ministry. The PKK was taught a lesson  in Sirnak. The state displayed its might. Everybody saw that  there's a price to pay for messing around with the state.  Today, not the slightest sound was heard in Sirnak. Think of  the change achieved in three years."    A curious line is being drawn from Ozal to Demirel and now  to  Ciller. It is being stressed that in the fight against the PKK,  Ciller is in great harmony with the security forces and the  military. One of the officials says, "Ciller has grasped that  situation. She saw how the security forces could be given the  boost to morale that they needed. And this has been  accomplished." And an interesting remark: "You may recall that  once it used to be said that the Republican People's Party (CHP)  plus the Army equals power. Now Ciller sees that and seizes on  the idea."  <H5>  Greatest Boost to Morale </H5>   How did Prime Minister Ciller inject the biggest boost to  morale in recent times to those fighting against terrorism in  the Southeast? There is a single answer to that question: "The  removal of the Democracy Party (DEP) deputies' legislative  immunity and their subsequent arrest. The security forces have  been immensely pleased with these developments, in which Ciller  herself played a major role. The people of the region could see  the power of the state. Those who criticize this decision are  not aware of the realities of this place. (Opposition  Motherland Party leader) Mesut Yilmaz has been less active than  Ciller on this issue."    Somebody asks, "Can the amendments required be made in the  Anti-Terror Law?" A curious reply comes: "Don't worry, they (the  proposed amendments) will be passed."  <H5>  The Hot Summer </H5>   Morale is indeed high. They say that heavy punishment has  been inflicted on the PKK, especially in the past 12 months.  "We do not provide too many photos and films of terrorists  killed because the international community does not react  favorably to such things," they add. The result of this  punishment can be summed up as follows: "Fewer recruits to the  organization, more information about the organization, a sharp  decline in the logistic support for the organization, greater  demand to become village guards."    There will be formidable pressure on the PKK with the onset  of spring. "Things have slowed down a bit because of the  elections. You will see after April." They say this will be a  "hot" summer, with the rural and mountain cadres, especially,  being wiped out. The numbers of special operations teams are  being rapidly increased, and these teams operate very  effectively, they note. Officials keep stressing that the  inhabitants of the region support the state and definitely do  not desire separation. "Otherwise, you would not be able to  achieve anything even if you set up 37 armies!" they say.  <H5>  Terror First </H5>   The Show TV news bulletin featured an interview with Kemal  Burkay! [Secretary General of Kurdistan Socialist Party, PSK]  This drew comments such as, "Look at what Show TV is doing.  They are launching Burkay. What is the need for that?"  Expressing their displeasure, officials say, "Nothing can be  done (on such issues) as long as the fight against the terrorist  organization continues. First you must make that organization  collapse. Then you can think of other things. If you tried to  do that at this stage, there would be no end. Things would go  on, as a chain. First the fight against terrorism."    In the region "pro-state" and "anti-state" forces.  Interesting analyses. One person says, "I felt that he was a  Turk. I told him, Your eyes do not speak of treason'."    It is said that certain complaints were voiced at the  National Security Council meetings, to the effect that the  judicial process in the region was not operating rapidly enough.  Some 10,000 defendants, about 3,000 of them under arrest, are  said to be currently on trial at the state security courts whose  jurisdiction covers 11 provinces.    They think that Motherland Party (ANAP) mayoral candidate  Nurettin Dilek is likely to win the election in Diyarbakir, and  the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) candidates in a few  countries of Diyarbakir. There is a certain, unexpressed,  feeling that it would be a good idea if the media did not write  or broadcast anything about the region. Yet, they do take care  to continue a dialogue with members of the press despite all the  criticism they direct against the media.</p>

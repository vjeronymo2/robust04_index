The president of the Bulgarian  Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Bozhidar Bozhinov, and a  representative of the Iranian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  signed an agreement for cooperation between the two chambers.    The commission has been working since April 25 in working  groups in the spheres of industry and agriculture, trade and  banking, oil and gas, transport and communications and  scientific and technical cooperation. Mr. Torkan and members of  the delegation (which included about 20 representatives of  Iranian business circles) met with Deputy Prime Ministers Evgeni  Matinchev and Valentin Karabashev, National Bank Governor Todor  Vulchev, and the Deputy Minister of Industry Racho Petrov. The  delegation visited the town of Burgas (on the Black Sea). Today  Mr. Torkan was received by President Zhelyu Zhelev. The  president had been informed about the results of the joint  commission's work and expressed his support for the efforts to  boost Bulgarian-Iranian cooperation, Mr. Ermenkov and Mr. Torkan  told a news conference.    Bulgaria and Iran reached an agreement on the construction  of  a gas conduit from Iran to Europe. The section passing through  Bulgaria will be built by Bulgarian engineers and workers, said  Mr. Torkan. Besides, Bulgaria will buy 1.5 million tonnes of  crude oil from Iran and the transaction will be effected  directly between Iran's National Oil Company and  Neftokhim-Burgas. The possible construction of a ferry service  between Burgas and Novorossiysk and from there to the Middle  East and Iran was also discussed. Industrial cooperation will be  focused on industrial truck building, and the Bulgarian  Balkankar company has already become part of a joint venture  operating in Iran. Iranian zinc and copper ore concentrate will  be processed in Bulgarian plants. No cooperation in the  production of or trade in arms and ammunition has been discussed  during the session, Mr. Torkan stated.    Responding to a question Mr. Torkan said that part of the  debt of Iranian companies to Bulgaria that he estimates at about  $20 million will be paid off in hard currency, another portion  will be paid off in goods and a rescheduling agreement will be  sought for the rest. According to experts from the Bulgarian  Ministry of Trade, the debt runs up to $27 million.

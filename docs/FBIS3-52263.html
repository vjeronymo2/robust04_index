Speaker Baha'-al-Din Ahmad delivered a speech at the  meeting in which he congratulated leader President Saddam Husayn  and Iraq's people on the new year. He pledged to his excellency  the president in the name of the members of the council to  remain loyal soldiers to defend Iraq's sovereignty and its  national unity. He also denounced the brutal crimes being  committed by the cliques of agentry and destruction against our  Kurdish people in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region in  implementation of the colonialist and Zionist schemes.    During the meeting, three reports prepared by the general  secretariats for economic, financial, awqaf, public works, and  housing affairs were read out. The reports reviewed the  achievements made by the sons of our Kurdish people in various  areas up to 1990, including trade, religious, housing, and  construction areas, in implementation of a decision by the  leadership of the party and the revolution under leader Saddam  Husayn to develop the Autonomous Region. In their reports  endorsed by the council, the secretaries general dealt with the  repercussions of the destruction carried out by the saboteurs  against state institutions, as well as the stealing state of  property. The meeting was attended by Ja'far 'Abd-al-Karim  al-Barzanji, chairman of the Executive Council of the Kurdistan  Autonomous Region.</p>

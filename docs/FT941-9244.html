			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Hosokawa anxious as yen shoots up Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday admitted 'serious concern' about the yen's rapid rise against the dollar but argued that it was not a direct consequence of the failure to reach an accord with Mr Clinton. He came under fierce criticism from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, which criticised him for failing to co-operate with the US to control the yen's advance. 'If Japan-US relations really are mature, they should have talked about how to deal with the yen's surge,' said Mr Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general, taking a jibe at the government's belief that Japan's relations with Washington had reached a new phase. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said US trade sanctions should only come 'at the very, very last' and that Japan was doing its best to open markets. Several cabinet ministers and senior bankers forecast that the yen would soon fall again, when the political tension dies down. 'Fundamentals that shifted the tide in August are clearly still there,' said Mr Toyoo Gyohten, chairman of the Bank of Tokyo and a former senior finance ministry official, referring to the last time the yen neared Y100 to the dollar. He thought US trade sanctions unlikely. Yet the currency turmoil, even if temporary, 'may dampen rising expectations of economic recovery,' said Mr Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC, the electronics group. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, warned: 'Lifting the yen is surely not the solution for all problems.' Economic analysts warned that a high yen would depress prices, another deflationary pressure when the government was trying to stimulate demand. Domestic wholesale prices fell 0.1 per cent month on month in January, though the wholesale index as a whole - including exports - rose by 0.1 per cent, said the Bank of Japan. The continuing weakness of the economy was underlined by another stream of gloomy statistics yesterday, including a near 18 per cent rise in the number of bankruptcies from December to January, to 1,104, a seven-year high. Almost 60 per cent of Japanese companies have cut their workforces during the recession and 70 per cent have reduced investment in plant and equipment, according to a survey by Sanwa Research Institute. However, a hint of recovery emerged yesterday with a 5.3 per cent rise in purchases of machinery by private sector companies between November and December, according to the government's Economic Planning Agency. Machinery orders in the first quarter of this year are likely to rise by 8.1 per cent from the previous three months, it said.</p>

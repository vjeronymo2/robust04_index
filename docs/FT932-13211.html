			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Press freedom bill fails to progress THE PRIVATE member's bill seeking to establish an independent press authority made no progress in the Commons yesterday and has virtually no chance of becoming law. Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP who is chief sponsor of the Freedom and Responsibility of the Press Bill, repeatedly accused Tory backbenchers of deliberately denying it the time needed to complete the report stage by prolonging debate on an earlier measure. His protests were ruled out of order by Dame Janet Fookes, the deputy speaker. Mr Robert Key, junior heritage minister, reaffirmed that the government was opposed to the bill and said it needed further time to prepare its own proposals. These would be aimed at securing a proper balance between press freedom and the rights of the individual. Mr Key confirmed that the views of the Calcutt committee and recommendations by the Commons national heritage committee would be taken into account.</p>

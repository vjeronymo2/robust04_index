			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Francoise Lepeltier: </F> "Russia: Yes to Balladur Pact"]    [Excerpt] Nizhniy Novgorod -- [passage omitted] After  harvesting the political results he expected from his visit to  Moscow, the French foreign minister decided to devote the two  final stages of his first visit to Russia -- Nizhniy Novgorod  and St. Petersburg -- to remembrance and culture. In  particular, he officially opened the French Institute in St.  Petersburg, "the symbol," the minister reaffirmed, "of the  new-found fraternity between Russia and France."    "The aim of my visit was to assert the French Government's  desire to give full strength to the partnership between our two  countries. This objective has been achieved," he said after his  talks with Andrey Kozyrev, his counterpart, President Boris  Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev. The Russian Government demonstrated a  degree of caution with regard to the French stances, both on the  partnership treaty with the European Union and on security in  Europe. But Alain Juppe was able to clear up the  misunderstandings.    European Partnership [subhead]    "We are similar. You like frankness and so do I," a jovial  Boris Yeltsin, who was in "excellent shape," as the French  foreign minister was able to observe, told him from the outset.  Andrey Kozyrev confirmed his presence at the start of the Paris  meeting [conference on stability in Europe] on 26 and 27 May and  Russia's pledge to follow the agreements resulting from it. In  particular, the Russians have given their agreement to the  principle of a roundtable on Baltic problems. General Grachev  also presented the French minister with the broad outlines of  the proposal he is due to unveil to NATO on Tuesday. "France  endorses the idea of a Partnership for Peace. In view of its  history and its size, the fact that Russia should hold a special  place in it goes without saying," Alain Juppe said. In his  view, Russia should also join the Council of Europe. And  participate in the work of the G-7, "which one day will become a  G-8."    Discussing the various crises within the CIS with the  Russian  defense minister, and especially the conflict between Ukraine  and Crimea, Alain Juppe stressed that "France understands the  special role which Russia can play in these regions," but that  it can only envisage "peacekeeping operations under the auspices  of an international organization." In the sphere of the  partnership agreement with the European Union, the obstacle of  the export of Russian nuclear fuel, which made Paris fear unfair  competition on this market, is about to disappear. "I hope that  between now and the meeting of the European Union ministers in  Corfu, we will have found solutions which make it possible to  sign this agreement," Alain Juppe said.

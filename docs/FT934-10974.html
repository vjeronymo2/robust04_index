			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Dublin expects rewards for concessions to north THE IRISH government goes into the Anglo-Irish conference meeting in Belfast today having made important concessions to unionist opinion but still determined to uphold parts of the nationalist agenda which are likely to prove unacceptable to unionist leaders. Last week Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in announcing a six-point plan as a basis for renewed talks, conceded the principle of a unionist veto over constitutional change in the north. Ambiguity persists over whether this goes further than a straightforward majority veto, as set out in Article 1 of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. The Irish foreign ministry says that 'majority consent' and 'unionist consent' should be considered together and that Mr Spring's additional proposal for a 'covenant of rights' will flesh out guarantees for the unionists and protect their basic political rights even in the event of a change in sovereignty. Irish government officials have indicated, though, that in addition to downgrading the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland to an 'aspiration' to satisfy what is a key unionist demand, Dublin would also be prepared to incorporate the guarantee of a majority veto in the north over constitutional change there, into its own constitution. The price Dublin expects to extract for these concessions is that they would form part of an overall package which would incorporate key nationalist goals and would be put to a simultaneous referendum north and south of the border. The Irish constitution can only be amended by referendum. Dublin's objective is that any agreement on governing structures should be approved by a referendum in the north, while a simultaneous referendum in the republic would amend the Irish constitution and approve the agreement reached in the north. Simultaneous referendums are a key element in the Hume- Adams peace initiative, and acceptance of them by the British government is thought to be the signal Sinn Fein is looking for as the minimum condition for the IRA ending its campaign of violence. It is the concept of simultaneous referendums, which would acknowledge a say by the republic in the affairs of the north, which most alarms the unionists, along with another element of Mr Spring's six-point plan which states 'for many of us, of course, the freedom to determine our own future by agreement should ideally lead to the possibility ultimately of unity on this island'. Hardline and moderate unionist opinion are united in wanting to close the door firmly and definitively on such an eventuality.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Japanese to buy Arizona Biltmore THE ARIZONA Biltmore, a Phoenix hotel popular with US celebrities, has been bought by a property partnership which includes Japan's Aoki Corporation, for an undisclosed price. The sale, by Equitable Life Assurance, is the latest example of Japanese investors acquiring landmarks of American culture. The Biltmore, one of the oldest resort hotels in the US, is also one of the most attractive, with architecture inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright. Aoki owns Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts and was already the management company for the Biltmore. Its partner in the deal, Grossman Co Properties, is a US property developer with offices in Arizona and California. North America's major league baseball teams yesterday gave the final go-ahead for a Japanese-led consortium of Seattle businessmen to buy the local baseball team, the Mariners. It will be the first major league baseball team to have no North American owners.</p>

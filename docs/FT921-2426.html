			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (38): A global view of planning - Case Study: Unilever - A streamlining of its worldwide operations, involving 500 companies, is one of the benefits Unilever is seeing from a co-ordinated policy on information technology MULTIPLY a good idea by 500, and it becomes a strategy. As a multi-national operator in many different markets, Unilever is interested in creating products, not re-inventing the wheels of information technology. Its approach of creating re-usable software, founded on flexible relational database products, has already proved its value in its operating companies. Unilever's Personal Products Co-ordination (PPC) deals with everything from shampoo to prestige perfumes, from such well-known names as Elida Gibbs, Rimmel, Elizabeth Arden, and Calvin Klein. All these companies report into London where John Rothenberg, senior commercial member of personal products co-ordination, is responsible for planning, buying, and logistics, as well as finance. Interwoven with all these areas is another concern which Unilever puts under the 'commercial' umbrella; information technology (IT). This had become a many-headed monster as old and existing IT systems were absorbed into the Unilever structure. 'We had a real hotch-potch of systems, common to most multi-nationals but no more than most companies that are very acquisitive,' explains John Rothenberg. Two years ago, Unilever recognised that its information technology needed to be more business-oriented, and Rothenberg's predecessor at PPC - Mike Johnson  - became head of information technology. Now, the entire group is already beginning to see the benefits of a globally co-ordinated policy for information technology which is streamlining its operations. It is bringing all its applications into line behind two 'standard' Unilever database products, chosen by the central Information Technology Group. The incompatibility of computer systems was a further hurdle in what is already complex structure of reporting and communication within PPC. Information-gathering within the group takes place on a huge scale. Elizabeth Arden, for example, is just one company, operating in 25 countries, which is responsible for Dollars 3bn turnover worldwide. Both Arden and Calvin Klein are accountable to the US head offices which report into London. The personal products group started by defining the similarities between its operating companies rather than their differences - 'factory planning and logistics was the initial focus. A number of companies had a need in common,' says John Rothenberg. 'So we looked for a way to develop systems to implement in various operating environments without throwing away everything we already had.' Following the policy set out by the central IT Group, the group looked around for 'added value': not just a package, but the best possible system to serve the business. The plan was to find a model which would meet current planning needs and use it as the basis of a common system which would adapt to future needs. The improvement would take place once, centrally, not re-invented in every company in the US, Italy, or wherever, using a generic database as its foundation. 'The benefit was that we would get everyone up to current 'best practice' in terms of the planning process,' says Mr Rothenberg. 'Not only would the system be more efficiently developed, but in a shorter timescale, and any further improvements could be passed round very quickly after implementation. The technology and the development approach allows us to do that better.' They found the best foundation in France in February 1990, in a custom-built system called Socrate at Elida Gibbs-Faberge. The task was then to re-build the system using an 'open' database so that it would become globally relevant, and useable across different computers in an open environment. 'It was a matter of taking the best in terms of functions, not the computer hardware or software, and writing in that functionality,' explains Roger Clarke, commercial member of Unilever's Products Group. 'That's why the open systems environment offered us a real opportunity.' The open systems policy allows the team to take a modular approach, taking step-by-step in what would eventually be an interlocking worldwide project. The long-term aims are to improve customer service, and maintain it at a high level thereafter while reducing peration cycle-time without affecting customer service. The applications project starts with supplier management and purchasing, manufacturing, planning and scheduling. As explained by Roger Clarke, the plan is to interface the systems rather than integrate them, the difference being that existing applications can interface with new ones, (ie pass data) without necessarily being part of the same database-derived structure - 'but those interfaces have to be defined very carefully' he adds. The first step is a supplier performance system, for measuring how well individual vendors deliver to Unilever's required standards. The work on this particular module has been done 'in a relatively short time,' according to Roger Clarke, and is running in a test version in several European countries. Significantly, the work took weeks rather than months to complete, thanks to the development language, Uniface, and the database beneath it, Sybase. Sybase and Oracle are the two 'standard' databases settled upon by the central information technology group at Unilever's head office in Blackfriars, London, which has defined a policy for the whole of Unilever. 'One of the reasons for choosing Uniface is that it interfaces with other database systems including Oracle,' explains Clarke. 'In this particular application, we chose Sybase because of its strength in transaction processing. We were dealing with high-volume data and processing of data: the choice was made jointly with the central IT group.' Geoff Webb, head of the business applications group in Unilever's central information technology group (ITG), outlines the approach to global development, used not only in the personal products group, but in many other IT initiatives elsewhere in Unilever. 'We can only support such international projects by using open systems and standard tools around the entire group,' he says. The approach to the process of development is as important to Unilver as the choice of software tools, he emphasises. Mike Johnson's core IT team has defined strategies which apply throughout the rest of Unilever's 500-company empire. The idea of a universal IT strategy is business-based, as Webb demonstrates by a detailed grasp of the issues behind the Personal products prototype application - 'some of our suppliers are highly sophisticated IT-users, others are not: clearly, we have relationships with strategic suppliers and build partnerships to optimise them. There are a lot of things you can do to raise the bar to other competitors.' Geoff Webb's own business background in Unilever took place in various operating areas including detergents and animal feeds, and has fuelled his view of IT as a strategic weapon. 'Historically, Unilever is no different from anyone else, in that 10 or 15 years ago, IT was primarily used for automation. But recently we have decided there is more opportunity for using IT to support competitive operations. Our technical policy is driven by our business vision.' Redeployment of good ideas is at the core of the philosophy which led to to the selection of not one, but two 'in-house' database products. 'With 500 companies, if you have a good idea in one company, you should be able to roll it out around the world' says Webb. His attitude to Open Systems is pragmatic, and springs from Unilever's worldwide commitment to three hardware suppliers: IBM, DEC and Hewlett-Packard. 'Traditionally, you can't take an implementation of an idea from and IBM environment and put it into DEC Vax without a substantial effort. Now, with open systems, it's much easier to transfer applications between environments, and a whole wealth of business opportunities open up.' The choice of Sybase and Oracle was made from a shortlist which included Ingres, Progress, and Informix, whittled down from an original 20 or 30 database products. There was a long process of selection, by analogy with the choice of standard hardware suppliers. A lot were excluded because of being proprietary, and non-portable, others for the lack of installed base. The parameters included richness of function and, says Webb 'people with a vision.' The final choice hung on commitment to standards, distribution and support, with geographical spread playing an important part in the latter. Unilever also believes in 'partnership': for Oracle, Unilever is a major customer, served by a worldwide accounts team. So far, there are more Oracle than Sybase customers. 'There are areas of detail where Sybase and Oracle may not have the highest functions available in the market. But we have to use building blocks that are the same in 75 countries. That's where the richness and advantages are to be found.' The team was reluctant to put all its eggs in one database basket, not just for the business reason of being tied to a single supplier, but to give far-flung companies a better chance of finding local support. The uniformity extends to the look of the final applications - 'we want one look and feel, one way of interacting with the information on the screen, so whether people use Lotus, Wordperfect, Express EIS or whatever. PCs have to go down that path as well. By the end of 1993 all users will have the Motif interface. 'What we say to our suppliers is that we want them to 'add value' in areas that matter to us as users. The key to the partnership is mutual value: we deliver an attractive market, they deliver services. 'A strong dimension is dealing with someone in whose strategy you have confidence - someone who will be there in five years' time.'</p>

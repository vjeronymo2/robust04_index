			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman  described the peace talks held in Petersberg [near Bonn] with  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic as useful, during a news  conference today. At the same time, Tudjman made it clear that  Izetbegovic had welcomed only in principle the comprehensive  peace agreement with Bosnia-Herzegovina that he had submitted.  The Bosnian president had pledged to table counterproposals in  the near future as he was unable to accept the Croatian  proposals of his own accord. Tudjman's news conference, given  at a packed Croatian embassy, took place without German support.  Izetbegovic had reportedly already left Bonn by this time.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT DOESN'T REQUIRE MANDATORY INSPECTION OF SEAFOOD;  </P> <P> IT'S BUYER BEWARE AS CONSUMPTION OF FISH INCREASES TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH  </P> <P> How fresh is the seafood you buy? If you are one of the many Americans who are  eating more catfish, swordfish, or fillet of sole these days, you may find that  freshness depends on which supermarket or fish store you patronize. The quality  can be very inconsistent.  </P> <P> Fish consumption is at an all-time high in the United States because dietary  guidelines and health agencies recommend eating more seafood. Americans are  eating and enjoying dozens of species -- from cod, halibut, salmon and shrimp  to mussels, skate, tilapia and sea robin.  </P> <P> The nexus between diet and health has changed food preferences, and Americans  are consuming more low-fat foods than before.  </P> <P> This low-fat category includes both fin fish and shellfish. Per capita  consumption is 14.7 pounds a year, up more than 11% since 1980. Expectations  are that annual consumption may approach 30 pounds by 1990. That is still well  shy of chicken, in the 59.5-pound category, and beef, at a dwindling 79 pounds  per person.  </P> <P> The demand for seafood keeps climbing because of its high protein content and  because of the highly polyunsaturated omega-3 oils, found only in seafoods.  Recent oceanic pollution, however, particularly on the mid-Atlantic Coast, has  caused concern. More appears to be swimming in the oceans these days than just  fish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> But Is Our Fish Healthy?  </P> <P> As consumers, we are concerned about the fish and seafood we consume from a new  angle: Are we eating harmful fish and seafood in the quest for a wholesome  diet?  </P> <P> Are there hidden hazards in our seafood meals? Are fish and shellfish  contaminated with bacteria and industrial chemicals? How do we know?  </P> <P> There is no mandatory inspection of fish in the United States. Unlike meat and  poultry, which receive continuous inspection by federal employees, much fish is  sold virtually unchecked.  </P> <P> "Fish is the only commercially produced flesh food not subject to federal  inspection for wholesomeness," says Ellen Haas, executive director of the  Washington, D.C.-based Public Voice for Food and Health Policy.  </P> <P> "This can be somewhat alarming when you consider that Americans consume over  four times as much poultry and five times as much beef as fish, yet seafood  caused more illnesses in New York State in 1986 than meat and poultry  combined," Haas said on a visit to Boston.  </P> <P> "Mandatory fish inspection is the only way to assure the public of wholesome,  good-quality, fresh seafood and decrease the health risk," says Haas.  </P> <P> "The real question," she says, "is, 'Why can't it be mandatory in the U.S. as  it is in Canada?' "  </P> <P> Michael Windham, Louisiana's director of meat and seafood inspection, says the  "potential danger from human consumption of seafood is greater than it ever has  been from red meat and poultry." Windham emphasizes his point, noting, "If it's  important to have as many as 30 meat inspectors in a single plant, why don't we  have at least one in a seafood plant?"  </P> <P> Roger Berkowitz, manager of Boston's Legal Sea Foods restaurant chain, says,  "Fish inspection, yes, I'm all for it. An inspection by one organization would  be a good idea. We have our own fish inspection and it is very strict. We have  six restaurants and we consider our inspection and tests of the utmost  importance."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calls for Wider Controls  </P> <P> Some restaurant owners say it's not just the fish that needs inspection; the  water it comes from and the fishing boats need some kind of standards or  certifying. Still others say a well-developed sampling program would be too  expensive. Could the government do a good job of it?  </P> <P> Bruce Frankel, owner of the Colony restaurant in Boston, says it's how fish is  handled on the boat that makes a difference. "Two-day-old fish is OK if it's  been handled properly."  </P> <P> Susan Loomis, a Seattle-based writer who has just written a seafood book after  interviewing almost a hundred fishermen on their boats, says she thinks a more  thorough program is needed.  </P> <P> "I realize there is some inspecting going on, but many processors pay for their  own inspection," she says. "But I think there should be mandatory inspection  for fish, since we do have it for meat and poultry and produce. It should also  include the imported fish that is flown from ports all over the world into the  Fulton Fish Market in New York and to some other cities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Existing Regulation  </P> <P> Lee Weddig, executive vice-president of the National Fisheries Institute, sees  the plea for mandatory fish inspection in a different light.  </P> <P> "Some people may imply that this is an unregulated, uninspected industry. This  just isn't true," Weddig says. "Fish and seafood plants are products subject to  the Food and Drug Cosmetic Act, which mandates sanitary facilities and  wholesome products. It is enforced by the FDA, which conducts plant and product  inspections. Also there are state health agencies that inspect facilities and  products and prosecute lawbreakers."  </P> <P> Another factor, Weddig says, is that "seafood reaches the customer in many  different ways. The largest percentage is frozen. The next largest percentage  is canned; then comes fresh. A small percentage is smoked or cured.  </P> <P> "Therefore about half the product is ready to eat," he said, speaking at a Food  Marketing Institute conference in Chicago.  </P> <P> "Almost as much is cooked before consumption by the home cook or at  restaurants. This includes the fish fillets, steaks, shrimps and lobster tails.  Only a small percentage is eaten raw such as clams, oysters and sashimi,"  Weddig says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Voluntary Inspections  </P> <P> He agrees that consumption of raw fish poses special problems.  </P> <P> "We do have concerns over environmental hazards which can cause illness,"  Weddig says. He explains that many major companies employ the National Marine  Fisheries Service on a voluntary basis for more comprehensive inspection  service.  </P> <P> "Of the 13 billion seafood meals consumed annually in the United States, very  few present a degree of risk more severe than other foods of animal origin," he  says.  </P> <P> Included in these 12 billion to 13 billion seafood servings were 5 billion to 6  billion tuna sandwiches, salads, or casseroles; about 1.5 billion fish  sandwiches, and several billion servings of shrimp.  </P> <P> Weddig points out that about 40% of our imported seafood comes from such  countries as Canada, Iceland and Norway, which have specialized fishery product  inspection programs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fish Farming Limits Risks  </P> <P> While the fishing industry still depends on a wild, natural resource, more and  more fish and shellfish are being farm raised, with special attention to  controlled environment and other quality measures.  </P> <P> The Catfish Institute, for example, realizing that there is no mandatory  federal inspection of seafood, adopted the Mississippi Prime Inspection Program  in early 1988, to be conducted in conjunction with the U.S. Department of  Commerce and the National Marine Fisheries Service.  </P> <P> "We feel it is vitally important to establish strict standards of excellence  for our industry, particularly when there is so much consumer concern about the  safety of seafood," explains Bill Allen Jr., president of the Catfish  Institute.  </P> <P> "FDA's limited programs monitoring fish contamination fall far short of  providing assurance that the fish Americans consume is safe," says Haas.  </P> <P> A number of proposals have been introduced in Congress during the last 20 years  to establish a mandatory fish inspection program with jurisdiction over  inspection alternately proposed for several departments.  </P> <P> Haas's Public Voice organization believes the USDA would be the agency that  could best administer an inspection program.  </P> <P> "It has one of the largest research institutions. It has technical expertise  and significant expertise because of its experience with poultry and meat  inspection.  </P> <P> "In addition, while FDA has the mandate to protect the American food supply,  that is the major mission of the USDA. A mandatory federal inspection system  that gives one agency responsibility for its implementation would provide  Americans with safer seafood, a potentially nutritious, low-fat source of  protein," Haas says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seafood Safety Tips  </P> <P> For safer seafood preparation, follow these steps to make sure that the fish  and shellfish you eat are safe:  </P> <P>  -- Avoid eating raw or partly cooked seafood. Many bacteria are killed by  adequately cooking the fish.  </P> <P>  -- Call or write the local state Department of Public Health to find out if  local fish are contaminated. These offices often issue advisories on restricted  areas for commercial or sport fishing.  </P> <P>  -- Be particularly aware of waters near major industrial plants or those  contaminated with "red tides." Do not eat raw seafood or shellfish from areas  that are contaminated with either industrial chemicals or biological  contaminants.  </P> <P>  -- Keep all seafood well chilled, between 32 degrees and 40 degrees. All  seafood contains some bacteria that can multiply quickly in temperatures above  40 degrees.  </P> <P>  -- Do not store unfrozen fish more than a few days. Fish and shellfish will  ultimately deteriorate.  </P> <P>  -- Use most frozen seafood within three months. Frozen oily fish have about  half the shelf life of frozen lean fish. Use them within two months.  </P> <P>  -- Keep the freezer as cold as possible, don't crowd it and avoid opening the  door unnecessarily.  </P> <P>  -- Purchase fish and shellfish from reputable dealers with proper storage and  handling facilities.  </P></p>

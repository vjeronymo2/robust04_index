			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Travel: Two Welsh rivers with secrets to tell - Michael Woods follows the glorious progress of the Wye and the Dee THE FALLING sun cast a golden light over the the bracken and the recently mown hay meadows. Grey lines of bleating sheep followed grass ledges across the steeper slopes and a shepherd on a pony, accompanied by three tongue-lolling dogs, plodded slowly home. Below, the silver river wound across the temporary flatness of the valley bottom, a moment of calm before sparkling downwards once more through a rapid rocky bed. In spite of the fine weather and the summer holidays, the early evening Welsh countryside was empty of traffic. I had the road to myself. This was the upper Wye valley but it could equally have been the higher reaches of the Dee, for both rivers share similar beginnings. The Dee first sees the light of day in the southern part of Snowdonia national park, leaving Bala lake and flowing eastwards away from the sea. The Wye bubbles up from the slopes of Plynlimon and it, too, goes away from the nearest coast in a south-easterly direction. Apart from having only three letters to their names (it is surprising how many rivers, from the Fal to the Tay, have short names), these two rivers have much in common. Both rise in Wales but flow for part of their length into England where they pass English cathedral cities. In the case of the Wye this is Hereford where, presumably, there was a crossing-point over the obstacle of the river. The busy market area that has grown up there with its broad pedestrian streets, stone cathedral and small portions of city wall still visible, notably incorporated in a supermarket, seems to continue to view the Wye as a nuisance, turning its back on the river and allowing little obvious access to the water. At Chester, the Dee is welcomed much more openly for the river was once the life blood of this important Roman port, bringing trade from the sea long before Merseyside was thought of. The battle to preserve the channel of this constantly silting river was a long one, culminating in the canalisation of the final stretch from Chester to the sea, significantly improving the drainage of the adjacent farmland. The struggle for the old harbour has been lost, and it is now the Roodee, the city's race-course. A water tower stands some way from the Dee in the midst of whose waters it was constructed in 1325. This tower is connected to the remarkable curtain wall which forms a fine elevated pedestrian route around the city and can be joined and left at any point in either direction. It led me from the car park to the river where I found a busy waterside scene. Swans and ducks came for bread, small boats were for hire and there were regular trips on the large ones. A little downstream is the weir over which flows a glittering but carefully regulated amount of river, for the Dee is used as an open pipeline to bring water from the wet Welsh mountains to Liverpool. Particularly in their lower reaches, both rivers form boundaries, not only between counties but between England and Wales. And both have their secrets. Tucked away in the hills, along narrow lanes and up a steep drive, I discovered Celyn Vale Nurseries, devoted entirely to the growing of gum trees. The owner planted them originally to shelter his own land and discovered that these fast-growing evergreens, if raised from progeny growing naturally in the mountains of southern Australia and Tasmania, did well in the Welsh countryside. Now their interesting, if ecologically dubious, silver green foliage adorns this Welsh hillside. In turn, the Wye has its chair bodgers, hardly a fitting name for members of an historical craft, who hide themselves away in woods near Newbridge on Wye and run open-air courses for budding bodgers. Unlike those on the Dee, very many of the Wye towns and villages have included the name of the nearby river in their own. Ross-on-Wye, which occupies a commanding position on river cliffs practically overhanging the water itself, is English, while most of the rest are Welsh. Hay-on-Wye, though, would have you believe that it is entirely independent. This so-called book capital of the world contrives, in a rather antagonistic way, to declare itself a separate kingdom, which I felt gave an otherwise pleasant town an unhappy atmosphere. I much preferred the straightforward nature of the riverside notice at a nearby village which read: 'Fishing only by permanent inhabitants of Glasbury - unless with the prior permission of Major De Winton.' The Wye, rejuvenated in the steeply-wooded Wye Valley, has Tintern, a now-ruined testimonial to the efforts of monks of old. The Dee, as befits a river flowing in the industrial north, has a more modern but still working monument to man's ingenuity, the huge canal aqueduct near Llangollen. In a trough of cast-iron over 1,000 ft long and built in 1795, the Ellesmere Canal is carried over the River Dee whose brown tumbling waters rush over rocks some 125 ft below.</p>

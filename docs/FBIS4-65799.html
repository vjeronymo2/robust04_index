			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President-elect Roman Herzog after winning the </F> election in Berlin -- live]    [Text] Madame President, ladies and gentlemen: It is a  moving hour for me. Over the past few days, it has repeatedly  been recalled how the last presidential election that was held  here in Berlin in the Reichstag building took place in March  1969. Many of you may not know it, but, at that time, my wife  and I were citizens of West Berlin and we saw how the GDR  Government closed the roads leading into Berlin for a few hours,  even though no one knew how long it would really take at that  time. We never considered it possible that we would live to see  an event like this again.    It is a miracle. It is a miracle that we are experiencing,  and we -- I above all -- are very grateful to you, to those who  voted for me and to those who were unable to vote for me, that  this has become possible. I deliberately address those who  refused to vote for me for their own good reasons. I will try  to conduct my office in such a way that in the end, they will  regret not having voted for me. [laughter, applause]    Let me say a few words to my fellow candidates. For many  months, there were four of us and we were in constant contact  with each other. We had a good relationship. I do not claim  that I did not want to receive the majority, but I would not  have been envious of any of the three others -- and this is not  just an attitude; I really mean it. I also thank them for the  way in which we dealt with each other over the past few months.  I believe that what we did was a good piece of democracy, and  it is never wrong if, in a state like ours, things go this way.  My cordial thanks and respect to all of you.    I will do everything -- even though this is only a formula,  as you know -- to be the president of all Germans. [applause]    In our state and in our society, there are many borders that  run through us -- borders of conviction, borders of origin,  borders of historical experience, borders also of economic  interest, but, ladies and gentlemen, there are innumerable  things that we all have in common, which does not always become  clear in the controversy of the parties and in the controversy  of the large associations, but which must be clear so that this  state and this liberal society continue to exist and are able to  act. I will do everything to stress these unifying things,  these things that unite us all here in this hall and those who  are represented by us.    Our path into the future is more uncertain than it was five  or 10 years ago. The future that we are moving into is  difficult. It is not predictable without any problems as it  used to be for some decades in the past. However, ladies and  gentlemen, we Germans have the strength, we Europeans have the  strength to find this way and to follow it. We should never  doubt that, and we should never hide this fact. It is part of  our life. If we did not have this hope, we would not be able to  follow the path that we are facing.    I say this in particular referring to the irritations that  arise today from the difficulties in the wake of German  reunification. I address the citizens of the former FRG, who  now must make many sacrifices. Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot  spare telling you again and again: This is the compensation for  an injustice of international history, which was committed by  coincidence at the Elbe border. [applause]    On this side and the other side of the old Wall there lived  Germans. On this side and the other side of the old Wall, there  lived industrious, imaginative, and creative people -- and the  ones progressed more quickly, and the others did not. The ones  did so because the Americans helped them, which we do not want  to forget in this hour [applause] and, therefore, ladies and  gentlemen, because they had a political system that promoted the  fruits of their industriousness and did not again and again ruin  them and hinder them. This was an injustice of history, and  those who were favored by this injustice have the moral duty now  to create a balance.    I also want to address the people in the new laender. They  must understand that they are not a burden for us but an  enrichment. [applause]    They are contributing incredible things -- in terms of  experiences, which we in the West did not have. They lived in a  completely different world, in which many things were more  humane than in our world, in which many things were completely  different. They contribute experiences from their professions.  Treasures are lying fallow there, which must be dug out again  and on which these people can rely. We must be happy -- and I  am happy -- that they are with us again. [applause]    Madame President, ladies and gentlemen, over the next five  years, I want to represent Germany as it really is --  peace-loving; freedom-living; capable; trying, at least, for  justice; ready for solidarity; tolerant; open to the world; and,  which almost seems to be the most important thing for me, ladies  and gentlemen, easygoing. [applause] We Germans have not always  been easygoing. One certainly cannot claim that. We have  managed relatively well to eliminate this tenseness of the late  nation. It is my greatest concern today that this tenseness  might return, and we must counter this, perhaps also by some  elegant formulations, by some casual words. This Germany must  play its role in the world, but it must be easygoing and must  not show its teeth. This is the most important thing that we  have to do over the next few decades. [applause]    Just as I began with a personal reminiscence, I would like  to  close with a personal reminiscence, ladies and gentlemen. I  began my career almost 30 years ago in this city in West Berlin,  as it was called at that time. Then I moved around for 25  years. Your vote has now brought me back to this city, which I  have never stopped loving. I thank you. Berlin, I am back  again. [applause]</p>

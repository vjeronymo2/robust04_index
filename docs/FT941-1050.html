			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: New lease of life for Waddesdon - Lord Rothschild invites the public to a permanent party Waddesdon Manor, a bizarre fantasy of French chateau architecture in the midst of the Buckinghamshire countryside, was the stately pleasure dome of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild. Commissioned in 1874 from the architect Hippolyte Destailleurs, it took 15 years to complete. The situation, atop a pointed hill, was unpromising but the peak was sliced off and a huge artificial platform was erected to accommodate the house. A temporary railway was installed to bring the building materials from the nearest station at Quainton, four miles away, and was carried across viaducts in the garden known as 'Tay Bridge'. An entire 'model' farm and dairy was also created. When the estate was completed, it appeared as if it had been there for centuries. The instant effect of permanence was achieved by the wholesale importation of thousands of already-mature trees and the bedding-out of plants in tens of thousands. After a century, Waddesdon was in need of a face-lift, but what started out as a standard restoration by the National Trust, which owns the house and gardens, swiftly turned into the greatest revitalisation of a country-house estate in modern times. Six years ago, when he inherited neighbouring Eythrope and the family interest in Waddesdon, which includes land and buildings on the estate, Lord Jacob Rothschild decided to direct his considerable energy and taste - and money - into transforming both house and grounds. The ground floor and wine cellars can be seen from next Thursday when they open to the public. The first floor, which opens next year, is being returned to two grand rooms, fitted out with 18th-century French panelling found in the Waddesdon stables and originally bought by Baron Ferdinand in Paris. The panels have been restored and fitted by French craftsmen brought in from Angers and Bordeaux, while the whole operation has been under the architectural direction of Peter Inskip, assisted by Alain Gruber, the expert on French decorative arts. Three new rooms have been formed to display the sensational Waddesdon collection of Sevres porcelain. That collection now includes the remarkable 1766 Starhemberg service which has never been seen in public before. Lord Rothschild is attempting to complete it by seeking out examples of the biscuit figures that would originally have formed the centrepiece of the service. A separate exhibition space will be devoted to displays about the Rothschild family, featuring a specially commissioned painting of the family tree by Jean-Marc Winkler. This work traces the rise of the family from its origins in the ghetto of Frankfurt to the construction of 60 great houses across Europe by the five branches of the family in the 19th century. Miriam Rothschild, adviser to Prince Charles on his wild-flower meadow at Highgrove, author of the seven-volume definitive catalogue of fleas, and writer of over 300 scientific papers, calls the family 'the original EC'. She adds, with characteristic pungency, that all the gigantic Rothschild houses had one thing in common: 'Not a single member of my family had any taste whatsoever.' So much for the famed 'gout Rothschild', which was, after all, a taste that defied taste. And, let's be frank, Waddesdon is anything but a model of good taste. It is packed with sensational treasures, furniture, tapestries, pictures and panelling, purchased promiscuously throughout Europe, with a special predeliction for anything French, the more elaborately carved and gilded the better. But Miriam Rothschild concedes that her nephew, Jacob, is an exception so far as the family's lack of taste is concerned and under his influence Waddesdon is assuming a more coherent shape. When the ground floor, which contains most of the pictures and furniture, opens next week there will be some surprises. For the first time visitors will see one of the largest masterpieces of French 18th-century furniture, an 'armoire' by Bernard van Risamburgh, perhaps the most inspired of all cabinet-makers. Waddesdon was always something of a display-case on a huge scale, but the house is now being brought back to life. The decision has been made to provide an impression of readiness for a house party in Baron Ferdinand's time, by reference to photographs in Baron Ferdinand's 'Red Book' for 1897. Mercifully, for those who distrust the 'faction' approach to the presentation of historic interiors, the additions necessary to achieve this effect were few: the laying of a dining table; the recreation of some floral centrepieces. Lord Rothschild has put the vast wine cellars back to use, adding facilities for tastings and entertainment, and featuring the Rothschild family's great wines. In a similar initiative, Baron Ferdinand's original dairy at the foot of the hill has been transformed under Julian Bannerman into estate offices, a conference and entertainment centre, the exteriors scrupulously restored. Waddesdon's perilous similarity to seaside hotel architecture had not been helped by a diminished garden next to the house which had an uncomfortable air of a clock-golf circuit. With a scholarship from the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, Lord Rothschild's daughter Beth has supervised the recreation of the extraordinary 'ribbon planting' that produced massive raised flower-beds. These will be in keeping with the overweening facade which survives as the outstanding monument to the Rothschild mania for building and collecting: a crazily romantic fiction of a French chateau of a type that never was.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Alberto Moreno, general coordinator for </F> the Pastrana campaign: "Why Andres Is Going To Win"]    [Text] With the support of the Colombian people, Andres  Pastrana is going to be the next president of Colombia. The  reasons are threefold:    1. His understanding and practice of politics; 2. His  serious, specific, and viable government program; and 3. His  compatible, serious, and imaginative team of colleagues    1. Andres Pastrana understands and practices politics in a  different way. He tries to surround himself with competent,  upstanding people, no matter what party they belong to. He did  this as mayor and in the Senate, where he worked with Liberals,  Conservatives, and independents. Andres' multiparty philosophy  stems from his own convictions about who he is and what politics  is, convictions that he has demonstrated with deeds. This is  unlike the multiparty approach that Samper Pizano has proclaimed  at the eleventh hour, motivated by a publicity strategy as with  so many of his proposals.    Andres is in tune with the new country. This is why every  day  he receives more support from young people, women, and  independents. They are the spokespersons of a Colombia that is  tired of empty promises, corruption, and political hucksterism.  And they are key pieces in Andres' political agenda, as he  believes in young people and in women, not because of their age  or their sex but because of their potential, which has not been  properly harnessed.    It is with good reason that Andres has been building his  credibility among the public. Those who think that this campaign  is and ought to be polarizing Liberals and Conservatives are  wrong. This is a short-sighted view of the citizenry's position.  At bottom, this campaign is about credibility and trust, about  the person Colombians believe in and in whose hands they will  place their country's future. In this regard, the support for  Andres is telling. People know him; they know that he is  straightforward, honest, committed, and experienced. Those who  identify with the new politics acknowledge him as such. They  remember his record as mayor; this is why more and more people  are supporting his political agenda every day.    In contrast, the feeble single-party approach does not  represent the new country. Political parties are going through  an unprecedented crisis. It is a surprise to no one that  patronage and corruption are no longer the exception but the  rule, thus putting an end to ideological debate. They have  replaced it with a simplistic blend of mechanical alliances and  with subliminal messages that wind up trivializing politics.  This shows that they underestimate our thoughtful, reflective  young people, who would like to analyze and compare platforms  before voting for a color or article of clothing of little  significance.    Colombia is tired of lies. The incident involving Samper  Pizano and Juan Gomez Martinez is truly regrettable. To offer  the vice presidential nomination to the current governor of  Antioquia and then to retract it is altogether irresponsible. It  is worrisome that a presidential candidate's credibility has  been undermined, to judge by the opinion poll that one radio  news show conducted. The fact is that Samper Pizano should have  acknowledged the offer he made and explained the political  circumstances under which he did so. The country would have  preferred a clear answer to a lie.    2. Andres Pastrana is the only candidate who has put a  serious, specific, and viable government program before  Colombia. For the first time in history a candidate has  identified what the priorities of his administration would be,  what they would cost, and where the revenue would come from.  Andres' government program is, in itself, a development plan. It  has a profound social content. Education, drinking water, and  housing are priorities, because we want to make a leap towards  development. Andres is committed to these issues and to the  environment, infrastructure projects, agriculture and  agribusiness, the modernization of government, security,  justice, and a growing economy, based on the liberalization  model, that can create more and better jobs, and his commitment  is the result of a responsible analysis of national realities,  of people's needs, and of ways to meet them.    Meanwhile, shallow proposals such as the ones that Samper  Pizano made at the Economic Association of Friends of the  Country, for example the need to update our antimonopoly  legislation, reflect a lack of familiarity with the real world.  When I was development minister, I issued the regulations for  promoting competition that implemented the principles set forth  in Law 155 of 1959 and that contain provisions designed to  insure a free market without abuses by the players in it. This  law is now being enforced. Therefore, to call for its updating  when it has been in effect for barely a year is superfluous. The  problem here is a lack not of laws but of political will. And  Andres has never lacked will.    The other side's lack of a program is also worrisome. The  country is aware of Samper Pizano's contradictions. Let me  mention a few. In May 1993, for example, he said that "the  circumstances that justify the legalization of drugs are more  imperative now." But he later asserted that such a move "would  be an insult to those who have been slain by narcoterrorism."  During his time in the Development Ministry he fiercely attacked  the liberalization policies of the administration he was  serving, which cost him self-exile in Spain. Now, in contrast,  he admits that he wholeheartedly backs such policies. Likewise,  during his 1989 presidential campaign he defended patronage as  "a personal relationship between a political leader and the  community that he is trying to help." Today, however, realizing  that this political practice is on the decline, he says that  "patronage continues to exist and is worrisome." I share this  concern with Colombia: our citizens want clear-cut positions,  not vacillation.    3. Andres Pastrana has a compatible, serious, and  imaginative  team of insightful colleagues who can make adjustments. One of  Andres' major virtues is that he knows what sort of people to  surround himself with. He demonstrated this throughout his term  as mayor and in the Senate. His campaign team is conscientious  and works together. Most of us have known each other for many  years; we are friends and we believe in Colombia and in Andres.  None of us seeks personal gain. This is why we are working with  enthusiasm and conviction. We have not had to make a pile of  mistakes or heal rifts within the campaign staff, as the other  side has. This quality has enabled us to remain in tune with  each other and to act promptly, imaginatively, and tenaciously.    Andres Pastrana will be the next president of Colombia  because he is an open, receptive man who understands and  practices politics without sectarianism or clannishness. Because  he has shown his independence by taking stands that benefit the  country above and beyond groups and parties. Because he is a man  of action, as he has shown in both the mayor's office and in  Congress. Because he has the moral authority and the resolve  needed to combat corruption. Because as a public official he has  been steady and calm during crises and in handling problems of  law and order. Because he is a team player and surrounds himself  with good people. Because he is a man with renewal-oriented  ideas. In short, because what Andres wants for Colombia is what  the great majority of Colombians want.</p>

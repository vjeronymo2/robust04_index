			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: New plan to settle TWA pensions dispute THE BATTLE over the underfunded pension plans at Trans World Airlines, the heavily-indebted carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, the former corporate raider, took a new twist yesterday when the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation announced it had reached 'an understanding on key terms of an agreement' with the bankrupt airline's unsecured creditors. Under the outline deal, the carrier would issue a note covering 'a portion' of the underfunding. This would be secured on TWA's international routes and on its Kansas City maintennance base - so that if these assets were sold at a later date, the proceeds would flow to the pension plans. Payments on the note would be made over a 15-year period. The two plans would also be 'terminated' - that is, closed off - and the PGBC, the federal agency which underpins pension benefits in the US, would then pursue its claims against Mr Icahn and his other business interests. This could lead to legal action. The pension controversy has overshadowed progress on any restructuring at TWA for months. PGBC wants Mr Icahn, and his other companies, to make good some of the underfunding, which it calculates at Dollars 1.2bn. Until this is resolved, a reorganisation plan - which would give TWA's employees a 45 per cent stake in the airline in exchange for wage concessions, with unsecured creditors taking the remaining 55 per cent - cannot be implemented. The proposal comes a week after inconclusive talks between the PGBC and Mr Icahn, and does not have the TWA owner's agreement. TWA said yesterday the proposal was 'under review'. Meanwhile, the PGBC said it had informed the carrier's unions of the scheme and they were examining the plan. Most participants in the pension schemes would get full benefits under the proposal, although some fund members could face reduced benefits. Earlier yesterday, the carrier revealed a Dollars 3.2m loss for August after tax. The operating deficit was slightly larger, at Dollars 7.49m, although this was a considerable improvement on the Dollars 28.7m which the carrier lost in the previous month.</p>

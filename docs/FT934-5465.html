			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Surge in factory output expected Manufacturing output is set to rise sharply in the next few months, boosting recovery hopes, says a survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply published today. The survey indicates an increase in orders and a fall in stock levels while delivery times have lengthened. All these indicators point to a continuation of the recent relatively strong growth in manufacturing. An index published by the institute giving a view of output trends came out at 54.2 this month, the highest figure since April. In October it was 53.6. The November figure indicates that the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity has increased for the second successive month. It also shows that activity has increased compared with the previous month for the 10th successive month. The index is calculated from data supplied every month by purchasing managers in 300 manufacturing companies. A figure above 50 shows that activity is higher than in the previous month. A number higher than the one recorded in the month before shows expansion has accelerated. The output component of the index was at 59.3 this month, indicating a rise in the level of production for the 13th successive month. Full order books and a high volume of sales were widely reported as the main reasons for the continued upturn. The new orders component of the index came in at 55.8 this month, down from 56.3 in October but well above the levels of about 50 in both August and September. The survey shows raw material prices were stable in November in line with the general view that inflationary pressures are muted. Companies reported an overall expansion in staff numbers during the month, fitting in with matching recent evidence that unemployment is falling.</p>

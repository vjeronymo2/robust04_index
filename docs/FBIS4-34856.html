			<p>BFN     [Text] Rene Diaz Olivera, vice minister of domestic trade,  stated that effective 1 July, stores that sell articles for  travel abroad will close down.    Diaz explained that this measure was taken in light of the  current shortage of supplies, which became more acute at the end  of last year and continues this year. For this reason, stores  such as El Baluarte, La Internacional, and Lujos, which sell  shoes, clothing, and other goods for travelers, will close down  on 1 July. Diaz added that organizations and enterprises with  an established clientele will receive a letter giving more  details.</p>

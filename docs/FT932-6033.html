			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / The European Market: Headaches over VAT changes - Surprises thrown up by the new regime TAXES may be one of life's great certainties but meddling with the tax system can produce some unexpected results. The far-reaching changes to the European Community's VAT regime introduced on January 1 are a case in point. Second-hand car dealers in Belgium have seen much of their business move to Luxembourg now that purchasers can bring back vehicles without paying Belgian VAT. In Luxembourg VAT is levied on the dealer's mark-up; in Belgium it is charged, at a higher rate, on the vehicle's original list price. Similarly, marinas and boat repair yards around the EC's Mediterranean coastline have seen business shift to Turkey, Malta and North Africa, as new rules have closed a loophole exploited by wealthy yacht owners mooring their yachts outside the country of registration. No business engaged in cross-border trade within the EC has been unaffected by the new tax rules, but some specialist sectors have been particularly hard hit. The previous system of inspecting shipments and collecting trade statistics as the goods crossed borders has been done away with. Companies now file details of shipments directly to their customs authorities. Border delays and a mass of export documentation have also been removed. But in their place has come a system which many traders and accountants have denounced as adding a new layer of complexity. The EC hopes in 1997 to move to a system of levying VAT on the exporter, but until this can be achieved a transitional system, with a host of exceptions to the rules, has been brought in. The new system has succeeded in reducing border delays. Journey times have fallen throughout the EC, according to the UK's Institute of Freight Forwarders. But the demands placed on companies' computer and data-collection systems by the need to collect their own trade data have imposed severe strains. UK Customs say they have obtained the January returns from 77 per cent of those businesses required to file the more detailed monthly statistics, just above their target of 75 per cent. However, accountants and business organisations such as the CBI suspect this has only been achieved by companies devoting considerable resources to collecting the data manually. Problems have also arisen in a range of important areas, some quite unexpected. These include: Repair. A UK company which repairs a piece of machinery for, say, a French customer must, under the new tax regime, charge VAT. The VAT is reclaimable but only after a long delay and UK repairers fear they will lose business, says Mr Alan Buckett of accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn. Modified rules are now being prepared which would allow businesses to short-circuit this difficulty. Commodities. Oil and metal traders found that, for the first time, their transactions had become liable to VAT. Since stocks in store in tanks or warehouses often change hands dozens of times - without actually moving anywhere - deals were creating dozens of invoices each with a corresponding VAT liability. Although the VAT was reclaimable, once again, it took time, imposed a heavy administrative burden and had serious cash flow implications. The London Metal Exchange spent several months negotiating with the VAT authorities in each member state to overcome this problem. Agreement has been reached with most countries, with the exception of France, the LME said. Similar problems have faced the oil trade and London's International Petroleum Exchange. Three or four-country trade. Special rules have been brought in to help companies in one country buying goods from another country and selling on to a third, so-called 'triangular trade'. But if two middlemen are involved and there are four steps in the sales chain, complications have emerged, says Mr John Arnold of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The middlemen are finding they have to register for VAT purposes, which can be costly and time-consuming, and pay VAT. Processing. Definitions differ around the community - as they do for repair  -which gives an advantage to companies in certain countries. In addition, problems have arisen for companies which, instead of returning the processed raw materials to the original supplier, sell it on to a third party. This is forcing companies to register needlessly for VAT. Distance sales. Mail order companies and newspaper, magazine and book publishers selling more than Ecu35,000 (Pounds 27,230) (or Ecu100,000 in some countries) to private individuals in any country must register for VAT in that country and pay VAT at the local rate. Registration imposes a high cost relative to the value of the goods they are supplying. UK Customs says companies are better off under the new VAT regime. Many have yet to be convinced.</p>

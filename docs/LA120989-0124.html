			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'MERIT-ONLY' COLLEGE ENTRY PROPOSAL FAILING;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: OPPOSITION BY JAPANESE-AMERICANS TO ADMISSION POLICY CHANGE  FRUSTRATES GOP SPONSOR. REP. ROHRABACHER ISN'T GIVING UP THE FIGHT.  </P> <P> A last-ditch attempt by Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher to head off growing  opposition to his plan to promote "merit-only" college admissions policies  collapsed last week when a key California congressman rejected the second of  two proposed compromises.  </P> <P> The opposition of Asian-Americans to his proposals has surprised Rohrabacher,  who says his intention is to correct an injustice suffered by that ethnic  group.  </P> <P> The dispute between Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), whose district includes  northwestern Orange County, and Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) highlights  a renewed controversy over the use of affirmative action plans by colleges and  universities to promote the admission of blacks, Latinos and other minorities.  </P> <P> It also illustrates the political friction that sometimes is created when  Republicans attempt to commandeer an issue -- racial discrimination -- that has  been associated historically with Democrats.  </P> <P> "The Asian-American community is really up for grabs in terms of the two  parties," said one Democrat, who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> Opposes Quotas  </P> <P> A conservative Republican steeped in Libertarian political philosophy,  Rohrabacher has said he strongly opposes schools' use of racial goals or quotas  to admit minority candidates who do not meet academic standards established for  the rest of the applicant pool.  </P> <P> He contends that his position has been supported by a recent series of U.S.  Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the scope of affirmative action  programs, especially those established by government agencies.  </P> <P> But some Asian-American leaders and groups have sharply criticized  Rohrabacher's attempt to put Congress on record against school policies that  permit admission of more blacks and Latinos at the expense of Asian-Americans.  </P> <P> "The Rohrabacher proposal troubles me in two ways," said Matsui, who has  emerged as the leader of congressional opposition. "It tends to exploit the  Asian-American community . . . and it pits Asians against blacks and  Hispanics."  </P> <P> In the last two weeks, Matsui has turned down invitations by Rohrabacher to  endorse an amended version of a Rohrabacher congressional resolution on the  subject and to jointly call for a Department of Justice investigation.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, nonetheless, is pressing forward.  </P> <P> "There are people who come from underprivileged groups in the United States who  have trouble meeting the standards for admission to major universities. Proper  affirmative action would be to try to educate them . . . in order to meet those  standards," Rohrabacher said.  </P> <P> "It is not proper, however, to change standards for one group or the other . .  . simply because of their race," he said. "And the problem is, Asian-Americans  have been bearing the brunt of this."  </P> <P> In recent years, complaints have grown that highly qualified Asian-Americans  have been denied admission to such schools as the University of California at  Berkeley because school officials have reserved spaces for blacks and Latinos  with lesser academic qualifications. Studies have shown that Asian-Americans  tend as a group to score higher on achievement and other tests than other  ethnic groups, including whites.  </P> <P> In a resolution introduced in June in the House of Representatives, Rohrabacher  called on the nation's universities to end admission policies that discriminate  against Asian-Americans and asked the Justice Department to investigate  institutions whose admissions policies appear to violate the law.  </P> <P> In part, the resolution reads, " . . . it has been reported that many  institutions of higher education have instituted admissions quotas designed to  limit the admission of Asian-Americans. . . . These restrictive quotas are  similar to those instituted in the 1920s to limit the admission of Jewish  students."  </P> <P> A congressional resolution puts Congress on record on an issue but does not  carry the force of law.  </P> <P> In a recent address to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Rohrabacher  acknowledged that he has more in mind for the resolution than a redress of  Asian-American grievances.  </P> <P> "The way we can make sure people understand that quotas are un-American is to  show that by using quotas, they affect in a very detrimental way a small group  of Americans, Asian-Americans, who are struggling to improve their lot," he  said.  </P> <P> "So in a way, we want to help Asian-Americans, but at the same time we're using  it (the resolution) as a vehicle to correct what we consider to be a societal  mistake on the part of the United States."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher had signed up 73 co-sponsors, 27 of them Democrats, before Matsui's  opposition surfaced early last month. Matsui said he was responding to concerns  among members of the Asian-American community that Rohrabacher was attempting  to use the issue for his own political purposes.  </P> <P> Democrats Demur  </P> <P> In recent weeks, seven Democrats have withdrawn their sponsorship. But  Rohrabacher said they have been replaced by seven new Republican sponsors. The  measure would require 218 votes for passage.  </P> <P> In an interview last week, Matsui said he turned down the recent compromise  offers because he does not believe that Rohrabacher's measure is the proper way  to address the issue.  </P> <P> "We just don't think a congressional resolution is the way to go because all it  really does is heighten an issue in a way that doesn't produce anything,"  Matsui said. "What we're trying to do is work these things (admissions policy  disputes) out on a case-by-case basis."  </P> <P> He cited an agreement on admission policies at UC Berkeley reached earlier this  year after negotiations between school officials and community leaders as  evidence that that approach is working.  </P> <P> Specifically, Matsui rejected Rohrabacher's request to sponsor an amended  version of the congressional resolution that would have conceded the legitimacy  of affirmative action programs that do not violate the recent, restrictive  Supreme Court decisions.  </P> <P> In addition, Matsui declined to co-sign a letter to U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick  Thornburgh that asked the Department of Justice to investigate complaints of  admissions discrimination at Boalt Hall, the law school at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> Instead, Matsui, Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose) and other Democrats have drafted  letters to Thornburgh and Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos asking for a  report on the number of discrimination complaints they have received and the  disposition of the investigations.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Under the new federal plant closing law, 17 companies notified California  officials of plans to lay off workers. All but three -- Restaurant Enterprises  Group in Irvine, Prudential Home Mortgage in Woodland Hills and the H. J. Heinz  pet food division in Wilmington -- filed in the weeks before the law took  effect Feb. 4. A story Saturday reported inaccurately that the notices were all  filed after Feb. 4.  </P></p>

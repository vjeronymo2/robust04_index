			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Tena] </F>   [Text] Altamirano, Mexico, 3 Jan (AFP) -- The Zapata  National Liberation Army (EZLN) guerrillas will not hold talks  with the Mexican Government and will continue its war "until  obtaining victory," several rebel leaders said today when  interviewed in towns under their control.    The leaders said they are seeking to establish socialism in  Mexico through an armed struggle for which they have prepared  for the past 24 years.    Reaching the territory occupied by the EZLN, which made its  public appearance on 1 January, is no easy task, because there  are several rebel checkpoints manned by Indians who speak  Spanish with difficulty and collect a "war tax" of approximately  $17 for each media vehicle crossing it.    The first EZLN checkpoints are about 25 km from San  Cristobal  de las Casas on the road to Ocosingo, in northern Chiapas State,  which neighbors with Guatemala.    At those rebel checkpoints the guerrilla Indians are  blocking  access to Ocosingo, warning that civilians cannot go there,  because EZLN and Mexican Army troops are clashing.    The rebels control about 65 km of highway, along which there  are several checkpoints, up to the town of Altamirano, which has  approximately 15,000 inhabitants.    "Eliseo," who is about 20 years old and who wears a ski cap,  said that he has been a member of this organization for five  years and that it has conducted exercises all over the country.  He denied that the EZLN has ties to other armed movements  abroad.    "It is we Mexicans who organized: there are teachers,  peasants, and laborers among our companeros. There are also  church people; we are mostly Catholic," Eliseo said when  interviewed at the rebel checkpoint in Huistan.    "If the government wants negotiation, we will reject it; we  want them to leave leadership in the people's hands," he added.    Along the road leading to Ocosingo, where fierce clashes are  taking place according to various sources, people can be seen  fleeing with their belongings on their backs in search of an  escape route.    The rebels, who are visibly nervous, are closely monitoring  every movement in the area, especially vehicles, and are ready  to fire.    In Oxchuc, which has about 37,000 inhabitants and is also  under subversives' control, the residents are quietly  complaining about the situation, because they are unable to  leave town in public transportation vehicles, because the EZLN  has "borrowed" them.    Oxchuc resident Ruperto Jimenez said that that town only has  enough food for three days and that people fear for their lives  if there were Army-rebel clashes.    "We are EZLN members in honor of our hero Emiliano Zapata  (leader of the 1910 revolution), and we are seeking to impose  socialism," said a rebel "captain" stationed in Cuxulja.    The rebel, who identified himself as "captain," is about 1.6  meters tall and armed with an AK-47 rifle. He said that his  organization was established in the city in 1969 and was later  transferred to the mountains, where "we became guerrillas and  are now an army."    In Altamira the rebels have occupied the square and a  hospital run by nuns of the congregation Sisters of Charity, who  are taking care of eight men, six rebels, and two policemen  injured during combat.    Planes and Mexican Air Force helicopters frequently overfly  the conflict area.</p>

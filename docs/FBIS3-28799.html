			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nagoya, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Prosecutors indicted Diet  member Tadao Otani on Thursday [10 February] on a charge of  helping his supporters obtain tax refunds by falsifying receipts  and income reports.    Otani, 58, formerly of the ruling coalition party Shinseito  and now an independent member of the House of Representatives,  allegedly conspired with his former political secretary Susumu  Ochiai, 51.    The indictment came after police sent their case to the  Nagoya District Public Prosecutors Office earlier in the day.    The two men submitted false reports to the Aichi Prefectural  Election Administration Committee, from 1990 through 1992,  saying that Otani's support groups had received political  donations from 72 supporters for which, according to the  indictment, they issued false receipts. Otani's supporters then  claimed unlawful income tax refunds totaling 55 million yen,  prosecutors said.    Otani also evaded 1.2 million yen in tax during the 1990 to  1992 period by falsely reporting that he had donated 3 million  yen to one of the groups.    In a separate allegation, Ochiai submitted false reports  during that same period claiming that support groups had  received donations from 47 supporters to whom he issued  receipts, but later refunded a total of 38 million yen,  prosecutors said.    The supporters apparently each claimed tax refunds of  several  hundred thousand yen by reporting to tax offices false donations  of 1 million yen to 1.5 million yen.    Private donations by individuals to politicians are exempt  from income tax.    Prosecutors indicted Otani without arrest on charges of  violating the Political Funds Control Law and the Income Tax  Law. It is the first time a Diet member has been charged with  such a tax refund scam, prosecutors said.    Otani has denied his involvement, stating Ochiai acted on  his  own discretion.    At the time of the alleged violations, Otani was an Aichi  Prefectural Assembly member of the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP). Otani was elected in July last year as a lower house  member of Shinseito, an LDP offshoot. He left Shinseito last  month to serve as an independent member of the lower house.    Ochiai, indicted in December on charges of violating the  Income Tax Law in the case, pleaded guilty in his trial last  month. Ochiai was also indicted Thursday on charges of  violating the Political Funds Control Law.</p>

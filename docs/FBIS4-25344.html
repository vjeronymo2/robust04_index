			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, June 8 (CNS) -- The Communist Party of  China (CPC) established the first Party branch in Shenzhen for  230,000 individual entrepreneurs undertaking industry and  commerce. The deputy head ofthe organizational department of  the Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee, Mr. Lu Feng, said that  such practice would be promoted across the municipality.    There are to date 56,400 industrial and commerical  individual  entities as well as privately owned enterprises in the  municipality included in the taxation bracket. Privately run  enterprises account for some 3,000 with 6,000 workers employed.  Statistics showed that the number of individual business  entities each with a registered capital of RMB 100,000  [renminbi] was over 200. Some privately owned enterprises  possessed registered capital of RMB 20 million with employment  of 400 workers. Taxes paid by those individual business  entities were up to RMB 736 million last year, ranking Shenzhen  second only after Shanghai in terms of amount of taxes paid to  the state.    Individual entrepreneurs vary as far as morals are  concerned.  However, most of them are honest and abide by law in running  their business. Some individuals, however, are profit minded  and seek benefit at the expense of others. They usually resort  to tricks to do harm to consumers' interests.    The Yuanling market Party branch, first of such grassroots  group of CPC set up in Shenzhen, has seven party members who are  model individual entrepreneurs running business in the market.  They observed professional ethical codes and abided by law  during the past several years. They also did a lot for public  welfare.    Establishment of such a CPC grassroots organization for  individual entrepreneurs was of great significance to the  strengthened leadership of the economic groups of nonpublic  ownership, to the development of the special economic zone, to  the proper market management and to social stability.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Exceptional gain helps Hogg Robinson to Pounds 21m Hogg Robinson, the travel, transport and financial services group, announced annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 13.3m of Pounds 21.5m, including a Pounds 7.25m net gain from the sale of the holiday business to Airtours last year. The group benefited from an upsurge in business travel, with operating profits for the year to March 31 more than doubled to Pounds 4.58m, compared with Pounds 2.04m. Profits from transport, however, were down by 21 per cent from Pounds 6.04m to Pounds 4.76m. Mr Brian Perry, chairman, said the international trailer, haulage and logistics businesses had done well, despite the recession in Germany and other continental countries. It was insufficient, however, to offset weaknesses in HR Embassy, the UK-based general freight forwarding arm, which suffered from not being sufficiently large to benefit from economies of scale, Mr Perry said. He hoped to move this part of the business out of loss but said it would never make large profits. New management had been installed. He added that although the business was not on the market, he would consider offers. The third part of the transport business, the shipping service to the Falkland Islands, was severely affected by a drop in cargo movements to the south Atlantic. Financial services saw profits rise from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 5.65m. Mr Perry said this side of the business had strengthened in the second half of the year, as companies recovering from the recession increasingly purchased advice on pensions and employee benefits. Group turnover was down at Pounds 153.8m (Pounds 172.7m) including Pounds 9.48m (Pounds 30.4m) from discontinued activities and Pounds 1.4m from acquisitions. Earnings per share were 23.49p (14p). The proposed final dividend is increased by 8.75 per cent to 4.35p, bringing the total for the year to 7.1p, against 6.6p. COMMENT Hogg Robinson is not helped by the widely-held perception that it is still a holiday company. In fact, this part of the business has since been renamed Going Places by its new owners, Airtours. Nor is it aided by its corporate perversity in managing to run a transport business which does well in recession-hit Germany and badly in the recovering UK. While the business of carrying goods to the Falkland Islands is improving, it is difficult to see its prospects are particularly exciting. The profit increase in financial services is less than impressive in a recovering UK corporate sector and the group will have to demonstrate that the improvement in the second half is sustainable. The only unambiguous good news is in business travel, where the UK upturn has shown through in buoyant profit figures.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Spurs hit by Cup ban and big fine Tottenham Hotspur was last night banned from the FA Cup for a year and fined Pounds 600,000. In addition, 12 points were docked from its score next season. The penalty, the biggest ever imposed by the Football Association, was over irregular payments to players. The FA also ordered the north London club - which was saved from financial disaster in 1991 by Mr Alan Sugar's injection of cash when he formed the then 'dream ticket' with club manager Terry Venables - to pay the costs of its investigation. The FA looked at 40 charges relating to loans made to players in the 1980s. Mr Sugar, the chairman, Mr Colin Sandy, Tottenham's financial director, and Mr Peter Barnes, the club secretary, spent several hours at yesterday's hearing held at Wembley, before the fine was announced. Previously, the largest fine for a similar offence was Pounds 105,000 imposed on Chelsea in 1991. The punishment is a severe financial setback to the club, which only just escaped relegation to the first division last season. The loss from FA Cup exclusion, with possible relegation next season - which will be more difficult to avoid starting with a 12-point deficit - could amount to millions. Mr Bernie Kingsley, co-ordinator of the Tottenham Independent Supporters' Association, last night demanded that the FA clarify its ruling. He said: 'The FA needs to make absolutely clear which charges Tottenham is guilty of and who they consider responsible so the club can take its own action.' The FA has said only that it found Tottenham guilty of a range of irregular payments. Mr Kingsley also argued that loans were not against the association's rules and that the breach was technical, in that they were not reported. Tottenham Hotspur shares have slid as the FA hearing has approached. Yesterday, with the market closed before the fine was announced, the price stood at 80p. The hearing comes just more than a year after Mr Sugar went to the High Court to oust Mr Venables, now the England coach, from his position as chief executive of Tottenham. A Tottenham spokesman said last night that the club was shocked at the ruling's severity, and added: 'Spurs provided all the information on the offences - all of which took place before Alan Sugar took control - voluntarily.' Mr Sugar said: 'I was always brought up to believe honesty is the best policy, and have followed that throughout my career. The punishment dished out today is a bitter pill to swallow if you adopt that policy as I have done.'</p>

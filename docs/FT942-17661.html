			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / China detains dissident again China yesterday detained its most prominent dissident for the second time in a month, thus risking further inflaming international criticism of its human rights behaviour. Police seized Wei Jingsheng, the pro-democracy activist, as he was travelling by car from the port city of Tianjin to Beijing. He was 'exiled' to Tianjin last month during the visit to China of Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. Mr Wei, 44, was held for 30 hours last month on the eve of Mr Christopher's arrival in Beijing before being sent to Tianjin. China's crackdown on political dissent in the past month, including the arrests of more than a dozen activists, has been condemned internationally. The arrests coincided with indications of growing official nervousness over dissident activity and signs of industrial unrest. In a mildly worded reaction, the US said it had asked its embassy in Beijing to check reports of Mr Wei's detention. 'If true, we regret that the Chinese government has taken this further step to harass Wei and urge that he be released,' the State Department said.</p>

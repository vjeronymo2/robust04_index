			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Observer: Carrying the can It will be months before Britain's 5,000 private detectives can estimate the damage done to their trade by this week's crown court ruling in Isleworth where a Pounds 12,000-a-year gumshoe was fined Pounds 150 for stealing bags of rubbish from outside the house of a senior Sunday Times' journalist. The sums of money involved are petty, but the judgement has sent shivers through some sections of the detective trade. If the judgement goes unchallenged, the fear is that one of the most lucrative sources of raw material for many investigations - the humble rubbish bag - will be off limits. It is thought that this is the first time that a court has ruled that stealing a rubbish bag from outside a house constitutes theft. 'You would be surprised how much information people throw away,' says Barry Trigwell, group operations director of the Nationwide Investigation Group, Britain's biggest private detective agency. Encouraging bin men to drop off black bags of rubbish at the end of the street, rather than into the corporation dustcart, is a well known trick of the trade for many investigators. Trigwell is 'shocked' by the decision and says it will make his job a lot harder. By contrast, Peter Heims, a past president of the Association of British Investigators, welcomes the Isleworth decision. He says that pinching a person's rubbish has always been a rather grey area of the law and he's glad that there has been a ruling. He recommends that his members sift through the rubbish bag on site and copy down what they want to find out. Now that sounds like really hard work, especially if it's raining.</p>

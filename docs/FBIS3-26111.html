			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chao Ming (6392 2494): "Secret `106 Work Office'"] </F>   [Text] What does the figure "106" represent?    Regarding the CPC top echelon, this popular figure  represents  a "state secret" unknown to the man in the street.    For a long time, the CPC has been fond of using number codes  to name some sensitive departments. The full name of this "106"  is the "106 Work Office," which was founded on 6 October to  specialize in collecting, studying and analyzing the conditions  of personages from political, military economic and monetary  circles of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, report to the State  Council and the Central Military Commission, and set out  specific strategies, principles, and policies toward Taiwan,  Hong Kong, and Macao.  <H5>  Branches Will Be Set Up in 16 Cities </H5>   At a time when Hong Kong and Macao are to be returned to  China soon, and Taiwan's political situation is in turbulence,  it is unusual for the CPC to have founded the "106 Work Office."  The "106 Work Office" is ready to expand in a big way in the  near future. When it was first founded, the office was set  inside the People's Liberation Army Headquarters of the General  Staff Political Department in west suburban Beijing, and moved  to the Jingxi Guest House in early December; however, the actual  place for its work were at some barracks under Guangdong  Military Region in Conghua and the Shanghai Garrison Command in  west suburban Shanghai. Besides, branches or teams were set up  in late November last year in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Haikou,  Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shantou, Zhuhai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Wuhan,  Lianyungang, Qingdao, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Dalian, and Shenzhen;  these offices were all set up at local military or garrison  commands.    But nobody should believe that the "106 Work Office" was  conducting mysterious "underground activities," for it has  already conducted open and above board activities. It was  learned that the "106 Work Office" was operating under the names  of the Office for Taiwan Affairs, the ARATS Office, the office  of research, the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, or the  State Council General Office in work concerning external affairs.  <H5>  "106 Work Office" Is To Focus Its Efforts on Taiwan </H5>   Because of the considerably important role of the "106 Work  Office," the CPC top-echelon paid great attention to it as soon  as it was established, equiped with the most efficient  personnel. On 7 December last year, the State Council, the  Central Committee,and the Central Military Commission called a  meeting at Beijing's Jingxi Guest House, and ceremoniously  announced that the "106 Work Office" had began work in a  comprehensive way; Li Peng and Liu Huaqing attended the meeting  and delivered speeches.    Liu Huaqing's speech was noteworthy, in that he acknowledged  that the "106 Work Office" would devote its energy and efforts  to Taiwan affairs, and was a work department which would offer  suggestions to the top echelon of the central authorities in  resolving the Taiwan issue; thus it must consist of the cream  from the party, government, and military departments.    Liu Huaqing indicated that the core and most arduous job  today is Taiwan; that being the case, the "106" must focus most  of its energy on doing work concerning Taiwan.    Liu Huaqing stressed that the "106 Work Office" was not a  provisional work organization, but would probably exist for 10  or 15 years and even longer; but perhaps it would not last 10  years, or 5 years; in a nutshell, it would all depend on the  development of the situation and changes in Taiwan and Hong Kong.  <H3>  Personnel Are the "Cream of Party, Government and Military  Departments" </H3>   Viewing the personnel of the "106 Work Office," they are  really up to Liu Huaqing's requirement in his speech, namely the  "cream from the party, government, and military departments":    Its director is Zou Jiahua, and deputy directors are Ding  Wenchang, Tao Siju, and Jia Chunwang.    The office is comprised of five groups: liaison, research,  intelligence, coordination, and economic groups.    The major personnel were all selected from the General Staff  Headquarters, the Ministry of Defense, the University of Science  and Technology for National Defense, the Office for Affairs of  Taiwan Affairs, the Office for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macao,  the Department of United Front Work, the Ministry of State  Security, the Central Committee policy research center, the  Guangzhou Military Region, the Nanjing Military Region, and the  Air Force, with 70-some basic members, who were all cadres at  and above department level.    Besides, the CPC gave the green light to the financial needs  of "106 Work Office." A source from the State Council said that  Li Peng and Zhu Rongji approved a first allotment of 280 million  yuan to the "106 work office" for its preparations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the Georgian Parliament continued discussions  and confirmation of nominees to the Cabinet of Ministers.    During the sitting, some representatives of the minority  again put forward an issue of the authority given to Aleksandr  Kavsadze, the head of state's personal envoy and chairman of the  Committee for Human Rights and Ethnic Relations, who had signed  a package of documents on the Abkhazian problem on behalf of the  Georgian side. Head of state Eduard Shevardnadze took a stand  and made a speech, during which he emphasized that while  exercising special authority as a leader of the country, he had  the right to take independent decisions on the candidatures to a  delegation participating in the Abkhazian-Georgian talks.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Skilled workers 'less confident' Skilled workers are less confident about the economy and job security than any other social group, according to the latest FT/MFS Mood of the Nation Index. The 'feel-good' factor among the C2 social group - the bedrock of Conservative success in the 1980s - fell 10 per cent in the past month. Skilled workers are more pessimistic than unskilled workers, while confidence among the professional and managerial classes rose 24 per cent this month. The overall index has recovered from a two-month depression triggered by the rise in interest rates. The index rose two points to 90, but is still 10 points lower than its starting point in April last year. The rise reflects a slight reduction in the number of people who think the economy will worsen in the next 12 months. The survey shows, however, that the workforce is just as concerned about redundancy as it was in October. One third of the 1,932 people surveyed think the economy will deteriorate, while 21 per cent are concerned about losing their jobs. Professor Robert Worcester, chairman of MORI Financial Services, the index compiler, said: 'More than one in four of the backbone of the electorate is very or fairly concerned' about losing their jobs. He added: 'The feel-good factor is traditionally about whether the economy will get worse, but people are saying that is not the case. People are worried about their own jobs.' Tory supporters remain the most optimistic of all political groups, as their confidence rating rose 41 points to 207. The feel-good factor among Tories is more than twice that of Liberal Democrats, who register an index of 97, and Labour voters, who score 75. Confidence levels among mortgage holders rose 4 points to 87, but still lingers below the average index level of 90. The north of England failed to feel some improvement in the economy and labour market, as its rating fell from 80 to 78. Scotland recorded the highest rise in confidence from 76 to 84, overtaking greater London, which fell from 91 to 82.</p>

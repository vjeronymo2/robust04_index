Teodor Melescanu said that the future of the economic  cooperation in the area after the extinction of the conflict,  the embargo consequences incurred by the economies of the  neighboring countries, as well as the possibility of retrieving  the losses were further themes of major interest discussed  during the meeting.    "Also, it was accepted for the first time now that a  political-military equilibrium should be achieved in the area.  And I believe that even the fact that the necessity was  mentioned of continuing such contacts among the neighboring  countries, including at a higher level, is a recognition of  Romania's idea as to the contribution of the countries in the  area to seeking a solution for the peaceful extinction of the  conflict," Teodor Melescanu added.    Referring to the latest decisions of the North Atlantic  Alliance, the Romanian foreign minister said that "the only  problem now is to find concrete possibilities for the withdrawal  and especially of monitoring its observance. I am afraid there  is the danger in this period of all kind of attempts to cause  incidents, so I believe a very serious involvement of the UN  forces will be vital."</p>

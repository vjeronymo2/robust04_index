			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4,500 MARATHONERS TO COMPETE TODAY IN LONG BEACH RACE  </P> <P> About 4,500 runners will compete in the eighth annual Long Beach Marathon  today, starting at 7:30 a.m. in front of the Long Beach Convention Center.  </P> <P> Included in the field are runners in the Pacific Rim Championships, which  feature entrants from 14 countries -- among them the Soviet Union, China,  Japan, Indonesia and Australia.  </P> <P> Last year's overall winner, Naek Sagala of Indonesia, is back this year, again  competing in the Pacific Rim race. His winning time in last year's warm  conditions was 2 hours 21 minutes 37 seconds.  </P> <P> Sagala is not the favorite, however. A Soviet runner has the fastest time of  those entered, although there was some speculation whether the Soviets, who did  not arrive as scheduled, would show up. Viktor Gural, a 27-year-old student, is  the prohibitive favorite with his time of 2:11:30.  </P> <P> Jeff Dettmer of Anaheim, who was second in last year's race, is the top  American with a time of 2:14:20. Jose Luis Chuela, 29, of Mexico, has a  2:12:08.  </P> <P> The women's race is decidedly weak. Irina Ruban, 27, of the Soviet Union has  the fastest time, 2:30:40. Soviet teammate Tatiana Zueva, 31, has the field's  second-best time, 2:32:30. Anita Johnson of Long Beach is the top American  woman with a best time of 2:52:52.  </P> <P> Race walkers will start at 7:20 and the wheelchair competitors at 7:25, at the  corner of Long Beach and Ocean boulevards.

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Walesa blocks finance posting Poland's two-month search for a finance minister hit further delays yesterday when President Lech Walesa refused to accept Mr Dariusz Rosati for the post, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Mr Rosati, an economist working for the UN in Geneva, had been proposed by the social democratic SLD, the larger of the two governing coalition parties. His name was grudgingly put to Mr Walesa for formal approval by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister and the PSL farmers' party leader, yesterday after heavy pressure from the SLD, which was handed the finance portfolio in the coalition deal agreed between the two parties last autumn. By blocking the candidature President Walesa is in effect backing Mr Pawlak, who is fighting to win more control over financial policies and has been unhappy with Mr Rosati.</p>

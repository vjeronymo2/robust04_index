			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / TSB workers to be balloted on action Bifu, the banking union, is balloting 1,000 insurance sales staff at TSB Group over a work to rule because of the company's refusal to pay a 5 per cent bonus. The union said the one-off bonus had been paid to 20,000 other TSB staff, and the exclusion had angered sales members of Bifu.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Man in the News: Lloyd's reformer who may not see results - David Rowland David Rowland, the dapper businessman at the helm of Europe's biggest insurance broking firm, Sedgwick, could well be the best chairman that Lloyd's of London never had. This week, as head of a task force on the future of the Lloyd's insurance market, he produced a radical blueprint for reform. Unfortunately for those who favour sweeping change, his responsibilities stop here; Lloyd's officials must carry the burden of putting the reforms into practice. Despite the welcome the Lloyd's establishment gave the bulk of his proposals on Wednesday, reform of the 300-year-old market could still run into the sand, as so often before. Mr Rowland, who is 58, was a natural choice to head the task force. He has been at Lloyd's for all his working life, but as a broker he is not totally dependent on the market. His company derives only around 10 per cent of its revenues from business with Lloyd's syndicates. This 'semi-detached' relationship has given him a wider experience than many of his colleagues among Lloyd's top brass; it also makes for a certain objectivity about the market's difficulties. It is thus not surprising that Mr Rowland has proposed far reaching change. In the short term, he wants to modify one of the central principles governing Lloyd's activities: that of 'unlimited liability' for Names, the wealthy individuals whose personal assets provide the market's capital base. Many of the Names are facing heavy losses as a result of the scale of damages awarded by US courts and natural disasters in Europe. The task force has provided no relief for victims of past losses, but its recommendations should remove the prospect of bankruptcy for Names in future. The task force goes well beyond these short-term measures, however. It also sets out a blueprint for much more drastic change, including the admission of insurance company subsidiaries to the market. These changes would finally sever Lloyd's from its fiercely individualistic roots. None the less, Mr Rowland is steeped in Lloyd's traditions. He says he has 'loved' the institution ever since 1956 when, fresh out of medical school at Cambridge, he joined a small family-owned insurance broker, Matthews Wrightson. Perhaps surprisingly - in view of the scandals that rocked the market in the late 1970s - he says the reason for his attachment was the honesty and trust that traditionally underpinned trading at Lloyd's. Such factors, he says, permitted the market to work with an informality that also bred efficiency. 'Early on it dawned on you that peculiar though the work methods might appear, it ultimately produced an extraordinary efficiency,' he says. 'Nowhere in the world could you achieve results so fast. Equally, nowhere in the world did you fear less that the bargain you struck would be unnecessarily rescinded.' The trust that allowed Lloyd's to combine informality with efficiency was greatly weakened by what Mr Rowland calls 'the appalling unfolding of the 1970s.' He finds it hard to sort through the waves of scandal that hit the market: 'It's all a bit jumbled and unclear, as indeed one's own emotions are.' He knew things were going wrong, but never had the evidence to prove it - and sometimes found the wrongdoing he suspected inconceivable or impossible. Joining the Matthews Wrightson board at the age of 31, Rowland steered the firm into successive mergers, to form Stewart Wrightson, one of the most successful insurance brokers of the 1980s. The climax of this process was a merger which joined Stewart Wrightson with Willis Faber. But for Mr Rowland, this proved one merger too many. He left shortly afterwards to head a much bigger rival, Sedgwick. Nevertheless, the skills displayed in the series of mergers - persuading highly paid, sometimes contentious personalities to work together - were to make him a natural choice to head the task force last year. It was formed in an atmosphere of crisis, with Names deserting Lloyd's in their thousands. Meeting entirely at weekends, the task force brought together a range of underwriters, brokers, market bureaucrats and outside advisers, all of whom had very different views about Lloyd's future. Throughout, Mr Rowland aimed for consensus. 'He has done it with a great deal of skill, humour and, above all, authority,' explains one member of the task force. 'His great expression was 'Let's pause for a moment, let's reflect a moment.'' The emphasis on consensus has produced a well-written, clearly thought out report, that starts from the assumption that Lloyd's must continue to grow, not shrink - as some outsiders have suggested - to a specialist core. The weakness of Mr Rowland's consensus approach, however, is shown in the crucial issue the report does not tackle: the crippling losses imposed on a relatively small number of Names by the disastrous business conditions of the late 1980s. Mr Rowland subscribes to the view summed up more brutally by Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman: 'The losses that are there have fallen where they fall. The policies that produced them are a fact of life. The syndicates that picked them up are a fact of life.' There is no attempt in the task force report to provide any retrospective help to those Names afflicted by heavy losses. Though this was probably the only feasible basis for consensus, it is certain to dismay those Names who have been campaigning for a rescue scheme, and this continued bitterness will continue to hamper attempts to set Lloyd's on to path for the future. Much therefore hangs on the skill with which the reform plans are piloted through the cumbersome Lloyd's machinery. Mr Rowland stresses that the report is designed to produce action: 'It doesn't do any good if you don't achieve change as a result.' He is concerned by the decision of the Lloyd's Council to reject the report's recommendations on corporate governance, which would have split regulatory supervision from business management. The aim of the proposed new structure was to create a powerful new business leadership for the market, run by its core members, the underwriters who assess risk. 'Lloyd's will never wholly solve its problems until it actually realises it is an underwriting market and it should be run by underwriters', says Mr Rowland. The Lloyd's Council's immediate rejection of the governance proposal does not augur well for the forceful implementation of the Rowland reforms. None the less, Mr Rowland is optimistic. 'The task force has created opportunity,' he says, and that will lead to inevitable change: 'I think there is a good chance that market forces - pressure of people's opinions - will not allow anything other.'</p>

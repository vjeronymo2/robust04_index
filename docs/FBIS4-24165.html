			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, June 25 (AFP) -- Congo favours sending  troops to Rwanda to support French troops carrying out a  humanitarian mission on condition the Union of Central African  States (UDEAC) asks it to at its meeting Monday [27 June] in  Libreville, an authoritative source said here Saturday.    "We had planned to send troops in the framework of the  United  Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda. But because of the size  of task, if UDEAC decides to speed up this mission with respect  to the French intervention, we are ready to do it," the source  told AFP.    On Friday, the six UDEAC heads of state welcomed the French  initiative.    Congo has 25 officers in Rwanda as part of the UN operation  and plans to boost its contingent to 300 men.    Senegal is the only African country to have taken part in  the  French operation.</p>

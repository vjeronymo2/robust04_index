			<p>BFN     [Text] The North Sumatera regional chapter of the  Coordinating Agency for the Strengthening of National Stability  will take stern action against workers who stage protest  demonstrations within its jurisdiction. Major General Pranowo,  commander of the Bukit Barisan Regional Military Command, said  this to reporters in Medan today after tens of thousands of  workers yesterday staged violent demonstrations, during which  they destroyed dozens of houses, four cars, and one motorcycle.    He said the authorities will not tolerate any protest  rallies  staged by workers in the future because such rallies will lead  to destructive actions. Besides, the workers' demands no longer  represent the true wishes of the workers themselves due to the  interference of irresponsible elements which may undermine  national unity and stability.    [Hong Kong AFP in a Jakarta datelined item at 1201 GMT adds  the following: "Indonesian security authorities in North  Sumatera Friday clashed with 40,000 workers demanding better  conditions and arrested at least six of the demonstrators, a  lawyer said.    "The demonstration occurred on the outskirts of the North  Sumateran city of Medan, and the number of participants was  double that who protested on Thursday, said Hasbi Ansori, an  attorney with the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute (LBH).    "Ansori, who was at the demonstration, said security forces  attempted to break up some 40,000 workers from around 40  factories in an industrial area north of the city.    "But an officer at the North Sumatera Police said the  demonstration involved only 10,000 workers in the three  industrial zones of Mabar, Pulau Brayan and Gelugur. He said  the workers had been completely dispersed in the afternoon and  that 70 people were under questioning.    "As the demonstrators were marching towards the city, Ansori  said he saw at least six people being hauled away by security  forces after the rally turned violent.    "Security forces began to break up the protest as  demonstrators threw stones at factories and passing cars.    "The officer, who declined to be named, said that police  forces in the Medan area had been put on 'first alert' Friday,  but that the status might fall back to 'second alert' Saturday.    "North Sumatera military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel  Marjono  said on the telephone from Medan that security authorities 'will  not tolerate (this type of activity) and will take firm action  against labor protests because they have stepped out of limit.'    "Marjono, however, denied that any arrests had been made.    "Ansori said shops and offices had closed Friday in Medan,  the third largest city in Indonesia, for fear of trouble. The  city's streets were deserted.    "He said he believed the workers staged Friday's rally  because they had failed to obtain a meeting with North Sumatera  Governor Raja Inal Siregar during their rally Thursday.    "'It might become bigger and bigger should the authorities  ignore their demand,' Ansori said, adding that at least two  isolated groups of workers were still protesting in the  industrial area.    "The workers urged the government to improve employee  conditions and grant them the freedom to organize and improve  wages. They also wanted an investigation into the death of one  of their fellow workers who died last month in the wake of a  labor protest.    "The battered body of Rusli, a worker of rubber industry PT  Industri Karet Deli, was found in a local river one day after he  had led a workers protest last month. But no investigation into  his death had been undertaken, Ansori said.    "Earlier this month, Indonesia's largest independent trade  union postponed its planned nationwide strike that had been  scheduled for early April to protest worker conditions, saying  that discussions with the government were underway.    "The US government has threatened to revoke Indonesia's 600  million dollars worth of annual trade privileges unless it  improves worker conditions, and temporarily extended the  privileges for another six months."]</p>

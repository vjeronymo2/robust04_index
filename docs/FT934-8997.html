			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UUP offers Ulster peace hope: Unionist party prepared to forge close links with Irish Republic THE Ulster Unionist party has told the government it is prepared to forge 'close and visible links' with the Irish Republic as part of a Northern Ireland settlement. The proposals conflict sharply with a peace plan published yesterday by the Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, which rules out any role for Dublin. However, the UUP's approach bodes well for the peace process launched two weeks ago by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier. The Major-Reynolds initiative has shown signs of running out of steam as a result of Unionist fears that Dublin is willing to talk to Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. Ministers are understood to see the UUP's proposals as signs of 'positive thinking' that could contribute to a settlement in proposed round-table talks between the two governments and Northern Ireland's four non-violent political parties. Mr Ken Maginnis, the UUP deputy leader, said the proposals were based on the party's final presentation to the last round-table talks, which broke down a year ago. The UUP blames the failure of the last round on the Irish government's refusal to cede ground on Unionist demands for the withdrawal of its constitutional claim to the province. The Irish government has since said it would be prepared to drop its territorial claim as part of an overall settlement that would be subject to majority consent. The UUP proposals were discussed this week by Mr Major and Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader. They focus on the creation of a Northern Ireland assembly with an inter-Irish relations committee, which would represent a 'formal link' with the Irish parliament. The UUP also proposes a bill of rights to allay the fears of the Catholic minority, and a 'meaningful role' in the administration of the province for the nationalist SDLP. The DUP proposals, entitled Breaking the Logjam, call for elections to a Northern Ireland assembly, which would draw up a new constitution for the province within the UK. The document, handed to the government six weeks ago, says that proposals gaining 60 per cent support within the assembly would be put to parliament. The final package would be subject to a Northern Ireland referendum. Mr Paisley said Sinn Fein would be allowed to stand for election to the assembly, but would be excluded from negotiations on the form of the government. There would be no role for the Irish government. Sinn Fein leader is barred from US, Page 9</p>

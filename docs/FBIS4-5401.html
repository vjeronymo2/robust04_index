			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- The leaders of the  seven-party governing coalition agreed on Saturday to pick a  successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and form a new  cabinet next week, coalition officials said.    The leaders also decided to make efforts to initiate  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget in the week that  will start on April 17, the officials said.    The accords were struck at a meeting of the leaders of  coalition partners who banded together to decide on the course  of the government following Hosokawa's bombshell announcement  Friday that he would step down as premier.    Budget debate has been paralyzed due to a four-week  opposition boycott over the premier's refusal to summon his aide  over Hosokawa's financial deals.</p>

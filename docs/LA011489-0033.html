			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POWER AND THE PUBLIC  </P> <P> Hedrick Smith's television series "The Power Game" proves again that even  public television can succumb to pressures to please viewers at the expense of  informing them ("Potomac 'Power Game' -- Rule No. 1 Is . . . Take Care of No.  1," by Howard Rosenberg, Jan. 2).  </P> <P> Interviews with leading players in the "power game" drove home once again the  expertise of the Reagan entourage in favorably shaping the President's image.  But the account also distorted our understanding of how political power is  constructed.  </P> <P> A more balanced analysis of Reagan's success would note that the public  credited him with overcoming the inflation that had plagued President Jimmy  Carter and with producing an expanding economy. Furthermore, without this  foundation of public support, constructed largely out of economic conditions,  the clever working of the media upon which Smith dwelled would have come to  naught. Smith is quite aware of this. But why confuse viewers with the dry  economics after the lively interviews with power brokers?  </P> <P> Nor did Smith pause in his contrast of Carter and Reagan to point out that  Carter's reliance on facts in his speeches failed for the same reason Reagan's  image-building succeeded: The public would rather be entertained than  confronted with unengaging facts.  </P> <P> The irony is that Smith stands guilty of the same superficiality in his drive  to please viewers that he finds objectionable in Reagan's methods of pleasing  voters. But perhaps the more important lesson of this disappointing public  television episode is that even our best political analysts often fail to tell  the public of its responsibilities in driving the power game because the public  does not wish to listen to this.  </P> <P> DONALD C.

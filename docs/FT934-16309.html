			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Patten hails opt-out schools MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, forecast that well over half the secondary schools in England and Wales would have attained grant maintained status by the next general election. It would prove to be 'an irreversible change,' he told the conference. Mr Patten announced that from the start of 1994 votes by governing bodies to determine whether schools should become grant maintained - and escape control of local education authorities - would be conducted by secret ballot. To applause, he said this would would 'clip the wings' of leftwing elements. Mr Patten said there were over 1,000 grant maintained schools providing the quality of education that had been a feature of the old grammar and direct grant schools. So far, 983 English schools - and about 1,007 in the UK as a whole - have voted to opt out. There are more than 30,000 state schools in the UK, of which 4,700 are secondary schools. Laughter mingled with applause when Mr Patten contrasted the action of Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NAS/UWT, in sending his son to a grant maintained school while leading his union's opposition to their creation. But Mr de Gruchy fiercely rebutted Mr Patten's speech. He said later: 'Accusations that I support grant-maintained schools are absurd. When my son's school contemplated grant-maintained status, I attended the parents' consultative meeting and spoke strongly against it. I voted against it in the secret parental ballot. Personal attacks based upon misrepresentation of the truth are no substitute for a convincing educational policy.' Mr Patten apologised yesterday for calling the chief education officer at Birmingham City Council a 'nutter' and a 'madman'. Mr Patten had told a fringe meeting that Professor Tim Brighouse, who took up his post in Birmingham last month, was a liability. Prof Brighouse said yesterday he was considering what action to take. Mr Patten said his comments were 'satirical' but he apologised if they had caused offence.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Markets: Foreigners return in force - London Buy in July and hope they stay high was the equity motto of the week, emboldening a nervous market and turning an old aphorism on its head. Encouraged by rallying European bond markets, investors, particularly foreigners, returned in force to London equities for the first time since February. The FT-SE 100 index gained 112.4 points, or 3.8 per cent, on the week to close at 3,074.8. Playing by the old rule of sell in May and stay away cautious investors had captured a good chunk of each year's gains over the past decade except last year. Last year the market rose 23 per cent from its July trough to its December peak. This year, anyone rash enough to sell in May would be in just as much trouble. They would have crystallised a loss of 18 per cent since the market peaked in February if their portfolios tracked the FT-SE 100 index. They would also be missing out on the recovery that appears to be underway. The trigger was a switch by global investors out of dollar bonds into European bonds. They were seeking some haven from the dollar which continued to fall after the Group of Seven summit last weekend failed to offer it support. Gilts had a particularly good rally. They rose six days in a row up to Thursday's close, their longest continuous improvement since their rout had begun in February. The run stalled yesterday, however, when the Bank of England announced it would sell long-dated gilts at its next auction. This would appear to signal that the authorities believe yields will fall no further, having reached a level appropriate to economic conditions. In spite of yesterday's hiccup, optimism is running high in bond markets. 'False dawns have been seen regularly but this rally has a more positive feel,' says the bond team at NatWest Capital Markets. 'Although still regarded with suspicion, the much vaunted decoupling between US and European markets has been seen.' The optimism was reinforced by this week's UK economic data. June's headline annual inflation rate was unchanged at 2.6 per cent and, minus mortgages, it slipped to 2.4 per cent from 2.5 per cent in May. Unemployment fell in June for the fifth consecutive month and manufacturing employment rose for the seventh time in 12 months. Construction orders in May hit a four-year high. Spurred by the gilts rally and the economic outlook, equities enjoyed four strong sessions through the week with the Footsie index gaining more than 40 points two days in a row. The keenest buying appeared to come, however, from foreign rather than domestic investors. One London brokerage house said an unusually high proportion of its commissions this week had come from the Continent. British institutions could still be cautious for several reasons: they have remained well invested in equities through the first-half slide; they are still feeling nervous about financial markets after suffering hefty bond losses; index-linked gilts are still offering a high return relative to dividend yields. These investors are unlikely to return with conviction to equities until this key relationship tilts in equities' favour and markets show some durable stability. Continental investors have a different perspective, however, argues Ian Harnett, chief economist and strategist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. Valuations of the UK market look attractive relative to their home markets. The prospective price/earnings multiple for the UK market is, for example, the lowest of any major market; the yield relative between gilts and equities is well below its five-year average, unlike in the US or other European markets; the outlook for UK growth and inflation is positive; sterling's recent fall against the DM and rise against the dollar will increase the competitiveness of UK exports while helping to keep down imported inflation. German investors, in particular, appear to have been big buyers this past week. All the positive factors about UK equities are true for them, with the currency factor playing a big role. Many had exited from UK equities in February when the market and DM/sterling exchange rate peaked. They had liquidated their UK portfolios when the pound was close to DM2.60. Now the pound is down to DM2.40, the Footise index looks as attractive to them as it would to UK institutions at 2,700, Harnett argues. A keenly-priced cross-border deal was also one of the main stories of the week on the corporate scene. Tesco made an agreed Pounds 200m bid for William Low, the Scottish supermarket chain. The purchase would boost the English chain's share of the Scottish market from 7.1 per cent and fourth place to 13.7 per cent and second place. J Sainsbury, the leading UK chain, could spoil the deal with a counter-bid but such a move would be uncharacteristic. Low became vulnerable to a takeover after discount chains began to expose the high overhead it was trying to carry on a narrow geographic base. While the Tesco bid was driven by commercial logic, it could also indicate that the stock market is again offering attractive enough values for a resumption of bids. While the stock market rallied strongly from last July to this February, many acquisitive companies complained valuations were too rich to make takeovers practical. One conglomerateur who could boast of success this week was Greg Hutchings, head of Tomkins. His October 1992 purchase of Rank Hovis McDougall, the baker and foods group, was much criticised by the market but in the year to April results reported this week, RHM contributed at least four percentage points to the 14 per cent rise in earnings per share. The only thing Hutchings laments is that investors are still reluctant to buy Tomkins shares in the hopes they will stay high.</p>

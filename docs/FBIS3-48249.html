			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa by </F> MAINICHI SHIMBUN chief editorial writer Mikio Shimizu; place and  date not given]    [Text] [Shimizu] On the 40th anniversary of the end of  World War II, if you remember, you said Japan had succeeded in  attaining the peace, freedom, and improvement in living  standards it had sought. Later, however, the myth of Japan's  economic growth collapsed, and politics came to a dead end.  Will you give your assessment now that nearly 50 years have  elapsed?    [Miyazawa] Any explanation by me of the last 10 years must  include, I think, mention of the end of the Cold War and the  demise of Marxism-Leninism. In the realm of foreign affairs, we  had hoped that a new peace would emerge following the collapse  of the system under which world balance was sustained by the  mutual nuclear deterrence of the United States and the Soviet  Union. In the short term, however, conflicts have broken out.  The United Nations should be in charge of maintaining peace,  but it has become apparent it can not do this. And nothing has  yet replaced the mutual deterrence.    Meanwhile, there is emerging the perception that as Japan  has  grown into an economic power, it no longer needs to hide behind  the United States. I should say these are the major changes  that have occurred in the realm of foreign affairs.    Their impact on domestic politics is said to have brought  the  collapse of the regime that ruled from 1955, though I do not  agree with that view. I do not see any reason why the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] should have lost power just because the  1955 system disintegrated. I think the collapse of the LDP  government was caused by the scandals.    [Shimizu] The rise of nationalism is conspicuous. Will you  comment on that?    [Miyazawa] It may mean that as the Cold War has ended, the  habit of thinking within the global framework of the United  States and the Soviet Union has disappeared. As a result,  people are becoming nationalism-conscious. I do not think it is  unhealthy. But what we must not repeat our mistakes.  Nationalism is becoming evident in discussions on the question  of amending the constitution, for instance. As a result of the  soul-searching done in the almost 50 years since the end of the  war, people may have started to feel it is not desirable for an  independent country to depend for ever on the Japan-U.S.  security alliance. I do not think this is a frivolous idea, but  I would like to stress that we should not repeat the mistakes of  the past. A country which has inflicted pain may forget, but  for the countries that suffered the pain, 50 years is not long  enough to forget.    [Shimizu] You mean we should revise our current policy of  emphasizing the economy, but not forget about the mistakes  committed in the past.    [Miyazawa] Now that nuclear arms no longer have a place and  the Cold War structure has gone, I think the Japanese can be  proud that the path they have taken so far has brought them  freedom and prosperity. The Japanese can walk their path with  pride. Events are moving in a favorable direction for them.  <H5>  `Decline' of the SDPJ Regrettable </H5>   [Shimizu] Fifteen years ago, you remarked, "I think the  people want the government to change hands. The reason why  there has been no change in power is because people are not sure  what the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] [SDPJ], the most  likely opposition party to take power, will do."    [Miyazawa] I have devoted all my time as a politician to the  cause of defeating Marxism-Leninism. It has become clear who  has won. The SDPJ will fall unless they can come up with some  really good ideas. In a way, though, I think it would be  regrettable if the SDPJ was no longer a political force.    People may tell me that in politics there should be no  complaints as long as everyone gets the same chance, but that is  not the case in countries which are fairly economically  advanced. I think there should be social justice to help the  people who tend to lag behind in competition, to enable everyone  to walk together. It is desirable that we have some people who  keep questioning whether free competition is the only thing that  matters. Given that, I seriously wonder whether the decline of  the SDPJ is really a good thing.  <H5>  Multiparties Unavoidable </H5>   [Shimizu] Do you see any need for the political pattern of  Japan to change?    [Miyazawa] The needs of the people have become very  diversified. It has become just about impossible for any one  party to represent 80 percent or so of the public. In advanced  countries, you expect that in a multiparty system no party will  get more than 30 to 40 percent backing from the people.    [Shimizu] In looking back at the government over the almost  50 years since the end of the war, we cannot ignore the  influence of the bureaucrats. You have experience of having  served as both government official and politician. How do you  view the bureaucratic system?    [Miyazawa] I may be a little screwy, but I think the  Japanese bureaucrats do a very good job. Politicians,  bureaucrats and businessmen each played their part to enable  Japan to catch up with and outrun Europe and the United States.  Such a division of labor is likely to generate collusion among  them, but did make it possible for Japan to catch up. However,  the moment the country did catch up, that division of labor lost  its purpose, and the problems with collusion then started to  surface.    The bureaucratic system means bureaucrats doing thed same  things they have done in previous years. It does not set its  own direction. Problems therefore arise if the government fails  to show targets to the bureaucrats. If that happens, the  division of labor system does not work too well. Some people  have complained about bureaucrats, and insist, for instance, the  government should have parliamentary vice ministers answer at  Diet deliberations. All this makes me laugh. But such views  are not so bad if we take them as revealing the belief that  politicians should lead bureaucrats.    [Shimizu] It is said the bureaucrats now wield even more  power since the coalition government came to power.    [Miyazawa] The coalition government was formed by parties  wanting to enact political reform. On other matters there has  never been any policy agreement among them. In such  circumstances, the bureaucrats are bound to lead the government.    [Shimizu] How do you view the Hosokawa coalition government?  I think nothing happens unless Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa orders it.    [Miyazawa] Mr. Hosokawa has a fine personality, but he came  to power without being prepared for it. There are many people  around him, but they are not professionals either. I feel sorry  about it. Mr. Ozawa is a very capable man, but it is difficult  to head the administration from behind the scenes. It is a very  complicated job. He has unique sense of values and is  far-sighted too. But old people like me are very aware that we  should not repeat the mistakes of the past, such as amending the  Constitution, for instance.</p>

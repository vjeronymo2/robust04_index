			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW CONSENSUS SURVIVES A TEST  </P> <P> The static on the left should not obscure the fact that Panama represents the  best evidence yet that, 15 years after the Vietnam War ended, Americans really  have come together in recognition of the circumstances in which military  intervention makes sense. The elements of agreement have been in place for some  time.  </P> <P> President Bush's contribution is to demonstrate that the new national consensus  will survive when tested.  </P> <P> The people whom I've been interviewing are also clear that the circumstances  that justified intervention in Panama are not going to be present in many other  places. They are writing no blank checks.  </P> <P> Still, we have, in fact, achieved a good deal of clarity in the nation on this  question, which divided us so badly during and after the Vietnam War. That's an  important achievement, and one which should not be obscured by a few dissident  voices on the left.  </P></p>

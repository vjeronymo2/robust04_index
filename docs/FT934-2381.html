			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Radio Clyde advances to Pounds 3m Radio Clyde, the USM-quoted broadcaster, turned in a near-threefold increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 3.03m for the year to end-September. The improvement was achieved on turnover up 12 per cent to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 13m), and included exceptional credits amounting to Pounds 618,000 - against Pounds 738,000 costs last time. Comparisons were restated in accordance with FRS 3. The bulk of the exceptional credit arose from the disposal of about 50 per cent of the company's 28.6 per cent investment in Satellite Media Services. An increased final dividend of 6p is proposed, for a total of 9.5p (8.5p). The distribution comes from earnings per share of 24.7p against 5p - restated under FRS 3 from 13.2p. The company intends to change its name to Scottish Radio Holdings.</p>

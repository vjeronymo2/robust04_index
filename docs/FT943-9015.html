			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets: Players gratefully take their eyes off the ball - Wall Street It usually helps if Wall Street has something other than the price of stocks and bonds to think about during the slumbers that typically afflict US financial markets at this time of the year, and that something this week has been the baseball players' strike. While the mid-season disruption of America's national pastime may not be a particularly happy subject, it has at least provided respite, for traders and investors, from the numbing dissections of economic statistics and the endless speculation about Federal Reserve monetary policy that normally passes for intelligent discussion around the trading floors and executive offices of lower Manhattan. At least with the baseball strike, there are some certainties everyone can rely upon: namely, the rich and greedy owners are fighting with the rich and greedy players over money (in this case, how to divide the Dollars 2bn annual revenues the games generate). This sort of thing has been going on throughout the history of baseball. This strike, which started yesterday, is the sport's eighth work stoppage in just over 20 years. Moreover, while the rest of America struggles to feel sympathy with the two sides in the dispute, there are plenty of people on Wall Street who can find common cause with baseball's players and owners. For example, the players, who earn millions of dollars a year and feel that nothing should interfere with the free market process that determines the price placed on their talents, are not far removed from Wall Street's best dealers and investment bankers. Their annual salaries are also measured in seven figures, and they would never dream of accepting any restrictions on who they work for, and for how much. Similarly, the complaints by club owners that the business of baseball is in trouble because costs are rising too fast relative to revenues will find an echo throughout the US business community. The owners insistence that their survival depends upon their employees - the players - accepting restrictions on pay levels would make sense to any industry chieftain. For years, US corporations have been cutting and restructuring their workforces, or imposing wage cuts or freezes, in an attempt to rein in costs during business downturns. This is exactly what is happening on Wall Street. While much of the rest of corporate America is prospering, the securities broking and investment banking industry is enduring its most difficult period since 1990. After three years of record profits, the earnings of Wall Street firms have shrunk amid falling revenues from securities underwriting, broking and trading. As a result, Wall Street firms have been taking action to bring costs back into line with revenues. In the last few weeks, Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber, Smith Barney Shearson and Prudential Securities - four of the biggest securities houses in the US - have cut their payrolls, most noticeably in bonds, which has suffered more than any other area from the deterioration in market conditions. More job cuts are likely, because there are few signs of an improvement in the business environment. If anything, matters may get worse because the upward trend in domestic interest rates, the root of Wall Street's problems, has probably not yet peaked. Just this week, statistics on July retail sales and inflation provided little evidence to suggest that the economy has been slowing down. If anything, economists believe the recent data has only made it more likely that the Fed will put up interest rates again soon, possibly as early as next week, when the central bank's open market committee meets. Although another interest rate rise has been partially discounted by Wall Street, it can only reinforce the bearish mood among stock market dealers and investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has fallen from just under 4,000 to its current level of about 3,750 since the Fed started raising interest rates in February, may have quite a bit further to go before the cycle of rising rates is complete. Perhaps the market faces a repeat of the Dow's performance during the last prolonged baseball strike, in 1981. In that year, the Dow stood at 1,006 on the first day of the strike. Fifty days later, when the dispute was settled, the average had dropped more than 6 per cent to 942. From then on it was all downhill. By the time the interrupted baseball season was over, barely seven weeks later, the Dow had plunged another 12.5 per cent to 824. If today's market repeats the performance of the last baseball-strike year, the Dow will be down at 3,100 by the end of October, and there will be more unemployed investment bankers and traders on the street.  ----------------------------------- Monday      3753.81  +   6.79 Tuesday     3755.76  +   1.95 Wednesday   3766.76  +  11.00 Thursday    3750.90  -  15.86 Friday      3768.71  +  17.81  -----------------------------------</p>

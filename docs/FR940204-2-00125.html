			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those orders that have been executed in the cross will be immediately transmitted by MMX to the Exchange for recordation and reporting to the Consolidated Tape. Trades will then be cleared by the designated clearing firm. After receiving an execution report (described below), institutions will then be able to reallocate trades to different clearing brokers, if desired. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Immediately after the cross, users will be notified if their orders have been executed. If an order was not executed, the user may receive an administrative message (depending on the ``near match'' parameters they have specified) asking whether the user wants a broker to call it to negotiate a trade with another user that has entered similar ``near match'' parameters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Unique Aspects of the MMX Facility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The most fundamental feature of the MMX facility is the use of liquidity fees and liquidity credits to determine the level of priority for order matching. Rather than matching orders on the basis of time priority, the MMX facility provides incentives to those users that provide liquidity to the system. The size of the liquidity fee or credit determines the level of priority for order matching, with those users that are willing to pay the highest liquidity fee having the highest execution priority (except for orders that are part of the CHX quote) and those users desiring to be paid for providing liquidity ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  orders with a liquidity credit) having the lowest execution priority. Liquidity fees and credits will only be paid when an order with a liquidity fee is matched with an order with a liquidity credit. When that happens, a liquidity fee that is equal to the size of the liquidity credit will be paid. In all other cases, no liquidity fees will be paid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to provide executions that are equitable, immediately prior to the match, all orders for a security are first sorted into groups and then each group is prioritized for execution. Except for orders that are part of CHX's quote, which will be placed in one group and will receive the highest priority for execution, a group will consist of either all buy orders or all sell orders in a security that have the same liquidity fee or credit. Groups will be prioritized by liquidity fee or credit (as stated earlier). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Groups will only be matched if the liquidity credit required by orders in one group is less than or equal to the liquidity fee offered by orders in the other group. Groups will be matched starting with the group of buy orders with the highest priority. This group will be matched with the group of sell orders with the highest priority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the aggregate size of all orders in both groups is the same, all orders in both groups will be matched. If the aggregate size of all orders in both groups is not the same, orders in the group with the smaller aggregate size will be allocated among orders in the group with the larger size on a pro-rata basis. If this results in any order receiving an odd lot or a mixed lot ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  265 shares), the amount of shares that order receives shall be rounded down to the nearest round lot ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 200 shares). All the odd lots for a particular Group ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the 65 shares) shall be aggregated and then allocated to the largest order in the Group. If, after matching orders in a buy group with orders in a sell group, unmatched orders remain in the group of buy orders, MMX will continue the process of matching this group with successively lower priority groups of sell orders until all of the orders in the group of buy orders are either matched or are unable to be matched. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After completion of the match described above, MMX will continue the process of matching groups and orders within those groups in accordance with the rules described above starting with successively lower priority buy order groups until no more matches can be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once all of the matches are made, MMX will determine whether any matched orders are conditional orders and if so, whether their conditions are fully satisfied. In the event that certain conditions are not fully satisfied, MMX will remove that order (and any other orders whose conditions are not fully satisfied). MMX will then erase the match for all orders in that security and will restart the matching process excluding all conditional orders whose conditions were not fully satisfied in the last matching process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This matching process and liquidity fee/credit payment scheme results in the liquidity fee being paid only when necessary, providing meaningful advantages to those willing to pay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

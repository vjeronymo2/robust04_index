			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INCREASED OCTC OF $11.1 MILLION OKD; IT'S UP 50%  </P> <P> Efforts to speed road and commuter-rail improvements in Orange County will cost  taxpayers more during 1989-90, but county transportation planners decided  Monday that such projects are worth the money.  </P> <P> The Orange County Transportation Commission adopted an $11.1-million budget  Monday for 1989-90, up $3.7 million or 50% over spending in the current fiscal  year ending June 30. Most of the increase is for professional services and  consultants who are preparing environmental assessment reports on widening  projects for the Santa Ana and Riverside freeways, as well as development of a  countywide rail passenger service plan.  </P> <P> The budget discussion revealed that officials are worried about the failure of  any agency to plan for the expected addition of 50,000 cars per day on the  northbound San Diego Freeway in Costa Mesa once the San Joaquin Hills tollway  is built. The tollway, scheduled for completion in the early 1990s, will be an  extension of the Corona del Mar Freeway and run between San Juan Capistrano and  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The existing transition road from the northbound Corona del Mar Freeway to the  northbound San Diego Freeway is only one lane. The commission added $200,000 to  its new budget Monday for environmental studies of plans to correct the  situation.  </P> <P> Commission member Dana W. Reed said that construction estimates range from $6  million to $56 million to "fix" the interchange but that no agency now has the  money for such a project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Developer Fee Increase?  </P> <P> Asked if tollway officials should earmark funds for the interchange, Reed said:  "They have been discussing raising developer fees (for the tollway), so they  should take a look at that possibility."  </P></p>

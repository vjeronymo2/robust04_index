			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory manifesto measures steal the show - The Issues: Arts IN HIS campaign for the US presidency Pat Buchanan has spent lavishly on advertisments condemning President George Bush's 'permissive' attitude towards the arts and promising to ensure that the National Endowment for the Arts, the US equivalent of the Arts Council, was 'shut down, padlocked and fumigated'. No such outbursts are likely to enliven the British election campaign. It is generally agreed that there are few votes in the arts. The party taking the arts most seriously is, surprisingly, the Conservatives, which features the arts prominently in its manifesto and proposes quite dramatic changes. Labour, traditionally the more vociferous champion of the arts, has few radical proposals. In recent years the Conservatives have stolen much of Labour's programme, awarding increases in annual subsidies ahead of inflation and trimming the Arts Council while encouraging devolution of decisions over specific funding projects to regional arts boards. It now proposes a cabinet place for a minister covering the arts, broadcasting, heritage, tourism and sport. The ministry will enjoy around Pounds 200m of the revenues from a national lottery. This money would be devoted mainly to capital costs - shoring up cathedrals, theatres and museums and projects like building a national dance house, to mark the millennium. The Tories also plan to trim the arts bureaucracy. The role of the Arts Council will be re-examined. It might be left to act as a think-tank for the arts. Given recent reductions in its funding powers its future cannot be guaranteed; it might be allowed to maintain the hallowed 'arm's-length' funding principle by which it sets the grants for the big national companies such as the Royal Opera House and National Theatre or these companies could be subsidised directly by the government. Against this barrage of proposed change Labour's plans look, well, conservative. It has little new to say about the Arts Council, which it also sees mainly as a propaganda body for the arts. It is hesitating over a lottery, saying it does not want to undermine the football pools companies; and it is stepping gingerly over its old plan to merge ministerial responsibility for broadcasting with that for the arts. Labour hopes to increase expenditure on the arts by raising more tax revenue from commercial interests that exploit the arts, like the record and video industries, and by forcing local authorities to spend a set percentage of their revenue on arts projects. The Liberal Democrats plump for continuity and change, maintaining the Arts Council, in deference to the arm's-length principle, and guaranteeing BBC licence-fee funding but also wanting cabinet status for the arts minister and higher national spending. The manifestos are more interesting for what they leave out. On the heritage side, no party has a sensible answer to the increasing loss of important art treasures abroad because of weak export controls and inadequate museum funding. The only obvious source of new money for the arts is the lottery, but already there are too many supplicants for its theoretical bounty, too many fears that if it does happen direct government funding will be reduced in line. Like much else, the future for the arts depends less on political promises than on an economic recovery.</p>

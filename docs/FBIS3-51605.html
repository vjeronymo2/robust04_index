			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Senate, with the sole abstention of the Party of  the Democratic Revolution, PRD, approved on 21 January an  amnesty law for armed transgressors operating in Chiapas State:    [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The Mexican Chamber  of Deputies and Chamber of Senators made an important  contribution to peace in Chiapas by approving on 21 January an  amnesty bill submitted by the federal chief executive.    The Chamber of Deputies modified the original text of the  amnesty bill. Preserving its spirit and main objective, the  deputies made important contributions to peace in Chiapas by  turning the amnesty bill into a broad and flexible legislation  to pave the way for peace.    The core of the approved law offers amnesty to all those who  committed crimes in relation to the violent acts in Chiapas  between 1 and 20 January at 1500. The bill was made more  flexible to grant amnesty to those who participated in preparing  violent incidents during December 1993.    The most important change made to the approved amnesty bill  was the authorization granted to the federal chief executive to  establish a commission tasked with coordinating the  implementation of this law. This is very important, because  this commission will be authorized to establish deadlines for  the surrender of weapons, explosives, and hostages should  amnesty be accepted.    The commission for the implementation of amnesty will  determine when and in which cases the enforcement of criminal  proceedings and the punishment imposed will no longer be  enforced [extinguirse las acciones penales y las sanciones  impuestas] regarding the crimes in question. All of this is  contingent, however, to the commission declaring the definitive  end of hostilities.    Another example of flexibility is that the deputies  eliminated from the amnesty bill a deadline for the surrender of  weapons. Article Two originally stated that the deadline to  surrender weapons for those who would like to take advantage of  amnesty should be within 30 days, beginning on the date of  publication of this law.    The elimination of this deadline ensures that peace  negotiations will be surrounded by a pressure-free atmosphere  and that the amnesty law will be applied at the right time. We  must point out that the only party that did not vote for the  amnesty law was the PRD, which abstained.    During a news conference Deputy Ricardo Valero, coordinator  of the PRD parliamentarian bloc, said his party abstained  because it disagrees with the terms under which the amnesty bill  was approved although the party favors it.    Congress will play a very important role in the search for  peace in Chiapas State. Besides the already approved amnesty  law, there are plans to hold special sessions beginning the  first half of February to modify several constitutional articles  to wage a strong fight against poverty among Chiapas residents.    The holding of extraordinary congressional sessions is  contingent upon the six political parties represented at  Congress drafting a working agenda and identification of which  laws and constitutional articles should be modified. There is  already consensus on the need to go to the root of the problem.    For example, PAN [National Action Party] has basically  called  for the modification of the laws on revenues and on the budget  of the federation for 1994 to ensure a just and real  redistribution in the poorest regions of the country. The PRD  demands the reform of constitutional Articles Four, 53, 73, and  115. All political parties agree on the modification of Article  115 of the Constitution to ensure the governments of ethnic  groups, which have regimes based on habits and customs  [regimenes de usos y costumbres], are recognized within the  realm of constitutional town councils.    The approval of the amnesty law is the first major legal  step  toward attaining peace in Chiapas. [end recording]</p>

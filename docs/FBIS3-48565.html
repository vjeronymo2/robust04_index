The survey also showed that agricultural cooperatives in 15  prefectures have refused to cooperate in the government's rice  production adjustment program.    Farmers in these prefectures were strongly upset with the  government's decision to partially open the rice market to  imports.    The Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu)  adopted a resolution last December not to cooperate with the  government in producing rice for processing.    Zenchu officials said the union plans to urge the government  to review its farming policy, featuring conversion of rice  acreage for production of other farm produce.    Farmers are reluctant to produce rice to be used for  processing because of low prices as compared with rice for table  use.    Despite their strong reaction to the government's  agricultural policy, many agricultural cooperatives acknowledged  the need for production adjustment because of government  subsidies.</p>

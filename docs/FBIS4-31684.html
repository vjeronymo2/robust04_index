			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Andi Bejtja: "What Did the Albanian Socialists </F> Discuss with the Serbian Representatives in Sofia?"]    [Text] "Secret" meetings to solve the Kosova question are  coming into fashion on both sides of the border, and there is in  the meantime every possibility that official Albanian-Serbian  meetings will also become fashionable. As was reported last  week, it was the Serbian side that announced a new proposal for  a possible Albanian-Serbian dialogue at the foreign minister  level. Meanwhile, the media reported a short time ago a secret  meeting between Albanian representatives of Kosova and Serbian  representatives in the Swiss Embassy in Belgrade. The  participants in the meeting in a way denied this report, leaving  the Albanian mass media to fight it out with the Serbian mass  media.    The center of fashion has this time shifted from Prishtina  to  Tirana. The Democratic Party [PD] newspaper reports a secret  meeting between the Albanian Socialists and representatives of  Milosevic in Sofia, during an academic seminar on the topic of  peace in the Balkans. RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE cites the Belgrade  papers POLITIKA and NOVOSTI on this, specifically a statement  issued by Keslanin, one of the main leaders of the Serbian  Socialist Party. He is quoted as having said, "We reached an  understanding with the Albanian Socialists, who are undergoing  the consequences of the ruling party's right-wing revanchism  dictated from abroad (they have their chairman in prison as the  result of a show trial), and in spite of this won the local  elections in 54 percent of the communes. This understanding is  to continue dialogue and to cooperate in the interests of our  two neighboring peoples and of general stability in the  Balkans."    But what did the Albanian Socialists discuss with the  Serbian  representatives in Sofia? This question arouses a lot of  curiosity even among the ordinary membership of the Socialist  Party [PS], while the PS leaders are quite calm and ready to  give an answer. Two of the PS leaders, Deputy Chairman Luan  Hajdaraga and Bashkim Zeneli, head of foreign relations, are two  of the Socialist personalities who have held many meetings with  foreign diplomatic representatives in Tirana and who appear to  be entrusted with the PS's foreign policy. They did not  hesitate to talk to KOHA JONE about the aforementioned meeting.    "A PS delegation took part in an academic conference about  the problem of peace in the Balkans. At this conference, there  were also representatives from 13 other countries, with whom  views were exchanged over the situation in the Balkans and the  possibility of avoiding a conflict. In this context, our  delegation presented our well-known standpoints. As far as we  know, these standpoints were reported to the Serbian delegation.  This seems to us utterly normal, especially at an academic  conference," the Socialist leaders concluded, trying to  demonstrate moderation in connection with questions put to them  over the Kosova issue. Bashkim Zeneli recalled his article of  one year ago, which mentioned the first and last Nano-Rugova  meeting in Villa Number Two in Tirana, at which, according to  Zeneli, the PS chairman made it clear to Rugova that dialogue is  the only means for solving the issue. Likewise according to  Zeneli, Rugova agreed with Nano's views.    It is also Zeneli and Hajdaraga who a short time ago held a  meeting with representatives of the Yugoslav Embassy in Tirana,  at which the problem of Kosova was particularly discussed.    However, what does the PS think about solving the issue of  Kosova?    Deputy Chairman Hajdaraga replies:    [Bejtja] Mr. Hajdaraga, at a news conference, you called the  PD's policy in connection with the Kosova question a failure.  Could you be more specific about this conclusion that your  party has drawn?    [Hajdaraga] If we look back at the PD's attitudes to the  national question, there is in general terms a coherence.  Tactically, there have been vacillations and coherence has been  lacking. Of course, there are differences between strategy and  tactics that arise from circumstances and external factors.  However, the truth is that the ultimate logic of the tactical  plan of action has often not been clear.    Specifically, if one talks about the national cause, one  talks about unification. This is a long-term platform that will  be realized on the basis of a program to which all political  forces, large and small and within or outside Albania, will  commit themselves. This final goal will be achieved on the  basis of a phased and well-studied policy. Unfortunately, we  lack a national political platform of this kind. The PS long  ago asked for this. The steps that have been taken have been  publicized as tactical steps for solving the question of Kosova.  It is still not clear what will be demanded. I say this  bearing in mind reality, and having visited the field.  According to the PS, a formula for a solution will be  determined by the will of the people of Kosova and by  international conventions, and the solution of the problem will  necessarily proceed along the road of dialogue.    I wish to underline that the national question cannot be  subdivided among political parties or personalities. Especially  today, when it seems that a solution is knocking at the door,  consultation among all the political forces, large and small, is  more than urgent. I even consider a political consensus over  this issue to be overdue. A roundtable of Albanian political  forces in Kosova and Albania must be proposed as soon as  possible, including the two Albanian presidents Rugova and  Berisha.    In this context, I wish to see that Berisha has recently  taken a sensible line. In today's Europe, large and especially  conflict-ridden problems are only solved by dialogue, with  efforts to respect at the same time national interests and  international conventions. We cannot let our national problems  be solved outside this spirit and this reality. I can say  firmly that our stands on the Kosova issue have been and will be  in this spirit.    [Bejtja] What are your objections to Rugova's policies?    [Hajdaraga] On one hand, I am glad that Rugova is coming  down to earth in a new reality. However, on the other hand we  think that Rugova, in any talks or negotiations, must  necessarily bear in mind the views of other Albanian political  forces on both sides of the border, and not reduce his  activities in this sphere to meetings with the PD and President  Berisha. The national problem is not a question of one or two  persons. Even though Rugova has not heeded us, although we are  the largest opposition party, we are sincerely open to dialogue  with him. We ask for Rugova at the table. This would be to the  good of the national cause, today and tomorrow.</p>

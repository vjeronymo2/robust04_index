			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: P&amp;O firm Rumours of a profits upgrade in transport and property group P&amp;O sent the shares 14 ahead to 704p in trading volume of 4.7m. The talk suggested that a leading broker was about to raise its full-year profits estimate to match BZW's top of the range Pounds 375m prediction. However, none of the names cited as possible candidates for the upgrade would confirm such a move. Sentiment in the stock was further lifted by reports of a Smith New Court recommendation, and a favourable outlook for container shipping from P&amp;O's Dutch rival Nedlloyd. The group reported disappointing interims but mentioned stable rates and growing volumes on its north Atlantic and Far East routes on which it competes with P&amp;O.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Ownership of videos up despite recession VIDEO recorders were the fastest-growing category of consumer durables last year, and their ownership continued to rise in spite of the deepening recession. Ownership of video recorders increased from 61 per cent to 64.6 per cent of households over the previous year. That compares with 36 per cent five years ago. More than four out of five families with children now own a video recorder. In contrast, the expected boom in home computers has failed to materialise. Only 18 per cent of homes had one compared with 17 per cent the previous year and 15 per cent in 1986. The high proportion of homes with consumer durables such as refrigerators, washing machines and telephones - and the impact of the recession - made the further increase in ownership surprising. Households owning refrigerators or fridge/freezers, the most popular of all consumer durables, rose from 98.1 to 98.2 per cent. Washing machines have become universally popular, with average ownership around 87 per cent, although Greater London was the exception, with only 77 per cent of homes having one. The only year-on-year fall in ownership was for television sets, which slipped from 98.1 per cent to 97.9 per cent of households. In general, the lower a household's income the greater the percentage spent on housing and fuel and the less on leisure goods and motoring. In the higher income groups, motoring and fares accounted for more than 15 per cent of total expenditure, but in the poorest groups their share was below 5 per cent.

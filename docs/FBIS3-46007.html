At this meeting, Provincial Deputy Party Secretary and  Governor Xiao Yang stressed that the success of the Three Gorges  project will depend on whether the 1 million residents in the  reservoir area can be transferred out. Sichuan firmly supports  the Three Gorges project and therefore must make this transfer  successful.    Xiao Yang pointed out: We must properly relocate these  residents so that they will work and live in contentment. In  this respect, we must resolutely implement the policy of  exploitative transfer so that the transfer of the residents will  merge with economic and social development.    Vice Governor Gan Yuping systematically explained the basic  situation in eastern Sichuan, its conditions for reclamation,  and the policy for joint development.    The meeting listened to the opinions proposed by the  committee on joint economic development in the Three Gorges  area. Sun Tongchuan, member of the provincial party committee's  Standing Committee and secretary of the Chongqing City CPC  Committee, attended the meeting and made a speech. Mayors and  commissioners from eight cities and prefectures in eastern  Sichuan, including Chongqing City, Wanxian City, Nantong City,  and Fuling Prefecture also attended the meeting.</p>

Chernyshev, who was in Ankara for six and a half years as  ambassador, hosted a farewell reception before his departure to  his country, where he was appointed as deputy foreign minister.    After a one-hour meeting with President Suleyman Demirel,  Chernyshev told journalists that he and Demirel exchanged views  on almost every subject.    "Strong friendly relations are necessary in the region to  overcome problems," he said.    Chernyshev, who expressed his emotions of leaving Turkey, as  "my heart will stay here," will be responsible of an area  covering the Black Sea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Turkey,  Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and the Maldives.    He said that no other country was welcoming either Turkey  and  Russia to sell their goods and "here is our great market, we  have this opportunity and we should work in this direction."    "We are obliged to cooperate. Peace and stability should  exist here," he concluded.</p>

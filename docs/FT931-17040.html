			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Plans for a garden sale WE BOUGHT the house in which we live, with a garden, six years ago. This year we received planning permission for a house on the rear part of the garden. 1) Can we avoid capital gains if we sell the land with planning permission before we sell our house, using that land as part of the garden right up to its sale? 2) The land with planning permission is separately registered. It was added to the original garden nearly 50 years ago (we bought the house and the whole garden as a single transaction). We are about to remortgage our property if we exclude that land from the mortgage, could this affect the capital gains position? 1) Yes, in principle, provided that the tax inspector is (or the Appeal Commissioners are) satisfied that you did not buy the house 'partly for the purpose of realising a gain from the disposal of it' and that no expenditure after the purchase was 'incurred wholly or partly for the purpose of realising a gain from the disposal'. The words in quotation marks are from section 224(3) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT4 (owner-occupied houses). 2) No (subject to the same proviso). The solicitors who act for you in the remortgage - and the prospective sale  -will be able to guide you through the CGT pitfalls etcetera, of course. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

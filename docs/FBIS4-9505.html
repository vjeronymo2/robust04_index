			<p>BFN     [Text] The number of Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  supporters increased by 4 percent in April; therefore, some 24  percent of the population that is eligible to vote support the  Socialists. The voters of the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] increased by 2 percent, which is not statistically  significant, but it means that they have caught up with the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. In the case of the  other parties, the changes are even smaller. Support for Fidesz  and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] has not  changed (9 and 5 percent), while support for the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Independent Smallholders Party  [FKGP] increased by 1 percent (to 7 and 6 percent). Based on  public opinion polls of recent months, it can be said that the  leading group of parties has become stabilized. The six parties  that gained seats in parliament in 1990 also have the biggest  chance to do so in 1994. The support level for the non-  parliamentary parties is around 1 or 2 percent -- such as, the  Workers' Party, the Agrarian Federation, the Entrepreneurs'  Party, the Repbulic Party, the Hungarian Justice and Life Party  [MIEP], and the United Smallholders Party [EKGP] -- or does not  even reach this minimum -- for example, the National Democratic  Federation [NDSZ] and the Social Democratic Party of Hungary  [MSZDP]. More people became certain about their preferences as  the parliamentary candidates became known, party lists were  published, and the campaign became more intensive. While in the  second half of March, 40 percent of the citizens could not or  did not want to vote; this went down to 34 percent in April.    At the moment, 64 percent of the electors promise definite  participation, and a large majority of them also named the party  they would probably vote for. In the month before the  elections, we can attribute major importance to this group.  They are the most likely participants of the 8 May elections.  (These people say they would vote for a party or deputy "this  Sunday.") At the moment, 49 percent of the adult population  belongs to the group of potential voters, 5 percent more than in  the second half of March. The members of this group have a  higher than average schooling level, and most of them are  middle-aged rather than young or old. In this group, the MSZP  has a large advantage; it enjoys almost four-tenths of the  support of active electors. It is the SZDSZ that managed to  increase the number of its voters among the potential voters,  thus claiming second place, while the MDF has the third largest  active support.    At the moment, 15 percent of the electors -- more than 1  million people -- consider themselves definite voters but do not  know which party to vote for. Elderly people and Budapest  citizens are more typical among them than the average. The  parties can still increase their number of voters from this  group; however, we can only approach their electoral orientation  indirectly from their negative sentiments. It follows that  those parties have a smaller chance of gaining the support of  these people, for which more of them show antagonistic feelings.  In this sense, the MDF can be the most pessimistic because  antagonistic feelings are shown toward this party by most people  (21 percent). Quite a few people also spoke negatively about  the FKGP [11 percent). From the group that is certain about  participating in the voting but uncertain about the choice, 7  percent named the Workers' Party and the MSZP as parties worth  voting for, and 5 percent mentioned MIEP. An increasing number  of the population believes that, according to the political  power structure, the MSZP has the biggest chance to win the  elections. At the end of March, every fourth elector assumed  that the Socialists would win the elections and every third  believed this in April.    The survey was carried out 8-18 April 1994. One thousand  people who represent the country's population over the age of 14  were questioned. Of the 1,000 questioned, 936 are eligible to  vote. The group to be examined was Hungarian citizens over the  age of 18 who have a permanent address in Hungary. The  structure of this group and that of the surveyed people  correspond in age, gender, and type of dwelling.    The data received in the public opinion survey can at the  most deviate by 4 percent if every citizen who is eligible to  vote had been asked; however, the results arrived at in the  survey have the biggest likelihood.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "mue": "Kinkel: Lead EU With Great Caution"] </F>   [Text] Restraint and extreme caution are the motto Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel of the Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP] has issued for the second half year in which Germany will  hold the European Union [EU] presidency. Kinkel said in Bonn  that, on the one hand, people expect the largest member country  to bring its weight to bear in order to advance the reform of  the EU and to outline the further course of European  integration. On the other hand, the "most powerful" partner  state was bound to create the suspicion of wanting to shape the  community in its fashion, regardless of what it will propose,  the minister said.    It is not least due to this concern that the Foreign  Ministry  head is anxious about who the Community will choose to succeed  Jacques Delors as president of the Brussels Commission. The  decision will be made at the Corfu Summit at the end of this  month. Kinkel was optimistic, which probably means that Jean-Luc  Dehaene, the head of the Belgian Government and the favorite of  France and Germany, will win the race against his Netherlands  colleague Ruud Lubbers. Yet diplomats in Bonn have been  skeptical and assume that although a majority will support  Dehaene in Corfu, there will not be the necessary unanimous  support. Then it would be up to the Federal Government, as of 1  July, to find the candidate who is acceptable to all EU members.    According to Kinkel, the German EU presidency, because of  the  pending referendums in the countries of EU candidates Finland,  Sweden, and Norway, would be ill-advised to come up with  proposals for far-reaching reform. Yet reform has been regarded  as inevitable for a long time. In view of the number of member  states, which will continue to grow in the long term, the  community must retain its ability to make decisions. Yet  changing the weight of the votes in the Council of Ministers  and, for example, keeping the number of commissioners in  Brussels within certain limits, would be bad for the smaller  partner states, which are to a degree enormously  over-represented. They will be joined by the new Nordic  members. This is why the membership opponents there might use  any ideas launched by Bonn as ammunition for their campaigns.    Kinkel's difficult situation is not made easier by the fact  that any reform resolutions are not to be dealt with until the  Maastricht II conference scheduled for 1996. The now  consecutive half-year presidencies of Germany and France are  regarded within the community as the phase of significant  decisions in European policy. Diplomats in Bonn are facing  great expectations from the neighboring Eastern European  countries that expect, particularly from Germany, to be led  closer to the EU. Kinkel would like to "get them to the table"  as best as he can. New constructions, such as partial  membership for the Eastern Europeans (for example in  transportation, trade, and energy policy) -- something that has  been discussed again and again -- have been rejected by the  foreign ministers.    The Federal Government will probably not react to ideas that  suggest that, first, an inner circle of member states might  enter into a closer union. Therefore, it rejects the plan of  French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure for a  "convention of the new founders." However, Kinkel has not ruled  out that an inner circle will emerge within the community at one  point. Out of consideration for members who would then  presumably have to remain outside against their own will, the  Federal Government must not promote the "two-speed Europe,"  Kinkel said.</p>

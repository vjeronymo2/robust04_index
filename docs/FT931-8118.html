			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Markets: Consider the options . . . - Serious Money / Examining a new Pep A PERSONAL equity plan which invests mainly in blue chip shares and offers a monthly income, after charges, of 10 per cent a year sounds like a wonderful deal. Indeed, it seems so attractive that investors should reach automatically for their two guiding principles: 'greater reward means greater risk' and 'if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.' Furthermore, this new unit trust from Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial, called the Higher Income Plan, is fiendishly complicated. Another rule for savers is 'never invest in anything which you don't understand.' How does it work? Around 55 per cent of the portfolio is in the form of blue chip shares, which will provide a modest income (equivalent to 2-3 per cent on the total portfolio). The rest of the portfolio is invested in 'debentures' (of which more later), money market instruments and cash. These provide interest income which pushes up the yield. But the extra income - the portion which pushes the return on the Pep above that on most alternative plans - comes from options. An option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a commodity at a given price over a given period. In return, the buyer pays a premium to the option seller (or 'writer' in the jargon). There are two kinds of option - a 'call,' which gives the purchaser the right to buy a commodity; and a 'put,' which gives the right to sell. An example might help. On Friday morning, it was possible to purchase a call option on BT shares, giving you the right to buy them at 420p before May. The BT price then was 402p and the option carried a premium of 11p. So, if the BT share price rises to 450p before May, the buyer can exercise the option and buy shares at 420p. He will then have a profit of 30p for an initial outlay of 11p. If the BT price stays at 402p, the buyer will let the option lapse and will have lost the 11p premium. Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's new unit trust will write both call and put options against the shares it owns. The premiums it earns by writing the options will boost the yield on the trust up to 10 per cent (after charges) for those who hold the trust in Pep form. (Since the rules do not allow trusts to pay out option profits as income, Hypo F&amp;C has arranged a clever deal whereby the 'debentures' incorporate the options.) One further twist is that the trust will buy a put option on the FT-SE 100 index, which will give it protection against a sharp fall in the stock market. The trick underlying all this complex detail is that Hypo F&amp;C has found a way of converting capital into income. By writing call options, the unit trust will not benefit from any sharp rise in the stock market (since the option buyer will exercise his rights). Hypo F&amp;C says that over the past 15 years, stock market return has been 15 per cent a year  - in the form of 10 per cent capital gain and 5 per cent income. Its new unit trust will aim for the same return, but in the form of 10 per cent income and 5 per cent capital growth. The concept is not entirely new; similar funds are available in the US. It will be interesting to see how the fund works in practice in the UK. But I do not think that anyone planning to invest in it should expect any capital growth at all (and they could make a capital loss). The stock market might well not produce the same levels of nominal return that have been achieved over the past 15 years. Indeed, it could take a while for the investor to earn back the 5 per cent initial charge. Nor will there be the same prospects for income growth as other Peps; option premiums do not grow in the same way as company dividends. It is tempting to seize on any product which offers such a high yield, relative to the rest of the market. But this is a product which needs a lot of thought, and investors ought to take independent financial advice before parting with their cash. ***** So, farewell then, best advice. New guidelines from Fimbra, the regulator for financial advisers, are headlined 'giving investment advice' and replace the 'guidelines on best advice' issued in 1988. One's suspicions are aroused automatically by such a change. Admittedly, best advice is difficult to define - it is easier to say when it does not occur than when it does. Nevertheless, dropping the word 'best' hardly seems a triumph for consumer protection. There are, however, some encouraging words for consumers in the new guidelines. Under a section headed 'Exercise of judgment,' Fimbra says: 'Members must take care to ensure that their recommendations are made on the basis of the client's best interests and not on the basis of the income generated for the member. For example, the 'best' investment for a client who is particularly risk-averse might be National Savings certificates or gilts which do not generate any commission (although the member may charge a reasonable fee for his advice) . . . The benefits of the investment to the client must in each case be balanced against its costs.' If Fimbra members can live up to those injunctions, the consumer will be well served.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Domtar chief executive ousted Mr Pierre Desjardins, president and chief executive of Domtar, the Canadian paper, packaging and building materials group, has been ousted after a boardroom dispute over policy and management style. Domtar's part-time board chairman, Mr Paul Gobeil, has also been removed. Domtar confirmed the contracts of both executives were ended as of Sunday. Insiders estimate that under the terms of their contracts, Mr Desjardins stands to collect about CDollars 1.7m (USDollars 1.2m) and Mr Gobeil nearly CDollars 500,000 as golden handshakes. Mr Desjardins became head of Domtar in 1990 when profits were tumbling with the north American recession. He had been head of John Labatt's Canadian brewing operation. Mr Gobeil was a minister in the Liberal cabinet of former Quebec premier Mr Robert Bourassa in the 1980s and joined Domtar in 1993. Mr Stephen Larson, who joined Domtar as president in 1991 from Boise Cascade, the US group, but who left last July following disagreements, has been named Domtar's president and chief operating officer. He is also a director. Mr Larson is perhaps best known for overseeing a turnround at Domtar's CDollars 1.2bn communications paper mill near Montreal. The new chairman is Mr Gilles Blondeau, an insurance industry consultant. Mr Raymond Cyr, a former chairman of BCE, the telecommunications group, and Mr John Thompson, president of Montreal Trust, become vice-chairmen. These three appointments are interim. Domtar is 20 per cent held by Caisse de Depot, Quebec's public pension fund manager, and 22 per cent by the Quebec Industrial Development Corp, another provincial agency. Domtar has spun off its newsprint operations but withdrawn a USDollars 400m spin-off of its Canadian and US building materials operations. The company returned to profitability on an operating basis in the first half.</p>

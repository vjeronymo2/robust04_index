			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RODEO DRIVE TO GET EURO-STYLE STREET OF SHOPS  </P> <P> Two Rodeo Drive, the largest retail development ever built on the  internationally famous shopping street, celebrated its topping off Tuesday.  </P> <P> The $130-million, 26-building shopping complex, occupying a full block at the  northeast corner of Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard, has its own private  street and will increase the retail square footage along Rodeo Drive by 50%.  </P> <P> Two Rodeo is a joint venture of AMEC-Power-Malkin Partners, which recently  acquired the Ambassador Hotel site on Wilshire Boulevard; Stitzel Properties  Inc., developer of One Rodeo in Beverly Hills, One Union Square in San  Francisco and One Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, and Berisford Rodeo Property  Development, a subsidiary of Berisford International PLC of the United Kingdom,  which joint-ventured with Stitzel Properties on numerous projects.  </P> <P> Douglas L. Stitzel, president of the Stitzel Co. and the project's development  director, specializes in the development of high-end retail projects.  </P> <P> He said he hopes his Beverly Hills project will capture some of the special  allure of time-honored European shopping districts such as Via Condotti in Rome  and Bond Street in London.  </P> <P> "We hope to bring to Two Rodeo the same welcoming ambience," he said, adding  that one of the special features of the project is its street plan, which  doubles the amount of valuable ground-level retail shopping space.  </P> <P> "Our concept was to create two ground floors through the utilization of a  9-foot grade change from Dayton Way and Rodeo Drive to Wilshire Boulevard,"  Stitzel noted.  </P> <P> "By manipulating the floor plan levels, we were able to arrive at a unique  rhythm of contrasting buildings on a curving street, to be named Via Rodeo,  each having a different tactile architectural element such as terra cotta,  limestone, brick and plaster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Individual Identity  </P> <P> "The building shapes will vary considerably, some will have balconies, others  colonnades or awnings that will give individual merchants their own identity,"  Stitzel said.  </P> <P> "Store fronts will be further customized to suit the clients' products and show  windows will be not more than 18 inches from the ground to relate more closely  to the pedestrian viewpoint."  </P> <P> Stitzel commissioned Italian artists to create special features for Via Rodeo,  which includes street lights, limestone sidewalks, an elevator tower and two  restaurants, including a sidewalk cafe.  </P> <P> Mark Scott, director of environmental services for the city of Beverly Hills,  said the project received close scrutiny before its final, enthusiastic  approval by the city's Architectural Commission.  </P> <P> "It involved a prime site previously owned by Amercan Savings &amp; Loan that  has been the subject of considerable controversy in recent years," he said.  </P> <P> "First there was the issue about a hotel proposed by the Four Seasons chain  that was turned down by Beverly Hills voters."  </P> <P> Later a group of investors negotiating for the site stirred renewed  controversy, Scott said. The project met with considerable public resistance  and was also considered by the city to be too minor for such a prime location.  </P> <P> The appeal of Stitzel's proposal for Two Rodeo was twofold, Scott noted.  </P> <P> "The developer, in this case, had a good track record and showed us a project  that lived up to the Rodeo Drive image -- also one that was economically sound  and architecturally creative."  </P> <P> Stitzel satisfied the city's business and governmental leaders with a proposal  that provided 132 additional parking spaces above the code requirements (one  space for every 350 square feet of retail space), besides its valet parking  service convenience.  </P> <P> The city granted Stitzel an encroachment under the Rodeo Drive sidewalk to make  the additional parking spaces possible, a concession that will benefit both the  developer and the city, since all 600 of Two Rodeo's parking spaces will be  available to the public on the same two-hour free-parking basis currently  provided by the city, for the life of the project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tiffany to Relocate  </P> <P> Leases at Two Rodeo are from 10 to 20 years and vary from $75 per square foot  annually for large spaces to $200 per square foot annually for 300-foot spaces.  "This . . . has made (anchor stores) more affordable," Stitzel said.  </P> <P> The prestigious Tiffany &amp; Co. of New York will relocate from its longtime  corner location in the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel to its own building across  the street in Two Rodeo shopping complex.  </P> <P> The 17,000-square-foot Tiffany building was designed for the tenant by Brand  Allen, a consulting architect for the project, and it is the largest business  location outside Manhattan for Tiffany.  </P> <P> Cole-Haan is also a tenant, and a new Giorgio is expected on the site.  </P> <P> The architect of record on the project is Kaplan McLaughlin Diaz, based in San  Francisco. Peck/Jones, Los Angeles, is the general contractor.  </P></p>

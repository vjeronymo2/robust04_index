			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Britons' foreign holidays surge to record level THE BRITISH took a record number of foreign holidays but fewer vacations within the UK last year, in spite of the recession and a campaign by the English Tourist Board to promote seaside resorts. The number of foreign holidays of four nights or more taken by UK residents rose by 9 per cent to 21.75m, a survey published yesterday by the British Tourist Authority shows. This is the highest number recorded, and compares with the figures of 14.25m in 1982 and 8.5m in 1972. The number of UK holidays of four nights or more fell 6 per cent to 32m. This compares with more than 40m in the mid 1970s. Holidays in the UK represented 60 per cent of all holidays taken by British residents last year, compared with 70 per cent in 1982 and 82 per cent in 1972. The survey found that holidaymakers aged 25-34 and 55-64 are taking fewer holidays at home. The authority said that 50 per cent of all British holidays were spent at the seaside. The average expenditure on a holiday abroad last year was Pounds 547. The average expenditure on a British holiday was Pounds 140. The West Country was the most popular UK destination for British tourists, accounting for 23 per cent of all holidays taken, compared with 24 per cent in 1991. Scotland accounted for 11 per cent, down 2 percentage points on 1991. Wales was also the destination of 11 per cent of British holidaymakers, the same percentage as in 1991. Fears of a disastrous season last summer in Devon were not borne out by a review there, Roland Adburgham writes. Visitor numbers to the county - in terms of tourist nights - fell by more than 3m (or 5.4 per cent) to 30.4m last year compared with 1991. The review, which will be submitted tonight to the county council's economy and employment committee, says the further fall last year reflected a nationwide decline in the industry brought about by the recession, fear of unemployment and discounting on foreign holidays. The worst-hit sector in Devon last year was self-catering, with the exception of tented camping, which benefited from trading down to cheap holidays. The review says: 'Surprisingly, the serviced sector in hotels and guest houses held up well with only a 1.7 per cent decline, although this has to be considered in relation to a worse performance in 1991.' Hotels suffered badly in 1991 and the review suggests they did better last year because rationalisation led to higher occupancy rates for those remaining in business. It says there is an urgent need for research, improved training, raising standards and developing new products.</p>

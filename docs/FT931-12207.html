			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MoD dismisses 'erroneous' Rosyth document A DOCUMENT suggesting that decisions had already been taken in the highly political battle over the future of Britain's naval dockyards was described by the Ministry of Defence yesterday as 'a straightforward clerical error'. Stronger expressions were, however, circulating within the ministry after the offending paper was brandished by Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor. As MP for Dunfermline East, Mr Brown is active in the campaign to save jobs at Rosyth, which is competing with Plymouth's Devonport yard for a guarantee of survival. The document produced by Mr Brown appeared to show that the government's intention, until very recently, was to concentrate vital nuclear submarine work at Rosyth. But according to the MoD's embarrassed explanation, this was a mistake. Two new civil service job openings, it said, were circulated in MoD branches earlier this month for 'development managers' to take a supervisory role at the two dockyards. Both dockyards are still government-owned, although they have been managed since 1987 by private-sector companies. The posts were specified as being at 'Dockyard A' and 'Dockyard B' - the former being the winner in the contest, and the latter the loser. However, the version of the circular that went around the Defence Research Agency, a semi-autonomous ministry offshoot, named Rosyth as the dockyard taking sole responsibility for nuclear submarines. Mr Brown cited this as evidence that 'there was political interference of some sort which prevented the decision which was to be announced . . being made.' If the decision were now to go in Devonport's favour, he said, 'we will never accept that Rosyth has lost this contract anything other than unfairly'. He claimed the document showed that if Rosyth were chosen, both yards would be able to remain open in the long-term. The MoD insisted yesterday that no decision had been taken on where to place the crucial contract for refitting the UK's Trident ballistic missile submarines. Mr Gary Streeter, Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton, described Mr Brown's allegations as 'absolute rubbish'. A decision, originally promised by the end of last year, is not now expected before mid-February.</p>

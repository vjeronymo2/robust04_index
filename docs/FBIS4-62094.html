			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Moscow's Military Court  confirmed on Wednesday that the dismissal of Colonel Stanislav  Terekhov from the army was legal.    Terekhov was sacked on September 23, 1993 by Russian Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev for violation of the contract and  disobeying his commanders, ITAR-TASS learnt from sources close  to the Defence Ministry.    Terekhov, who is also chairman of the Union of Army  Officers,  was detained on charges of plotting an attack on the  headquarters of CIS united armed forces after President Boris  Yeltsin dissolved the parliament last autumn and has been in  custody since then.    Terekhov did not deny the charges, but said he was against  using guns. He was released under amnesty earlier this year.    Additionally, Terekhov is charged with participation in May  Day riots in 1993 which killed one and injured dozens of people.</p>

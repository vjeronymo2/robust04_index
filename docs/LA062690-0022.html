			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LATINO GROUPS ORGANIZE A CONGRESS  </P> <P> Ventura County Latinos have a new forum for discussing common concerns.  </P> <P> El Congreso, a countywide organization for Latinos, was formed by participants  in the Latino Community Conference, held over the weekend at Oxnard College.  </P> <P> The goal is to have representatives of the county's 28 Latino organizations  meet regularly to discuss political, social and economic concerns.  </P> <P> "There is a critical need for all of these groups to consolidate their  strength," said Marcos Vargas, executive director of the social service agency  El Concilio. "The most pressing issues at this time are youth violence, quality  education and political representation."  </P> <P> El Concilio has served as an umbrella organization for the Latino groups since  1975, but its directors decided that an independent organization could better  serve the needs of the community.  </P> <P> Meetings will be moved to a different city each time. No regular schedule has  been set, but the group will meet at 3 p.m. July 28 at Moorpark Community  School, 280 Casey Road, Moorpark. MAJA RADEVICH  </P></p>

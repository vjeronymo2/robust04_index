			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Court rules against Gehe bid for OCP THE complex takeover battle for Office Commerciale Pharmaceutique, France's biggest drug wholesaler, took a another twist yesterday when a Paris appeal court ruled against the bid by Gehe, the German drugs wholesaler. This appears to leave the field open for a Franco-American counterbid launched on Monday. The court took exception to the agreement made between Gehe and Mr Jean-Pierre Duche, who in spite of being recently ousted as nominal head of OCP controls two companies - SGP and Eurosante - which effectively run OCP's distribution system in France and abroad. The agreement stipulated that if Gehe got more than 50 per cent of OCP, it would also get 75 per cent of the shares in these two companies. The court said this arrangement unfairly predetermined the outcome of the takeover bid for OCP. Gehe could not be reached for comment on what its next step might be. But the court ruling appears to leave the field free to the counterbid launched by Co-operation Pharmaceutique Francaise (Cooper), Bergen Brunswig of the US, the Bourely family and the drug laboratories of such French companies as Rhone Poulenc and Sanofi. The Cooper-led group has offered FFr 865 a share, compared with the FFr800 originally offered by Gehe, for shares not only in OCP, but also in SGP and Eurosante. These latter companies were set up as a defence against hostile takeovers by Mr Duche under a peculiarly French system known as societes en commandite, in which the shareholders virtually surrender their rights to managers who in return assume unlimited liability for the com-pany. The Cooper bid for OCP may itself face legal problems because it is conditional on the Cooper group getting 75 per cent of SGP and Eurosante.</p>

The European Union considers the agreements, due to be  signed  in April by President Yeltsin and President Ulmanis, as an  important step towards achieving the complete withdrawal of  Russian troops from the Baltic states called for in the 1992  CSCE Helsinki document, and towards the establishment of good,  cooperative relations between Latvia and Russia.    In the same spirit, the European Union expects that Russia  will complete its troop withdrawal from Estonia by 31 August  1994.</p>

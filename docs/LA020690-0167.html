			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> 3RD STRAIGHT VICTORY ON LINE FOR TSU'S DAWNING IN STAKES RACE  </P> <P> Tsu's Dawning will be after his third straight victory when he faces six other  sophomores in the $75,000-added Santa Catalina Stakes on Wednesday at Santa  Anita Park.  </P> <P> The 1 1/16th-mile Santa Catalina is an early preparation race for the $500,000  Santa Anita Derby on April 7.  </P> <P> Tsu's Dawning made an inauspicious debut in November, finishing fifth. He broke  his maiden by 5 1/2 lengths at a mile in his second start, then triumphed by  two lengths in allowance company to close out 1989.  </P> <P> Tsu's Dawning campaigns under the silks of Royal Lines for trainer Eddie  Gregson, the same connection that raced his sire Tsunami Slew in 1983-85 when  he captured eight stakes, including the Grade I Carleton F. Burke Handicap at  Santa Anita.  </P> <P> With a field of seven runners, the Santa Catalina Stakes will offer an $81,450  purse and the winner will receive $47,700.  </P> <P> In post position order, the field includes Music Prospector, Frank Olivares,  114; Tsu's Dawning, Chris McCarron, 120; Flying Reb, Eddie Delahoussaye, 114;  Senegalaise, Gary Stevens, 114; Short Timer, 114; Shapiro's Hero, Alex Solis,  114; El Toreo, Sandy Hawley, 114.  </P> <P> Shapiro's Hero comes off a fast-closing third-place finish in the California  Breeders' Champion Stakes.  </P> <P> Short Timer took five tries to break his maiden against claimers but came right  back to score an allowance victory in his last race.  </P> <P> Flying Reb broke his maiden last time, upsetting Sir Beaufort, a top 3-year-old  in trainer Charlie Whittingham's shed row.  </P></p>

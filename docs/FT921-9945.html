			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Russia and France agree partnership RUSSIA and France yesterday agreed on a new partnership based on 'confidence, solidarity and co-operation' in a treaty signed by President Boris Yeltsin and President Francois Mitterrand at the end of a three-day state visit by the Russian President, writes Ian Davidson from Paris. Non-committally entitled 'Treaty between France and Russia', the agreement effectively replaces the 'Franco-Soviet Treaty of Understanding and Co-operation', which was signed with President Mikhail Gorbachev in October 1990, but never ratified. The treaty promises co-operation on the conclusion of a European security treaty and stresses the importance of nuclear disarmament, with the aim of reducing nuclear arsenals to levels of 'minimal sufficiency'.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Delors slates G7 summit 'circus' MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday described the summit meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations as 'a Barnum circus with 3,000 journalists,' and called for a radical reorganisation of international economic organisations. 'The G7 should be setting an example but all it can offer is platitudes,' Mr Delors told a meeting of the International Management and Development Institute, a gathering of corporate executives and politicians from Europe and North America, in Washington yesterday. 'The duty of the most prosperous countries is to co-operate and deliver a concrete signal to the rest of the world,' he added, complaining that the G7 had spent the last four years telling the world it had the goodwill to complete the Uruguay round of negotiations on new world trading rules, but had failed to fulfil this. Arguing for closer linkage between international economic institutions such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank under the auspices of the United Nations, Mr Delors said the next two years offered an opportunity to create a new framework 'in the same spirit as after the war, because we face a new world'. Mr Delors was due to visit the White House later for a 20 minute opportunity to get acquainted with President Bill Clinton. European officials denied that any longer negotiating session had ever been planned, but a full summit meeting in Washington between the US and the EC was expected to be announced for May 7. White House officials said they expected some discussion of trade issues, but Mr Delors was also expected to bring up broader questions, including G7 co-ordination and aid for the republics of the former Soviet Union. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, denied that any snub was intended by the shortness of the meeting. 'Commissioner Delors asked for a courtesy call. We granted that,' she said yesterday. Some senior administration officials have complained privately, however, of a 'snow shower' of visitors from Europe wanting to see the new president.</p>

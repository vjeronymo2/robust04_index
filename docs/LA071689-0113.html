			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO JULIA  </P> <P> by Robert Herrick  </P> <P> Julia, I bring  </P> <P> To thee this ring,  </P> <P> Made for thy finger fit;  </P> <P> To show by this  </P> <P> That love is  </P> <P> Or should be, like to it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loose though it be,  </P> <P> The joint is free;  </P> <P> So, when love's yoke is on,  </P> <P> It must not gall,  </P> <P> Nor fret at all,  </P> <P> With hard oppression.  </P> <P> </P> <P> But it must play,  </P> <P> Still either way,  </P> <P> And be, too, such a yoke  </P> <P> As not too wide  </P> <P> To overslide,  </P> <P> Or be so straight to choke.  </P> <P> </P> <P> So we who bear  </P> <P> This beam, must rear  </P> <P> Ourselves to such a height  </P> <P> As that the stay  </P> <P> Of either may  </P> <P> Create the burthen light.  </P> <P> </P> <P> And as this round  </P> <P> Is nowhere found  </P> <P> To flaw, or else to sever,  </P> <P> So let our love  </P> <P> As endless prove,  </P> <P> And pure as gold forever.  </P> <P> Writing your own wedding ceremony? Take a look at "Wedding Readings: Centuries  of Writing and Rituals for Love and Marriage" (Viking: $17.95; 262 pp.),  selected and with an introduction by Eleanor Munro. Robert Herrick (1591-1674),  an Anglican priest, was the author of both religious and secular love lyrics.  Swinburne called him "the greatest song-writer ever born of English race."  </P></p>

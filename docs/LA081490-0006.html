			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> COLOR BLIND AT THE FRONT LINES  </P> <P> As a veteran and from my viewpoint, I think we have a very touchy situation in  (the Middle East) and one that will probably be hard for people to understand  if people get killed. It would probably be difficult for those who are not  privy to all of the intelligence that goes into making these decisions of when  we ought to use military power and this just happens to be the case.  </P> <P> The President has chosen that option.  </P> <P> Blacks are Americans and a part of this country. We hope that there will be no  significance made between black or white (military men and women during the  crisis). We hope that they would carry out the job that is required.  </P> <P> Our services for a great number of years have been made up of volunteer forces,  not drafted forces. And perhaps a greater number of blacks have volunteered to  serve, even if a great proportion were on the front lines in Vietnam. If they  have been accepted on equal standards and can carry out the job, I think they  would perform just as well.  </P> <P> They are not in (the Persian Gulf) because someone is sending blacks to be the  first to be killed. They are there because they volunteered to support this  country and to help keep the military power of this country great. I really  think this is often something that our populous doesn't understand and that is  related to this, no war has been declared (in the Persian Gulf) but certainly  military power is one of the options that our President has to keep this  country free to keep its allies protected.  </P> <P> Whoever that soldier is who has volunteered and is qualified to carry out that  duty at the front line, he has to be color blind.  </P></p>

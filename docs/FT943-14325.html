			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Royal Mint to avoid sell-off The Treasury, the department in charge of the government's privatisation programme, has decided against privatising the Royal Mint, one of the most profitable of the government's executive agencies. Whitehall insiders expressed surprise because the Treasury is pressing other government departments to privatise their agencies. 'It reminds me of that old saying about people in glass houses not throwing stones,' said one mandarin last night. The Royal Mint, which is based at Llantrisant in south Wales and became an agency in 1990, was an attractive candidate for privatisation, with an operating profit of Pounds 15.6m last year. Unlike other agencies it does not rely on UK government contracts for income. Almost two-thirds of its sales are exports, where the agency has more than 50 per cent of the market in coins and medals. In December a white paper on the future of agencies promised a much stronger emphasis on privatisation in the triennial reviews of each agency. However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday announced that the Royal Mint would remain in public hands after a review of the options. A report on the agency's performance found that it had made a return on capital of 23.2 per cent during its first three years - almost double its target of 12.5 per cent. The announcement coincided with the publication of the Royal Mint's annual report showing that it paid the government a dividend of Pounds 16.5m last year, up from Pounds 11.8m in the previous year. Its operating profit had risen 38 per cent in the past year.</p>

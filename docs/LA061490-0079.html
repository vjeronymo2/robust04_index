			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS HOPE PARTY CONGRESS CAN MEND PERESTROIKA RIFT;  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS: POLICIES ARE BEING REVISED TO GIVE THE PLATFORM BROADER APPEAL, AN  OFFICIAL SAID.  </P> <P> The Soviet Communist Party, torn by more internal dissent today than at any  time since the 1920s, is struggling to avert an open split among its members  over the course of perestroika, the party's chief ideologist said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Vadim A. Medvedev, the party secretary for ideology and a key adviser to  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said the party leadership would use the  forthcoming party congress, called to make crucial decisions on future reforms,  to consolidate support for perestroika -- even, it appears, at the cost of  bolder moves.  </P> <P> Medvedev said that the party's platform, introduced in draft form three months  ago, is being rewritten in as broad a form as possible, with proposals from  across the political spectrum to avoid defections to either the left or the  right.  </P> <P> Proposed new party rules are also being revised further, he said, to allow  active dissent by members -- but without impairing the party's ability to act.  </P> <P> "We are making all efforts to prevent the fragmentation of the party prior to,  during and even after the congress," Medvedev said. "In working on major  documents, including the platform and the rules, we are trying to develop the  broadest possible basis. . . .  </P> <P> "We will set certain boundaries -- the socialist choice (for the country's  political and economic system) and certain social and ideological values -- but  they will be broad enough to unite all forces of perestroika."  </P> <P> The future of the Soviet Communist Party, which has ruled the country since the  1917 Bolshevik Revolution, is clearly in the balance, and the party leadership  is confronted with choices between the policies it wants to pursue and the  danger that the party will split over them.  </P> <P> The search for an early compromise is important, for it will shape both the  decisions of the delegates and their election of a new party leadership at the  congress next month.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has been pressed hard by party conservatives for a pre-congress purge  of radicals, but little appears to have been done to put into effect  instructions from the party's policy-making Central Committee for a review of  the membership.  </P> <P> At the same time, Gorbachev is challenged aggressively from the left to act  more boldly, even at the risk of breaking with traditional Marxism-Leninism and  driving conservatives out of the party.  </P> <P> "We stand for consolidation," Medvedev said. "We are against the disintegration  and splintering of the party."  </P> <P> But Medvedev, who is also a member of the ruling Politburo, said the party's  political elasticity does have limits, and he acknowledged that members of the  Democratic Platform, a liberal group still operating within the party, might  well quit to form a party of their own.  </P> <P> "There is every opportunity to avoid a split in the party, but unfortunately  not everything depends on us," he said. "As for members who espouse alternative  platforms, if they are for constructive dialogue, fine. If other . . .  interests prevail, that is a matter for those comrades."  </P> <P> A greater threat has come from the right, however, with the threatened  formation of an independent Russian Communist Party, which would be dominated  by conservatives opposed to many of Gorbachev's reforms.  </P> <P> To preempt that move, the party leadership announced over the weekend that, in  a major policy reversal, it would form an official Russian Communist Party,  presumably loyal to Gorbachev. Its founding congress will open here Tuesday.  </P> <P> Medvedev, who in the past strongly opposed the division of the party into  ethnic units, contended Wednesday that, in fact, it would become a "barrier" to  further fragmentation because it would group about 58% of the party's 18  million members in a single body and prevent domination of the whole party.  </P> <P> "We need some organizational guarantees that this dominating Russian Communist  Party does not cause the development of separatist tendencies in other  republican parties," Medvedev said, referring to rebellions within party ranks  in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in Armenia and  Georgia in the south and in the Ukraine.  </P> <P> The need to preserve party unity has also apparently led the party leadership  to drop plans for the adoption of a new party program, for conservatives and  radicals would undoubtedly see it as a final struggle for their cause.  </P> <P> Medvedev said there is even sentiment for pushing deliberation over other key  policy documents into closed-door commissions to avoid inflaming passions at  the congress.  </P> <P> "Political tension in the country is rather high," he said. "The party and  nation are in a critical stage at this time as the final work is completed for  the party's congress."  </P> <P> The party leadership, seeking a greater mandate for broader and faster reforms,  brought forward the congress by a year -- it opens here July 2 and is expected  to run for a week or more -- and it has portrayed the congress as a pivotal  event in the country's history.  </P></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Compromise plan offered on EC farm policy reform THE CURRENT Portuguese presidency of the European Community yesterday presented its promised compromise 'working paper' on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which seeks to loosen the Brussels package without altering its shape or design. On cereals, the central chapter of the reform plan, the presidency paper raises the possibility of higher compensation for cuts in the support price of 35 per cent over three years, and for the land set aside to enforce production restraint. However, this proposal contains two caveats that should hamstring ministers keen to secure more income for their farmers. Higher direct compensation for the cuts would only be made 'if possible in budgetary terms', and if it did not cut across the intention of making cereals prices competitive. The European Commission will today unveil a five-year budget revision proposal that is already likely to be forensically examined by member states for unnecessary spending. It foresees CAP outgoings rising from Ecu35.3bn (Pounds 25bn) this year to Ecu38.6bn in 1997, at 1992 prices, but with a bulge caused by the compensation payments in 1995 and 1996, which would raise the farm budget to around Ecu40bn. Compensation for cereal price cuts will alone rise to Ecu13.1bn by 1996, with additional spending on environmental and early retirement measures costing a further Ecu1.8bn. Even though savings from price cuts turn this into a net increase of Ecu4.7bn, commission officials see little prospect of any further rise. The rest of the Portuguese compromise is a shopping list of member states' most vigorously pressed demands, some of which the commission is discreetly welcoming as useful political grease to ease the passage of the reform. Thus, the UK's complaint that limits on premiums to sheep farmers in disadvantaged hill areas discriminated against Britain's large flocks has surfaced in the Portuguese plan as an increase in the eligible headage of sheep from 750 to 1,000. Similarly, the compromise loosens the commission's limits on the number of both dairy and beef cows per hectare which would receive a premium payment, raising it from 1.4 to 2. Greek and Italian tobacco farmers facing a sharp cut in the quota financed by the EC have had 10,000 tonnes added back. And for dairy farmers, there will in addition be more flexibility in the management of quota cuts.</p>

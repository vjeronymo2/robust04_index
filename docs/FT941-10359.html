			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / 'Requests for money come in brown envelopes' Mr Andrei Illarionov, the prime minister's former chief economist, is the latest in a a long line of reformers to leave the Russian government saying it is shackled to special interests. Speaking immediately after his resignation earlier this week, Mr Illarionov said Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's proclaimed end to 'the age of market romanticism' had translated into a return to pandering to representatives of industry and agriculture - who delivered their requests for budgetary expenditure in plain envelopes. Mr Illarionov, recalled in particular a visit to Lenin's home town of Ulyanovsk, where he was sent by Mr Chernomyrdin to investigate whether a local scheme for fixing prices could be extended to the whole of the country. After being given much food and drink, Mr Illarionov was handed an envelope. The officials told him it contained a 'a special letter for the prime minister' - a request for Rbs3bn to help Aviastar, the local aviation plant. 'I tried not to take the letter at all,' he recalls, grinning at his own naivety. 'I did not want to lobby for any interests.' But finally, he took the letter and decided to give it to Mr Chernomyrdin 'to see what would happen'. 'I said, 'Victor Stepanovich, I do not know what we should do. I have never got such a letter in my life. Perhaps we should give it to the finance ministry to see if they've got the money'. He said 'Why? Give it to me. Let's see if they need help. When you see such requests, give them to me'.' Ms Ella Pamfilova, who resigned as social affairs minister, said at the weekend she believed Russia's new leaders were 'gathering power into their hands to preserve the bureaucratic system of distribution as their main source of income'. Things have deteriorated sharply since the departure of the first reformist government of Mr Yegor Gaidar, said Mr Illarionov. 'Even under Gaidar, it was not possible to leave a government office in a drunken state. Now it happens very often. Ask the drivers who take people home.' He would not be drawn on whether he had seen ministers in a drunken state, saying simply that 'people in the apparatus do the same things as their chiefs'. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, made similar allegations at the time of his resignation last month. Mr Fyodorov, who admitted he never travelled around Russia because 'such trips end up being just 'promising' trips', said it was his attempt to impose fiscal discipline which really angered colleagues like Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, deputy prime minister for agriculture. Although he could control spending he could not control the spending promises of others. 'You find that in 90 per cent of cases, money is misspent or people did not need it.' Subsidies rarely reached their targets, thanks to corruption and inefficiency, while those most in need of support felt abandoned by the government. 'If you stand in front of the British Treasury for an hour and shout, nobody will give you any money,' Mr Fyodorov said. 'But here it works, so why should people stop doing it?'</p>

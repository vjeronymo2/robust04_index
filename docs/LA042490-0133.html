			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN SITES TO CLOSE IN 1-DAY ISRAEL PROTEST  </P> <P> Christian leaders Monday ordered all their holy sites in Israel closed for one  day Friday to protest Israel's support for a new Jewish settlement in the  Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.  </P> <P> "This action endangers the survival of all Christian communities in the Holy  City," said a statement signed by 10 leaders who represent the major Christian  sects in Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Anger at the April 11 takeover of the building owned by the Greek Orthodox  Church, in the midst of Easter-week celebrations, was heightened by the  government's admission Sunday that it paid $1.8 million to help pay for leasing  the building.  </P> <P> "On Friday, April 27, all Christian holy places in Jerusalem, Nazareth,  Bethlehem and elsewhere in the Holy Land will close their doors as of 9 a.m.  and will not reopen until the following day," the church leaders wrote.  </P> <P> Anglican Bishop Samir Kafiti of Jerusalem said he believes the protest will  mark the first time that all the Christian holy places have been closed.  </P> <P> In Washington, the State Department said Israel's backing of the new Jewish  settlement is "deeply disturbing." Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler  called the settlement "an insensitive and provocative action."  </P> <P> Reacting to the U.S. criticism, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yosef Amihud  said in a statement: "It is the right of Jews to live in any place and to  acquire or rent property anywhere in the land of Israel and especially in  Jerusalem."  </P> <P> The sprawling Hospice of St. John, occupied by 150 Jewish settlers, is next  door to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, located on the site where Christians  believe Jesus was entombed and resurrected.  </P> <P> Israel's Housing Ministry said Sunday that it paid $1.8 million to cover 40% of  the cost of a lease on the building.  </P> <P> The church last week won a court order to evict the settlers, but it has not  been enforced. The bailiff's office Monday gave the settlers 48 hours' notice  of eviction at the request of the church, but security sources said the  settlers could appeal.  </P></p>

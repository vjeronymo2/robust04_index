			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (9): A light in the darkness  -Finance EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES REPORT 1993 IMD &amp; World Economic Forum SFr700 (Pounds 320) 355 pages A BOLD analysis, this, at several different levels. But, first, what are 'Emerging Market Economies'? Twenty countries trying to make the transition from state regulation to the market. In the league of mega-markets, there are China, India and Russia (in that order, in the Report's view); in the medium-sized markets, Poland and 'Czechoslovakia'; among the mini-markets, Slovenia and Croatia. So, what is bold about the analysis? Briefly, that it tries to evaluate the comparative competitiveness of these transitional and volatile economies. How does it define 'competitiveness'? By the capacity to gain market share abroad as well as by the ability to create investment and trade at home. This means 'the extent to which the specific obstacles on their way have been overcome . . . (including inflation, unemployment, output, privatisation, currency exchange, foreign trade, institution building, political transition, and mental structures).' Now if that isn't bold, it must be foolhardy. Who can assess, from the outside, the degree to which, in comparison with each other, the attitudes (or 'mental structures') of two different populations have altered? And even in the case of data which is more quantifiable, how is one to heed the Report's call for us to 'interpret the data carefully, keeping in mind the biases resulting from unstable exchange rates, high inflation or differences in statistical systems'? This is an attempt to eat your cake and have it: if the data is not reliable, surely any time spent in discussing its interpretation must be wasted? Not really, the instigators of this Report argue: they have 12 years of experience in working with imprecise data in their annual World Competitiveness Report, and they are working with the latest figures. All very well, but they should have provided, at the least, a Reliability Index  -a guide to the degree of confidence they feel in each set of data, by country and by subject of inquiry. Nevertheless, if the Report is highly fallible, it is the only Report of its sort. In working with the present darkness of economies which have such great potential, any light must be welcomed.</p>

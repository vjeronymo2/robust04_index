			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned that the ROK and the United States  held high-level talks on 18 April to deal with the North Korean  nuclear issue.    In the talks, the two sides reaffirmed their previous  position on the immediate resumption of the third round of the  U.S.-North Korean talks if North Korea accepts additional  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.    Yi Kang-tok reports:    [Begin Yi recording] Today, Kim Sam-hun, our side's nuclear  ambassador, and his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci held  high-level talks to deal with the nuclear issue and held the  same view that the third round of the U.S.-North Korean talks  would be held only after realizing additional inspections of  North Korea's nuclear facilities.    The two countries agreed to seek sanctions through the UN  Secretary Council if North Korea fails to accept additional  inspections by next month.    Since the UN Secretary Council president's statement called  for dialogue among countries concerned, the two sides also  agreed to resume the U.S.-North Korean working-level talks in  New York if North Korea first proposes contacts.    They shared the same view that inter-Korean talks are  necessary for the realization of the joint declaration on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. However, they agreed  to set the date for resumption of the inter-Korean dialogue  after watching the developments of the nuclear issue, including  the resumption of U.S.- North Korean high-level talks.    In particular, the two countries have decided to have close  consultations on specific items to be discussed in U.S.-North  Korean talks, which will take place if North Korea allows  additional inspections.    In today's talks, the two sides decided to resume the Team  Spirit joint exercise in the event the North Korean nuclear  issue continues to experience rough sailing and to map out  detailed measures when U.S. Defense Secretary visits Seoul on 19  April.

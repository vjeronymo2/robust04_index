			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / The convicts who reap what they have sown - Nicholas Lander visits one of Britain's largest agricultural operations and finds that the prison farm officers face a life of hard labour THIRTY years after starting as a farm foreman, Maurice Codd runs the third biggest farming operation in the country. But his is not a rags to riches story, as the nature of his workforce reveals. Codd started at Pounds 11 per week on a farm attached to Dartmoor Prison in Devon. Now, as Chief Farms and Gardens Manager for HM Prison Service, a Grade 6 Civil Service post which carries a salary of Pounds 26,000-Pounds 34,000 per annum, he manages 5,500 hectares of marginal farming land and a workforce of 3,500 prison inmates from an office in Croydon. Putting prisoners to work on farms is not unique to the British penal system; when I met Codd he was flying off to meet his counterpart in the US. The constraints under which Codd and his 80 strong management work and the diverse goals they have to achieve are quite different from those of normal farm managers. They must make the prison system as self-sufficient as possible in foodstuffs (by producing enough to feed 47,000 inmates three times a day) and train inmates for a career upon their eventual release. Farming was first introduced to the British penal system at Dartmoor because it provided a healthy and hard day's work in the open air. It was an integral part of the Borstal regime when it was first established near Rochester in 1908. Prison farms have grown sharply as the number of prisoners has grown and as prisoners have increasingly been seen as an effective, and cheap, way of converting marginal land that no commercial farmer could be persuaded to touch. Codd's organisation includes 17 large farms around Britain with 2,400 dairy cows, 1,400 breeding sows, 2,000 ewes and 4,000 laying hens. It produces 12,000 tonnes of potatoes, 6,000 tonnes of cabbage and 3,000 tonnes of carrots a year. The farms also provide most of the milk for the prisons and sell 6.5m litres to the Milk Marketing Board. There are five distribution centres around the country and prisons receive their deliveries three times a week via private contractors. Until 1968 when a Cabinet directive stipulated that prison farms must become cost effective, they were run, says Codd, on the 'dog and stick' principle and lost Pounds 200,000 a year. Things have changed. Today the only time a smile leaves Codd's countenance is when he talks about the Treasury. Codd's annual turnover is over Pounds 35m and he receives an annual grant of Pounds 8m from the Treasury towards the running of the farms. But because he is Treasury-funded he cannot plough back any profits, nor is he eligible for any external grants. His management is pushed to make a profit but not allowed to retain what it makes and this, for Codd, removes the biggest source of staff motivation. The prison farm system has little commercial contact with the outside world. It cannot sell to others as this would naturally upset commercial farmers. Prison farm workers are paid just Pounds 3 to Pounds 5 a week, not in cash but credits. But the saving that this cheap labour generates is not credited back to the farms either. Under the present set-up, which may change when the prison service becomes an Agency Service in April 1993, it does seem that the Treasury is the beneficiary of a system of funding distinctly at odds with anything approaching the stimulus of the free market. Codd and his managers face two other constraints on their performance. New prison buildings will have to be built on land taken from the surrounding farmland. Codd will therefore have to feed more inmates on less land. In the meantime, because of prison over-crowding, only the more serious offenders are being sent to jail. As his farm workers are prisoners with good behaviour records or nearing the end of their sentences, Codd is also having to cope with a shortage of suitable labour. A day spent with Ivor Gough, farm manager at HM Standford Hill, an open prison on the Isle of Sheppey on the north Kent coast, showed the many non-financial rewards of farming with inmates. Gough trained at Agricultural College in his native Shropshire before running a Salvation Army farm for the poor in Jamaica. He combines professionalism with a common touch and a sense of humour. He needs all these attributes. Grade 3 is considered the poorest quality land for farming purposes but Gough's land was Grade 3 minus. It was an airfield in the Second World War - RAF Eastchurch. It was heavily bombed and the craters were filled with rubble. The hangars were heavily strafed, leaving scars which are visible today. The base was decommissioned in 1951 and handed over to the prison farming service. It is an incongruous sight. Because the prison farming system receives such limited capital it has to make do and mend. Gough's offices, from which produce is despatched daily to London's 27 prisons, are the semi-circular homes built for RAF officers in 1938. Huge buildings that used to be hangars for aircraft assembly lines now act as cold storages for up to 800 tonnes of potatoes and processing and packaging units for root crops. His 150 head of cattle are still milked on a system that, says Gough, would long ago have been replaced on any commercial farm. After the 1989 riots at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, all capital expenditure on farms was frozen. As Gough explained resignedly: 'New accommodation for the inmates was more important than new homes for the pigs.' I was fortunate enough to visit on a hot summer's day when most inmates were happy to have the opportunity to be working outside. The men, mostly young, worked in prison uniforms - blue shirts and jeans or overalls - but the absence today of the traditionally brutal prison hair cut made it difficult to spot exactly who was a prisoner. Those I saw on the prison farm had all earned the right to be there. All were in low-risk categories and had served part of their sentence and now, the authorities felt, would respond to the more relaxed atmosphere of an open prison. There are few attempts at escape. The punishment, the immediate removal of the good conduct award, which carried with it the remission of a third of a prisoner's sentence, is sufficient deterrent. Gough is visited frequently by environmental health officers and must obey all the legislation laid down by the Health and Safety Executive. His produce must be as good as the food the kitchen catering officers, whose budget for feeding a grown man varies from 88p to 120p per day, can buy from outside suppliers. Dennis Neville, production and marketing manager for the prison farm system, said his 47,000 customers are obviously dissatisfied and that the food is always the first thing they will complain about. When I asked what was the biggest difference between a commercial farm and one within the prison system he immediately replied: 'the workforce.' He did not mean this uncharitably. Because the farms provide work, therapy and training for the outside world Gough has a constant workforce of 110 when his commercial competitors are seeking to shed labour at every opportunity. Gough cannot hire or fire. He has to find work for all his prisoners whether they want to work or not and their working days are frequently interrupted by visitors - either family, police or probation officers. One way in which the prison farm system has been able to make a virtue of its workforce, its size and its need to provide a vocational training has been through its connection with the Rare Breed Association which began six years ago. To help the national gene bank to maintain as many bloodlines as possible 15 prison farms stock increasing numbers of what were rare animals. Ove 40 species rare animals are bred on prison farms. Among them are British Lop pigs, belted Galloway cattle and Indian runner ducks. The prison system also boasts 27 Suffolk punch-horses, the farm work horse. It is the largest herd in the world. I was introduced to Squire, a Suffolk punch which weighs just over a ton. He was being groomed for the weekend when, drawing a repainted gun carriage, he would take children for rides at a village fair. Of his two grooms, one with long curly hair and a confident air had appeared last year on the front page of the Financial Times in a fraud case. His colleague, with tattoos, grey cropped hair and a beard that gave him the air of a genial pirate, had been sentenced for smuggling cannabis in a case The Sun newspaper had headlined as 'Bangers and Hash'. The prison farm system was teaching these, and many other city-bred prisoners, vocational skills and providing the basics for a new career. Appearing at agricultural shows and fairs, such as the recent Royal Agricultural Show at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, where they won 25 awards, is also teaching the prisoners social skills and introducing them gradually back into society. Pride of place in Gough's crowded office was a book of drawings and thank-you letters from a local group of Brownies who had recently spent a day down on his farm.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECH PREMIER FRAMES TAKE-IT-OR-LEAVE-IT GOVERNMENT;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: ADAMEC, THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE, THREATENS TO RESIGN IF HIS NOMINEES  ARE REJECTED.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec, warning that Czechoslovakia faces the danger of  anarchy, said in a nationally televised address Wednesday that he will propose  a new government today. He threatened to resign if the Communist Party and  opposition forces do not accept his choices.  </P> <P> "I cannot bear responsibility for the further development of the situation" if  the government does not have "public confidence in the sincerity of our  intentions," Adamec said. "In that case, I have only one honorable way out --  to ask the president of the republic to release me."  </P> <P> He said the country faces a choice of "stability or disruption of the national  economy, democracy within the framework of the legal order or chaos and  anarchy."  </P> <P> Adamec has threatened to resign before, but close associates say he is now near  exhaustion, isolated and deeply frustrated by the conflicting demands he faces  as the man in the middle between his hard-line fellow Communists and the  increasingly powerful opposition.  </P> <P> As one of the few Communists who has retained some credibility with opposition  groups, Adamec has been an important bridge between the two sides. His  resignation would deepen the nation's political crisis.  </P> <P> In less than three weeks, Czechoslovakia has gone through a stunning  transformation, compressing political changes that have taken its East European  neighbors months and, in some cases, as in Poland, years.  </P> <P> "Everybody's shocked by how fast the system has collapsed," said Jan Urban, a  leading strategist for the opposition Civic Forum. "It shows very clearly how  rotten, how weak, the system was."  </P> <P> But the rapid change has left both sides unprepared to assume the burden of  governing at a time when Czechoslovakia faces fundamental economic change.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, as part of negotiations to organize a new government, Communist  Party chief Karel Urbanek held an unprecedented meeting with Civic Forum's  leader, the playwright Vaclav Havel. Leading members of the opposition group  said that Civic Forum is prepared to enter a new government.  </P> <P> "By this weekend, we will have Civic Forum ministers," Urban said.  </P> <P> Civic Forum has resisted being drawn into the government, insisting that it is  not a political party. Last week, the group refused to give Adamec a list of  names for government ministries. Now, the rapid pace of events is moving Civic  Forum into a more traditional political role, causing deep misgivings in some  of its leaders.  </P> <P> "The Communist Party does not want to give up power," Urban said. "It wants us  to take responsibility."  </P> <P> The move, he said, could trap Civic Forum into taking blame for government  action it cannot control.  </P> <P> "We understand this," he said, "but do we have a choice?"  </P> <P> The next government is widely expected to be forced to take difficult and  unpopular steps to right the economy, which has deteriorated during years of  Communist mismanagement.  </P> <P> Adamec's new government will be the second he will have proposed this week.  Sunday, he put forward a government consisting of 16 Communists and five  non-Communists, and the opposition denounced it as insufficient.  </P> <P> Since then, Communist and opposition leaders have conducted intense  negotiations to produce a new list. The process has been extraordinarily  difficult, according to people involved.  </P> <P> Communist leaders have recognized the need for new officials. Party Chairman  Urbanek said at Wednesday morning's negotiating session that he wants the  Communists to be represented in the government by young and competent people, a  party spokesman said, and Civic Forum members confirmed this account.  </P> <P> Urbanek also assured Civic Forum that the Communists realize "the deeply rooted  mistrust" with which they are regarded. They also understand that "the party  must transform itself radically to become one of several forces with equal  participation in Czechoslovak political life," Havel told reporters.  </P> <P> But Urbanek conceded, Havel said, that he faced considerable resistance from  conservative provincial and regional party leaders at a recent meeting.  </P> <P> "I tried to explain to them for three hours that the Communist Party does not  favor a monopoly of power," Havel quoted Urbanek as saying, "but some of them  did not want to understand."  </P> <P> After years in which the Communists put top priority on conformity, suppressed  internal dissent and blocked advancement of non-party members, finding  acceptable people has become a major challenge.  </P> <P> Policies adopted after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968 ended the last taste of  reform here "made selection of the best of the best more difficult," Adamec  said in his speech. "Not a few talents did not get either education or  opportunity."  </P> <P> In the circumstances, finding talented people who are not politically tainted  has become a daunting task.  </P> <P> "We could form the sort of incompetent government we have now in an hour,"  Urban said. "We have to form a competent government. That's the problem."  </P> <P> If a new government is formed, it is expected to begin putting into effect Jan.  1 plans for economic reform. At least initially, these steps are likely to  cause unemployment and higher inflation as resources are shifted to areas of  urgent need and away from costly subsidies for consumer goods.  </P> <P> Political figures, involved in organizing new parties to compete in free  elections that are expected in the spring, are not eager to take responsibility  for such actions, said a Western diplomat.  </P></p>

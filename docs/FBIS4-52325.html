			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand has asked Myanmar [Burma] to regulate the  prices of its natural gas export in line with fuel oil prices.    During his meeting with Myanmar Minister of Energy U Khin  Maung Thein, Minister to the Prime Minister's Office Sawit  Phothiwihok told the Myanmar minister that Thailand plans to  utilize natural gas supply from Myanmar at the power plant in  Rat Buri Province in the central plain bordering Myanmar.    He explained that the power plant can use either fuel oil or  natural gas and that higher prices of natural gas would not be  acceptable.    The Thai minister also informed his Myanmar counterpart that  Thailand has also contracted to buy energy from the Lao People's  Democratic Republic and Malaysia.

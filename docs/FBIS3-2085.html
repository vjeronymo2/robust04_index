Song Haipeng, deputy director of the State Administration of  Exchange Control, made the statement at a recent international  financial symposium in this special economic zone in Guangdong  Province.    Song said that there are 2,292 financial organs in China  handling foreign exchange business, including 90 foreign-funded  banks or Sino-foreign banking joint ventures.    Chinese financial organizations have 230 billion U.S.  dollars  in foreign currency assets. They deal with various kinds of  business in international and domestic financial markets.    More than 100 swap markets in the country make it possible  for enterprises and individuals to buy and sell their foreign  currency. The transaction volume during the past two years has  reached some 25 billion U.S. dollars.    Since 1991, when China began to issue B shares to overseas  securities investors, 30 types of B-share stocks have been  listed on the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, pooling  more than one billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds.    Meanwhile, a number of state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises have listed their stocks on the Hong Kong Stock  Exchange.    In addition, Chinese enterprises succeeded in issuing bonds  in Tokyo, London, Frankfurt, Singapore, Luxembourg and the  United States last year.    Beginning April 1 this year, a nationwide unified interbank  foreign currency transaction system will be adopted to make it  more convenient for currency sellers and buyers to conduct their  business.    Song said that during the past few years China's economy has  been growing at a high speed and the country is opening wider to  the outside world. As a result, China has become a major  participant in international trade. All these factors will  further promote China's foreign currency business, Song said.</p>

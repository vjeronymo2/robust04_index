			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Austria votes decisively to join Union Austrians yesterday gave the European Union its first big vote of confidence in several years, with 66.4 per cent voting in a national referendum in favour of joining the Union. The turnout for the referendum, 81 per cent, was equally impressive and by late afternoon crowds waving EU flags gathered at the main party headquarters in Vienna and at the federal chancellery shouting: 'We are the champions'. Mr Alois Mock, the Austrian foreign minister, said: 'It proves that Austrians are determined to play their part in building the new Europe.' The wide margin of victory was also a boost for pro-EU forces in Norway, Sweden and Finland where EU entry referendums are due in the autumn. The Austrian vote comes before party congresses on the EU in the three countries and a parliamentary no-confidence vote on Wednesday in Finland. Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, welcomed Austria's decision as 'an important signal' to Swedes. Only in Finland is the Yes campaign leading the race in the opinion polls. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's premier, facing a No campaign with over 50 per cent support in the polls, said Austrian entry strengthened the bridge-building between western and eastern Europe. Austria's official entry will be on January 1 1995. Scare campaign, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

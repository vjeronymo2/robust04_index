			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Akzo argues that the Department properly excluded sales of scrap from its preliminary determination because the quantities sold in the United States were small and there were no similar sales of scrap in the comparison third country markets. Additionally, Akzo asserts that exclusion of scrap sales is consistent with the treatment of non-prime material in the recent carbon flat steel cases, where the Department disregarded sales of second quality merchandise in the U.S. market where there were no similar sales in the home market and they constituted an insignificant portion (less than five percent) of the respondent's total U.S. sales, (Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled and Certain Cold-Rolled Steel from the Netherlands, 58 FR 37199, 37201 (July 9, 1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Akzo further argues that petitioner's reliance on the product designations on the invoices is misplaced because scrap is generated as part of the beaming ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  repacking) process in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with Akzo. The volume of scrap sales is insignificant and there are no comparable third country sales. Therefore, we have continued to exclude these sales from our calculations. In addition, at verification we verified that most of the scrap is tailings generated by the U.S. repacking operation and that, invoice descriptions notwithstanding, the product is sold as waste and the customer has no recourse to quality claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner argues that we should not exclude certain (G&amp;A) expenses incurred by Akzo America, Inc. in the calculation of indirect selling expenses for purposes of the ESP deduction from U.S. price. Petitioner further argues that it is long-standing Department practice to consider G&amp;A expenses incurred by the U.S. selling arms of a foreign producer to be indirect ``selling expenses'' for purposes of this deduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Akzo argues that it has captured all expenses of the selling affiliate, Akzo Fibers, in its calculation of indirect selling expenses. In addition, Akzo asserts that it has captured all selling-related expenses which were allocated to the aramid fiber business unit of Akzo Fibers by Akzo America. Akzo contends that all remaining G&amp;A expenses carried on the books of Akzo America are not associated with the selling function at Akzo Fibers and therefore are properly not included in the calculation of U.S. indirect selling expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioner. Akzo America is the parent company that provides administrative, accounting and finance services for all of Akzo's North American subsidiaries. In addition, there is no evidence that it provides any services for Akzo N.V. (its parent company in the Netherlands) other than to facilitate the activities of the subsidiaries in the United States. Therefore, all expenses incurred by Akzo America, including those classified on its books as G&amp;A, are indirectly related to the selling activities of the subsidiaries. Consequently, we have included in the calculation of U.S. indirect selling expenses the amount of Akzo America's G&amp;A expenses which have been allocated to the aramid fibers business unit of Akzo Fibers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner argues that certain other G&amp;A expenses listed on the June 1993 financial statement of Akzo America have not been allocated to any of the North American subsidiaries and that the representative portion attributable to the aramid fiber business unit should be included in the calculation of indirect selling expenses for purposes of the ESP deduction from U.S. price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Akzo argues that these G&amp;A costs are the same G&amp;A expenses which are the subject of Comment 6 above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioner that the G&amp;A expenses of Akzo America should be included in the calculation of indirect selling expenses for purposes of the ESP deduction from U.S. price (see comment 6). However, we agree with Akzo that these G&amp;A costs are the same G&amp;A expenses which are the subject of Comment 6 (see memorandum to the file, dated April 22, 1994). Therefore, no additional increase to U.S. indirect selling expenses is necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 8:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner argues that in calculating the Dutch portion of U.S. inventory carrying costs, the Department should use the short-term borrowing rate of Arami ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the actual producer and seller of the subject merchandise), rather than the rate of Akzo N.V., the parent company. Petitioner asserts that Arami's borrowing rate is appropriate because Arami is the company which actually financed the inventory and is a separate corporate entity from Akzo N.V. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Akzo argues that Akzo N.V.'s short-term borrowing rate should be used in calculating the Dutch portion of the inventory carrying cost for the same reasons it argues that Akzo N.V. and Arami should be consolidated for determining a financial expense ratio for CV and COP. (See the discussion below at Comment 11). Respondent also argues, in the event that the Department decides not to collapse the two companies and uses Arami's short-term borrowing rate in calculating U.S. inventory carrying cost, that the Department should also use Arami's short-term borrowing rate in the calculation of inventory carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on sales made in Japan and Germany and in the calculation of German credit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in our response to Comment 11 below, we have determined that it is not appropriate to collapse Arami and Akzo N.V. Therefore, we agree with petitioner and have used the short-term borrowing rate of Arami in calculating the inventory carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on U.S., German and Japanese sales. We have also applied Arami's rate in the calculation of German credit expense, as suggested by Akzo. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 9:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner argues that Akzo's U.S. customs duty calculation may be incorrect because there are discrepancies between the list of customs entries for subject merchandise entering Akzo's warehouses in the United States during the POI and the list of all shipments to the United States provided by Akzo in connection with the critical circumstances allegation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Akzo argues that petitioner has erroneously assumed that the entries included in the two lists should correspond exactly. In fact, respondent argues, the list of shipments includes additional entries that did not enter Akzo's warehouse but were transferred directly to U.S. customers, entries made after the POI, and invoices that were cancelled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

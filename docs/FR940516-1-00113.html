			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> R. Absence of Averaging, Banking, and Trading Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is not proposing an averaging, banking, and trading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program (ABT) for small SI engines at this time. ABT programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which EPA uses in its on-highway heavy-duty engine program and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for the nonroad large CI engine program, provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers flexibility in meeting the emission standards. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is increasingly using market-based incentive programs such as ABT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because such programs can reduce the cost of controlling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. An ABT trading program can also reduce the burden of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation on small manufacturers by providing them flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in meeting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, EPA has not been able to construct an ABT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, given the uncertainties surrounding projected in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission levels. These uncertainties will be resolved as part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Phase 2 regulatory negotiations. However, as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of approving an ABT program, EPA must know the in-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use emission characteristics of engine families in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement an ABT standard, unless all engine families deteriorate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the same rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lifetime emissions of engine families must be averaged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together in order to compute the average emission level of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's product line. Use of lifetime emissions is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary because it may be the case that the emissions of one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of engine deteriorate at a higher rate than another type, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a smaller engine may deteriorate at a higher rate than a larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine of the same type. EPA is not in a position to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what the in-use emission level is presently or would be under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this Phase 1 regulation. EPA's initial assessment is that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of these engines deteriorate somewhat over time and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely deteriorate at different rates between engine families,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but more research is necessary. However, even if engine families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deteriorate at different rates, if such deterioration is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systematically biased, it may not undermine the validity of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ABT program. EPA requests comment on this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase 2 will directly assess in-use emission characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of engine families and incorporate enforcement of in-use emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels. Once in-use emission levels are known with more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidence, EPA expects that market-based programs such as ABT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be viewed favorably by the regulatory negotiation committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during policy development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on the absence of an ABT program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> S. Engine Manufacturer Requirement_Disclosure of Maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exhaust Pressure and Minimum Inlet Pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The design of the exhaust system can influence emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most small engines are supplied with both an air inlet system and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an exhaust system which are tested as part of the engine package,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the entire package is used by the equipment manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, some engines are designed to be installed in a chassis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with more complex packaging requirements where the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer may supply and/or install the exhaust system, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of it, and even the air inlet system. In these latter cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is considering a requirement that the engine manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would need to specify to the equipment manufacturer the maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust pressure and the minimum inlet pressure, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment manufacturer would be required to adhere to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications. EPA requests both engine and equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer comments regarding this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> T. Direct Health Effects of Air Toxics and CO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the concern of the role of HC and CO in ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and CO nonattainment, EPA is concerned about direct health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of air toxics and CO exposure. The concentrations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct health effects of toxic pollutants in exhaust are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially important because the operator of a small SI engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application is typically near the equipment as it functions. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some applications, the operator must be adjacent to the exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlet and is in the direct path of the exhaust as it leaves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine. See ``VI. Environmental Benefit Assessment'' for further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of this issue. The Agency requests additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on the effects of air toxics and CO exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the use of small SI engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> U. Catalyst Durability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Relative to all other types of emission-related engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components, catalysts are unique in that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Relatively small changes in chemical and/or physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of a catalyst can result in very large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleterious changes in operational characteristics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The engine manufacturer is not likely to be involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the design or fabrication of the catalysts nor be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify the acceptability of vendor-supplied catalysts by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of the simple checks and tests that are adequate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other engine components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The satisfactory operational durability of catalysts are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much more dependent on the catalyst manufacturer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proprietary techniques and processes than is the case with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other emission control system components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Since it is the last component in the emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, a catalyst can compensate for sub-standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performances by other emission control components, but it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not itself supported by any other back-up component that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to compensate for a reduction in catalyst performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Substantial reductions in performance can result from: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Abrasion or fracturing as a result of relative motion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the catalyst and its protective outer metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jacket,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Poisoning as a result of fuel contaminants (such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Glazing as a result of excessive quantities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lubricating oil in the exhaust, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Thermal degradation as a result of exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excessively high temperatures for prolonged periods. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Catalytic converters designed for small SI engines in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short term will be low efficiency catalysts to address safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns. The catalysts designed for potential Phase 1 use would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have conversion efficiencies on the order of approximately 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent for HC and CO emission. The design constraint that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dictates these low efficiencies is the need to limit the increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in exhaust temperatures, since the exhaust is in close proximity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the operator in handheld equipment. Efficiencies much higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 30 percent begin to generate exotherms that can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially increase exhaust temperatures. Since the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has not yet developed the necessary solutions, such as creative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small-scale insulation approaches, to control the added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature, only low efficiency catalysts would be available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase 1 use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Brideshead revisited - this time on stage EVELYN WAUGH (1903-66) wrote Brideshead Revisited in 1945. In a stage premiere by the Snap Theatre Company at the Swan Theatre, Worcester, it seems more serious than itself, much more like Eliot's The Cocktail Party (1950) or Rodney Ackland's The Dark River (1941). The play sets out to be a corrective to the nectared nostalgia of Granada's lavish 1980 TV series. However, the familiar characters, or rather ciphers, have still not shaken off the Granada heritage. The Swan production, adapted by Roger Parsley and directed by Andy Graham (who appeared in the TV Brideshead), still owes much in tone to Granada. What Waugh wrote in the 1959 preface to Brideshead speaks for the history of the book and its representations: 'a gluttony for the splendours of the recent past'  - Granada revisited. The story of Charles Ryder's obsession with the Marchmain family and in particular Sebastian Flyte and his sister Julia is overlaid with Catholic excess and guilt. Julia says: 'The worse I am, the more I need God.' These three are the most perplexed and engaging characters; around them a cast of 1920s academics, socialites and aristocrats hovers like gnats over Christ Church meadow. Anyone who crossed Waugh's path was immediately made into a figure of absurdity and ridicule. The persistent Oxford context (the House, Old Tom, Mercury) gives the novel and the play a Zuleika Dobson feel, but the action stays clear. The rest is Aloysius the teddy bear, plovers' eggs and Moet. The adaptation crams Waugh's text into 34 scenes. Ryder's memories are spread out laterally on the stage, a living portrait of a dying family. The here-and-now of Ryder's 1943 army billet contrasts perfectly with the blue remembered hills of early adulthood. The action does move elegantly between scenes, but Lady Marchmain appears to have strayed in from Ambridge, constantly 'having a word' or 'wanting a chat.' And it was brave to abandon Waugh's haunting last line spoken by an adjutant to Ryder as the troops settle into the billet, 'You're looking unusually cheerful today.' The cast of seven plus teddy play 15 of the more memorable characters in the novel, as well as some minor ones. The acting is everywhere tactful and thoughtful, with particularly versatile performances from Barney Long (as Samgrass, Sebastian's academic minder, and Lord Marchmain) and Brian Orrell (as Boy Mulcaster and Brideshead). The principals, Andrew Loudon as Charles and David Willoughby as Sebastian flirt with the sexual relationship hinted at in Waugh. Lisa Turner as a sexy, troubled Julia is excellent. The Swan Theatre, Worcester (0905 27322) until May 8</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SOCIAL' SOLUTION FOR HOUSING  </P> <P> In response to Chester Hartman's column "U.S. Housing Needs 'Social' Solution,"  Op-Ed Page, Oct. 6:  </P> <P> Hartman's "social" solution to the nation's housing problem is exactly that,  "socialism."  </P> <P> Both he and our local politicians are under the same delusion that somehow more  welfare and more regulation will result in decent, affordable housing.  </P> <P> Excess profits breed competition. That is what built this country, including  its housing, and gave our people the highest standard of living in the world.  There were times, before rent control, when landlords competed against each  other in providing services and amenities, and tenants had their pick of  affordable housing.  </P> <P> It has been said that welfare is like drugs, at first pleasant, then  habit-forming and ultimately destructive. Welfare robs people of their  self-respect and gives them a disincentive to find work.  </P> <P> Excessive regulation, especially rent control, has the opposite of its intended  effect. It discourages investment in new multifamily housing, thereby reducing  the supply and forcing up rents for everyone. As a result, low-income families  are outbid for existing housing that would otherwise be within their reach.  </P> <P> The for-profit system has not failed, it is being destroyed by well-meaning  socialists.  </P> <P> ROBERT GANS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

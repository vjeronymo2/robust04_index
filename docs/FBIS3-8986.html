			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] One day after taking over the post of UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] commander in former Yugoslavia, French General  Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville de Lapresle visited Sarajevo  where he discussed -- as he said -- the future with Presidency  member Ejup Ganic and General Rasim Delic. He also discussed  the issue of Sarajevo with Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic.  Senada Cumurovic reports.    [Cumurovic] After talks with General de Lapresle, Ejup Ganic  told journalists what was discussed at the one-hour meeting.    [Begin Ganic recording] We informed him that the agreement,  the cease-fire, and the disengagement of our Army and the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] forces is functioning in the best  possible way, and that conditions are ripening for the Bosniaks  and the Croats to return to their homes. The situation is  returning to normal in that part of our state. (?At the same  time) we pointed out the grave situation in Maglaj where the  Serbian aggressor continues to pursue his military aims, and the  grave situation in Bihac. Moreover, we pointed to certain  events [words indistinct] of Serbian troops in the occupied  territories. [end recording]    [Cumurovic] As far as the possible negotiations with the  Serbian side are concerned, Dr. Ganic mentioned two conditions  for these negotiations.    [Begin Ganic recording] We are ready to begin negotiations  with the Serbian side immediately, providing that they speed up  the withdrawal from territories where the Bosniaks were the  majority population before the aggression and providing that the  international community speeds up the proceedings against war  criminals. [end recording]    [Cumurovic] The demilitarization of Sarajevo was also  discussed with the UNPROFOR commander for former Yugoslavia.    [Begin Ganic recording] We informed the general that we  agree to the demilitarization of Sarajevo, which is still under  blockade, the roads are still blocked, providing that all  citizens (?can return to their) homes. [Words indistinct]  toward normalization, return of trust, and, of course, the  further development of Sarajevo as an undivided city, a single  city. [end recording]    [Cumurovic] General Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville de  Lapresle, who yesterday morning took over command, came to visit  Sarajevo today, because he believes -- as he said in his  statement -- that there are many reasons that make it important  for him to be here.    [Begin Lapresle recording in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] I would say that I have come here  so that I could put my professional abilities at the disposal  [words indistinct] and help with establishing peace in this  country which has suffered so much, and in which I and my troops  wish to be of service by working in accordance with political  negotiations and aims that would satisfy all the sides in the  conflict.

At a provincial meeting on planning  work, provincial party Secretary Lu Rongjing made the above  remark while hearing reports given by responsible comrades from  the provincial planning committee. Wang Yang, member of the  Standing Committee of the provincial party committee and vice  governor, also gave a speech at the meeting.    Lu Rongjing pointed out: As a result of microeconomic  regulation and control, our province realized sustained, rapid,  and healthy development in its economic and social undertakings  this year. Not only did cadres at all levels and the broad  masses of people understand and support these undertakings, but  the CPC Central Committee and the State Council also fully  endorsed our achievements. Planning committees at all levels  had a lot to do with these achievements.    In speaking on planning committees' work next year, Lu  Rongjing called for integrating the CPC Central Committee's  guidelines with Anhui's actual situation in three areas. He  said: First, we should study the new environment and the new  situation, be in control of the intangible but dynamic changes  of the market environment, make good forecasts, and continue to  improve Anhui's microeconomic regulation and control to promote  our province's economic development, especially development in  agriculture and village and town enterprises. Second, we must  pay closer attention to the key projects in our province so as  to expand the chances for Anhui's economic development. Third,  planning committees themselves must become more successful to  accommodate the new situation.    Lu Rongjing said emphatically: The basic way to solve  Anhui's problems in economic development lies in reform. The  reform measures to be launched by the CPC Central Committee will  involve all quarters. In addition to the reform of the planning  system, all other reforms are related to planning committees.  While quickening the pace of reform, we must advance firmly and  steadily to make substantial progress and ensure the smooth  launching of all supplementary reform measures.    While holding discussions with planning committee directors  at the prefecture, city, and county levels and with leading  cadres of major enterprises, Wang Yang pointed out: While  enforcing the central authorities' microeconomic regulation and  control, we have further defined local authorities'  responsibilities by delimiting their rights, responsibilities,  and benefits. Because of this, local authorities have in a way  become more capable of regulating the economy, and this will  help central and local authorities to bring their initiative  into play. Planning committees must work hard to solve problems  -- problems which have arisen in development -- through reform  and must bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development in Anhui.    Wang Yang urged planning committees in our province to  intensify their reform of the systems governing investment and  interbanking loans, and to blaze a new trail in the rapid  raising of capital. We should first draw up regulations,  properly divide up responsibilities, and define powers for  managing investment for infrastructure, competitive projects,  and public welfare services. We should start this work next year  and perfect the regulations when we do the job. After the  investment system has been reformed, we should do everything  possible to open more channels for raising capital. We should  also manage well state-owned fixed assets, better manage the  inventories of enterprises which are in better shape, and save a  group of enterprises which is in distress.</p>

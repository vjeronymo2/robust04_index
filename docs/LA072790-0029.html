			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A SOLID CASE;  </P> <P> FILM: 'PRESUMED INNOCENT' BRILLIANTLY CAPTURES THE NOVEL'S ESSENCE, AND  FEATURES A TOUR DE FORCE PERFORMANCE FROM HARRISON FORD.  </P> <P> Intelligent, complex and enthralling, "Presumed Innocent" (citywide) is one of  those rare films where all the players seem to be in a state of grace, where  the working of the machinery never shows and after it's over, one runs and  reruns its intricacies with a profound sense of satisfaction.  </P> <P> In his original novel, Scott Turow, a prosecuting attorney himself, worked from  a fascinating hypothesis: Rusty Sabich (Harrison Ford), a respected Midwestern  prosecuting attorney, a man solidly wedded to the law and its principles,  suddenly gets a reverse view of its workings when he becomes a suspect in the  lurid sex murder of a colleague with whom he had had a torrid affair.  </P> <P> Turow's fans will be pleased to know that Frank Pierson and the film's  director, Alan J. Pakula, have made an uncommonly sensitive adaptation of  what's been called a bullet train of a book. Their changes in Turow's vividly  detailed novel are smart; if in the process interesting but non-essential  characters have been erased, if a certain depth has been stripped from a  central character and an endangered marriage has been set on its feet again,  this is, after all, the idealized world of movies. Streamlining  notwithstanding, the book's essence remains intact.  </P> <P> Surely, no reader is going to quibble that the novel's coolly ambitious  prosecutor Carolyn Polhemus has dropped a dozen or so years and a teen-age son  to become Greta Scacchi -- not when that actress' measured glance and  apricot-colored skin could spark lust from granite. Scacchi's time onscreen is  relatively brief but Gordon Willis, the film's great cinematographer, has  summed up her impact in one ravishingly beautiful shot. As Carolyn gazes  steadily at the camera, the look Willis catches is unguarded, unambiguous lust,  a tool she wields with intensity -- and ambition -- enough to cause shock waves  in even a marriage as seemingly secure as the Sabiches'.  </P> <P> "Presumed Innocent" looks properly rich and Midwestern, one wouldn't be wrong  to take its hypothetical Kindle County for Illinois' once famously corrupt Cook  County, where author Turow has practiced law. Its extremes are summed up for us  succinctly: the linen-wallpapered suites of the high-end lawyers and the  crowded prosecutors' digs with all the charm of a welfare office; the suave  intelligence of Raul Julia's defense attorney Alejandro "Sandy" Stern, and the  too-sharp tailoring and ferrety air of Joe Grifasi's Tommy Molto, out to nail  Sabich.  </P> <P> The film's best actors are a formidable lot; Paul Winfield, whose complex  judge, Larren Lyttle, is invested with a rumbling humor as well as power; John  Spencer's quintessential detective, Lipranzer, that "scholar of the underlife,"  and Bonnie Bedelia's, deeply sensitive work as Barbara Sabich, the wife  painfully damaged by her husband's infidelity.  </P> <P> Coroner "Painless" Kumagai becomes unforgettable at the hands of Sab Shimono,  and Brian Dennehy is Sabich's longtime boss, whose every maneuver has a  far-reaching political meaning. (With all the film's technical perfection,  however, it's unclear why Dennehy seems to have spray-on spot lifter whitening  his hair.)  </P> <P> In what is almost his signature feat ("All the President's Men," "Sophie's  Choice"), director Pakula has kept his cast of bravura actors in miraculous  balance; none of them is allowed to pull the fabric of the whole out of shape.  There is one performance so self-effacing, however, that it may get overlooked  among all the high-wire acts: Ford's Rusty Sabich.  </P> <P> Builders would recognize Ford's role for what it is, a bearing beam of a part;  one which every other character in the film builds on. Yet -- after his  roller-coaster affair with Scacchi is launched -- most of Ford's time is spent  reacting. He must react in the courtroom; react to the story's shocks and  surprises and, in the film's crucial scene, his unspoken reaction tells us more  clearly than dialogue what Sabich lives by, his guilts, his doubts and his  loyalties.  </P> <P> Ford conveys this with the sort of deceptive economy that was part of Henry  Fonda's sleight of hand. In fact, more than any other home-grown actor, Ford  seems the logical choice to take over Fonda's niche as the decent American,  which makes the dimensions of his moral anguish here all the more fascinating.  If there are moviegoers who still think that Harrison Ford is most himself in  an action role, "Presumed Innocent" (rated R for its nudity, sexuality and  language) should go a long way toward clearing up that misconception.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, the purple bankclimber was found at 14 sites in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Flint River system; 3 sites on the Chipola River mainstem (Dead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lake vicinity); 2 sites on the Apalachicola River mainstem; the type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locality on the Chattahoochee River; and at 4 sites along the lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-thirds of the Ochlockonee River mainstem in Florida and Georgia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Clench and Turner 1956, Butler 1993). A total of 24 historic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites are known for this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This large mussel persists at 10 sites in the lower two-thirds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Flint River mainstem, at 4 sites in the Apalachicola River,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and at 8 sites in the Ochlockonee River mostly above Talquin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reservoir (Butler 1993). Although the purple bankclimber is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently known from only two fewer total sites than before, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species has nevertheless experienced a significant reduction in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total range. No specimens in recent years have been reported from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Chipola River and the species has not been collected in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chattahoochee River for several decades. In addition, Flint River  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tributary populations appear to have been totally eliminated. At a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> few sites in the Florida portion of the Ochlockonee River, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purple bankclimber may number in the dozens of individuals. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species of mussel does not tolerate impoundment conditions well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 18, 1993, the Service notified (by mail; 72  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letters) Federal and State agencies, local governments, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested individuals that a status review was being conducted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these seven species. A total of ten comments was received as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of this notification. The Florida Division Office of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Highway Administration replied that no bridge replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects were currently being planned in northwest Florida, and it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was anticipated that any future bridge replacement projects would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have no effect on these species based on the localized and short-term impacts associated with these activities. The Federal Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Commission reported that it licenses 12 hydroelectric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development projects in the study area, and that any issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning these species could best be coordinated with the Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Hydropower Licensing. The Fayette County (Georgia) Board of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commissioners expressed concern over the Service's contention that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundments have played a major role in the decline of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species, but they did not oppose the listing. The Alachua County  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Florida) Environmental Protection Department, after consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a Florida Museum of Natural History malacologist, indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that none of these seven species of mussels are known or were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspected to occur in Alachua county. The Florida Game and Fresh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water Fish Commission expressed concern with how its plan to dredge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mouths of several silted-in streams along the Apalachicola River  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to improve access to striped bass might have on these mussels. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GDNR) had some questions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the distribution of these mussels, particularly in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Georgia. The Florida Natural Areas Inventory supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service's listing of these species and provided information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Econfina Creek watershed where the Gulf moccasinshell and oval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigtoe occur. Three experts on freshwater mussels supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential Federal protection of these species. No objections to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed listing of these species were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purple bankclimber, oval pigtoe, shiny-rayed pocketbook,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fat three-ridge are included as category 2 species in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service's notices of review for animal candidates that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). A category 2 species is one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may be in need of listing as endangered or threatened, but for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently available to support a proposed rule. Based on status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys that were completed in 1993, the Service has determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all of the species included in this proposal now qualify as category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

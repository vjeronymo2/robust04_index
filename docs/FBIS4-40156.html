			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Ivanov under the general heading: "DPRK </F> Leaves International Atomic Energy Agency Under Wise Leadership  of Kim Il-song. In Preparation for World War III"]    [Text] New York -- Pentagon Chief William Perry made a  gloomy forecast in the middle of April this year as he was  touring South Korea: The DPRK "will be able in a few weeks to  develop at least four atomic bombs" with all the attendant  consequences.    A month later CIA analysts concluded that as of early June  Pyongyang would have between one and two atomic bombs.    In a recent brief interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Thomas  Hubbard, deputy assistant U.S. secretary of state for Asian  affairs, said that North Korea "has stockpiled enough plutonium  to develop at least one nuclear device, and this process is  proceeding fairly rapidly."    Washington's concern at the state of affairs on the Korean  peninsula is still growing. The nuclear reactor in the Korean  village of Yongbyon, which was to act as a plant for the  development of "a deterrent weapon," was unloaded very rapidly.  It had been thought that it would take the DPRK several months  to remove 8,000 radioactive fuel rods from the reactor given  that it had just one transporter.    Today the situation is extremely delicate. On the one hand,  Pyongyang is clearly resisting U.S. pressure. On the other, a  permanent member of the UN Security Council -- China -- may not  respond appropriately to pressure from Washington.    "Mr. Hubbard, under these conditions does it look as though  Russia's idea of holding an international conference on Korea is  the only way of settling the problem?" I asked the U.S. State  Department representative.    "Needless to say, this suggestion cannot be entirely ruled  out today. But, believe you me, there is no time to be lost."</p>

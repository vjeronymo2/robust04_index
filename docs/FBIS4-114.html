			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Greg Arde] </F>   [Text] Ulundi April 1 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Friday [1 April] he held  out hope for next week's planned summit with State President F W  de Klerk, African National Congress President Nelson Mandela and  Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. In an interview outside a small  rural church near the kwaZulu capital Ulundi, where he attended  a Good Friday service, the IFP president said if the summit went  ahead it would take place in a "sour atmosphere", following  Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu.    There was uncertainty after the declaration whether the  meeting would go ahead but Mr Buthelezi indicated it appeared to  be on and said he held out hope "otherwise I wouldn't be going".  However, threats by Mr Mandela to confine the kwaZulu Police to  barracks and Mr de Klerk's "appalling and shameful" decision to  declare an emergency were not conducive to good negotiations, he  said.    The summit was to have taken place last week, but King  Zwelithini pulled out because of the killing of his subjects in  Johannesburg on Monday.    Mr Buthelezi said on Friday he had begun to doubt the state  president's integrity. While commending Mr de Klerk for his  reforms, he said "the extent to which he has capitulated to the  ANC worries me". "I've begun to question his integrity. He's  disappointed me." Mr de Klerk was supposed to make a decision  on an emergency from security information but instead he had  been compelled to do so by the Transitional Executive Council  [TEC], charged the IFP leader. "For TEC, you must read ANC."    Mr Buthelezi alleged Mr de Klerk was handling the situation  unfairly, because he had said nothing about the ANC's hidden  arms caches but was worried about Zulu traditional weapons. Mr  Buthelezi repeated that it was "not normal" for elections to be  held under a state of emergency. The IFP leader, who is also  kwaZulu's chief minister, expressed despair at the turmoil  engulfing South Africa, saying the country was experiencing the  "worst of the worst". "I can't prophesise what will happen, but  what's worse than what's already happening?"    Mr Buthelezi said it was difficult to say what might happen  if a settlement was not reached to accommodate him and his  supporters. But, he would continue to act as before: "For  decades I've been practising resistance politics, by that I  don't mean taking up arms...but people on the ground are very  angry. I don't want to speculate or predict how their anger  will be expressed on the ground."</p>

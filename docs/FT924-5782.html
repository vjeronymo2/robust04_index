			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Girls catch up in maths results BOYS have only a slight edge over girls in maths performance at GCSE, while girls have a significant lead in English, a report said yesterday, Andrew Adonis writes. Historically, boys have outperformed girls at maths by a large margin, but an analysis of this year's GCSE results shows that boys gained only 3 per cent more higher grades (A to C) than girls, while girls gained 14 per cent more higher grades in English than boys. The report says the relative performance of the sexes in maths is attributable partly to 'the tendency for a higher proportion of girls than boys to be entered for the safer intermediate examination papers rather than the more challenging papers which lead to the top grades'. The report was based on research carried out by the University of London for the School Examinations and Assessment Council, a government advisory body.</p>

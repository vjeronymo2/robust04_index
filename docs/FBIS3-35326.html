			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan today  visited the second Hashemite exhibition on the reconstruction of  the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, an exhibition on  the reconstruction of the mosques named after the prophet's  companions, and an exhibition on the achievements of the  Ministry of Awqaf, Islamic Affairs and Holy Places being held at  the exhibition hall in the Martyr King 'Abdallah Mosque. The  details follow:    His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan has expressed his  happiness with the near completion of the second phase of the  reconstruction of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock,  which demonstrates further interest in improving the Arab and  Islamic image in Jerusalem. His highness said that the  maintenance and reconstruction of the sacred Islamic places are  aimed at supporting the Arab Islamic identity in the holy land  because this is a sacred matter and an inevitable duty.    His highness said that the completion of the maintenance and  reconstruction work for the Islamic places in Jerusalem will  have moral significance, especially during these days of the  blessed month of Ramadan because good work is rated above all  other considerations.    Answering a question by the Saudi Press Agency correspondent  in Amman on his highness' feelings regarding the initiative of  the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, concerning the collection of popular  donations from all Saudi regions for reconstructing and saving  the Islamic shrines in Jerusalem, his highness said: The  decision by the custodian of the two holy mosques to support the  Islamic shrines in Jerusalem, which is the first of the two  qiblahs [direction to which a Muslim turns during his prayers]  and the third holiest shrine, is a good decision and a lofty  tradition, especially when it comes during the blessed month of  Ramadan.    His highness added: The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, led by  His Majesty King Husayn, views this decision by Saudi Arabia  with respect and appreciation because it contributes to  supporting and strengthening the Arab nature of Jerusalem and  protecting the Islamic shrines in it, a policy which  Jordan--king, government, and people--has always sought to  continue and promote through coordination and cooperation with  all the Arab brothers. He asserted that this step by the Saudi  brothers clearly contributes to realizing Arab solidarity. It  is a continuation of the previous steps and stands of the  custodian of the two holy mosques and the Saudi brothers toward  the Islamic shrines in holy Jerusalem.    His highness said: Moreover, the Saudi steps can also be  understood within the framework of promoting the Islamic appeal  by His Majesty King Husayn concerning the religious authority  [al-wilayah al-diniyah] in holy Jerusalem, an authority which  recognizes only the moral sovereignty of God the Almighty, a  sovereignty that takes into account the rights of the Muslims to  express their historical and religious gains and to exercise  their rights inside their city. He called on Arabs and Muslims  to take the necessary measures to realize this religious  authority and sovereignty over holy Jerusalem and the Islamic  shrines.    His highness expressed his thanks and appreciation for the  initiative of the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, in this blessed month and said: I can see  that this initiative demonstrates an absolute interest by Saudi  Arabia--king, government, and people--in the human contribution  for the good of holy Jerusalem.

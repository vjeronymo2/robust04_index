			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: Africa: frustrating, but worth it - Practical Traveller: Nicholas Woodsworth says commonsense precautions can minimise health risks - from viruses to dodgy food and water - and offers suggestions for coping with the uncertainties and frustrations of travel in Africa A CENTURY ago African travel was no holiday. Look at David Livingstone. He left for Africa in perfectly good health on a perfectly innocent venture - a search for the source of the Nile. He returned to England a sun-blackened mummy wrapped in a roll of bark, his heart and entrails left behind in a tin box buried under a mango tree. Holiday and business travel in black Africa is not so rigorous these days. You can find good French cooking on the deepest backwaters of the Okavango swamps, CNN satellite TV in the most pestilential of west African cities, gleaming medical clinics just a hop from prancing herds of wildebeest. But such facilities are found only in enclaves where expatriates congregate. For the most part, the continent remains what it has always been, a place of uncertain and sometimes hazardous travel. Successful African travel depends on arrangements that take these uncertainties into account. The easiest way, of course, is to let specialist operators undertake travel and holiday arrangements for you. But not even an entire legion of tour reps from Abercrombie &amp; Kent can keep you from a sticky end if you stray too far from the rules of common sense. Avoid, for example, travelling in ostentatious style. In a continent of sometimes desperate need, expensive baggage and jewellery, conspicuous clothing or a neck slung with cameras is an unnecessary provocation. Being in a large modern city is no protection; most African crime is urban crime. Baggage, in fact, is best cut to a minimum. If you can travel with a small frameless bag rather than a full-size suitcase, chances are you will be able to keep it in the bus rather than on top of the bus, in the aircraft rather than the cargo hold. The less time it is in other people's hands, the less chance it has of becoming 'lost'. And do you really need mountains of luggage? The Africa editor of this paper claims that the entire continent can be taken in wearing either a lightweight suit or simple cotton trousers, shirt and a pair of running shoes. There are certain things, though, that he would never be without: a torch and batteries, not only for the bush, but for city hotel rooms during inevitable power cuts; a teaspoon and penknife for papayas and avocados bought from market stalls; a pair of high-quality sunglasses dark enough to cope with harsh African light; a wad of Dollars 1 bills, honored everywhere for tips, taxis and small emergencies; a short-wave radio and reading material to relieve waits and delays; and lastly, an adequate supply of Lomotil to relieve diarrhoea. Medical and hygiene precautions, in fact, are among the most important you can take in Africa. The key points such as food, malaria and Aids, are covered in the article above. Do not expect Africa to be cheap simply because it is poor. Air travel within Africa is among the most expensive in the world. Count on paying international prices in top hotels, but do not count on international management standards; if hairs on unchanged pillow-slips are common in African-run establishments, they are not unknown in Sheratons, Meridiens or Inter-Continentals. The most important items you can bring to Africa are time and patience. Train, bus and even aircraft departure times often have nothing to do with printed schedules. Leave plenty of margin for error and keep a flexible timetable. If things do go wrong, keep cool. A wake-up call missed, a worn tyre burst, a visa refused, a petty official over-indulgent in the exercise of power - these and 1,000 other irritations lie in wait to test the African traveller's mettle. Lose your temper, puff yourself up, and start threatening the wrath of your consul, and you are lost: you may not return home a wizened mummy, but you will have foregone some of the pleasures to be garnered from an often frustrating continent.

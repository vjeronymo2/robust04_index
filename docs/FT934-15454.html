			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Westland in Pounds 250m Hercules parts deal WESTLAND, the British helicopter manufacturer, has received a significant boost to its non-helicopter business with a Pounds 250m order to supply parts for C-130 Hercules transport aircraft made by Lockheed of the US. The deal to supply nacelles to house the aircraft's four turboprop engines could eventually be worth Pounds 1bn to the UK company. The initial contract, starting in 1995, will cover the next 180 Hercules sold by Lockheed. Westland will become the sole source of nacelles for the C-130H variant, now in production, and the new C-130J, which Lockheed hopes to sell to the UK and other countries as a replacement for existing Hercules fleets. Westland said sales of 700 were expected for the new model. The deal covers product support and upgrading business for earlier Hercules variants, involving up to 1,400 aircraft. The contract was won by Westland's aerospace division, based at Cowes on the Isle of Wight, which is predominantly geared to making components for civil airliners. Westland said it would help to offset the impact of recession in the civil aircraft market but was not expected to lead to extra jobs. Although design and assembly would be undertaken at Cowes, much of the work would be contracted out. The C-130 Hercules, first introduced in the 1950s, has held its place as the standard workhorse for most Nato air forces. More than 2,000 are in service with 65 countries worldwide. The new version is favourite to replace the RAF's current Hercules fleet, on which a decision is due next year. British Aerospace, however, is campaigning for the UK to commit itself with six other European nations to a new joint aircraft programme known as Euroflag.</p>

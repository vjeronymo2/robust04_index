			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Alcoa earnings surge to ADollars 199m in opening half ALCOA of Australia, the Australian integrated aluminium producer, has overcome flat demand and recorded a robust earnings performance in the half year ended June. Net earnings rose 45 per cent to ADollars 198.8m (USDollars 133.4m) in the six months on a 2 per cent improvement in revenue to ADollars 1.09bn. The result excluded an abnormal gain of ADollars 59.7m (against nothing previously) reflecting a tax adjustment while capital expenditure was down to ADollars 85.2m from ADollars 120.4m. The company lifted its dividend payout to ADollars 180m from ADollars 120m, most of it going to the two largest shareholders, Aluminum Company of America and Western Mining Corporation. Alcoa said the aluminium division had made a negligible contribution to earnings, and operations remained under review following American Alcoa's recent 25 per cent cut in primary metal output. Tax took ADollars 100.8m and depreciation ADollars 73.4m. Interest expense totalled ADollars 13.0m. High aluminium stocks and low prices have hit the aluminium business worldwide. A large part of the industry's difficulties stem from an upsurge in imports to the west from the former Soviet Union.</p>

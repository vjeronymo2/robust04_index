			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Spending level to govern pre-election tax cuts: A view from the Institute for Fiscal Studies about the chancellor's options in post-1994 Budgets If Mr Kenneth Clarke used his 1995 or 1996 Budget to make pre-election tax cuts, he would be following closely in the footsteps of several of his recent predecessors. Lord Howe's 1983 Budget saw a pre-election increase in the ceiling on mortgage interest relief, Lord Lawson's 1987 Budget cut 2p off the standard rate of income tax, while Mr Norman Lamont, even amid gathering fiscal gloom, found room to cut income tax by around Pounds 2bn by introducing a new 20p tax rate in 1992. But if electoral considerations are at the forefront of the present chancellor's thinking, his scope for implementing substantial tax cuts looks rather limited. One important fact to bear in mind is that the government has yet to finish implementing all of Mr Lamont's tax increases announced in March 1993, to say nothing of the additional tax increases set out by Mr Clarke last November. Chief among the Lamont measures is the increase in the rate of value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent due in April 1995. In addition, both chancellors announced sharp real increases in duties on petrol, and to these Mr Clarke added increases in tobacco duty and further cuts in income-tax allowances. Altogether, these measures represent an additional Pounds 6.5bn of tax increases still to come in April 1995 and another Pounds 2.5bn in April 1996 as the full effects of these measures work through. What evidence is there to suggest that the fiscal (as opposed to political) climate has changed so much since last November that there is now scope for tax reductions? One promising sign is that the out-turn for the public sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94 was about Pounds 4bn lower than had been expected at the time of the November Budget. While some of this was due to one-off factors such as higher local-authority capital receipts, a significant part did reflect slightly better than expected economic performance. A further source of encouragement has been the recent trend in unemployment. By convention, it is assumed that over the planning horizon unemployment will remain unchanged, and the November projections were based on a figure of 2.75mn. This is likely to be an over-estimate for 1994-95, where on present trends unemployment looks likely to average less than 2.5m. Given that each 100,000 off the unemployment register is estimated to save the government about Pounds 350m in social security spending alone, the overall effect of the fall in unemployment could be to add a further Pounds 1bn or so to the chancellor's room for manoeuvre. If the chancellor was perhaps Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn better off than he had anticipated, he could - in principle - either cancel some of the planned tax increases, or go ahead with the announced changes but at the same time cut other taxes. If he went down the first route the most attractive option would probably be to cancel the second stage of the imposition of VAT on fuel. The loss of revenue from this would be more than Pounds 1.5bn, but he could also cancel the second stage of the social security compensation package and reduce the net cost to around Pounds 1bn. As an alternative, the chancellor could attempt to re-establish the Conservatives' tax-cutting credentials by going straight for the most prominent tax rate of all - the standard rate of income tax. The government is in principle still committed to moving towards a standard rate of 20p, and just under Pounds 2bn of the chancellor's spare cash would buy him a standard rate of 24p. The beneficial political effects of such a change might however be somewhat diminished if implemented next April, since the overall package would still represent a net tax increase of about Pounds 4bn. All of this speculation is based on the assumption that the existing public-spending plans will be adhered to. An overshoot on the rather stringent public-sector pay targets would soon change the picture. In the longer term the message is that significant tax cuts will be possible only if there are substantial cuts in public spending. Over the past 15 years this has simply not happened, with spending in 1994-95 accounting for almost exactly the same share of national income as in 1978-79. Unless the economy performs markedly better than expected Mr Clarke will have to wield the knife on spending far more effectively than his predecessors if he is to have any scope for significant pre-election tax cuts.

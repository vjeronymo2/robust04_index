Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs 'Abd-al-'Aziz Dakhil  said that, in its regular session on 23 January, the Cabinet  reviewed a draft bill referred from the National Assembly to  amend the regulation in Law No 51/1959 concerning Kuwaiti  citizenship, aimed at permitting children of naturalized  citizens to vote and run for office on equal footing with  Kuwaitis who obtained Kuwaiti citizenship by birth.    It was decided that the final form of the bill will be  determined in the Cabinet's next meeting, and will be referred  back to the National Assembly for debate and decision.    On another matter, a Kuwaiti security source confirmed to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT on 23 January that a security force had raided  the building of the Palestinian embassy in Kuwait on the evening  of 22 January. He said that was done in accordance with legal  procedures, referring to the fact that the members of this force  were empowered to enter the embassy building on a warrant from  the Public Prosecutor's Office.    The source explained that the decision to enter the  Palestinian embassy building was made by Criminal Investigation  and State Security personnel, after a person accused of  burglarizing several homes in the area confessed that the  weapon, which he had used, had been obtained from the embassy  building located in the Hawalli area.    The same source said that this matter necessitated that the  prosecutor's office issue a warrant to search the building in  the presence of a responsible official from the prosecutor's  office. He said that the authorities had banned newsmen and  photographers from entering the embassy building, which has been  abandoned since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. However, certain  Kuwaiti newspapers reported that machine guns, pistols, and  ammunition had been found in the embassy building and were  confiscated. The remains of a body was also discovered; it was  hanging, supported by one of the walls.</p>

At this meeting, Robaina explained to Vo Tran Chi  that Cuba is immersed in a process of change in which the  people's participation is essential.    Robaina, who is on the last leg of an Asian tour that  included eight Southeast Asian countries, pointed out that Cuba  is making many changes and that there are many still to come.  Robaina said that Cuba wants to learn first-hand from the  experiences of a brother such as Vietnam, to which we are linked  not only by economic ties but by auspicious and frank  traditional ties. He added that Cuba is in a process of recovery  that is dependent on the efforts and work of the Cuban people.  Robaina stressed that what has most caught his attention in  Vietnam is the way the party controls and directs the economic  reforms.    Vo Tran Chi said that there are many spheres in which the  two  countries can hold exchanges with a view to overcoming the  current circumstances. The Cuban delegation will also meet with  local officials and tour sites of economic interest.    Ho Chi Minh City, which has a population of 5 million, is  considered Vietnam's most important commercial hub.</p>

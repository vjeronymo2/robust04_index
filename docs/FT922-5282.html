			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Wealthy nations balk at costs of conservation treaty MANY of the world's wealthier nations have expressed doubts about one of the two main documents to be signed at the Earth Summit, just two days before the gathering is due to begin. President George Bush's announcement on Friday night that the US would not sign the biological diversity treaty - an international treaty to preserve species - has been followed by objections from other states. The disagreement has cast a shadow over preparations for an event whose aims have already been reduced by compromise. Although the US does not think it can stop the signing of the biological diversity treaty in Rio de Janeiro, it apparently hopes that other nations, including Japan and some European Community members, will now be persuaded to take a second look at it. The EC delegation met to assess its position. There was some anger that the US had pulled out so late. Mr David Maclean, the UK environment minister, said yesterday the UK was worried about the treaty's financial aspects and had asked its lawyers to study the text. The concern has prompted 19 industrialised countries to sign a declaration which lays out their reading of a potentially ambiguous clause in the treaty, which they fear could amount to signing a blank cheque. The draft of the treaty says the amount of money rich nations will give to poorer ones to preserve species would be determined by all participating countries. This means that the donor nations could be out-voted by the recipients, and forced to hand over large sums of money. This is particularly sensitive given that the richer countries are resisting the notion that the Earth Summit is mainly about environmental aid for the Third World. But there are wider worries. The treaty defines the right of countries to exploit their species for commercial purposes, such as making medicines out of plants. Industrial countries fear that this would undermine pharmaceutical patent rights. The bio-diversity treaty is one of only two now left for the summit to approve. The other is on climate change. In Washington, meanwhile, the White House sought to take the sting out of environmentalists' criticism of the US stance. Mr William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said President Bush would today announce a US contribution of more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m) a year for a new plan to preserve the world's forests.

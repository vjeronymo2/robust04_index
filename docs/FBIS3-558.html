			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Niamey, 4 Mar (AFP) -- As an implicit reaction to  the demands to self-determination by Tuareg rebels, the Niger  Government today expressed its "determination to safeguard  national unity, territorial integrity and the unitary form of  the state."    In submitting its report to the cabinet meeting, Government  Spokesman Moctar Diallo reiterated the government's  "willingness" to maintain dialogue and called on his fellow  citizens to continue to "examine with serenity" the demands made  by the Coordination of the Armed Resistence [CRA], the leading  organ of the Tuareg rebellion.    Regarding the prospect of the negotiations that are to  resume  at the end of March in Paris, the CRA demanded last month the  right to manage, as autonomous territories, those parts of the  country it is claiming in the north on behalf of the Tuareg  community (10 percent of the population). The CRA also demanded  quotas that would guarantee the representation of Tuaregs within  the government, the National Assembly, and the National Armed  Forces.    This reaction, the first from the government since the  publishing of the demands by the CRA, follows that of the  opposition, which rejected on 2 March "all maneuvers aimed at  dividing the country."    Several associations and trade unions also made their stand  clear against the CRA demands.</p>

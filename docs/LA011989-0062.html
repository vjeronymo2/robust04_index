			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE FACES STERN CCAA ROAD TEST TONIGHT AT BAKERSFIELD  </P> <P> You think negotiating moguls on your last ski run was a true test of athletic  ability?  </P> <P> That's mere child's play compared to navigating the hazards of the floor at the  Bakersfield Civic Auditorium, according to those who try to play basketball on  it.  </P> <P> The difference? You can see moguls.  </P> <P> But dead spots on a basketball floor lurk invisible beneath the surface --  similar to land mines ready to explode.  </P> <P> And when they do? Thud. So much for that fast break.  </P> <P> However, the floor is not the toughest part about playing at Cal State  Bakersfield, which happens to be Cal State Northridge's assignment tonight at  7:30.  </P> <P> "Above all," CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy said, "they are a very talented team."  </P> <P> Bakersfield, 11-3 and ranked 19th in the nation, was rated among the best 10  Division II teams in several preseason polls.  </P> <P> The Roadrunners, the CCAA's defending regular-season co-champions, also are  supported by a highly partisan -- and often obnoxious -- capacity crowd.  </P> <P> "Bakersfield is the toughest place in the conference to play by far," said John  Masi, coach of second-ranked Riverside and a one-time target for a beer-tossing  Roadrunner fan. "The other ones don't even compare.  </P> <P> "The crowd is part of it -- they're extremely negative toward the opposing  team. And then there's the floor, and the lights."  </P> <P> Ah, the lights.  </P> <P> "They're bad at the south end of the floor," Cassidy said.  </P> <P> Dealing with shadows and glare is not nearly as unpredictable as coping with  the floor, however.  </P> <P> "It's not like there's one or two bad spots, you know," Masi said. "There's a  bunch of them."  </P> <P> Cassidy, who says most of the bad spots are near the sidelines, claims he has  never heard a complaint from a player -- at least not to his face.  </P> <P> "They shouldn't be taking the ball over half-court down the sideline against  pressure, anyway," Cassidy said. "Maybe the dead spots are justifiable  punishment."  </P> <P> Still, Northridge has been more successful than most when visiting the  2,300-seat Civic. The Matadors have won 3 of their past 4 games at the 27-year  old facility.  </P> <P> After Bakersfield, the next game on the Matadors' agenda is Saturday at Cal  Poly San Luis Obispo, which, in Masi's estimation, is the second-toughest place  to play in the conference.  </P> <P> The Mustangs were 14-0 in their home gym last season and they knocked off  heavily favored Bakersfield, 78-73, there Friday.  </P></p>

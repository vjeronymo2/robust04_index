			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ministers near to final agreement at Opec talks MINISTERS of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries said yesterday they were close to an agreement on oil production levels for the third quarter which they hoped to finalise in a meeting this morning. Mr Yousif Omeir bin Yousef, the United Arab Emirates oil minister and present Opec president, said last night: 'We hope the meeting will end tomorrow.' Ministers, who held an extended series of bilateral meetings until late yesterday, offered no figure for a third quarter production ceiling, but any agreement reached today is likely to entail a rise in overall output to accommodate increasing Kuwaiti production at least. Ministers spent yesterday whittling down differences between Saudi Arabia, which entered the meeting arguing that the Opec ceiling should rise by 1m barrels a day, to 24m b/d and Iran, which said it would accept no rise in the ceiling. Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister who entered the summit saying he wanted to see a cut in output to boost prices, said last night he hoped a deal would be struck today, but that Iran, nevertheless, 'does not accept to increase the ceiling'. However, Mr Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister, suggested that no Iranian caveat need obstruct a final agreement, pointing out that Iran also registered its non-acceptance of Opec's second quarter ceiling of 22.98m b/d, agreed in February. 'They said so (that they did not accept the figure) last time, so if they said it again, it is not surprising,' Mr Aminu said. The agreement is likely to embrace a rise in Kuwaiti production from its presently claimed 930,000 b/d to an average of 1.2m b/d. Saudi Arabia gave no indication of whether its output, presently at 8.02m b/d, would change. Mr Aminu's sole comment on the shape of a possible agreement was that Opec would take the cartel's previous deal and 'modify this according to previous quotas and developments in the industry'. Most analysts estimate that the call on Opec oil is likely to rise in the third quarter, perhaps to as high as 24.4m b/d, and skirt 25m b/d by the fourth quarter. Actual production over the second quarter has exceeded the nominal February agreement by just over 500,000 b/d, according to industry estimates. Analysts suggested that a deal today could see Opec pumping between 23.7m b/d and 24m b/d.</p>

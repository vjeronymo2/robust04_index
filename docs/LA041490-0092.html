			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT URGED TO OVERTURN LIBEL AWARD TO SINGER  </P> <P> An NBC attorney attempted Friday to persuade federal appeals court judges in  Pasadena to strike down the largest libel verdict against an American news  organization -- a $5.3-million judgment that the network defamed singer Wayne  Newton in newscasts that linked him to organized crime figures.  </P> <P> NBC lawyer Floyd Abrams said the stories were the product of aggressive  reporting, not ill will, and should be protected by the First Amendment.  </P> <P> But Newton's lawyer, Morton R. Galane, urged the judges to uphold the December,  1986, verdict of a Las Vegas federal court jury that Newton had been injured  unfairly by three broadcasts in 1980 and 1981.  </P> <P> Newton, 47, who listened to the legal arguments with his daughter and friends,  said that regardless of who wins he has been injured forever.  </P> <P> "When someone accuses you of what I've been accused of by these people . . .  the effects of what they said will last the rest of my life," the singer said  outside the courtroom.  </P> <P> Abrams said after the hearing that the case is very important because "a loss .  . . would make it very difficult for the news media to report about  investigations and suspicions about public figures, particularly in their own  community."  </P> <P> Galane agreed that the case has broad ramifications. In his brief, he asserted  that there would be negative consequences for many people besides Newton if the  punitive damages, which constitute $5 million of the $5.3-million verdict, are  overturned.  </P> <P> "If such awards are prohibited, victims of malicious defamation by the mass  media will have no effective remedy and the media will not be deterred from  disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods," Galane wrote.  </P> <P> The legal battle stems out of three newscasts by NBC's special investigative  unit, headed by reporter Brian Ross and producer Ira Silverman.  </P> <P> The first report, on the Oct. 6, 1980, Nightly News, focused on Newton's  relationship with Guido Penosi, who was described as "a New York hoodlum from  the Gambino Mafia family."  </P> <P> The story said that Penosi was a key figure in an ongoing federal grand jury  investigation of the activities of the Gambino family in Las Vegas and that  investigators were looking into Newton's purchase of the Aladdin hotel-casino  there. The broadcast said Frank Piccolo, a Gambino family boss in New York, had  become a hidden partner in the Aladdin as a result of helping Newton take care  of a problem of an undisclosed nature.  </P> <P> Additionally, the newscast showed Newton testifying before the Nevada Gaming  Board on the subject of his relationship with Penosi. Federal authorities said  Newton had not told them the whole story about the relationship, the broadcast  added.  </P> <P> Newton's lawyers demanded a retraction four days later, calling the report  "untrue and slanderous." NBC stood by the story.  </P> <P> The network ran two follow-up stories, one on Nov. 6, 1980, after Newton  testified before a Connecticut grand jury investigating Piccolo, and another on  June 12, 1981, the day Piccolo and Penosi were indicted by a federal grand jury  in Connecticut on extortion charges. Piccolo was shot to death in a Bridgeport,  Conn., telephone booth before the extortion trial and Penosi was acquitted.  </P> <P> Newton sued for libel in 1981 and after numerous delays a 37-day trial was held  in 1986. The jury awarded him $19.3 million in damages.  </P> <P> On a verdict form, the jury said that there had been one false statement in the  stories and one false impression conveyed. But the jurors did not say what they  were.  </P> <P> Eleven months later, U.S. District Judge M.D. Crocker, who presided at the  trial, reduced the award to $5.3 million. In January, 1989, Newton agreed to  accept the reduced award rather than have a new trial in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> One issue emphasized by Abrams in the appeal is whether a broadcaster can be  held liable in a defamation case based upon a "false impression" created by  true statements in its broadcasts.  </P> <P> Abrams acknowledged that "there was no way this broadcast could have been made  at all without leaving a negative impression" of Newton. But NBC did not  deliberately set out to injure Newton, he said.  </P> <P> But Galane said Abrams had misstated the issue because the jury found that  there was a false statement in the report, not merely that a false impression  was conveyed. Moreover, his brief contends in detail that NBC was out to get  Newton.  </P> <P> Appeals court Judge William Norris questioned both Abrams and Galane  intensively about the extent of an appeals court's power to review jury  findings in First Amendment cases involving public figures. Galane asserted  that the review should be limited to the question of whether the jury had  abused its discretion, while Abrams argued for a much broader review.  </P> <P> Norris also asked the lawyers to compare the NBC stories to articles done by  Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate  scandal that led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.  </P> <P> "We tread a very fine line here to make sure that future Woodwards and  Bernsteins aren't inhibited in pursuing their stories," Norris said.  </P> <P> Another key issue in the appeal is whether Judge Crocker erred by refusing to  grant NBC's motion to move the trial from Las Vegas, where Newton has been a  longtime headliner in showrooms and will start a four-week appearance at the  Las Vegas Hilton next week. A street has been named after him there and he has  received many civic honors.  </P> <P> Abrams said putting NBC on trial in Las Vegas "was the American equivalent of  trying author Salman Rushdie in Tehran for defaming the Ayatollah."  </P> <P> A pretrial poll taken for NBC showed that 95.6% of the people in the area knew  who Newton was and that 70% had a favorable impression of him. But Judge  Crocker said the poll revealed nothing about whether they would be biased.  </P> <P> Federal appeals court Judges Alfred T. Goodwin and Dorothy Nelson also took  part in the hearing. A decision is not expected for several months.  </P> <P> Newton sold his interest in the Aladdin some time ago.  </P></p>

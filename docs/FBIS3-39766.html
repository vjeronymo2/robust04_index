He added that this is proof of how effective  nonmilitary measures can be in handling a crisis.    Venizelos said: Diplomatic efforts must now intensify to  find an immediate peaceful solution. The Greek Government, both  as a government and as the European Union president, will make  every effort to find a solution because Greece has the  sensitivity of a Balkan country.

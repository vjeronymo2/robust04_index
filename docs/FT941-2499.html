			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Italy speeds up plans to sell telecoms stake The Italian government is to speed up plans to sell its 52 per cent stake in Stet, the national telecommunications utility, in what it is describing as 'the mother of privatisations'. At the same time, it is preparing its telecommunications operators for international competition by merging five separate networks into a single unit, under plans announced at the weekend. The new company, Telecom Italia, will be the principal asset of Stet. Although Italy is to hold a general election next weekend, a new government is expected to proceed with the sell-off of Stet which may now take place before the end of the year. The cabinet, which has yet to name advisers to the flotation, is aiming at wide ownership. This will include a core of financial institutions as leading shareholders, which the government hopes will provide stable ownership. A 0.5 per cent limit is likely to be set on holdings acquired in the public offer, while the institutions will be able to hold up to 2 per cent. The rationalisation of the five groups, long held up by political interests, was agreed by the boards and is to take place in August. Telecom Italia will be the world's sixth-largest telecoms operator in terms of turnover, which topped L26,800bn (Pounds 10.7bn) last year, and will have nearly 100,000 employ ees. The merger of Sip, the quoted domestic network operator, and the four smaller groups, is intended to cut costs, integrate overlapping organisations and provide a single group able to compete in Europe's deregulated market due to come into force by 1998. Sip has a monopoly in the domestic network, but the market in cellular telephones is being opened up. The winner of a race to run Italy's new Europe-wide network, GSM, is expected to be announced this week. The merger of the five companies is to be achieved by converting their shares into shares in Sip, under terms of exchange based on the companies' stand-alone values as determined by the government's advisers to the restructuring, JP Morgan and Albertini Sim.</p>

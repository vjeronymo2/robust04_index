			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Americans know they have much to lose THE tumult over potential movement on the long-stalled Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) is being watched nervously by one group with much to benefit - or to lose - from the outcome: American farmers. Over the years, enthusiasm has waned as the shape of a proposed settlement in farm talks emerged. It became clear from the draft text, proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt director-general, that the long-promised aim of free trade in agriculture would be no more than a goal for years to come. Protected US commodity groups looked at what they would have to sacrifice so their fellow farmers would get access to new markets and began to see some validity in the Japanese argument for 'food security'. The anxiety is compounded by the unseen presence of the White House 'puppet master' - Mr James Baker, former and possibly future secretary of state. 'He'd sell us out in a second,' said one farm leader. One prominent participant on the US side is the American Soyabean Association, whose long-delayed case against the EC oilseeds subsidies - twice won in a Gatt dispute settlement panel - may well be enmeshed in a final Gatt farm deal. In the hope of avoiding that linkage, the group has been urging the administration to impose Dollars 1bn (Pounds 562m) in sanctions against the EC since August, when a 60-day negotiation period under Gatt expired. Sixty US senators signed a letter to the administration last month urging the US to 'take action to enforce its Gatt rights'. With this kind of pressure on the administration, there are fears US officials will trade wheat for soyabeans - agreeing to a possible EC offer to limit its oilseeds production to 7m-8m tonnes - in exchange for a larger share of the subsidised wheat trade. In Minnesota, Mr Mark Ritchie, head of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, has been a powerful force in organising US farmer resistance to Gatt. From the centre of a worldwide network of similarly concerned farmers, he fears the talks are on the verge of a breakthrough. 'Bush has to have something to show domestically for his focus on international issues,' he says. 'He has a club called oilseeds hanging over the Europeans, and they have the key to unlocking the Gatt deal.' EC officials are aware that President George Bush badly wants a deal, and they are most likely to get their best offer now.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Concerns on N Sea oil tax to be heard THE GOVERNMENT has told MPs it will listen to their concerns about its controversial proposals for reforming the North Sea tax regime to see if improvements can be made. But ministers remain convinced they have found the best plan possible, David Owen writes. Treasury ministers have indicated they will look at suggestions for providing some transitional relief for oil companies affected by the changes which were proposed in the Budget. Under the proposals the rate at which petroleum revenue tax is levied would fall from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and tax relief would be abolished for exploratory drilling. Many companies say these plans would lead to a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to 40,000 jobs. Mr John Butterfill, a senior Tory backbencher, this week tabled a set of amendments to the Finance Bill designed to maintain tax relief for exploration work to which the industry is already committed. Labour has also made clear its objections to the government's proposals, saying it thinks it is 'fundamentally wrong' to abandon the PRT system 'at the present time'. Mr Alistair Darling, a frontbench Treasury spokesman, intends to use a Commons debate early next month to press this viewpoint.</p>

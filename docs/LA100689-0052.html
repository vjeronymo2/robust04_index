			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKKER GUILTY OF FLEECING HIS TV FLOCK OF MILLIONS  </P> <P> Defrocked television minister Jim Bakker, meeting his day of reckoning after a  long, dizzying fall from grace, was convicted Thursday by a federal jury of  defrauding his followers of $3.7 million.  </P> <P> After two days of deliberation, jurors found Bakker guilty on every count of a  24-count indictment for mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. The indictment  charged that he oversold time-shares at a religious retreat being built by his  PTL ministry.  </P> <P> Sentencing is set for Oct. 24. Maximum sentence would be 120 years in prison  and a $5-million fine.  </P> <P> After hearing the verdict, Bakker spent about three hours in custody at the  downtown federal courthouse before posting $25,000, 10% of the $250,000 bail.  While he is out on bail, Bakker must report daily to a parole officer.  </P> <P> His wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, appeared on the courthouse steps and launched into  the hymn "On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand."  </P> <P> Cutting it short, she said: "It's not over 'til it's over. I have a great faith  in the God I serve."  </P> <P> Bakker later told reporters outside the building that he was still innocent and  vowed to appeal his conviction.  </P> <P> "I went into the courtroom several weeks ago telling you that my faith is in  God. I want to tell you my faith is still in God," he said. "I went into the  courtroom innocent of the charges against me, and I come out today still  innocent of the charges against me."  </P> <P> Commenting on the swift verdict, Ricky Hill, the jury foreman, said: "We kept  looking for something from the defense and couldn't find anything."  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Tom Ashcraft said: "With today's verdict reality has finally dawned  for Jim Bakker. He refused to behave responsibly of his own accord at PTL, so a  jury of his peers imposed responsibility on him in a court of law."  </P> <P> Federal prosecutor Deborah Smith, who cross-examined Bakker during his two days  on the stand, said: "The message is you can't lie to people, and you can't use  television and the mails to lie to people and ask them to send you money."  </P> <P> But George Davis, Bakker's attorney, said: "We will appeal. There is a court  that we can go to where I think we'll get justice."  </P> <P> At its height, Bakker's PTL television show was seen on hundreds of cable  television stations. Bakker's ministry took in millions of dollars monthly, and  was embarked on the construction of a religious theme park, "Heritage USA," in  Ft. Mill, S.C.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sexual Encounter Revealed  </P> <P> His long descent began in 1987 when his sexual encounter with church secretary  Jessica Hahn came to light. He resigned and fundamentalist preacher Jerry  Falwell took over the PTL. Shortly thereafter the ministry declared bankruptcy,  and in December last year Bakker and three aides were indicted on fraud  charges.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said that he oversold "lifetime partnerships" that were supposed to  provide the "partners" lodging at Heritage USA. Typically the partnerships cost  $1,000 and promised three nights lodging each year for life. The indictment  charges that 66,683 partnerships were sold, even though Bakker had made the  "false and fraudulent" claim that only 25,000 would be sold.  </P> <P> Prosecutors charged that not enough lodging was built and that the  once-charismatic TV preacher and his close aides diverted $3.7 million of the  $158 million they raised, using it to support decadent life styles. Meanwhile,  prosecutors said, Bakker concealed PTL's ill financial health from his board.  </P> <P> In addition, the indictment charged that Bakker authorized a $265,000  hush-money payment from PTL funds to Hahn. The money was drawn from an account  designated for construction of the Passion play amphitheater, the indictment  says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judge Expresses Concern  </P> <P> Immediately following the verdict, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter decided in  a contentious hearing to allow Bakker to go free on the $250,000 bond, despite  what the judge said was his concern that Bakker's supporters might hide him if  he chose to flee.  </P> <P> Bakker's supporters are "so zealous," Potter said, "they have a Jim Jones  mentality," referring to the cult leader who led hundreds to suicide a decade  ago.  </P> <P> The judge's comment caused Tammy Faye Bakker to groan derisively. "Ohhhh!" she  said and shrank back into her seat.  </P> <P> That was the strongest reaction from either Bakker during the proceeding. The  convicted preacher, dapper in an ensemble of taupe pants and patterned jacket,  sat impassively as his fate was pronounced, occasionally grasping the defense  table in front of him.  </P> <P> His wife, wearing a red suit and huge round white earrings, usually sat  motionless, her left hand supporting her head. Silently, she seemed to cry. At  one point she shook her head no when the prosecution implied that Bakker might  flee or harm himself by taking prescription medicine.  </P> <P> Outside the gray, two-story courthouse, pandemonium reigned, as hundreds of  spectators and reporters chased jurors and principals in the case.  </P> <P> Several vocal Bakker followers castigated the judge and jury, insisting Bakker  is innocent and declaring he is still a pillar of religious strength.  </P> <P> "God has not changed since the days of the Bible," said Bea Martin angrily. "He  can break down the walls of the prisons. Jim will clear out the prisons. He  will get the prisoners saved."  </P> <P> Throughout the often-zany 22-day trial, which was interrupted by Hurricane Hugo  and earlier by Bakker's own breakdown during which he reportedly hallucinated  in a "panic attack" and put his head under a couch, the 49-year-old  televangelist was portrayed by prosecutors Smith and Jerry Miller as a  money-grubbing con man, a liar and a cheat who bilked believers out of hard-got  money through slick appeals over television and through the mails.  </P> <P> Of the 24 counts against Bakker, one through eight were mail fraud; nine  through 23 wire fraud (television), and count 24 was for conspiracy to commit  mail and wire fraud.  </P> <P> For their part, defense lawyers Davis and Harold Bender portrayed Bakker as a  visionary, a humanitarian, a man of God who knew how to build a Christian  empire but knew little about finances -- even his own -- and certainly not  PTL's.  </P> <P> Under cross-examination Smith asked Bakker: "Had your life style become so  extravagant that you wouldn't have noticed a $50,000 bonus?"  </P> <P> "I did not look at my checkbook for several years," Bakker answered.  </P> <P> Bakker's defense included numerous memory lapses, assertions that he was  ill-informed about the workings of PTL, claims that PTL computers did not work,  that associates were out to get him and denials that he knew of PTL's money  problems. Prosecutors on Thursday called him their best witness.  </P> <P> At one point, Bakker tried to show that PTL actually had plans to build enough  lodging for 211,062 partners, but Potter, known here as "Maximum Bob," refused  to allow jurors to be shown Bakker's charts detailing his calculations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites Constitution  </P> <P> Underlying Bakker's defense was the constitutional argument that an overbearing  federal government was infringing on the right to worship, violating First  Amendment rights. Bakker's emotional appeal centered on the claim that he had  been an awesome crusader for Christ, who did good for the masses by spreading  religion over the airwaves.  </P> <P> "TV is the most powerful medium in the world today," Bakker testified. "I felt  the message of Jesus Christ should be propagated over that medium."  </P> <P> Altogether, almost 200 witnesses testified in the trial as the two sides tried  alternately to prove that Bakker had either defrauded the partners or stood by  the contracts.  </P> <P> Their stories were graphic and passionate, as prosecution partners told of  unfulfilled promises and defense partners praised their lodgings at Heritage  USA.  </P> <P> Many of the unsatisfied prosecution witnesses said they were suing the bankrupt  ministry to get back their $1,000 investments.  </P> <P> Following the verdict Thursday, Thomas T. Anderson, an attorney for the angry  partners, said he was "encouraged by today's verdict," but he added that it is  "merely the first step in the process. The victims of Mr. Bakker's actions have  not been made whole."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Former Allies Testify  </P> <P> As in many a classic tale of a meteoric rise and a precipitous fall, perhaps  the most damning witnesses were erstwhile close allies. Bakker's former PTL  associates, Richard Dortch, James Taggart and his brother, David, all of whom  are destined for prison on charges growing out of the PTL scandal, gave  devastating testimony.  </P> <P> Dortch, with serious demeanor, testified for five hours, saying that Bakker  deceived viewers about how many lifetime partnerships were being sold and that  PTL money was being used to pay operating expenses instead of to build hotels.  Bakker viewed PTL as "a gold mine," Dortch testified.  </P> <P> Describing Bakker's reaction to Hahn's contention that Bakker had kidnaped and  raped her, Dortch said: "He turned around and looked at me and said, 'I have  not raped anybody. I have not assaulted anybody. But there is a problem.' "  </P> <P> Dortch went on to say he told Bakker how much the payoff would cost: $265,000.  Testified Dortch: "It was going to have to be dealt with, and I told him the  sum of money. His response was, I hate to give them a dime but do what you have  to do to get it solved."  </P> <P> James Taggart, PTL's interior decorator, used a pointer and photographs to give  jurors a "tour" of the Bakkers' luxurious Highland Beach, Fla., condominium,  which had $40,000 worth of draperies and bedding, and a $5,000 Christmas tree  with handblown ornaments.  </P> <P> Times researcher Edith Stanley contributed to this story from Atlanta.  </P></p>

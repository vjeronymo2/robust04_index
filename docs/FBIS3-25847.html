			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XIZANG RIBAO reporters Mao Yan (3029 3601) and Zhao </F> Renhui (6392 0088 6311): "The Great Progress of This Region's  Foreign Trade"]    [Text] The Tibet Autonomous Region Foreign Trade  Department grasped the opportune time to adjust its trade  strategy last year and made considerable progress in developing  imports and exports. The region's imports and exports in 1993  reached US$52.06 million, of which imports were $51.2 million  and exports were $868,000. The total increased 32 percent over  the previous year. The net amount of import tax delivered to  the state was 64.06 million yuan. Reporters learned this from  the regional foreign trade import-export company's 11 January  work conference.    Under the situation in which an import market has not been  formed and the consumer market is still relatively narrow in  this region, the regional foreign trade company actively  cooperated with enterprises in other localities of the country  to expand trade and other business operations. In 1993, the  regional foreign trade department strived to expand trade with  neighboring countries. The foreign trade company and a Nepalese  business concern jointly set up a carpet plant in Lhasa. The  Nepalese company's investment was $100,000 and the foreign trade  company's was 2.2 million renminbi [yuan]. The plant was  formally put into operation in July, and the plant produced over  600 square meters of handmade Tibetan carpets as of the end of  last year. In 1993, the plant exported items with a total value  of $388,000 and imported items with a total of $160,000 through  border trade.    Various departments and branch offices of the regional  foreign trade company have been bold in exploring new business  opportunities. Two new enterprises were set up with good  results as of the end of last year, and five other ventures are  being studied. In 1993, the autonomous region's foreign trade  center used more than 600,000 yuan of long-stocked funds and  realized a total profit of 10 million yuan. It changed the  situation of suffering losses in previous years. The foreign  trade company also acts as an agent to handle import business  for units in various areas of the region. It has signed  contracts with foreign companies totalling $3.696 million, of  which the Yanghu Power Station accounted for $2.07 million, and  $2.087 million have been utilized.</p>

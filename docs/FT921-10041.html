			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: General Dynamic in further job cuts GENERAL DYNAMIC'S electric boat division may cut as many as 4,000 jobs in response to government plans to cancel the Seawolf nuclear submarine programme, writes Karen Zagor in New York. Mr Roger Tetrault, general manager of the division, said 2,200 employees would be laid off by June 12, in addition to 300 previously announced job losses. The programme's cancellation may force the division to reduce its 21,500 workforce by as much as 18.6 per cent by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale: Voters desert the French far right - Le Pen out of tune as campaign fails to make ground THE lights dimmed. Strains of soft choral music filled the room. The audience leapt to its feet in rapturous cheers. 'Le Pen Vite, Le Pen Vite,' chanted the crowd ecstatically, as a burly figure swept on to the spotlit stage, pausing only before the television crews. Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen had arrived on Wednesday evening at the Pierre de Coubertin sports stadium in Paris for his last rally of the French parliamentary election campaign. The leader of France's extreme right-wing National Front strolled around the stage with the wide smile and conversational manner of a television chat show host rather than a politician. The cheers and chants continued all evening. There were boos whenever Mr Le Pen, his voice hoarse after weeks of speeches, spat out words such as 'socialist' and applause for every mention of his election slogan 'Clean Hands and Head Held High'. But there were empty seats in the stadium and the rally, like the rest of the campaign, was not quite as triumphant for the Front as Mr Le Pen would have wished. Until recently the party, with its anti-immigration policies and its denunciations of the established parties, was one of the fastest-growing forces in French politics. It gained ground in the opinion polls from its foundation in 1972 until last year when it won 13.9 per cent of the votes in the regional elections. The Front has faltered in the current campaign with the final opinion polls suggesting it will win 10.5 per cent of the votes. The main reason for the decline in the polls is the loss of supporters to the Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR), one of the two centre-right parties. This is due to the influence of the outspoken Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister in the last conservative government and a leader of the No faction in last autumn's Maastricht referendum. Mr Pasqua's patriotic views and his trenchant criticism of France's economic ties to Germany have struck a chord with the Front's less extreme supporters. The audience at Wednesday's rally was a typical mixture of petit bourgeois Le Pen supporters and skinhead thugs. However, the RPR's success at winning over the petit bourgeois element poses a serious threat to Mr Le Pen's aim of mainstream acceptance. The recent outbreak of skinhead riots in France and violence involving Front militants are worrying signs that he may be finding it more difficult to quell the thuggish faction in his party. The Paris supporters were in no doubt as to who to blame for the party's electoral difficulties. They roared with derision at the names of prominent socialists and conservatives such as Mr Michel Rocard and Mr Jacques Chirac. But the biggest boos of all were reserved for Mr Pasqua.

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Health cash charges rejected COMPLAINTS by local authorities that they have been denied the money needed to properly discharge the new community care responsibilities they assume in April were rejected by Mr Tim Yeo, junior health minister, in the Commons last night. He clashed with Mr David Hinchliffe, a Labour front bench spokesman, who insisted that senior Conservative councillors - as well as those of other parties - were seriously worried by the 'huge shortfall in funding'. Mr Yeo emphasised that in the coming financial year directors of social services would have Pounds 565m at their disposal as a result of the 'very generous' provision made by the government. He dismissed claims by the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities that the government should have allocated a further Pounds 250m as 'totally bogus'. When Mr Hinchliffe stressed that the Association of County Councils, the Conservative-controlled local authority organisation, estimated the shortfall at Pounds 135m, the minister retorted: 'I think those claims are wholly exaggerated'. Mr Yeo accused the Association of Metropolitan Authorities of making unfounded statements suggesting that 12,000 elderly and disabled people would be at risk of not receiving services. Such tactics only succeeded in 'frightening and worrying some of society's most vulnerable people'. He reaffirmed that apart from the Pounds 565m specifically allocated to local authorities for community care over Pounds 5.5bn would be made available by the government from April for existing personal social services. Mr Hinchliffe described the government's insistence that the bulk of the money allocated to local authorities for community care should be channelled to the independent sector as a 'backdoor method of closing council homes and reducing choice'.</p>

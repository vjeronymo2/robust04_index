			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Government communique issued in Lome on 21 February; read </F> by Georges Combevi Agbodjan, minister of territorial  administration and security]    [Text] The second round of legislative elections took place  on 20 February in an orderly manner in nearly all the polling  stations in the 24 contested constituencies. However, acts of  sabotage disrupted the voting in certain constituencies right  from the start of voting, during electoral operations at the  polling stations, or right after the voting booths closed. In  the Sokode municipality district constituency in the Tchaoudjo  Prefecture, polling officers were forced to suspend the  morning's electoral process, close their polling stations, and  thus block access to polling stations to some voters in Sokode  municipal district who, in their panic, could not vote for the  candidates of their choice.    In the Haho Prefecture, six polling stations were ransacked,  ballot boxes were broken, and ballot papers were scattered about  before the start of voting. Some ballot boxes were stolen away  right after the polling stations closed before the votes could  be counted. What became of these ballot papers? In the fifth  district of Lome municipality, incidents were recorded in some  polling stations. Armed men prevented the counting of votes,  especially in Aflao-Toshivi and Batome. Armed gangs caused  panic in several polling stations, thus forcing voters to return  home without performing their electoral duties.    In Wawa Prefecture the review of electoral reports and vote  counting were suspended when armed gangs broke into the office  of the Gbalou Prefectoral Council, where the local electoral  commission was holding a working session. Election papers were  taken out and burned and electoral commission members  terrorized. These unfortunate and anti-democratic incidents  have certainly influenced the manner in which voters cast their  votes in the said constituencies, where a number of voters were  unable to vote.    Under these conditions many voters could not freely and  properly exercise their voting power. They were simply  prevented from doing this and the ballot papers of those who  were able to vote could not be counted before the announcement  of the results. Those who commit these unacceptable acts of  intolerance in a state where there is a the rule of law,  compromise the fragile basis of our young democracy.    In any case, it is up to the competent authorities to  question the validity of the voting that was carried out in the  affected constituencies.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont cornered by Commons pragmatism - Ivo Dawnay on legislative considerations facing the chancellor as he prepares his pre-election Budget COULD Mr Norman Lamont use his Budget to present the electorate with an appetising smorgasbord of fiscal goodies, then, just two days later, have the prime minister call a general election and defy the Labour party to vote them down? Britain's electoral and legislative machinery may be brutal, but it is not quite as barbaric as that. Mr Lamont, as chancellor, can certainly use his Budget speech to present a picture of what the Tories have in mind for the future. He can - and undoubtedly will - also devote some part of it to outlining glorious economic prospects ahead. He can thus convey the message that voters must choose between tax-cutting Tories and spendthrift Labourites. But what he cannot do is table a legislative package of fiscal measures that he has no intention of actually passing through the House. Budgets normally need at least eight weeks to complete their parliamentary passage and have until the beginning of the summer recess at the end of July to do so. With an election imminent, however, the chancellor must choose carefully among controversial items on his menu. If, as some have suggested, Mr Major calls an election within two or three days of the chancellor resuming his seat on the green leather front bench, then Mr Lamont will know beforehand that there may be only at best two or three days of parliamentary time to get a tiny bill through the House. Under normal procedures, temporary budget 'resolutions' are enforced as soon as the chancellor has spoken on the Tuesday. Those allow only normal revenue activities - the collection of income taxes or Customs and Excise-supervised changes in, for example, cigarette duties - to come into force for a limited period. On the following Monday - after three days of debate - two sample resolutions are presented, debated and passed; immediately prompting the full Finance Bill to be tabled. Some two to five weeks later (after the Easter recess) the bill then comes to its formal second reading before passing the usual committee stage, navigating the Lords and returning for final Commons ratification. If an election is to interrupt that process, the chancellor must table only what he knows he can get through in a few hours of Commons time. That process means that the reach of the budget must inevitably be heavily curtailed. The chancellor is not entirely hedged in. He can use the 'usual channels' - Commons-speak for informal negotiations with Labour's business managers - to compromise on the easier parts of the package like the simple annual uprating of inflation-indexed taxes or allowances. For the contentious, headline-grabbing items - above all a possible cut in the standard rate of income tax - he must choose what is feasible and what is not. If by the Monday after Budget Day an election has already been called, there may be only two or three days of business before a formal dissolution must take place. While any new government can table another Budget after the election is over, Britain cannot be without any Finance Bill in the interim. What is now fascinating connoisseurs of procedure is whether a skilled reading of the Budget speech and its legislative proposals will prove sufficiently explicit to predict the election date accurately - even before the prime minister officially announces it.</p>

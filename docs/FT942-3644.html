			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Mercury mobile business tariff cut Mercury One-2-One, the mobile-phone operator in the London region, yesterday announced a sharp cut in its business tariff. The move comes a week after Vodafone, the largest cellular operator, said that tariffs would be unchanged for the rest of the year. One-2-One will cut its business tariff from 16p a minute to 14p next week and its monthly subscription from Pounds 20 to Pounds 17.50. Business subscribers will be able to make international calls at rates cheaper than BT's standard tariffs for an extra fee of Pounds 3 a month. For an extra Pounds 10 they will be able to make local calls without charge on weekday nights and at weekends. The move will put pressure on Vodafone and Cellnet, the second-largest operator, to cut their tariffs, although both operators said their networks did not need to be price competitive with One-2-One because they offered national coverage. The changes pitch One-2-One's tariffs far below those of its larger rivals, which charge a monthly rental of Pounds 25 and a peak rate tariff of 25p a minute - reduced to Pounds 20 and 20p respectively on a tariff available in the London region. The past year has seen mobile phone tariffs fall by as much as a third, with two new networks - One-2-One and Orange, operated by Hutchison Microtel - launched in the past eight months. One-2-One has gained nearly 100,000 subscribers in the London region since September. Mr Kevin Langford, mobile-cellular analyst at Fleming Securities, said One-2-One's price cuts appeared to be aimed at shifting business customers from its residential tariff - which offers no-charge local calls on weekdays after 7pm and at weekends - and to forestalling competition from Orange, whose tariffs are particularly attractive to high-usage business customers. Its network is more extensive than One-2-One's and will be expanded faster. Mr Richard Goswell, One-2-One managing director, said he did not rule out raising tariffs again as the network expanded. The cheapest handset for One-2-One's network retails for Pounds 199, which is significantly more expensive than those for the analogue networks of the larger operators. The UK has nearly 2.5m cellular mobile subscribers, more per capita than most of the rest of the EU but behind the US and Scandinavia. Orange claims 30 per cent of subscribers in the London region. Vodafone and Cellnet, which launched their networks in the mid 1980s, both have more than 1m subscribers.</p>

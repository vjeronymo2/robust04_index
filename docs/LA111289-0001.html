			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW RIGHT AGAINST THE OLD RIGHTS;  </P> <P> THE TEMPTING OF AMERICA: THE POLITICAL SEDUCTION OF THE LAW BY ROBERT H. BORK  (THE FREE PRESS: $22.95; 388 PP.)  </P> <P> In 1987, the Senate rejected the nomination of Robert Bork by the largest vote  in history against a nominee for the Supreme Court, although he was  preeminently qualified. His constitutional opinions, which accounted for the  nomination, brought his defeat. Bork provoked intense opposition because he was  perceived as a conservative judicial activist who had made himself a symbol of  opposition to liberal activism. He remains the nation's foremost theoretician  of a constitutional jurisprudence of originalism, or original meaning: "All  that counts is how the words used in the Constitution would have been  understood at the time the Constitution was ratified."  </P> <P> This book solidifies Bork's position as an intellectual role model for scores  of federal judges appointed by President Reagan. The book also elaborately  defends Bork's views and explains his defeat by "left-liberal" pressure groups  that, he alleges, politicized the judicial process. The title of the book  refers to "the temptation of results without regard to democratic legitimacy."  </P> <P> In his first section, Bork surveys the history of judicial activism. He depicts  an increasing politicization and leftward movement of the Court from  liberty-oriented doctrines to equality-oriented ones. Judicial activism began  with the first decision on constitutional law. It reached an ugly climax in the  years following the Civil War, when the Court savaged congressional  civil-rights laws and betrayed the 14th Amendment's promise of equal  citizenship. Bork omits this bleak chapter of our judicial history, conserving  his space to lambaste the Warren Court for its activism in the cause of  equality.  </P> <P> In the middle part of the book, Bork criticizes theorists, left and right, who  support judicial activism -- that is, deciding on a basis other than Bork's  concept of original understanding or intent. Finally, he narrates the story of  his own confirmation ordeal. He places the rejection of his nomination in the  context of a "war" for control of the legal culture and even for America's  soul. The book will confirm the beliefs both of Bork's liberal opponents and  conservative supporters. Unfortunately, Bork, who inhabits a Manichaean  universe, does not address himself to moderates who endorse judicial restraint  without embracing his brand of originalism.  </P> <P> Bork claims that "liberal elites" seek to destroy the idea of the rule of law  and make the philosophy of originalism a disqualification for judicial office.  That claim conflicts with the confirmation of William Rehnquist as chief  justice and the unanimous confirmations of Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy,  who share many of Bork's views. Moreover, Bork initially had the support of  moderates and some liberals. When Sen. Edward Kennedy demagogically distorted  Bork's record to inspire a fear of him, I wrote to congratulate Bork on his  nomination and to wish him well. I thought he should be judged on the basis of  his judicial record and believed that his opinions would not be predictable.  </P> <P> Before the final vote on Bork's nomination, however, several studies of his  opinions strongly indicated a systematic hostility to feminists, blacks, gays  and labor. Bork angrily disputes these accusations. He takes none of the blame  for his defeat, alleging that the hearings, including his five days of  testimony, changed "no one's mind." In fact, he lost several initially  indecisive senators including Southern Democrats and members of his own party.  He waffled on numerous issues, causing some to declare that they did not  understand him and others to speak of his "confirmation conversion."  </P> <P> This distempered book fails as a defense of originalist jurisprudence because  originalism rests on the views of the founders, and Bork, as a historian, is  ignorant. Moreover, the historical sources are simply inadequate to provide a  viable constitutional jurisprudence that will decide actual cases. Bork  emphasizes ratifier intent, but we don't even have the records of the  proceedings of most state-ratifying conventions, and those that we do have are  often unreliable. What Bork wants from history is a premise or principle to  apply to constitutional issues, but he acknowledges that history yields various  and conflicting premises and that able and sincere originalist judges who apply  the same premises can reach differing results.  </P> <P> Bork himself has employed discrepant premises and reached discrepant results at  various times. In a 1968 Fortune article, for example, he favored "legitimate  activism" and found a warrant for it in the 9th Amendment, which says that the  enumeration of rights should not be construed to deny or disparage other  rights. To Bork, that meant that the Bill of Rights "is an incomplete,  open-ended document, and that the work of completion is, at least in major  part, a task for the Supreme Court." The amendment extended the range of  individual freedoms "far beyond the text of the Constitution." From that  amendment and enumerated rights, judges should properly draw "new natural  rights."  </P> <P> Today that is all anathema to Bork. When the grand theorist of originalism  changes his mind, the theory -- which is supposed to yield impersonal results  free from judicial subjectivity -- loses credibility. What originalists  attribute to the wisdom of the founders turns out to be their own wisdom  dressed in 18th-Century ruffles.  </P> <P> Bork's 1989 wisdom shrivels most old rights and regards new ones as  "preposterous." He equates federalism and states rights, arguing that if a  state discriminates on grounds of race or religion, the injured parties are  free to emigrate. "In this sense, federalism is the constitutional guarantee  most protective of the individual's freedom to make his own choices."  Similarly, Bork in 1963 believed that an act of Congress outlawing racial  discrimination in hotels and theaters and restaurants would infringe on the  rights of white-supremacist business owners. Today he repudiates that position,  but I doubt that he would have voted to sustain the constitutional authority of  Congress to enact the statute.  </P> <P> Any right not mentioned in the Constitution doesn't have constitutional  existence, according to Bork -- not a right to privacy, to have an abortion, to  practice contraception, or any right that is not enumerated. ("Liberty," it  seems, is not an enumeration.) Yet Bork is wonderfully inconsistent. Although  the 4th Amendment protects "papers" and not "words" against unreasonable  searches, and although the founders knew about eavesdropping and did not  protect against it, Bork derives a right against electronic eavesdropping.  Here, he says, judges must understand rights in the context of changing  circumstances, rather than allow them to become meaningless. He refuses,  however, to acknowledge that the equal-protection clause has a similar capacity  for adaptation to a changed world -- or even that it means what it says. "The  equal protection of the laws" contains no limitation to any particular group of  beneficiaries, and the clause immediately follows the 14th Amendment's general  declaration of citizenship. Yet Bork now regards the guarantee of equal  protection as restricted to a historical intent to forbid racial  discrimination. On this view, equal protection offers nothing to women, aliens,  homosexuals or the aged.  </P> <P> So, Bork argues, the Constitution means what it says when it says what he  means. Sometimes the literal words should govern; sometimes the words should be  taken to embody a larger general principle; sometimes original purpose should  triumph over the words. As Bork says, an honest judge "knows that he often  intuits a conclusion" and then finds supporting reasons. That proposition is  undeniable, and this book is Exhibit A.  </P></p>

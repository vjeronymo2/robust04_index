			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Japanese play down wage role Low labour costs are far down the list of reasons for Japanese companies investing in Britain, according to evidence presented to the Commons employment committee and published yesterday. The more important causes for inward investment cited by Japanese corporations that have invested heavily in Britain in recent years were availability of government grants and green-field sites, use of English as the language of international business, political and economic stability, communications infrastructure and the UK's proximity to the Continent. A strong emphasis was also placed on flexibility in UK working practices, the relatively high skills level of British workers and good industrial relations. The committee report on the import and export of jobs revealed that: Toyota, the motor company, told the committee that the company did 'not consider low wages to be a factor in our investment'. It added: 'What is far more important is the availability of good people, with the desire to apply a high level of management and engineering skill.' Motor company Nissan said it was not concerned with labour costs, nor with the consequences of the social chapter of the European Union's Maastricht treaty. 'In our industry labour costs are less than 10 per cent of total costs,' it said. Sony, the electronics company, cited labour costs as only 10th of 11 reasons why it chose to invest in south Wales. Both Toshiba electronics and the Honda motor company did not even mention low labour costs to the committee as a reason for investing. But MPs do suggest in the report that 'a conflict of evidence' left them in 'some doubt about the relative importance of wage costs'. Mr Greville Janner, committee chairman, said their division of opinion reflected the party political affiliations of members - with Conservatives believing low labour costs were important.

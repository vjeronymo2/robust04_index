			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 16 May (PL) -- The Cuban union movement  today began holding assembly proceedings to seek alternatives  and solutions for attaining increased production in the work  centers.    The weekly TRABAJADORES in today's edition makes a special  appeal to the workers of the country, urging them to strive for  economic efficiency in meetings which, according to the  newspaper "must not be formal gatherings but genuine collective  gatherings."    We appeal to the workers, especially to the worker class, to  come with their sleeves rolled up, to search for measures which  today, in the harsh conditions of the special period, will  determine in each work center the need to improve order,  discipline, attention to the worker, more efficient use of  scarce resources, and increased production and quality, the  paper states.    Considering it the most important task of the Cuban worker  movement, the editorial urges the leaders of the Cuban Workers  Federation (CTC) and its members to commit themselves to the  success of the process which -- it insists -- must serve to take  action on essential aspects of our economy and society.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Shopping centre hit by Boots pullout A PROPOSAL to build an Pounds 85m out-of-town shopping centre near Chester received a setback this week after Boots, the chemist group, pulled out of the scheme, Vanessa Houlder writes. Boots Properties, the group's investment and development subsidiary, became involved in the Cheshire Oaks scheme in February when the Church Commissioners, who own the site, selected it as a development partner. They withdrew after failing to secure a principal tenant for the scheme on terms that were acceptable to the commissioners. 'Given our assessment of future returns, we could not make the deal work for all three parties,' Boots said. The withdrawal of Boots casts doubt on the viability of the 463,000 sq ft scheme five miles north of Chester. It is planned to occupy 65 acres on a 230-acre development site. Boots said it would focus its energies on other developments. It is involved in a number of retail development schemes including new shopping centres in Harrow, north-west London; Hastings, East Sussex; and Caerphilly, Mid Glamorgan. Occupancy rates for new shopping centres across the UK have risen from 67 per cent to 75 per cent in the last year, according to a survey by DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers.</p>

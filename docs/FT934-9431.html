			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (11): Newspaper's capital move - The press MONTERREY boasts not just Mexico's leading companies, but by common repute, the country's most profitable and best-run newspaper, El Norte. El Norte reads and looks more like a Texas newspaper than one from Mexico. It is printed in colour, makes liberal use of photographs and graphics, and contains about eight sections a day, all thick with advertisements. News articles are generally brief and the style is plain, while the editorial line is pro-market and pro-business. The offices in the centre of Monterrey are sleek and modern, and everything, from writing to editing to graphics, is done on computers. The paper is proud of its independence from government, and takes delight in exposing fraud in elections. Unlike many journalists in Mexico City, El Norte reporters do not accept money from departments they cover, do not work on commissions for the advertising departments, and are paid a reasonable salary. The owners of El Norte are now about to publish a Mexico City newspaper, with an initial investment of Dollars 50m, which they say will bring to the capital the same standards that have helped the Monterrey newspaper's morning circulation rise to certified 145,000. The paper, to be named Reforma, will come out on November 20, the day Mexico celebrates its 1910-20 revolution. Mr Alejandro Junco, publisher and (with his family) the owner of El Norte, believes there is a tremendous business opportunity for a new newspaper in Mexico City, with readership levels about one eighth of those in Monterrey. The paper, he says, will be similar to El Norte, and carry sections on local issues, consumer products, real estate, food, as well as standard ones on sport and business. The project has already raised questions in Mexico City about whether a commercial, brash approach to news and culture will go down in the capital, which likes to think of itself as a little more civilised than compatriots in the north, and less consumer-orientated. Mr Raymundo Riva Palacio, an editor of the independent daily El Financiero, says: 'El Norte is effective in the society of Nuevo Leon, but you cannot translate this to Mexico City. The reader in Mexico is more sophisticated, more interested in international affairs, his knowledge of arts is more profound. He demands longer articles and more political analysis than that offered by El Norte.' Mr Junco contends that existing Mexico City newspapers are so concerned about developments in politics and the bureaucracy that they lose sight of the middle-class concerns of their readers. He believes that the paper's independence and objectivity will gain readers, and claims to have lined up some top-rate political columnists to increase the paper's appeal to a Mexico City readership. Mr Riva Palacio questions whether Reforma will be able to maintain its independence as effectively in Mexico City as El Norte does in Monterrey. 'It's one thing being told off by the minister of interior in the state of Nuevo Leon, another by the minister of interior for the whole country.' he says. Reforma's ability to withstand commercial and possibly political pressures received a blow several months ago when the Dow Jones company, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, pulled out of talks to acquire a 49 per cent stake in the newspaper. The negotiations failed after Dow Jones insisted on the right to buy out or be bought out by its partner in the event of a disagreement, a condition Mr Junco refused. Mr Junco still hopes to use Dow Jones news for coverage of the US and international financial news, and the two companies may reach some agreement on sharing advertising revenues in the Mexico City-based newspaper. The entry of Reforma promises to shake up the Mexico City newspaper industry, which is already going through heavy restructuring. Mexico City boasts more than a dozen mainstream daily newspapers, but most have circulations well under 100,000. The majority survive only thanks to subsidies from their owners or from the government. In a largely successful effort to manipulate the press, Mexico's state and federal government departments pay heavily for advertisements that appear as news articles, advertisements that serve no obvious purpose, and often subsidise salaries of journalists through the monthly embute (envelope) of cash. Such practices ensure ample coverage of favoured political leaders, but may explain why newspaper readership is so low. However, some government departments are now cutting back subsidies, reducing generous printing contracts, and are putting an end to the practice of embutes. Private sector advertising is falling as a result of the economic slowdown, and almost all newspapers are feeling the pinch. In a sign of the economic difficulties of the press, the government recently put up for sale the state-owned El Nacional newspaper, but found no-one willing to meet the modest reservation price. Several other newspapers are now up for sale and La Jornada, the favoured paper of the leftist intelligentsia, is seeking a capital increase. Other newspapers are seeking foreign partners to help them out in the battle for readers and advertisers. La Prensa, Mexico's top selling tabloid daily, was recently sold to a group of investors that include Mr Jesus de Polanco, Spain's most powerful media baron. The US media group Capital Cities/ABC has just bought Mexico's largest business magazine, Expansion. Even competitors concede El Norte has an edge over southern rivals in selling advertising and distribution. Mr Junco says with some pride that Reforma will be the world's first newspaper with 'flexible manufacturing'. A reader can, if he wants, customise his newspaper to receive two copies of the section on sports and no copy of the section on food and drink, or whatever.</p>

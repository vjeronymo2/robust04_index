			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A social side to business (6) - Samuel Brittan's views on the legitimacy of the social elements of corporate responsibility, reported on September 2, generated a large number of letters. This is a selection Sir, More than a touch of cynicism seems to have crept into Samuel Brittan's address. No one is seriously asking 'corporations to take on a pseudo-governmental role' nor 'to achieve public policy objectives on the cheap'. However, they are rightly being asked to concern themselves with issues in society that directly affect their businesses. For example, companies need well-educated and trained school leavers and graduates to ensure future profitability. Should they stay shut up in their narrow business world, wholly concentrating on making money today, as Brittan implies, or should they enter into partnership with the public sector and the wider community, spelling out their needs and working with the other sectors to achieve solutions? Deep-seated problems like educational under-achievement can only be solved if all the parties to the solution co-ordinate their efforts. The simple fact is, business can only prosper long term in the context of a stable, prosperous society. Michael Tuffrey, editor, Community Affairs Briefing, 14 Soho Square, London W1V 5FB</p>

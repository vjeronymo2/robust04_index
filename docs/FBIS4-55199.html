			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Karol Bohunicky: "An As-Good-as-New Screening </F> Problem -- Candidates for Secret Collaboration"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava -- Yesterday's news briefing at the  Slovak Interior Ministry was devoted to tax evasion, abuse of  the clearing account, and screenings.    Almost three-quarters of the crimes committed in Slovakia  are  of an economic nature. Representatives from the Financial  Police estimate tax evasion during the first three months of  this year to amount to nearly 3.5 billion korunas [Sk].  Criminal proceedings are already underway in cases involving  losses of about Sk1.0 billion. In scams involving the import of  oil products during the first quarter alone, certain importers  defrauded the state of some Sk300-400 million in taxes. The  Financial Police have reason to suspect that an extensive  network of fraudsters with contacts abroad is operating here.    The activity of the Financial Police in machinations in the  so-called old account between the Slovak and Czech Republics is,  at the moment, more of an investigative and informative nature.  It is apparent from the investigation, however, that "in scams  associated with the old account between the Slovak and Czech  Republics during the first three months of the year alone,  evasion amounting to Sk1.0 billion is estimated." However, it  is still not clear whether such an abuse of the account is  really a crime or merely an abuse of what the law does not  prohibit.    Minister Pittner said, in connection with screenings, that  they will be carried out by the Slovak Information Service,  because this task falls to it by law. Unfortunately, that part  of the "screening law" concerning the candidates for secret  collaboration, which the Constitutional Court of the former  Federation suggested be removed from the law, has not been  amended.

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACE, LEADERSHIP ARE KEY N.Y. CAMPAIGN ISSUES;  </P> <P> ELECTION: DINKINS IS HURT BY DOUBTS THAT HE CAN COPE WITH UNCERTAINTIES AND  CRISES. HIS LEAD IN THE MAYORAL CONTEST NARROWS.  </P> <P> Through the windows of the penthouse high above Manhattan, the guests could see  the spectacular shimmering lights of skyscrapers and bridges glowing in the  night.  </P> <P> But the audience in the room had little interest in the view that has inspired  generations of artists as diverse as George Gershwin and Woody Allen. They had  come to be reassured, and it was the task of Democratic mayoral candidate David  N. Dinkins, wearing a hand-woven yarmulke, to allay their fears.  </P> <P> Moments earlier, Robert Abrams, New York State's attorney general, had spoken  on Dinkins' behalf to the group of rabbis and Jewish community leaders, a  crucial constituency.  </P> <P> He told how Dinkins, who is seeking to be the city's first black mayor, was a  strong supporter of Israel and human rights and how the candidate had traveled  with a delegation of prominent Jews to Bitburg to protest President Ronald  Reagan's visit to a cemetery containing Nazi graves.  </P> <P> When his turn came to speak, Dinkins said: "We are on the threshold of what I  hope will be history.  </P> <P> "Across the country and abroad, people are reading about this contest. I ask no  one to vote for me because I am Afro-American. But I also ask no one to not  vote for me because I am Afro-American."  </P> <P> Dinkins remarks were warm and personal, at times eloquent. But, after he had  departed, skepticism remained with the half-empty trays of canapes.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of fear," a man said, spurning a fund-raising pledge card.  "We'll see."  </P> <P> "He comes off as a nice guy," added another guest. "I don't know if he comes  off as a leader."  </P> <P> Race and the quality of leadership are central issues as New Yorkers prepare to  elect their 106th mayor next Tuesday.  </P> <P> Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough president, is opposed by former federal  prosecutor Rudolph W. Giuliani in a contest that has grown tighter in recent  days.  </P> <P> Issues have faded to secondary importance. Both Dinkins and Giuliani favor  hiring more policemen to fight crime and drugs, both agree on the need to  improve New York's air quality and to keep transit fares at current levels, if  possible. The candidates agree that budgetary problems next year will sharply  limit the chance for broad initiatives.  </P> <P> Dinkins continues to lead in the polls, riding a campaign of conciliation and  civility that stresses his desire to serve as a unifier in a racially troubled  city.  </P> <P> But Dinkins, a 62-year-old clubhouse politician who has held only one previous  municipal elective office, faces questions of whether he can cope in the  crucible of uncertainties, rivalries and crises that shape the mayoralty of the  nation's largest city. New York's 106th mayor will take office on Jan. 1 at a  difficult time. If voters on Election Day approve, he will face a new city  charter. The economy is cooling, fiscal problems are growing, and the expensive  and socially wrenching dilemmas of drugs, AIDS and poverty await fresh  initiatives.  </P> <P> He will face the challenge of roads and bridges badly in need of repair, a  public school system in need of reform, a middle class buffeted by high taxes  and inefficient services, a set of difficult contract negotiations with the  municipal unions.  </P> <P> Recent polls show Dinkins' lead over Giuliani ranging from 4 to 18 points. But  significant numbers of potential voters have been moving from the Democratic  column to undecided.  </P> <P> The New York Times voiced the discontent of many voters, lamenting the quality  of the campaign when it tepidly endorsed Dinkins.  </P> <P> "The sorry nature of this contest makes a hard choice harder," the paper said.  "Democrat Dinkins has shown little in the way of managerial skills; Republican  Giuliani has demonstrated few political skills."  </P> <P> Dinkins "has a reputation for indecision and reinforced it during the  campaign," the paper added, but "he understands New York's government,  neighborhoods and people. He is not the ideal candidate but he is a good man  likely to make a decent mayor."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, after a very shaky start, Giuliani's campaign finally has taken  shape.  </P> <P> The 45-year-old former prosecutor with a national reputation for fighting  white-collar crime on Wall Street, has tried to meet the racial issue head on.  </P> <P> "The suggestion that this contest should center on race is not fair to the  voters. It's divisive. It panders to fear," Giuliani said in a speech this  week.  </P> <P> Giuliani said that he was sensitive and understood the need for racial harmony,  and, if elected mayor, would "have as great a responsibility . . . if not  greater" than Dinkins to bring the city together.  </P> <P> He has accused Dinkins of "sloppiness and indecision" and of "running away"  from the city's projected $1-billion budget gap in the next fiscal year. And he  has sought to cast Dinkins in the mold of the old politics.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that the voters want to continue a City Hall run by old,  opportunistic, vested interests that have cast a thick cloud over how the city  is run," the candidate tells audiences. "It is time to give our city new  thinking, new energy, new commitments, new ways of dealing with problems. What  David Dinkins offers is a return and continuation of the old way."  </P> <P> Giuliani, who frequently promotes his own experience fighting crime and drugs,  leads among white Catholics and divides the Jewish vote with Dinkins, according  to some polls.  </P> <P> But Giuliani still suffers from a perception that he is more a prosecutor than  a prospective mayor. He was also hurt during the GOP primary by a constant  bombardment of negative commercials by cosmetics heir Ronald S. Lauder, who  charged that Giuliani was not a true Republican because was also running on the  Liberal Party ticket.  </P> <P> Analysts say which voting groups turn out will be the critical. Registered  Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by a ratio of 5 to 1 in New York.  </P> <P> Dinkins hopes that traditional Democrats, particularly liberal Jewish voters  and Latinos, will join his strong base of black support and that he will gain a  large enough share of the white Catholic vote to put him over the top.  </P> <P> In an effort to energize those voters, Dinkins has campaigned with outgoing  Mayor Edward I. Koch, whom he defeated in the Democratic primary, and other  well known Democratic figures, such as New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and  Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.  </P> <P> Dinkins has also pledged that his Administration will be independent of the  Rev. Jesse Jackson, who helped energize black voters in the primary but so far  has played a far lesser role in Dinkins general election campaign.  </P> <P> "If I become mayor, I and I alone will be the mayor," the candidate reassures  Jewish audiences.  </P> <P> In a further effort at reassurance, Dinkins stresses his mainstream Democratic  ties, promising that his council of economic advisers will include such  financial leaders as Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker, who played a  prominent part helping solve New York's fiscal crisis two decades ago. Dinkins  pledges he will insist that municipal unions supporting him become "partners  for progress" in labor negotiations.  </P> <P> As the contest has become closer, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's son, Andrew, who played  a key role in his father's campaigns, has become a prominent strategist in the  Dinkins campaign.  </P> <P> The Manhattan Borough president's mainstream philosophy stems in good measure  from his political mentor, J. Raymond Jones, the first black leader of Tammany  Hall, the Manhattan Democratic organization.  </P> <P> Jones' Carver Democratic Club in Harlem in the 1950s and 1960s was an incubator  of political talent, nurturing not only Dinkins but such prominent black  Democrats as Rep. Charles B. Rangel, former Manhattan Borough President Percy  Sutton and former Deputy Mayor Basil Paterson.  </P> <P> Dinkins was introduced by his father-in-law, a Harlem politician, to Jones.  </P> <P> "I thought he was a person I would like to get behind," the former Tammany  leader said in a phone interview from the Virgin Islands, where he is retired.  </P> <P> "I think he (David) is very smart. He benefits not only from experience but  from contacts with other people. He listens. He is a good selector of ideas. He  is very polite. That is traditional in the Carver (club)."  </P> <P> Jones taught Dinkins and his other proteges that, to succeed downtown, the  politics of inclusion was necessary.  </P> <P> "I figured out a long time ago that one could not be successful in New York  City unless you had an appreciation of all the groups in the communities,"  Jones said.  </P> <P> "I had not gotten where I am had I not solidified my base and reached out to  others," Dinkins tells voters. " . . . I've tried to concentrate on what brings  us together."  </P> <P> That unifying philosophy, plus a good dash of caution, have been steady threads  running through Dinkins' two elected offices -- a single term as state  assemblyman and Manhattan Borough president -- plus a number of somewhat  ceremonial jobs gained with the help of New York's Democratic organization.  </P> <P> Over the years, Dinkins has served as a Democratic district leader, head of the  Board of Elections, City Clerk and a board member of the State Urban  Development Corp. Some of these posts were part time, allowing him to practice  law. Dinkins' wife, Joyce, whose father was a Harlem assemblyman, is  coordinator of metropolitan affairs for the state Division of Taxation and  Finance.  </P> <P> After serving in the Marines during World War II, Dinkins, whose father was a  barber in Trenton, N.J., majored in mathematics at Howard University and was  graduated with honors. In 1956, he received a law degree from New York Law  School. The Marines and math have left their mark. At times, he can be very  precise, correcting in private the grammar of his close friends. In the Marine  tradition, he is impeccably dressed in public, changing his sharply-pressed  dark suit several times on humid days.  </P> <P> Dinkins can also be imprecise. He was forced to withdraw as a deputy mayor in  the Administration of former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, after he disclosed to the  City Department of Investigation on a routine background questionnaire that he  had failed to file federal, state and city income taxes for four years.  </P> <P> His explanation has remained constant over two decades. He said he was busy as  a lawyer dealing with his clients' matters; a tax withholding form was filed  along with the partnership form from his law firm. No criminal charges were  brought and Dinkins paid all penalties.  </P> <P> Dinkins' personal finances continued to cause political problems during the  mayoral campaign. Questions were raised over the true value of stock in a media  company headed by Sutton, his political patron, that Dinkins said he sold to  his son.  </P> <P> Politicians who have worked with Dinkins over the years say more than some  previous mayors, the quality of his deputy mayors and staff will be very  important in determining the success of his Administration.  </P> <P> "He is a gentleman. He has an instinct for the common good, which bodes well.  He does what he thinks is right. He has a controlled personality and people  underestimate him," said a state official who has dealt with Dinkins on the  local level. Yet, "he is not a high-pressure driven personality. You can't  compare him to a mule in his talent for work. He will need good people around  him.  </P> <P> "He has a hard time making up his mind about decisions," added a lobbyist who  has brought issues of land use before the borough president's office. "He has  people on his staff who guide him toward the right decision. It will be an  Administration of committees to tell him what to do. When he was thinking of  running for mayor, he formed a committee to advise him what to do."  </P></p>

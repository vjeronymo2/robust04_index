			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Letter: Put another way, inequitable tax can be better presented Sir, In publicising the council tax, the government has, yet again, demonstrated its ineptitude in communicating with the electorate. The basis of assessment to the tax is comparative property values determined at April 1 1991. In practice, the choice of date is as irrelevant as it is misleading. If appeals are to be forestalled, the government should now adopt a broad-brush approach and announce that, since property prices have fallen, on average, throughout England and Wales, in the last 18 months by, say, 20 per cent, the starting point for each band will be reduced accordingly but the allocation of individual homes into each band will remain unchanged. Thus the new steps would be fixed at: B Pounds 32,000 (instead of Pounds 40,000); C Pounds 41,600 (Pounds 52,000); D Pounds 54,400 (Pounds 68,000); E Pounds 70,400 (Pounds 88,000); F Pounds 96,000 (Pounds 120,000); G Pounds 128,000 (Pounds 160,000); H Pounds 256,000 (Pounds 320,000). Honour will thus be satisfied] Alternatively, as a real giveaway, the bands might be arbitrarily reduced by 50 per cent, resulting in potential vendors appealing to have their property reassessed into a higher category. The public might then get the message: all forms of taxation are inequitable and arbitrary, particularly those based on transient asset values. The public rejected the tried and tested (and arbitrary) rating system; they cannot object to its equally flawed successors unless, in the interest of simplicity and equity, they abolish local taxation and with it the concomitant right to elected local government.

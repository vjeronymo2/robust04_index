			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEORGE ALLEN RETURNS TO TINY IOWA SCHOOL TO ASSIST TEAM IN ENDING ITS LOSING  STREAK  </P> <P> With the help of George Allen, formerly a National Football League coach,  Morningside College snapped a 15-game losing streak with a 31-13 victory over  Northwestern of Iowa Saturday night in the season opener for both teams.  </P> <P> Allen, who coached the Rams and the Washington Redskins, coached at Morningside  in 1948. Allen agreed to serve as a Morningside assistant for the past two  weeks and was on the sidelines as the Division III school paid tribute to him  during Saturday's game.  </P> <P> Johnnie Brown scored three times for Morningside. His one-yard run put the  Chiefs ahead, 17-0, but Northwestern responded with a 28-yard scoring pass from  Kirk Maasdam to Craig DeHaan.  </P> <P> Morningside quarterback Mark Kamies then connected with Brown on scoring passes  of 43 and 38 yards to put the game out of reach, as the Chiefs stopped the Red  Raiders twice on fourth down inside the Morningside 10 in the second half.  </P> <P> Northwestern got a late score on a six-yard run by John Swart.  </P></p>

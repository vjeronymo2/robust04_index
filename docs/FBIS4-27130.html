			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday [28 May], a spokesman of the DPRK Foreign  Ministry gave the following answer to questions posed by a KCNA  reporter in connection with the working-level negotiations held  recently between us and the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA]:    Working-level negotiations were held between us and the IAEA  in Pyongyang from 25 to 27 May on the question of the  replacement of fuel rods at the five-megawatt experimental  atomic power plant.    What was basically [kibonuro] discussed at the negotiations  was the method of preserving the technical possibilities of the  measurement of spent fuel rods by the IAEA in case we undergo  routine and ad hoc inspections after a package solution to the  nuclear issue between Korea and the United States is found in  the future.    As has been reported, we are replacing the fuel rods in a  unique status following the temporary suspension of the  effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty. Under such circumstances, we cannot allow routine and  ad hoc inspections by the agency. But, we have clarified our  stance of good will for fully ensuring the continuity of  safeguards corresponding to our unique status and for replacing  fuel rods in such a way as to preserve even technical  possibilities of selected measurement of fuel rods in the future.    The United States, the main [kibon] party concerned with the  solution of the nuclear issue, also appraised this as  encouraging and expressed to us the hope that its method would  be discussed with the IAEA.    At the negotiations, the agency, first of all, raised the  method of selected and separated preservation of fuel rods.  But, an understanding was reached between the two sides that it  was not acceptable in principle because this was essentially an  inspection activity falling under the category of ad hoc  inspections and going beyond our unique status.    Hence, the negotiations focussed on the reasonableness of  the  method we are applying to the replacement of fuel rods.    Our side earnestly explained that this is an appropriate  method of sufficiently ensuring technical possibilities of  freely measuring selected fuel rods as demanded by the agency by  the time when our unique status is dissolved in the future,  while guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards in conformity  with our unique status at the present stage.    And we also ensured all conditions for the agency delegates  to go down to the spot and confirm the conditions and work there  and have sufficient technical consultations with the operators  of the facilities while the negotiations were under way, thereby  helping them have a clear understanding of the reasonableness of  our-style method.    The agency side took note of the fact that this method of  ours is theoretically feasible and that it has already been  experimentally confirmed, and requested us to arrange its  content in writing, saying that the agency side would study with  prudence [sinjunghage] the efficiency and practical safeguards  of our-style method with good will.    We stressed that though this method will enlarge a little  the  amount of measurement, it is the only way for us to adopt under  the present conditions in which political restrictions exist.  We guaranteed [tambohayotta] that we would continue the  replacement of fuel rods in such a way as to accept a series of  opinions of the agency side concerning this method and would  respond any time to the agency side's future proposals for  holding negotiations.    At the negotiations, a final agreement was not reached on  our- style method, but this method was further supplemented and  perfected through the process of negotiations. We immediately  applied this method to the replacement of fuel rods so that the  possibility of future selected measurement of fuel rods could be  more fully preserved, and we are also placing the process of all  work process under a strict supervision of the agency inspectors  and monitoring [kamsi] equipment of the agency.    We acknowledge that through the negotiations with the IAEA  side and the monitoring [iphoe] activities of the agency  concerning the replacement of fuel rods of this time, our good  will to place the peaceful nuclear activities thoroughly under  the control of the agency was manifested to the maximum.    In the future, too, we will make active efforts to ensure  the  transparency of our nuclear activities and do everything to find  an ultimate [chonggukjok] solution to the nuclear issue through  the Korea-U.S. talks.</p>

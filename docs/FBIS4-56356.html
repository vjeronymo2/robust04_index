			<p>BFN     [Text] Manuel Marin, vice president of the European  commission for humanitarian aid, stressed in Havana the  political willingness of the European Union to help Cuba, not  only in the humanitarian field, but also in the economic and  technical fields as well.    According to an AFP dispatch, Marin met with President Fidel  Castro and praised the opening made by the Cuban Government,  yet, Marin specified, the European Union is waiting to see the  economic reforms that will, no doubt, result from the National  Assembly of the People's Government special session.</p>

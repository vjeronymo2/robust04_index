			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND BRUINS NEEDED MORE OF EVERYTHING  </P> <P> Bruin heaven '89 lasted less than a week, from about Jeff George's last pass to  the end of the third quarter of that 6-24 Tennessee nightmare on Linda Vista.  </P> <P> Unless the opener was a complete aberration, the Bruins are in a lot more  trouble than the Trojans, who were basically beaten because of a fluke tipped  ball.  </P> <P> UCLA was run over, flattened, humiliated, and not by Oklahoma or Nebraska, but  by what is very probably a middling SEC team with not much of a passer. How  could it happen?  </P> <P> My suspicion is that Terry Donahue used a straight-up defensive approach, and  when Bret Johnson and the offense started having trouble with the Vols'  defensive pressure, the game was gone.  </P> <P> In other words, the Bruins asked for it. This might have been one of those rare  times Terry didn't worry enough.  </P> <P> CHARLES CHICCOA, Los Angeles  </P></p>

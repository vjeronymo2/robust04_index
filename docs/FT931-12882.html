			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Aid for special projects suspended MR Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, announced in the Commons last night that aid provided for special projects under the Industrial Development Act would be suspended until April 1995. Labour MPs accused him of 'sneaking through' the announcement during a debate on the provision of up to Pounds 20m to enable the Swedish paper-making company SCA to invest in a newspaper recy-cling plant at Aylesford, Kent. Mr Sainsbury said it was intended to suspend the operation of the assistance for special projects facility from the end of February. MPs approved an order authorising sums exceeding Pounds 10m but not Pounds 20m towards the cost of installing new machinery and refurbishing existing machinery to manufacture newsprint from recycled fibre at Aylesford.</p>

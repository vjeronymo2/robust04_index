			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Fourteen state companies were formally charged in connection with a scandal at  the Bank of Crete that has battered Greece's socialist government in recent  months. Among the companies that have been charged are the national airline,  power, phone and mail companies, which allegedly received higher than legal  interest on deposits at the bank. The scandal's central figure, Greek-American  banker George Koskotas, fled last year after being charged with fraud and  embezzlement at the private bank, which he owned. He is under arrest in the  United States.  </P></p>

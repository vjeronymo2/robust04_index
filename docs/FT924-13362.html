			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Isosceles/Fitzwilton The sale yesterday of the Northern Irish food retailer Wellworth is a cruel reminder of how businesses at the moment are worth only what someone will pay. Wellworth's location doubtless restricted the number of potential bidders. But an exit earnings multiple of just under 10 is hardly a handsome rating for an apparently well managed company with enviably well protected market share. Depressingly for Isosceles, this was the easy bit. The next question for the debt-laden owner of Gateway is whether it can recoup any of the Pounds 278m splashed out in March 1986 for Herman's sporting goods. Conversely, of course, yesterday's deal looks attractive for Fitzwilton. The structure is also ingenious. The Irish company is 90 per cent geared, yet has managed to take effective control of a business currently valued at more than 2 1/2 times its own market capitalisation without further stretching its balance sheet. Wellworth's stable cash flow is part of the secret, but so is Mr Anthony O'Reilly's readiness to help fund Fitzwilton's investment by subscribing up to Pounds 14m of subordinated loan stock. Such commitment is impressive, though he is being well rewarded for the risk. Perhaps he also feels it is the least Fitzwilton's wealthy North American shareholders would expect after the disappointments of recent years.</p>

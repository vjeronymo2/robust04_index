			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Labour loss put down to poor image LABOUR'S much-awaited analysis of its general election defeat has concluded that the campaign was lost because of its failure to project a vision of the future and a 'very negative' attitude towards the Labour party even, among its own supporters. The party's policy mix, its tax plans, the 'Jennifer's ear' affair and the controversial Sheffield rally had little bearing on the outcome when put alongside deep-rooted fears of the consequences of a Labour victory. The confidential report, drawn up by Mr Larry Whitty, the general secretary, from more than 40 individual analyses of the campaign, will be debated at a special meeting of the National Executive tomorrow. Its conclusions appear to reverse the adage that 'governments lose elections, oppositions do not win them'. Instead, it suggests that the growing impression of a Labour victory drove thousands of undecided voters into the Conservative camp. In a key paragraph, Mr Whitty argues that Labour is seen as 'a party of the past and one which holds back aspirations and tends to turn the clock back'. While this was encouraged by the Tory-supporting tabloid newspapers, some responsibility must be attributed to the tone of its policy platform which 'reflects a failure to project a strong enough forward and modernising vision for Britain'. He adds: 'At the end of the day, it was not just that the electorate could not bring themselves to vote Labour; it was also that we failed to give them a clear image of the future under Labour.' The report comes alongside numerous other analyses, including Mr Neil Kinnock's own conclusion, in a BBC television interview yesterday, that the Labour party has failed to dispel the negative image created by internecine warfare in the early 1980s. Another inquiry, conducted by the GMB general union, has shown that Labour improved its vote among union members by 4 per cent overall and has reversed a decline to the Conservatives that occurred over the years of the Callaghan government. However, some NEC members are certain to contest some of Mr Whitty's findings, drawn from qualitative polling of sample groups of floating voters, conducted by the Shadow Communications Agency, Labour's image consultant, after the election. Ms Clare Short MP, an NEC absurd that such polling was conducted by the consultancy, whose executives have been charged with relying too heavily on poll findings and media 'glitz', and not enough on Labour's integrity as a caring party. It was no surprise the consultancy's conclusions were that it was Labour's traditional image that was at fault, not the way the campaign was conducted, Ms Short said. Mr Whitty's report is certain to be seized on by Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, as vindicating his claims that the party is not confronting its failings with adequate rigour.

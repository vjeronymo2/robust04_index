			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;84&hyph;27, which initially set forth the provisions and procedures of Rule 476A, <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  the Exchange indicated it would amend the list of rules from time to time, as it considered appropriate, in order to phase in the implementation of Rule 476A as experience with it was gained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21688,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange is seeking approval to add to the list of rules subject to possible imposition of fines under Rule 476A its policy with respect to a requirement for new members of the Exchange to have their order executions observed by another member for a period of two weeks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of their training regimen, new Exchange members are required to participate in a New Member Orientation Program (``Program''). The Program, consisting of six one-hour sessions over a two-week period, is designed to familiarize the new members with regulations, systems and trading practices. Subsequent to the Program and passing the member examination (Series 15), a new member is required to wear a temporary badge (called on the Exchange today an ``orange badge'') for a minimum of two weeks, during which time the new member may execute orders only under the direct supervision of another experienced member. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to the NYSE, a new member may execute an order under the direct supervision of any fully qualified NYSE member who is a disinterested third party to the transaction. The experienced member observes the trade, and reviews it for compliance with the relevant Exchange rules and trading practices. This review is evidenced by placing the experienced member's badge number on the back of the order ticket. See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose for the proposed rule change is to facilitate the Exchange's ability to ensure compliance with all aspects of the above-named policy. New members would be informed that, if they are found to have executed an order during the initial two-week period not under an experienced member's supervision, the requirement to wear the temporary badge and have their executions observed by an experienced member would be extended for an additional week. A second violation of the policy would result in a possible fine under the provisions of Rule 476A. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange has clarified that, because the initial violation of this policy would result in an extension of the probationary period, the second violation would be subject to the first time fine provided by Rule 476A. See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes failure to comply with the requirements of this policy should be addressed with an appropriate sanction and seeks Commission approval to add violations of these requirements to the Rule 476A List. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of Section 6(b)(6) of the Act in that it will provide a procedure whereby members and member organizations can be ``appropriately disciplined'' in those instances when a rule violation is minor in nature, but a sanction more serious than a warning or cautionary letter is appropriate. The proposed rule change provides a fair procedure for imposing such sanctions, in accordance with the requirements of Section 6(b) (7) and 6(d) (1) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

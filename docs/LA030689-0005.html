			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COALITION SETS HEALTH, SAFETY DRIVE;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN AIMS TO CUT 'RISKY PRODUCT' ACCIDENTS, ILLNESS  </P> <P> Consumer and health organizations joined insurance groups Sunday in announcing  a plan to lobby industry and government at all levels in six product-related  areas that affect public health and safety.  </P> <P> The new, 26-member Coalition for Consumer Health and Safety said the effort  aims to reduce product-related illnesses and accidents. The coalition estimated  the annual toll from misuse of what it called risky products -- notably motor  vehicles, liquor and cigarettes -- at more than 475,000 deaths and $250 billion  in medical and damage claims.  </P> <P> "The stakes are enormous. Hundreds of thousands of lives are lost, millions of  injuries and illnesses are suffered and hundreds of billions of dollars in  medical and related costs are spent each year as a result of products that pose  an unreasonable risk to consumers," said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of  the Consumer Federation of America and chairman of the coalition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Formal Alliance  </P> <P> The group said its lobbying effort marked the first time consumer organizations  and major insurance industry groups have combined formally to work for product  improvements. It said the campaign will focus on six goals:  </P> <P>  -- To curb casualties from motor vehicle accidents, which killed nearly 46,000  Americans in 1987, the coalition seeks to promote the use of seat belts and air  bags, as well as work for more laws requiring their use. It also supports  extension of safety standards to light trucks, vans and utility vehicles and  favors toughening drunk-driving laws.  </P> <P>  -- To reduce the number of accidents in the home, which it said annually cause  28,000 deaths and $10 billion in hospital charges, the coalition supports  revitalization of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a target of budget  cuts during the Ronald Reagan Administration.  </P> <P>  -- To discourage tobacco smoking, which it said is responsible for 390,000  deaths annually, the coalition proposes increasing funds for local, state and  federal anti-smoking campaigns and tightening the rules on smoking in public,  especially in public conveyances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alcohol Abuse Toll  </P> <P>  -- To discourage misuse of alcohol, which it said is involved in more than  100,000 deaths a year, the group recommended restricting alcohol advertising  directed at youthful drivers and setting tougher penalties for driving under  the influence.  </P> <P>  -- To guard food quality, the group proposed mandatory inspections of seafood  for bacterial contamination, as well as long-term controls for pesticide  residues on fruits and vegetables. It said that Food and Drug Administration  guidelines should require clear statements of ingredients and nutritional  values on food labels.  </P> <P>  -- To attack pollution of indoor air, especially contamination with  cancer-causing radon gas, the coalition advocated expanding federal research  and making grants to aid state programs.  </P> <P> Although acquired immune deficiency syndrome is not a product-related ailment,  the coalition said that the public health threat of AIDS, which had killed  46,344 Americans as of Jan. 3, is too serious to be ignored. It urged that  private and public sector leaders commit themselves to educating the public  about the disease, and that employers adopt humane policies toward people with  AIDS.  </P> <P> The coalition includes 13 consumer and health organizations, among them the  American Public Health Assn., the American Lung Assn., American Assn. of  Retired Persons, Center for Science in the Public Interest and the Consumer  Federation of America.  </P> <P> Among the 13 insurance groups and companies backing the agenda are the American  Council of Life Insurance, the American Insurance Assn., Allstate Insurance  Co., the Kemper Group, Liberty Mutual Insurance Group, Nationwide Insurance  Co., the Prudential Insurance Co. of America and State Farm Insurance Co.  </P></p>

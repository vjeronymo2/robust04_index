			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- A declaration was  adopted at the international chuche idea seminar on  independence, peace and friendship held in New Delhi.    It says the seminar was a more significant and auspicious  meeting as it was held on the occasion of the 82nd birthday of  respected president Kim Il-song, the founder of the immortal  chuche idea and guide of the popular masses' cause of  independence.    "The seminar stressed in unison that though the onward  movement of mankind is undergoing a test, it is temporary, and  the present time is an era of a historic turn in which the  people refuse the old world of domination and subjugation and  they are advancing toward a new independent world," the  declaration notes, and continues:    "Independence, peace and friendship are the basic idea which  must be applied to the international relations for the building  of a new world, independent and peaceful, in which the peoples  of all countries around the world would develop and prosper  alike, loving and cooperating with each other as the common  masters of the world.    "The great chuche idea is the true outlook on the world in  our era whereby mankind can realise its age-old desire to live  and develop independently and creatively, loving and cooperating  with each other in a free and peaceful world without domination  and subjugation, aggression and war.    "We express full support and firm solidarity for the just  efforts of the Korean people to reunify the country  independently and peacefully, firmly defending the cause of  socialism under the banner of the chuche idea.    "Today the entire Korean people are waging a resolute  struggle to defend and develop socialism, singleheartedly united  around dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the outstanding leader of the  Workers' Party and people of Korea and supreme commander of the  Korean People's Army, thus powerfully demonstrating the  advantages and invincible vitality of anthropocentric socialism,  an embodiment of the chuche idea.    "It is a noble duty of the followers of the chuche idea and  the progressive people the world over to actively defend the  socialism of Korea from the attack and abuses of the  imperialists and reactionaries.    "We strongly reject any attempt to stifle the socialism of  Korea under the pretext of `nuclear issue', regarding it as an  act going against the trend of the times toward independence  and a challenge to the progressives.    "We must not be pessimistic but optimistic of the events of  the last decade of the 20th century and greet the new century  with firm readiness and determination to more vigorously push  ahead with the onward movement of history toward independence.    "No force can turn back the powerful flow of our era toward  the building of an independent, new world under the banner of  the chuche idea and the cause of independence of the masses  will certainly end in victory."</p>

Then they hastily called  a news conference at their headquarters in Via del Plebiscito.  There were the AD [Democratic Alliance] men, behind a green  crescent-shaped table, under the Alliance symbol, the great red,  white, and green clover leaf.    Ferdinando Adornato, Giuseppe Ayala, Willer Bordon, Paolo  Battistuzzi, Giorgio Benvenuto, Giovanna Melandri, Giancarlo  Giglio, Pietro Scoppola, Giorgio Bogi, and Bartolo Ciccardini  all looked grim. Their faces were stern and they were very  reluctant to talk. So much so that they immediately made it  clear: "No questions..., this is a delicate situation...."    They limited themselves to a document that said it all about  the alliance's present condition. The two pages issued an  appeal to the progressive forces and set four conditions. What  are their goals? A government program that will continue from  what [Prime Minister] Ciampi has done; a candidate for the  premiership; a commitment to establishing a single parliamentary  group; and a reassessment of candidates, so that voters can be  offered 60 percent new faces.    The affiliation of the candidates is a major problem. The  document states that they must not be chosen on the basis of  party allegiance: "We will not accept any predetermined sharing  out of quotas to parties and movements. The single-candidate  system demands that candidates be fit in with the individual  constituencies. We will not give up our principles in exchange  for a few additional seats. The choice of candidates must lead  to a major renewal." This means "yes" to men and women from  ordinary society, workers, professional people, and citizens who  "want to enter politics for the first time." And "no" to  choices made on the basis of "party needs."    This urgent appeal did not seek a split, however. The AD's  representatives would not specify anything explicitly, having  sworn themselves to silence. But the document says it all.  "The AD's political and ethical position within the progressive  area is not in question."    The aim of the initiative was not to divide but to prevent  "the democratic forces from exposing themselves to yet another  defeat." According to the AD, the progressive alignment still  lacks many things. It needs "a government program capable of  creating confidence and credibility with regard to the  progressive forces' ability to restore the country's economy to  health, in continuity with the work done by Ciampi." And the AD  regards the naming of a candidate to the premiership and his  team as an important step. Moreover, Adornato's team criticized  the lack "of commitment to joint action in parliament." "These  are all things," according to the document, which was read out  solemnly, "that are demanded by the spirit of the referendum and  that the citizens are entitled to expect in order to know where  the progressive forces want to lead the country. Unless these  things are specified, the rationale of the alliance cannot fail  to be reduced to a disappointing performance."    The AD says that such a hard stance among allies is  justified  by their common aim -- to defeat the right, "its attitude, and  its political blueprint." What can be set against this "danger"?  Not the "ideological left," the AD says. That "is not the  right medicine for governing the country."</p>

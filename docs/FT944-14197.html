			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Indosat highlights faith in telecom privatisations - International offerings The enthusiasm of international investors for shares in Indosat, the Indonesian telecoms group, which rose 20 per cent in their first day of trading, has put under the spotlight one of Asia's most rapidly growing emerging markets. It has also served to underline another significant trend: the enthusiasm of securities houses, banks and institutional investors for freshly privatised telecommunications businesses, but some analysts are questioning whether investors are becoming over-enthusiastic. There is no doubting bankers' enthusiasm. The industry is set to bring Dollars 100bn in offerings to the global markets within the next five years and bankers can expect to earn in the region of Dollars 3bn in fees from these deals. Securities houses are gearing up for a sharp rise in telecoms offerings - increasing the size of their analytical teams is just one method. The Indosat deal has been carried on a wave of enthusiasm which has affected other global telecom offers: Pakistan raised Dollars 900m when it sold 10 per cent of Pakistan Telecom. The government had originally aimed to raise just Dollars 500m. The value of ADRs in Telmex, Mexico's telecommunication company privatised in 1991, has increased from Dollars 27 to Dollars 60. The Indian government plans to sell part of its 85 per cent stake in VSNL, the international telecommunications monopoly, at a price of about Rs1,100 a share - which one banker reckoned as '35 times earnings'. Other countries planning privatisations or sell-offs include Belgium, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey and Hungary. Potential privatisations later in the decade include Brazil, South Africa and South Korea. However, some specialists are suggesting that investors may be losing sight of the risks. 'One warning sign is the almost unanimous view that telecommunications investments carry low risk,' says Mr Rod Dowler, head of Technology Consulting, a specialist advisory company, and formerly head of KPMG's telecoms consultancy. 'This echoes the assertion that countries cannot go broke or property is always a safe investment, that accompanied previous investment stampedes.' He warns that newly privatised companies could be artificially attractive because of their monopoly in local markets and could be hit by the emergence of competition. The question of valuing a telecoms company has been addressed by Baring Securities, which held a seminar on the subject in Cambridge last month. Baring's model looks at the territory covered and growth potential. This question of valuation may be highlighted by the sale of part of OTE, the Greek telecoms operator, which is due this year. At first sight it has all the attractions of an emerging market telecom company but a close examination reveals that there may be less potential for growth. The penetration of telephone lines in Greece, at about 47 per hundred people, is not far short of the European average. Athens is not a major commercial hub, and servicing the myriad Greek islands will be expensive. One analyst values OTE at Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 3bn, yet the Greek government hopes it will be valued at Dollars 5.2bn. 'I'm sceptical. I don't see it as a red hot deal,' he said. Another analyst says that although telecoms are one of the few utilities with good growth prospects 'it is very easy to get too excited and pay silly prices'.</p>

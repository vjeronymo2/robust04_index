			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP TRACK AND FIELD MEET;  </P> <P> PATRICKS WIN GOLD MEDALS, FAMILY STYLE  </P> <P> David Patrick said that the only better time he could remember having with his  wife was their honeymoon.  </P> <P> In the 20 months since, they have had to clear many hurdles. But never have  they done that with quite so much at stake, or with so many people watching, as  they did here Friday night, when both became World Cup track champions.  </P> <P> Patrick ran his fastest time of the year, 48.74 seconds, in winning the men's  400-meter intermediate hurdles, the first event of the three-day meet. About 45  minutes later, while Patrick was on the stand to receive his gold medal, his  wife, Sandra Farmer-Patrick, won the women's 400-meter intermediate hurdles in  53.84.  </P> <P> It was a special occasion, although not entirely unprecedented. Earlier this  summer, they became the first husband and wife to win U.S. track and field  national championships in the same year since 1964, when Harold Connolly won  the hammer throw and his wife, Olga, won the discus.  </P> <P> Now they have become the first married couple to win gold medals in the same  major international track and field competition since Czechoslovakia's Zatopeks  in the 1952 Summer Olympics. Emil won the 5,000, the 10,000 and the marathon.  His wife, Dana Zatopekova, won the javelin throw.  </P> <P> "It would have been horrible if I had lost after David won," said  Farmer-Patrick, a 1985 graduate of Cal State L.A. "I told myself, 'Oh God, I  won't be able to live with myself when I go back to the hotel.' "  </P> <P> Or with David.  </P> <P> One other U.S. athlete had a gold medal to celebrate when he returned to the  team's hotel. Ten years after winning the long jump in his first World Cup at  Montreal, Larry Myricks of Ontario, Calif. also won in his second with a jump  of 27 feet 2 1/2 inches.  </P> <P> U.S. athletes won two other medals. Leroy Burrell of Houston ran the 100 meters  in 10.15 seconds, finishing behind British sprinter Linford Christie's 10.10.  Randy Barnes of Houston was third in the shot with a throw of 69-2 3/4. East  Germany's Ulf Timmerman was first at 71-1 1/2 and Switzerland's Werner Guenthor  second at 70-2 1/2.  </P> <P> There are nine teams in each the men's and women's competitions in the World  Cup, which is held every four years. Four teams represent countries, five  geographical areas.  </P> <P> In the men's standings, the United States leads with 42 points. Europe, Africa  and Great Britain are tied for second with 39. In the women's standings, East  Germany leads with 39 points. The United States is fifth with 26.  </P> <P> One women's event, the high jump, was postponed until today because of a  driving rain that fell through much of the opening night's activities. When  Eliza Doolittle sang that the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain, she  apparently had never been to Montjuic, which overlooks Barcelona.  </P> <P> There were 46,000 tickets sold, although not all of them were used, for an  event chosen to re-inaugurate Montjuic Olympic Stadium, which opened in 1929  and recently was renovated in anticipation of the 1992 Summer Olympics.  </P> <P> The president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the mayor of  Barcelona and the president of the Spanish track and field association were  drenched as they performed their roles in the ceremony from the middle of the  field. Spain's King Juan Carlos, meantime, officially dedicated the stadium  from inside the royal box. It's good to be the king.  </P> <P> But into everyone's life a little rain must fall. Patrick and Farmer-Patrick,  who live near Austin, Tex., had their share last summer in the U.S. Olympic  trials.  </P> <P> Patrick, 29, ran a personal record in the intermediate hurdles and finished so  close to UCLA's Kevin Young for third place that both were allowed to take  victory laps while the photo was studied. Young got the nod and the trip to  Seoul.  </P> <P> Farmer-Patrick, 27, finished first in her intermediate hurdles final, but she  was disqualified for running out of her lane.  </P> <P> A heavy rain fell before her race, causing a delay. When the meet resumed, her  lane was changed from 5 to 6. But coming off the first turn, she got confused  and moved back into Lane 5.  </P> <P> That was particularly disappointing for Farmer-Patrick because she easily would  have won a place on the Olympic team for her native Jamaica. Despite having  lived most of her life in Brooklyn, she chose to compete for Jamaica until she  married Patrick on Jan. 2, 1988.  </P> <P> After the Olympic trials, she wrote a letter to the Jamaican track and field  association, explaining her decision to run for the United States. She said  that she hoped the Jamaicans would reinstate her, but she never received a  reply.  </P> <P> "At that point, I would have run for Italy," she said. "I just wanted to go to  the Olympic Games."  </P> <P> Patrick said that he gave his wife a pep talk after last season.  </P> <P> "I told her that we were going to make everybody pay for what happened to us,"  he said. "We said we were going to challenge ourselves for four years, here for  World Cup this year, at the Goodwill Games next year, at the World  Championships the next year and back to Barcelona in '92."  </P> <P> They earned their berths here by winning in June in the national championships  at Houston. Farmer-Patrick ran first there, putting pressure on her husband.  This time, the roles were reversed.  </P> <P> As usual, Patrick did not challenge for the lead early. But neither did he lose  contact with his primary rivals, Nigeria's Henry Amike and Great Britain's Kris  Akabussi.  </P> <P> Patrick overtook Akabussi after the sixth hurdle and Amike after the seventh.  Amike finished in 49.24, Akabussi in 49.42.  </P> <P> Warming up outside the stadium, Farmer-Patrick was unable to watch her  husband's race. But she heard about it from her coach within a few seconds  after Patrick crossed the finish line. Then, it was her turn to be nervous.  </P> <P> She had not lost in 12 races this year, twice breaking the U.S. record, but she  thought that this might be the night.  </P> <P> "I kept saying, 'This is the one I'm going to lose. David's going to kill me.'  "  </P> <P> It appeared as if she might be prophetic when the Soviet Union's Tatiana  Ledovskaya, silver medalist in the 1988 Summer Olympics, raced to an early  lead.  </P> <P> But Ledovskaya is a notoriously fast starter who often fades near the end.  Farmer-Patrick passed her coming off the seventh hurdle and never looked back.  Ledovskaya finished second in 54.68, more than eight-tenths of a second behind  Farmer-Patrick.  </P> <P> "I didn't win that one on technique or physical conditioning," she said. "I won  that one on guts and glory."  </P> <P> Her victory did not make up for last year, she said. "But it's getting better."  </P></p>

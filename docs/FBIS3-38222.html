			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "Europe's Bitter Bananas"] </F>   [Text] The banana market regulation is the prime example  of the fact that the European Union and its institutions in  Brussels may harbor danger. France, Great Britain, and Spain  have abused European law to give national branches, namely their  banana importers, advantages at the cost of other member states.  They fanned the Commission's instinctive inclination toward  general regulations with the usual result, namely that markets  are not so much regulated but destroyed, which means that the  consumer pays higher prices or gets worse goods. There is  virtually nothing about the banana market regulation that can be  defended, and in Brussels they even use the principles of  European integration to justify it.    "Whoever advocates Community preference for milk, beef,  grain, and sugar," Bavarian Agriculture Minister Reinhold  Bocklet says to the point, "cannot refuse it to the banana  producers in the Community." Limiting imports and making them  more expensive in order to protect domestic producers is one of  the most important elements of European agricultural policy, and  some European politicians would like to make many other economic  branches in the single market happy with that too. No matter  how absurd the banana market regulation may be, any agriculture  minister will advocate it, because criticizing it means  undermining the foundations of agricultural policy.    However, do these politicians not realize that they do not  serve their cause well? Community preference is not an  achievement of European unification, but an exceptional price  that the consumer pays because he wants to have agriculture  preserved as an integral part of his own society. If Bocklet  believes that he has to burden the consumers with the care for  banana producers in Martinique just so that they do not get the  idea of saving in their payments for the farmers in their own  country, he is provoking precisely what he is trying to avoid.    Is it so difficult to make it clear to the agricultural  politicians that they can preserve what they have all the more  certainly the earlier they draw a line? With the banana market  regulation, however, they have far overdrawn the bow, in  particular since it wastes hundreds of millions of the tax  payers' money before it will help the banana producers overseas.  It will remain the talk of the day and it will be used as a  warning every time when the next step is supposed to be taken in  European integration. The opponents of a united Europe could  not have thought up anything better.</p>

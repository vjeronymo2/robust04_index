			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Management: The danger of competition Most people will be surprised to learn that one reason for Britain's lack of competitiveness is an 'over-emphasis on competition' on the part of UK industry. This startling assertion is made today in a lengthy academic research programme on British industrial competitiveness which was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, a government body. More predictably, the study also concludes that companies must not just focus on improving their strategies, but should also pay greater attention to changing the 'social institutions' within their organisations. The curious-looking allegation about competition is contained in the ESRC's latest 'Innovation Update', entitled Regenerating British Industry - An Agenda for Management*. Together with the US, it argues, Britain has developed a view that commerce is all about individual companies 'battling it out with each other'. However, in the market-place of the real world, trade is between interdependent companies, it continues. Companies must remain competitive in order to win individual deals, but they also depend on collaboration with 'networks' of other companies. Coming at a time when most companies - including those in Britain - are involved in at least one strategic alliance, joint venture or 'supplier network', the ESRC warning looks decidedly academic, in the pejorative sense of the word. Given the equally rampant fashion for organisational 'culture change' throughout industry, the same seems true at first sight of the clarion call for managements to shift their reformist efforts away from strategies and structures on to the 'norms and values' of individuals and groups. Yet the reality is that many British companies are still operating with early 20th century attitudes and procedures, claims Arthur Francis of Glasgow University Business School, who co-ordinated the ESRC research programme. He cites the (anonymous) example of a large, well-known engineering group where communication between design and production engineers 'is still done by letter', and where 'graduate engineers with late 20th-century skills are still treated mechanistically, like draftsmen'. Compared with their foreign rivals, far too many British companies give their technical professionals an inadequate role, says Francis. 'It (British industry) is locked into organisational structures which developed when industry was craft-based. That way of working was fine in the 1920s, but is certainly not today.' Such organisational arrangements, says the ESRC 'update', make it hard for companies to move away from what it calls the 'American System paradigm' of high volume and low price, towards the 'New Competition' model of delivering variety, quality and 'fashion' at low cost. To achieve this, the ESRC document stresses that companies must adopt an innovative approach to their organisation, rebalancing the power of different specialist functions, and creating new communication links between them. They must also give everyone involved a greater sense of ownership of the product or service which they are producing. 'It is hard enough for an individual to change his or her norms and values, even when highly motivated,' says the 'update'. 'How much harder it is for a manager to persuade others to change in this way.' Institutional change takes time, it adds - typically 10 years. If much of this seems like modern motherhood to many managers, Francis' research shows that it is by no means second nature to everyone. But his appeal seems also to be directed at his fellow academics and their funding bodies, notably the ESRC: to abandon their traditionally rationalist obsession with research into 'hard' strategy and structure, and to switch instead to the much 'softer' areas of creativity and organisational change. * Innovation Update Two.

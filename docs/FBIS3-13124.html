			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Juniyah, Lebanon, March 9 (AFP)--The Lebanese Army  defused a gift-wrapped bomb outside the French cultural center  in the heart of Lebanon's Christian community on Wednesday,  fuelling fears of further attacks ahead of the pope's visit.    The incident in the coastal town of Juniyah came 10 days  after a bomb attack on Our Lady of Deliverance Church in  northern Beirut killed nine people and wounded 55 in the nearby  Christian community of Zuk Mikha'il.    Pope John Paul II pays his first visit to Lebanon in May and  some political leaders have already voiced concern over his  safety.    The six-kilogram (13-pound) bomb was concealed in a  gift-wrapped package placed outside the French cultural center  in the Ghadir area of Juniyah, 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of  Beirut.    It was found by Chantal Mansur, a teacher at the center, who  alerted the army, the French embassy charge d'affaires Bernard  Letourneau told AFP.    The army said an unidentified group had recently protested  over a decision to move the French cultural center to another  location. It did not elaborate.    But Letourneau denied any plans to close down the center,  which served as a consulate during the early days of Lebanon's  15-year civil war.    He said the building was owned by the Maronite Catholic  Sisters of the Holy Family, and they were renegotiating the  lease which expires in 1995.    "I don't know who the target was, the sisters or us. But it  seems that this is the latest in a series of unfortunate  attacks," he said referring to the February 27 church bombing.    Letourneau added he had instructed the directors of all  French cultural centers and schools in Lebanon "to be vigilant."    An AFP photographer said army troops were stationed outside  the center after the incident.    Secretary General of the right-wing Phalange Party Karim  Paqraduni -- which was devastated by a car-bomb in December  which killed three and wounded 100 -- said he expected more  attacks.    "Thanks to God today's attack was aborted. But I expect more  bombings. They are part of a cycle which is aimed at the  destabilisation of peace in Lebanon," Paqraduni told AFP.    "Christians feel they are the victims of such terrorist acts  and these attacks will continue as long as the assailants go  unpunished," he added.    The investigations into the church bombing and into the  attack at the Phalange headquarters have made no headway.    Paqraduni said a series of steps by the government to  strengthen the country's security apparatus, including plans to  bring back capital punishment, "are all good things as long as  they don't remain ink on paper."    Security measures have been stepped up in churches, mosques  and schools in Lebanon.</p>

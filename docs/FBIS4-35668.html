			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic </F> revolution, at a meeting of Majles deputies marking the  anniversary of the formation of the Majles; in Tehran --  recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. I welcome you warmly, dear brothers and sisters. We  are pleased that another year has passed since the formation of  our honorable Islamic Majles. [passage omitted]    What I deem necessary to mention at this juncture is that  the  slightest issue that might give hope to the enemy should not  emerge from the centers of responsibility. We have nothing to  do with irresponsible individuals. The government and Majles  should work shoulder to shoulder. The Majles should be a source  of help for the government. This is not a new idea. It has  been like this for centuries. If the people's deputies do not  render assistance to the governments, the governments are unable  to carry out their work. The Majles is a legislative center.  The power of restraint is in the hands of the Majles. The  Majles has its foot on the brakes too. If a government moves  and you put your foot on the brake, it cannot move. If the  Majles were to neglect to direct the government, no good result  would be gained. Directing should be carried out. Attention  should always be paid to the issue of independence and sense of  responsibility and bravery. But a situation should not arise in  which a conflict may be felt between the government and the  Majles, lest one should think that there is conflict between  these two. Today, too, thanks be to God, is not like that. Of  course the enemy may magnify any small matter tenfold, sometimes  a hundredfold. However, praise be to God, the Majles supports  the government and the government too works toward the  legislative process of the Majles. The running of the country  is a difficult task. [passage omitted]    Of course one should never defend mistakes that mainly take  place in the second and third ranks of the government. No one  should defend them. If someone makes a mistake, it should be  pointed out to him. Thanks be to God, our president is a  knowledgeable scholar, is aware of changing times, and is in  control of the running of the country. Among all the people  that are known to us, he has exceptional capabilities. He pays  attention to all the affairs and the suggestions of the deputies  will assist him too. You can make use of the instruments that  the law has put in your hands, such as points of order,  questions, and so on. You have these resources too. The most  important instrument is the legislation, which guides the  government on which directions to take, and the government has  an obligation to obey. You can prevent mistakes by this means  completely.    Today the situation is very sensitive. Today it is the turn  of one of the most difficult tasks -- that is, the task of  reconstruction. Destruction is much easier than construction.  There is a difference between destroying a building that is  collapsing and constructing a straight and powerful building.  The first takes two days and the second might not be finished in  two years.    It is a difficult time, difficult work. The foreign enemies  are serious in their hostility too. You only observe a corner  of their animosity in their propaganda. The esteemed deputies  might of course have access to secret reports. Therefore, you  see how much the enemy is trying to prevent the Islamic Republic  from realizing its set aspirations. Under such circumstances,  thanks be to God, we have this Majles that is alive, religious,  committed, aware, familiar with its duty, and courageous; we  have this capable and authoritative government; and we have this  experienced president who has shown his presence in all the  arenas. This is a good basis for work. We should go forward  with speed and power, God willing. Nothing should prevent us  from undertaking correct action. [passage omitted]    I hope that all the brothers and sisters will be successful.  I hope that the esteemed speaker of the Majles -- thanks be to  God that the same shining face has been appointed -- and other  esteemed deputies who have responsibilities within the Majles  will be successful. God will award you further successes.  [passage omitted]</p>

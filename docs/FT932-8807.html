			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: R Dutch/Shell planning to rationalise shipping side ROYAL DUTCH/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, plans to rationalise its shipping operations in an effort to cut costs and reduce exposure to increasing environmental liabilities of the oil tanker trade. Mr Ian McGrath, managing director of Shell International Marine, said the company will reduce the number of large oil carriers currently held in its four deep sea fleets from 42 to 30 by 1997. At the same time it will merge its four fleets in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and France and its separate freight trading organisation into one company based in London. The move will entail losing some jobs among Shell Marine's 350 shore-based staff. Mr McGrath said under 100 jobs will be cut in an effort to make savings in the order of 'several millions of dollars.' Shell's marine operations currently employ 2,600 people altogether and the plan was put to the company's staff on Friday. Mr McGrath expects the new company to be formed at the beginning of next year. Shell had begun to examine its marine strategy in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989, Mr McGrath said. In an effort to reduce its exposure to the risks of liability for environmental damage, the company was trying to carry as much of its own oil in its own ships as was economic. In addition, it had stepped up its inspections of ships chartered. Shell owns 2 per cent of the world's tanker fleet, but the company said it will lease most of its carriers in future. Freight rates for tankers are extremely low and the world's fleet is getting older. Mr McGrath said rates need to rise before the tanker fleet will be renewed, but he said that 80 per cent of accidents were caused by human error.</p>

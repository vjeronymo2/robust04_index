			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM LEADERS TO GET EYEFUL OF L.A.;  </P> <P> ART: ON ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY, THE COMITE INTERNATIONAL POUR LES MUSEES D'ART  MODERNE HAS BYPASSED NEW YORK TO CONVENE IN SANTA MONICA.  </P> <P> For 24 years, the International Committee for Modern Art Museums has met  annually throughout Europe. The group of museum directors and other leaders in  the field of modern and contemporary art has convened in Amsterdam, Helsinki  and Dubrovnik. Committee members have pondered museum issues in Lisbon,  Dusseldorf, Paris and London. One year, they ventured across the Atlantic Ocean  to Buenos Aires. But not once have they met in the United States, even though  about 10% of the organization's 275 members are Americans.  </P> <P> This year, as the committee marks its 25th birthday, the group will not only  come to the United States, it will bypass New York and convene in Los Angeles.  CIMAM (the acronym for Comite International Pour les Musees d'Art Moderne) will  hold its 1990 conference today through next Saturday at Loew's Hotel in Santa  Monica. Participants will attend lecture sessions at the hotel and visit  Southern California museums and collections.  </P> <P> Why are they finally coming here?  </P> <P> "Because I have nagged them for three years," said Lyn Kienholz, director of  the Los Angeles-based California/International Arts Foundation. "I was invited  to join the organization about 6 1/2 years ago, and I couldn't understand why  they hadn't met here." Kienholz's foundation, which organizes international art  exchanges, is facilitating the conference with a committee of Southern  California museum directors.  </P> <P> Kienholz has had close ties to the European art community for nearly three  decades, but she said that her dealings with Europeans revealed a persistently  disappointing perception of Los Angeles. "I kept hearing that nothing of  interest happened in Los Angeles and that no good art was produced here," she  said.  </P> <P> The appointment of Pontus Hulten as the first director of Los Angeles  Contemporary Museum of Art in 1980 turned the tide, Kienholz said.  </P> <P> Hulten, the founding director of Paris' immensely popular Georges Pompidou  Center, left MOCA in 1982, but the idea that Los Angeles was becoming an  exciting art center had caught hold in Europe, she said. The notion gained  substance when MOCA got its program rolling and opened its new building on  Grand Avenue, the L.A. County Museum of Art built a new wing for modern and  contemporary art, and the gallery scene boomed in Los Angeles and Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Conference participants who partake in all scheduled events will be busy  visiting Watts Towers and a host of museums and collections, including an  all-day trip to Santa Barbara and another to Newport Beach and Laguna Beach.  Tonight's inaugural event is the opening of the exhibition "Lee Miller:  Photographer" at the Santa Monica Museum of Art.  </P> <P> CIMAM members will also attend lecture sessions on weighty topics. The opening  program, on Monday morning, is dedicated to "Perspectives on the State of  Culture at the End of the 20th Century."  </P> <P> In Tuesday morning's session on "Realities of the California Scene," video  artist Bill Viola will talk about California art and artists, art consultant  Tamara Thomas will discuss corporate collections and Henry Hopkins, director of  the Frederick Weisman Art Foundation, will speak about Southern California  museums. Additionally, Thomas Hines will deliver a lecture, "Los Angeles  Architecture: The Issue of Tradition in a 20th-Century City."  </P> <P> A Thursday morning session on "Enlightened Sponsorship," featuring speakers  from Citicorp, the Rockefeller Foundation and the J. Paul Getty Trust, will  introduce Europeans to American practices of private support for the arts. The  final session, on Friday morning, will be a round-table discussion on "Present  Day Developments" with curators and directors of private museums, galleries,  foundations and study centers.  </P> <P> Following the conference, one group of participants will visit San Francisco  and about 20 others will accompany Kienholz on a five-day trek through the  Southwest.  </P> <P> Eighty-four CIMAM members have registered so far, the largest attendance in the  organization's history, Kienholz said. About half the participants are from  Western Europe, two dozen live in the Americas or the Caribbean, and the rest  hail from Japan, the Soviet Union, Israel, Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and  Australia. Most of the foreign participants have never visited the West Coast,  Kienholz said.  </P> <P> CIMAM board members planned the lecture sessions, while Kienholz and her Los  Angeles committee have organized housing, transportation, hospitality, art  tours and funding.  </P> <P> Conference costs, totaling about $200,000, have been offset by contributions of  money and services from corporations and foundations. The Rockefeller  Foundation provided $60,000 to bring participants from developing nations to  Los Angeles. The J. Paul Getty Trust contributed $24,700 to transport CIMAM  members from East Bloc countries. Other sponsors include Citicorp, the City of  Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department and Pacific Enterprises.  </P> <P> During nine years of work with the California/International Arts Foundation,  Kienholz has become accustomed to the complications of international projects.  She organized a show of California sculpture that opened at the 1984 Olympic  Arts Festival and toured Europe, and she coordinated an exchange of donated  artworks between the Museum Stuki in Lodz, Poland and the Los Angeles Museum of  Contemporary Art. She has also produced a film, "A Good Time to Be West," on  sculptors from California.  </P></p>

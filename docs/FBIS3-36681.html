Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin  Answers ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's Questions"]    [Text] [Yelagin] Vitaliy Ivanovich, what do you see as  the main cause of the difficulties in Russia's relations with  the Baltic countries?    [Churkin] We believe that some Baltic politicians are making  a serious mistake. Namely in thinking that the Baltic states'  national interests can be realized through confrontation with  Russia. Hence the endless appeals to the world community aimed  at eliciting a sense of pity and compassion for small countries  which are supposedly being hurt by their bigger neighbors. It  is evidently purely domestic considerations and an attempt to  obtain something for themselves that are behind this. However,  the renaissance of the Baltic peoples is only possible if they  build partnership relations with the Russian Federation. I hope  that a sensible approach will ultimately prevail. Positive  momentum can already be glimpsed in our relations with Lithuania.    [Yelagin] But how are the "sore points" in Russia's  relations with the Baltic states being resolved? How justified  are our northern neighbors' incessant accusations directed at us?    [Churkin] There are two problems. First, the troop  withdrawal. Plenty has been done in this sphere. Today there  are still around 13,000 Russian servicemen in Latvia and fewer  than 4,000 in Estonia. In other words, the withdrawal has been  85 percent carried out. Our partners are for some reason losing  sight of this. I would remind you that the redeployment of the  Russian troop contingent began at these states' request without  corresponding agreements being signed. We relied on their good  will. Regrettably, that did not materialize. They have not had  a good word to say for Russia, even though it is continuing the  troop withdrawal amid a very grave economic situation. What is  more, Estonia and Latvia occasionally make tougher demands.  However, we are persisting with the policy of negotiations. It  is important for these to culminate in the signing of  appropriate agreements. The drafts have been almost 90 percent  coordinated, among them a document laying down terms for  retaining the Russian strategic installation at Skrunda.    The second problem is the position of the Russian and  Russian-speaking population. This painful issue is the subject  of our careful attention. During the interstate talks Tallinn  and Riga are doggedly avoiding discussing the key subject of  citizenship. And this procrastination is creating conditions  for the nonindigenous population to be ousted. Despite the  efforts of international rights organizations and  recommendations from CSCE and Council of Europe experts, the  Baltic countries' legislation still enshrines rules that  discriminate against ethnic Russians. In Estonia, for instance,  there are six laws of this kind pertaining to citizenship,  language, and schools which are in one way or another injurious  to the Russian-speaking population. And Latvia's Saeima  recently adopted a law on the election of local self-government  bodies robbing over 35 percent of the country's foreign  inhabitants of their right to vote even at municipal level.  That is tantamount to barring them from political life. We  therefore reserve the right to raise this topic over and over in  our bilateral contacts with Riga and Tallinn and also with  international bodies. Naturally, strong-arm means of resolving  the problem are precluded. The rule of law is the only option.    Lately Riga and Tallinn have been constantly reproaching  us, saying that Russia links this issue with the troop  withdrawal. We have not done that and have no intention of  doing so, but we note Baltic politicians' promises that the  position of the nonindigenous population will improve once the  Russian troops are withdrawn, and will remind them of this at  the right time.    [Yelagin] Could you comment on the Estonian side's  territorial claims on a number of rayons in Pskov Oblast?    [Churkin] We know that Estonian representatives with  semiofficial status are active in Pskov Oblast. They are  insistently canvassing the local population to take up  citizenship of the Estonian Republic and promising them some  land or compensation for land. At the same time they do not  forget to emphasize that these territories will shortly belong  to Estonia. I do not think there is any need to explain the  seriousness of these actions. Via diplomatic channels we have  drawn Tallinn's attention to their inadmissibility. We must not  be forced to take retaliatory steps and create additional  irritants in Russian-Estonian relations. The question is  simple: The territories belong to Russia.    [Yelagin] It is no secret that people in the Baltic display  a pathological reaction to Russian politicians' use of the term  "nearby foreign countries," considering it illegitimate with  regard to these countries. What is your opinion?    [Churkin] Perhaps this term should not be used in official  statements. But should anyone get aggrieved if it crops up  occasionally? I think not. We are not after all equating our  relations with the CIS states and the Baltic countries. There  are definite differences here. The latter left the USSR  earlier. They were not among the 12 states formed after the  breakup of the former Union. They have no intention of becoming  members of the CIS. Consequently we have a particular  relationship with them. But because we lived in the same state  for many years, we still have common problems. The use of this  term does not imply an encroachment on any sovereignty, and that  includes the Baltic.    [Yelagin] Your refusal to accept Russia's assumption of  responsibility for the "Soviet occupation" of the Baltic caused  a fairly stormy reaction in circles there. What is your opinion  of those events from the viewpoint of international law?    [Churkin] They require evaluation from many angles. The  Soviet troops were brought in and stayed in accordance with  treaties with these states. The assent of these countries' top  leaders to the troops' being brought in was also obtained in  1940, albeit at the last minute. Thus, from the viewpoint of  the international law both of that time and of the present,  there are no grounds for talking about the USSR's armed  incursion into the territory of the Baltic states and their  subsequent occupation since, in addition, authority functions  were exercised by national administrators.    It is appropriate to recall that the USSR Supreme Soviet's  1940 decisions admitting Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia to the  Soviet Union were preceded by corresponding political appeals  from their supreme representative bodies. So we cannot talk  about these countries' becoming part of the USSR as a result of  the latter's unilateral actions. With this and the above  arguments in mind, the entry of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia  into the former Soviet federation cannot be described as  annexation.    What is more, a concrete legal definition of any action can  only be provided in the light of the law in force at the time  when the said actions were committed. In this connection the  claims regarding the illegality of the USSR's threatening force  against the Baltic countries in 1939-1940 are, at the very  least, contentious. Unlike present-day law, where the principle  of nonuse of force and threat of force is fundamental, the  international law in force prior to the adoption of the UN  Charter contained no provision banning the threat of force.    Needless to say, a formal legal approach which is correct in  terms of the past does not accord in every respect with current  moral and political or in some respects even legal assessments  of events. Renewed Russia condemns the actions of the Stalinist  regime. Russians suffered no less than the other peoples of the  former USSR as a result. We cannot and did not agree with  attempts to put present-day Russia in the dock by analyzing  particular events in the past.    There have been many dark pages in history, but it is our  common history and the problems inherited from it can only be  resolved together, in a spirit of cooperation and mutual  respect. We urge our immediate neighbors to do this.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 26  April, Liu Huaqing, Standing Committee member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the Central  Military Commission [CMC], attended a discussion with six  military region [MR] commanders and political commissars, who  were attending the third theoretical study class sponsored by  the Central Party School for principal provincial and  ministerial leading cadres. They discussed ways to deepen the  study of Volume 3 of the "Selelected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and  to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and his concept of Army building in the  new period to guide Army building in all fields.    CMC members Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou were  present at the discussion.    At the discussion, MR leaders Li Xinliang, Liu Jingsong,  Song  Qingwei, Gu Hui, Li Xilin, and Li Jiulong spoke glowingly of  their understandings gained from the intensive study of Volume 3  of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" during a concentrated  period of nearly 20 days. According to them, the more they  studied the works, the deeper they realized the profound meaning  and broad coverage of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the great  importance of studying Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping," especially in the light of the realities in the  Army's leadership work. As senior leading cadres, the MR  leaders pledged to diligently study and master this theoretical  weapon and use it to guide Army building.    Liu Huaqing said: To diligently study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and to use Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics to arm the minds of all Army commanders and  fighters is the long-term strategic task of the whole Army,  which must be carried out without fail. He emphasized: In  studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping and correctly handling the relationship between  reform, development, and stability and between local and  national interests, it is imperative to integrate theory with  practice. Senior cadres, in particular, should conscientiously  set a good example for rank- and-file soldiers by promoting the  Army's work in all fields and making positive contributions to  China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive and to the  maintenance of social stability. We should continue to educate  all Army commanders and fighters to bring the Army's fine  traditions into play and to preserve Red Army veterans' true  color. We should administer the Army strictly. Cadres at all  level must go deep into the realities to strengthen military  training and ensure a good job in ideological and political  work. At present, particular attention must be paid to managing  troops and strengthening unity between the Army and the  government and between armymen and civilians.    Xu Huizi, deputy chief of general staff, and Tang Tianbiao,  assistant to the director of the General Political Department,  also attended the discussion.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jose Maria Brunet report on remarks by Spanish Prime </F> Minister Felipe Gonzalez at 11 February press conference in  Madrid: "Gonzalez Believes That CiU's Support Guarantees Stable  Legislative Term"]    [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez believes  that political stability has been guaranteed on the basis of the  cooperation with CiU [Convergence and Union], and for the whole  legislative term. Gonzalez believes that the level of  cooperation achieved with the nationalists makes it possible to  ensure governability, and interprets the lack of deadlines in  this relationship as indicating that it will continue  indefinitely, without ruling out the possibility that there  could be some "minor hitch" or even a "fundamental  disagreement," which would have to be examined, if it occurs,  "at the proper time."    But in any event, Felipe Gonzalez said that he feels  "perfectly comfortable" from the viewpoint of "the government's  initiative and stability in decisionmaking. My stance has not  changed on what could be a hypothetical coalition government"  with CiU, Gonzalez stated, adding immediately that he did not  raise this Thursday [10 February] with Generalitat [Catalan  autonomous government] premier Jordi Pujol, "because it was  unnecessary since it was constantly implicit in the  conversation." The prime minister explained -- as Pujol did on  the previous day -- the agreement in analysis with the CiU  leader, especially on the issue of the economy, with respect to  the need to support the country's productive economy.    "It is assumed," Gonzalez said, "that when you back  stability, you do so throughout a legislative term. This does  not mean that there cannot be a slight hitch or disagreement  which is deemed substantial in the legislative term, but until  it arises, I would not consider in any event -- and this is what  I told Mr. Pujol -- this idea of setting dates, because it is  rather absurd."    Gonzalez described his conversation with Pujol Thursday as  "extremely interesting." During it, "we found that an attempt  is being made to create a wrong impression of what this effort  at understanding between the government and CiU means," when  "our bid goes beyond pure parliamentary arithmetic. This is a  bid to involve CiU with the nation's government, and hence with  the policies which affect the state as a whole."    The prime minister stressed that there is no "blackmail or  pressure" in this relationship, and everything that has been  negotiated has been put forward "clearly." On the issue of  autonomy, he said that he regards as a "necessity" an agreement  on new transfers [of powers from the central government to the  autonomous communities], a matter which must be negotiated with  all the "fast-track" communities, not forgetting that there are  always "nuances" based on their respective distinctive features.  Hence there will be bilateral negotiations with each of these  communities, without excluding political dialogue between  parties, which directly concerns the People's Party.    Nevertheless, the prime minister detected in the People's  Party's stances contradictions which must be surmounted. This  is the case -- he added -- when the People's Party demands a  single administration one day and deplores "slimming down" the  state's peripheral administration the following day. This  latter administration "will be simplified" without this  entailing any relinquishment of its always being represented in  all the country's territories. Gonzalez mentioned his meeting  with Chaves, Fraga, and Lerma in order to conclude that many  communities are demanding "substantially the same" things, which  facilitates the dialogue on the impetus to autonomy. This  process is not taking place owing to "strictly nationalist"  demands but as a result of a "different view of the functioning  of a state organized on the basis of political decentralization."    Gonzalez expressed his desire to continue the dialogue with  the People's Party and for the contacts on the democratic  impetus to bear fruit soon.</p>

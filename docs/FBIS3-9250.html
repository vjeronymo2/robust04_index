			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dorina Baesu: "The SRI Director Settles </F> Accounts"]    [Text] The conflict between Virgil Magureanu [director of  the Romanian Intelligence Service, SRI] and his deputy did not  start yesterday. At about this time last year, information was  circulating in political circles to the effect that Dumitru  Cristea was trying to make contact with various opposition  leaders -- and not only them -- to point out to them that he  might be a good SRI director, better than Virgil Magureanu. Had  they accepted the suggestion, it would have provoked a scandal  following the discussions on the SRI report in the parliament  and they would have had to vote against Virgil Magureanu's  confirmation in the position. Cristea even met with some of  those opposition leaders, while others avoided any contact with  him, seeing it as a trap, and did not wish to get involved in  private, internal SRI scandals. In those days there were even  rumors about how Virgil Magureanu had dismissed Dumitru Cristea.    However, this did not happen because Cristea fought hard for  his position. Slowly, slowly, after having been confirmed in  his position, the SRI director removed from their positions  those people who were supporting his deputy. General Gheorghe  Diaconescu, the head of the counterespionage service, was one of  them, and now even Cristea's turn has come.    Sources close to the SRI director affirm that Gheorghe  Diaconescu was not removed from office because he was involved  in the Pancea affair but simply because he was an incompetent  person and a hard drinker. As far as Dumitru Cristea is  concerned, the same source affirms that he was also involved in  leaking information to a known extremist magazine. According to  our source, published texts in that magazine that were signed  Al.I. Manescu, were edited by somebody who is a professional in  the field of information, namely, former General Neagu Cosma.  For a while he was putting out the magazine  "Espionage-Counterespionage," which he was writing almost  entirely alone, and whose style very much resembled the  aforementioned items in the extremist magazine.</p>

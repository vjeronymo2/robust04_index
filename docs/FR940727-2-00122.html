The Department's report was filed with the Office of Management and Budget on July 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These systems principally support the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration's role in the processing of applicants for the U.S. refugee program and the initial reception and placement in the United States of those who are selected. The Refugee Case Records contain information about applicants for the United States refugee program. The Refugee Data Center Processing Records contain information on applicants for the U.S. refugee program that is used by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to determine their eligibility for the U.S. refugee program. The Refugee Data Center Processing Records contain information on applicants for the U.S. refugee program which is used in the initial reception and placement of persons admitted to the U.S. as refugees and to assist in the collection of refugee travel loans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any persons interested in commenting on these proposed systems of records may do so by submitting comments in writing to Margaret P. Grafeld, Chief, Privacy, Plans, and Appeals Division, Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and Classification Review, Room 1239, Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520&hyph;1239. These systems of records will be effective 40 days from the date of publication, (September 6, 1994), unless we receive comments which will result in a contrary determination. The proposed systems, ``Refugee Case Records, STATE&hyph;59'' and ``The Refugee Data Center Processing Records, STATE&hyph;60'' will read as set forth below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Patrick R.

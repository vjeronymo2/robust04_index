			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities extend gains Water and electricity issues left the rest of the market far behind as domestic and overseas institutions chased both sectors, responding to yet more bullish broker circulars, the prospect of more big special dividends from the regional electricity companies (recs), and on hopes of bumper results and dividends from the water stocks. There was one notable casualty in the recs in Manweb, whose shares, very strong early in the session, came under pressure following news of the resignation - 'by mutual agreement' - of its finance director Mr John Astall. Other recs, although generally closing below their best levels, still displayed hefty gains, with those perceived as strong candidates to deliver special one-off dividends heavily bought. Southern, up 28 at 800p, was seen as one of the favourites for such a move, as was Eastern, up 30 at 796p. James Capel was said to have been the latest broker to recommend the water sector, following last week's positive notes from BZW, UBS and Credit Lyonnais Laing. Thames Water opens the water sector reporting season this morning, with the market looking for an interim dividend of at least 8p, a rise of around 8 per cent. Thames put on 10 1/2 at 532p. Severn Trent jumped 14 to 573p and Southern 12 to 608p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara/Brussels--Six Turkish Parliamentarians of  Kurdish origin announced in Brussels on Friday [17 June] that  they would not return to their home country for fear of  persecution by Turkish authorities. They said they would  continue political activities abroad and could even consider  asking [for] political asylum. Diplomatic sources said that  with the closing down of the country's only Kurdish-based party  and the possible defection of elected members of parliament,  Turkey's international human rights record was expected to  receive a serious blow. Friday's development came a day after  the Constitutional Court permanently disbanded the Democracy  Party (DEP) and ordered the seizure of all its assets and  properties. The decision was taken unanimously by members of  the supreme court after approximately ten hours of debate.    "Turkey, by closing down the DEP, has shown that it is not a  democratic judicial state," a statement issued by the deputies  in Brussels said. "We will stay and be the voice of our  imprisoned friends and of our disbanded party," added Remzi  Kartal, deputy for Van province.    The party's attorney Hasip Kaplan and Turkish Human Rights  Association (IHD) chairman Akin Birdal said in Ankara on Friday  that Thursday's verdict was of a political nature. "The right  of Kurdish people to express themselves in the Turkish  Parliament has been snatched out of their hands," both said.  The verdict caused an immediate reaction among human rights  activists around the world as the closure decision was taken  only because of two speeches made by a former party official and  a written statement issued by DEP.    Late Thursday evening, a court official told journalists  that  the verdict was based on speeches made by DEP former chairman  Yasar Kaya in Bonn, Germany and Irbil, northern Iraq. The final  reason for the closure was a statement titled "Appeal for Peace"  issued by DEP last year. All were deemed as violations of the  Constitution and the Political Parties law.    Kaplan told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS on Friday that although  the verdict was related to the two speeches Kaya had made, the  former DEP leader was still on trial for the same speeches and  had not yet been found guilty.    According to the verdict, a total of 13 members of  parliament  from the now-defunct party are to lose their parliamentary  status as soon as the decision is published in the Official  Gazette.    The decision opens the way for an immediate prosecution by  the State Security Court of eight DEP deputies out of which only  two remain in Ankara. Hours before the verdict was announced,  six members of parliament moved to Brussels. Five are still in  prison since early March, waiting to be indicted after their  immunity was lifted on March 2 by Parliament.    According to the constitution, Turkey would have to hold  by-elections if 24 out of the 450 seats in parliament are  vacant. Currently there are eight vacant seats but this will go  up to 21 once the court verdict is published in the Official  Gazette.    Kaplan and the two free DEP deputies Selim Sadak (Sirnak)  and  Sedat Yurttas (Diyarbakir) argued Friday that this was one  reason why the court had not included four other former DEP  deputies in its verdict. "They were members of the party when  the case was launched but now they claim they were not. This is  being done only to avoid by-elections and show that the case is  a political case," Kaplan said.    Currently DEP deputies Hatip Dicle (Diyarbakir), Orhan Dogan  (Sirnak), Sirri Sakik (Mus), Ahmet Turk (Mardin) and Leyla Zana  (Diyarbakir) are in prison waiting to be put on trial--all to  face a prosecutors demand for capital punishment related to  opinions they have expressed in written and verbal form. DEP  deputies Naif Gunes (Siirt), Remzi Kartal (Van), Mahmud Kilinc  (Adiyaman), Nizamettin Toguc (Batman), Ali Yugit (Mardin) and  Zubeyir Aydar (Siirt) are in Brussels.    Only one of the four deputies formerly related to DEP,  Mahmut  Alinak of Sirnak province, is in detention but he as well as  Mehmet Emin Sever (Mus), Muzaffer Demir (Mus) and Mahmut Uyanik  (Diyarbakir will maintain their parliamentary seats. Next week,  the DEP deputies who have sought asylum in the West will start  to apply to international bodies against the Constitutional  Court decision.    According to the party's lawyers, they will first apply to  the Strasbourg human rights court and will be making their  application on three grounds. First they will argue that the  decision was based upon the 1982 constitution which is the  product of the Sept. 12. 1980 transition regime and thus a  military constitution and that the verdict completely depended  on crimes of opinion. Secondly, they will argue that the party  was closed down owing to statements made by its former chairman  and that according to the individuality of crime, 13 members of  parliament are being "punished" for crimes committed by another  individual. Thirdly, they will demand compensation.    According to Kaplan the party had previously applied to the  court asking for a postponement of the verdict pending the  result of a parliamentary effort to amend the Turkish  constitution.    Kaplan said Thursday's decision showed that this petition  had  been rejected but that the court had not even given an  explanation. On Wednesday all deputies, provincial and district  executives of DEP had submitted their resignations to avoid  being banned from founding or heading a new party for at least  ten years.</p>

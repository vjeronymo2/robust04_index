Noting that Japan has stepped up its conversion into a  military power and its nuclear armament and opened a road of  troop dispatch overseas for aggression and war, the paper brands  this as a violation of the constitution.    The author of the article says:    The current constitution of Japan declares that Japan shall  renounce threat with and use of arms and shall not possess war  potentials of the ground, naval and air forces. The successive  governments of Japan, in violation of the constitution,  organised ground, naval and air forces, the fire-power of which  is now scores of times that of the "imperial army" before World  War II, and have stepped up arms buildup and war preparations,  increasing military spendings extensively.    Opening a road for Japanese troop dispatch overseas means  that the Japanese ruling quarters took the first step toward  overseas aggression.    The Japanese ruling quarters have so far put up the  constitution in order to use it in making Japan appear a  "peaceful state" abroad and giving the Japanese people a  psychological assurance that Japan would not pursue war.    Calling for constitutional revision as an immediate task,  they argue that the constitution should allow the use of arms  overseas by the "self-defence forces" because if Japan does not  participate in military operations of the United Nations, it may  invite world criticism. They also argue that constitutional  revision is necessary for Japan to become a permanent member of  the UN Security Council. As seen above, the main purpose of  their frenzied move to malrevise the constitution is to remove  all elements obstructive to war, win freedom of military action  and create conditions for their military intervention and war of  aggression in any part of the world.    Malrevision of the constitution will only bring disaster to  the Japanese people. To check Japan's conversion into a  military power and overseas aggression is an important task for  peace in Asia and the world.</p>

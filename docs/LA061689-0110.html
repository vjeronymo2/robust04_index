			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROCKWELL RADIATION EXPOSURE IN '60S TOLD  </P> <P> Federal energy department officials Thursday released documents showing that  dozens of nuclear workers at Rockwell International in Canoga Park and its  Santa Susanna field laboratory were exposed to excessive radiation levels on  occasions in the 1960s.  </P> <P> The records reveal no over exposures in subsequent years, and a department  official described the 1960s events as "minor over exposures" with "no health  consequences" for the workers.  </P> <P> But the records, provided to The Times by the Department of Energy under the  Freedom of Information Act, do not include two over exposure events that  Rockwell officials have said took place in the 1970s and 1980s.  </P> <P> The records also do not mention the fact that, without admitting liability,  Rockwell recently paid settlements in at least three workers compensation cases  involving cancer deaths allegedly caused by radiation exposure.  </P> <P> The documents released Thursday are called "unusual occurrence reports," which  the DOE requires contractors, such as Rockwell, to file after safety or  equipment problems.  </P> <P> Pat Coulter, a spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division, said the firm  recognizes its "very serious responsibility" to operate safely.  </P></p>

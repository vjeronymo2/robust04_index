			<p>Galvanized   Steel Scrap   <F P=102> 94FE0402H Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 Nov 93 p  13 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0402H </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] On 10 November, Toyota Motor Corp. announced that it  had developed recycling technology that efficiently separates  and recovers steel and iron from galvanized steel scrap used in  automobiles. The technology involves heating galvanized steel  under a low pressure to vaporize the zinc, which has a low  boiling point, and then solidifying and recovering it, along  with obtaining high-purity iron. A facility for the new  technology, which was jointly developed with Toyokin Co., went  into operation in October at Toyokin's main plant. The  facility's processing capacity ranges from 4,000 to 5,000 tons  per month. This is the first recycling technology of its kind in  the world.    For some time now Toyota has been using the iron scrap of  pressed edge materials, etc., to produce casted parts  (in-process recycling). However, because the zinc components in  the scrap reduce the durability of the melting furnaces used in  casting, since 1987 Toyota has been removing the zinc by means  of shot-blast processing, which blows fine iron beads into the  scrap. With that method, however, the zinc removal rate is only  85%. In addition, recovering the zinc is difficult, and  pig  iron had to be mixed in.    A strong point of the new method is that scrap containing a  large amount of impurities can be handled in a vacuum furnace,  which requires a high degree of purity to maintain  air-tightness. With the new method, scrap cut into massive  pieces is heated to about 700C in the vacuum furnace  (0.0001 atmosphere) to vaporize the zinc, then that zinc is  collected by solidifying it, and the iron is recovered by  cooling it.    The zinc removal rate is 97% or more, and  99%- and  higher-purity zinc is recovered efficiently. The new method  helps to lower costs because only small amounts of pig iron need  to be mixed in.</p>

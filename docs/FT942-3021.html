			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Citibank applies for full Mexican licence Citibank, part of the US banking group, is the first foreign bank to apply for a licence to operate as a full-service financial institution in Mexico. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, ratified last year, US banks are permitted to carry out a wide range of activities in Mexico under the auspices of a locally-incorporated holding company. Citibank said it had applied to create a holding company in Mexico with minimum capital of 1bn pesos (Dollars 296m), making it the first foreign bank to take this step. It plans to develop securities broking and leasing businesses, as well as a banking operation. Citibank already has five bank branches in Mexico City and one in Monterrey, offering mainly retail banking services. Bankers Trust of the US yesterday opened representative offices in Beijing, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. The bank said the move represented Bankers Trust's commitment to China and Asia.</p>

The statement was made by  Defense Minister Fabbio Fabbri, who was speaking about the  latest developments in the Bosnian situation.    Fabbri stressed that, with UN authorization, air strikes  could be directed against the main sources of fire and provide  adequate air cover for the peacekeeping forces. The problem  which so dramatically confronts our consciences, Fabbri said, is  whether it is possible to stop the massacres in Sarajevo.</p>

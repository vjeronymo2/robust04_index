			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Bychkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 June -- Russia and Vietnam consider the  results of Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's official  visit to Moscow, which ended 17 June, on the whole to be  successful. Russia and Vietnam converge in the opinion that the  visit will contribute to future progress in Russo-Vietnamese  relations, upgrading them significantly, says a report  distributed to the press by the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs today.    The ministry notes that the treaty signed by Viktor  Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Federation Government, and  Vo Van Kiet on the bases of friendly relations between the  Russian Federation and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam  "formulates the basic principles of cooperation between the two  countries in light of the changes that have occurred both in  Russia and Vietnam and in the international arena on the whole."    Also taking into account the three intergovernmental  agreements concluded, which regulate capital investment problems  and matters of cooperation in areas such as fishing and the  agroindustrial complex, Russia and Vietnam now have  approximately 15 intergovernmental documents, the result of work  over the past two and a half years.    However, Moscow and Hanoi do not intend to stop there. The  two countries' governments have thought it expedient to continue  work on compiling a list of the treaties, agreements, and other  intergovernmental documents concluded between the former USSR  and Vietnam. It is planned to step up efforts to implement  existing agreements in practice.    The fuel and power complex, including hydroelectricity, was  described at the talks as being among the most promising areas  of cooperation. The press release stresses that cooperation  between individual regions of the two countries, particularly  the Russian Far East and Vietnamese provinces, occupies an  important place in the development of Russo-Vietnamese  relations.    In discussing the international situation, the governmental  heads of Russia and Vietnam confirmed that their views either  coincided or were close on most of today's most urgent problems  and called for the expansion of constructive cooperation aimed  at creating a new, nonconfrontational system of interstate  relations in the Asia- Pacific Ocean area and Southeast Asia, in  particular.    Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Nyugen Manh Cam went  into greater detail on matters of international politics. They  exchanged opinions on specific ways of coordinating the work of  the Foreign Ministries "under the conditions of perceived  changes for the better in the international climate."</p>

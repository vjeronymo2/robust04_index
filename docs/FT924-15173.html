			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House stands ground over 1991 results TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the property, construction and engineering group, is determined not to restate its 1991 financial results following an investigation by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the new accounting standards watchdog. Trafalgar, which is under siege from Hongkong Land, has told the panel that it is willing to change its accounting policies by transferring property developments from fixed to current assets. But according to one of its financial advisers it is adamant that it should not have to restate last year's figures. If Trafalgar's write-downs of wholly-owned properties and associates had been deducted from the profit and loss account they would have severely reduced last year's Pounds 122.4m pre-tax profits.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The rule should only apply prospectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC disagrees that this rule should not apply to licensees of plants that have already permanently ceased operating. This rule should be consistent with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.82(a), which requires all power plant licensees to submit decommissioning plans no later than 2 years after permanently ceasing operations regardless of how long the plant operated. The NRC recently amended 10 CFR 50.82(a) to allow the collection period of any shortfall of decommissioning funds to be determined on a case-by-case basis for plants that had been shut down prematurely (57 FR 30383, July 9, 1992). However, even licensees of these plants must submit their decommissioning plans within the 2-year time frame, notwithstanding the collection period ultimately adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To maintain consistency, the NRC believes that the 2-year limit should be applied to plants already shut down. However, to assure that the NRC does not impose unnecessary burdens on these licensees, the final rule has been modified to allow these licensees 2 years from the effective date of the rule to submit their spent fuel management and funding plans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In practice, licensees of most of the nuclear power plants that have already permanently shut down have developed plans for the management and funding of the disposition of spent fuel at their sites. For example, Fort St. Vrain has either shipped spent fuel offsite to DOE or moved it to an ISFSI onsite. Shoreham is shipping its fuel to Limerick. Yankee-Rowe and Rancho Seco have developed plans for onsite storage facilities. Humboldt Bay and LaCrosse are maintaining fuel in their spent fuel pools. Dresden 1, San Onofre 1, and Indian Point 1 are maintaining fuel in their spent fuel pools or in pools of other units still operating at the site. Peach Bottom 1 has no fuel onsite.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submittal of spent fuel management and funding plans should be required within 60 days of permanent shutdown of the facility, rather than within 2 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC disagrees with this comment. Sixty days is too short a period in which to develop a meaningful spent fuel management and funding plan. Because licensees will normally develop these plans in conjunction with their decommissioning plans, the NRC should maintain consistency by requiring the same 2-year limit for both spent fuel management and funding plans and the overall decommissioning plan, which includes decommissioning funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Costs associated with the construction, operation, and decommissioning of ISFSIs are already assured by provisions in 10 CFR Part 72.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC agrees that part 72 contains provisions to ensure that licensees have adequate funds to construct, operate, and decommission ISFSIs. Spent fuel management and funding plans submitted in compliance with the amended &sect;50.54(bb) need not cover spent fuel while it is being stored in an ISFSI in compliance with part 72. The NRC will consider whether these provisions are adequate when it evaluates whether it is necessary to include spent fuel management and funding as part of decommissioning costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule clarifies the timing of the submittal of plans for managing and providing funding for managing all irradiated fuel for those licensees whose power reactors are shut down prematurely. This action is required to coordinate the submittal of spent fuel management and funding plans with the submittal of decommissioning plans for prematurely shut down reactors. Because management and funding of spent fuel can have a significant impact on the method and timing of decommissioning, licensees should submit their plans for spent fuel management and funding to be consistent with the timing provisions for decommissioning plans in &sect;50.82(a) (i.e., no later than 2 years after permanent shutdown).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

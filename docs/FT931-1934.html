			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / God is in the market Contemporary British political debate is a pawnbroker's auction. We are offered second-hand lies, used slogans and recycled sound-bites. We are bribed with money taken from our own pockets. This is hardly surprising. Most of us, politicians and public alike, work in a moral and philosophical vacuum. Marxist socialism has been exposed as rotten; any kind of socialism as inefficient. So much for utopian creeds. Their infinitely more profound erstwhile rival, Christianity, has become unfashionable, if not in the US then at least on this side of the water. The ghost of Christian morality lingers on, but the damage caused by the decline of religious observance is already being felt. The moral foundations of public discourse have been blown away. Sporadic efforts are being made to find alternative lodestars. None of them looks especially promising. This morning a new think tank opens for business under the name of Demos. Organised by former proponents of Marxism, it is supported by distinguished people with a wide range of views. Its presentational literature reads like the wailing of a tribe of lost souls. It proposes to find ' . . . new ways of giving shape to the democratic ideal'. Politics, say the founders, 'needs to be enriched with the insights of . . . anthropology, organisation theory, psychology, theology, biology, geography, culture and communications theory'. Yes, theology is in there, but religious practice, moral philosophy, Christian values, the human spirit, are not evident. I cannot say anything about the actual work of Demos. It has not yet published any, beyond its 'statement of aims'. It may produce brilliant papers; if so they will be welcomed. At the moment it is an empty box. To me the wrapping is disappointing. The curse of the west in general and Britain in particular is widespread anomie, a withering away of social and ethical standards. The pragmatic Demos is a symptom of this late 20th-century cultural deficiency. It does not have the appearance of a potential cure. Against that it has to be acknowledged that the thinking business is not what it was. There are more producers, but quality is hard to find. Some of the brightest minds on the left are occupied, serving the Labour party's commission for social justice. On the right, at least five organisations are hopping about looking for audiences, acquiring one another's luminaries and, I suspect, competing for funds. Schismatics have departed from the grand-daddy of them all, the Institute of Economic Affairs. Yet the IEA's rump is still churning out booklets, the latest being 'God and the Marketplace', published yesterday1. These have the merit of seeking to debate the morality of wealth creation. During the past decade capitalism has been elevated to the role of the god that succeeded. In one of the IEA essays a high priest of this endeavour, Professor Michael Novak, puts his case once more, thus: 'What makes human beings distinctive is creativity. The Pope has focused on this 'creative subjectivity' of the person, seeing the endowment of a fundamental human right to personal economic initiative.' True, but Centisimus Annus, John Paul II's encyclical of 1991, also warns of the free market's limitations - as one of the other contributing authors, Bishop John Jukes, reminds us. The evidence is in the streets. Look at the beggars, or the lost faces in the dole queues. In spite of Professor Novak's enthusiastic assertions, capitalism exists side-by-side with growing unemployment, relative deprivation and a level of absolute poverty that should not be accepted. The numerical evidence can be found in 'Poverty the Facts', by Carey Oppenheim, an up-to-date edition of which was published by the Child Poverty Action Group yesterday2. As a pressure group, the CPAG piles on the agony, and gives some of its statistics greater weight than they can carry, but at least it does so with moral intent. The same purpose informs Mr John Smith, Labour party leader, whenever he speaks. In his Tawney memorial lecture at the weekend he came out unashamedly as a Christian socialist. ' . . . Let me assert my profound conviction that politics ought to be a moral activity,' he said. ' . . . We should never feel inhibited in stressing the moral basis of what we believe.' Mr Smith would be the first to agree that in so doing he is not claiming a monopoly of ethical sentiment, either for himself or for Labour. Other Labour front-benchers have contributed to a new book, 'Reclaiming the Ground'3, the final chapter of which consists of Mr Smith's lecture. The book reveals Labour's leading Christian socialists to be Mr Tony Blair, Mr Paul Boateng and Mr Chris Smith. A few devoted souls, not on the front bench, have trodden similar ground. Mr Frank Field, a Labour MP who sparks off more bright ideas than all his comrades put together, is a practising Christian. The name of R H Tawney, who died in 1962, was taken in vain by the founders of the Social Democratic Party in the 1980s. I am not sure how many of them were heathens. Among the Tories there are Messrs John Patten, John Gummer and Peter Lilley. Beelzebub records that Mr Lilley would rather take his instruction on church matters from Mr Field than from Mr Gummer. The central tenet of Christian socialism is no great mystery. As expressed by Mr Blair, its principal element is 'the union between individual and community, the belief that we are not stranded in helpless isolation, but owe a duty both to others and to ourselves and are, in a profound sense, dependent on each other to succeed'. This is in stark contrast to the cult of the individual alone, which is what people mistakenly perceive to be the wellspring of Thatcherism. A morally-founded debate might reveal more similarities than differences between Christians in different parties. In one of the IEA essays Simon Robinson, Anglican chaplain at the University of Leeds, gamely tries to reconcile Novak's thinking with Tawney's. Difficult. Yet in continental western Europe the moral high ground sought by Mr Blair and Mr Smith is familiar. It is occupied by Christian Democrats. 1IEA, 2 Lord North St. SW1 P 3LB. 2CPAG, 4th Floor 1-5 Bath St., EC1V 9PY. 3Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Pounds 5.99</p>

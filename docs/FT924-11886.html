			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Technology: Putting the brakes on wasted energy - Worth Watching Most electric motors only reach full load for a few seconds when they start up. But the motor itself has no way of adjusting the amount of electricity it consumes, wasting large amounts of energy as heat and vibration. Now a Cornwall company, Somar Environmental Systems, has come up with an innovative intelligent power controller that works with any AC induction motor and cuts energy consumption by as much as 40 per cent. The Somar Powerboss uses the most advanced microcomputer of its type in the world to sense automatically what load is being placed on the motor, and then supply precisely the right amount of electricity. Companies installing the Powerboss have cut their electricity bills by between 20 and 40 per cent, says Somar, so the unit pays for itself within a matter of months.

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDEX THE GAINS TAX; DON'T CUT IT  </P> <P> After focusing for months on extraneous arguments about revenue effects  (probably zero) and fairness (a red herring), the capital gains debate has  taken a politically bizarre twist. The Democratic-controlled House is about to  vote on a very Republican capital gains measure that would cut the capital  gains tax rate to 19.6% for two years, then index capital gains to inflation.  </P> <P> By insisting on two years of a "differential" lower capital gains tax rate, the  bill, authored by Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.), risks seeing the two years stretch  on indefinitely through the actions of rate-cut supporters. And by rejecting a  superior alternative plan to index capital gains for inflation right away, the  Ways and Means Committee has jeopardized passage of any capital gains measure.  </P> <P> Indexing, which would exempt from taxes any profits up to the level of  inflation, is best on economic grounds. It looks as if it would be better  politics as well, in view of opposition to the Jenkins bill by powerful  Democrats like House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Senate Finance Committee  Chairman Lloyd Bentsen.  </P> <P> Indexing capital gains on new investment, as Ways and Means Committee Chairman  Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) originally proposed, avoids the harmful effects of  taxing illusory inflation gains and eliminates the fairness issue, since it  means that taxpayers, whatever their bracket, will see their capital gains  taxed as ordinary income.  </P> <P> Ironically, the primary opposition to indexing capital gains comes from a small  segment of the business community that claims that indexing does not provide  adequate incentives for high-risk investors. Says former Rep. Edward Zchau, now  a high-tech executive in California, "in order to inspire patient, long-term  risk capital, you have to go further" than indexing capital gains. "Going  further" means cutting the tax rate on unindexed gains to 15% or 20%.  </P> <P> This opposition to indexing represents part of a long tradition of business  community opposition to tax measures that turn out to be highly beneficial.  When President John F. Kennedy in 1961 proposed a "radical" measure to spur  investment with the investment tax credit, business reaction was almost  uniformly negative. One accountant termed the proposal "vague, uncertain in  application . . . its effect on revenue is doubtful and unpredictable." Of  course, once it was understood, the investment tax credit became one of the  most popular tax measures ever enjoyed by business.  </P> <P> The argument for a differential capital gains rate of 15% or 20% instead of  indexing capital gains comes down to a claim that the differential rate is  necessary to provide adequate rewards for risky ventures.  </P> <P> Most economists, not to mention many venture capitalists, agree that the market  already provides adequate compensation for additional risks. For example,  during the 1951-88 period, for five-year holding periods, investors in the  stock market who switched from less-risky S&amp;P 500 companies to riskier  smaller companies increased their average return by 373% (from 3.05% to 11.37%)  while the most common measure of risk rose by only 50% (from 7.31% to 10.93%.)  </P> <P> By far the oddest thing about venture capitalists and other commentators on  capital gains is their failure to examine carefully the question of whether  they would be better off with differential capital gains rates or indexing.  Indexing wins hands down. When it comes to reducing uncertainty about the  after-tax real return on an investment, indexing means that an investor is  relieved of having to forecast the inflation rate to calculate the return. This  is not true with a differential capital gains rate, which, once fixed, can  leave the investor with inadequate or excessive protection against inflation.  </P> <P> Most important, indexing actually results in a lower tax rate on capital gains  than the proposed 19.6% rate. For five-year investments, given a typical 4%  inflation rate, indexing beats a 20% capital gains tax rate for projects with  assumed annual real returns of up to nearly 20%. In short, indexing is the best  way to reward the longer-term investments favored by Treasury Secretary  Nicholas F. Brady. The longer an investment is held, the more gains accrue from  deferral of tax, while indexing protects against erosion of real returns by  inflation.  </P> <P> The Rostenkowski proposal even included an option whereby after five years,  investors could choose between inflation indexing and being taxed on only 75%  of the selling price of the asset. This option means that if, after five years,  you have a project that earns more than a 32% annual real return, you would be  better off under his alternative. The cost is minimal because only a tiny  fraction of investment projects would consistently yield real returns over five  years of more then 30%. But if the alternative made some venture capitalists  feel better, more power to them.  </P> <P> Indexing capital gains was part of the Treasury's original landmark tax reform  proposal that ultimately led to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Let's hope that  Congress can regroup on a sound policy to index capital gains and that the  President will recognize indexing as a valuable modification to the tax code  that will do more to encourage investment than any other measure.  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik raises more to exploit gold mine Bakyrchik Gold, which raised Pounds 9m in London last August to exploit a gold mine in Kazakhstan, once part of the Soviet Union, has raised a further Pounds 2.25m net to expand the first stage of the project. Some 750,000 new shares, representing about 5 per cent of the increased capital, have been conditionally placed with institutional investors by William de Broe at 300p each. Last August Bakyrchik shares were placed at 120p, since when they have been as high as 405p. Mr Kevin Foo, chief executive, said the new cash would be used for a bigger treatment plant so that annual gold output in the first stage of the project would be 46,000 troy ounces compared with the 35,000 to 40,000 first envisaged. The feasibility study for a second stage, to take output to 230,000 ounces a year, was due to be completed in May and, subject to this being satisfactory and a successful start-up of the stage one plant, Bakyrchik would raise another Pounds 75m later in 1994. Most of this would be via new equity.</p>

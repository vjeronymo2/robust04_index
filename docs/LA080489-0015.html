			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOL AUTOS AND WARM DEBATE  </P> <P> The Times reported (Part I, July 18) that Assemblyman John Vasconcellos  (D-Santa Clara) will introduce legislation to ban the sale of automotive air  conditioners within two years. He feels such a law would force the development  of a cooling method not dependent upon chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which harm  the ozone layer.  </P> <P> I have been an automotive engineer for many years, and share Vasconcellos'  concern for the environment. While his objective is noble, I feel that an  outright ban on air conditioners is too extreme. What is really at issue is the  careless release of CFCs.  </P> <P> Currently, when automobiles are scrapped, the air-conditioning Freon is simply  released to the atmosphere. Last year, in correcting a manufacturing defect in  one of its models, a Japanese car maker released more than 20 tons of Freon in  the air, rather than purchasing available recovery equipment.  </P> <P> With laws to penalize irresponsible release of CFCs, air conditioners can  continue to serve their intended purpose without harm to the ozone layer.  </P> <P> R.G. HOFFMAN  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGING OF THE GUARD AT S&amp;L BAILOUT AGENCY;  </P> <P> OUT: WILLIAM SEIDMAN HAILED AS CAPABLE BUT HIS INDEPENDENCE IRKED WHITE HOUSE  </P> <P> He calls it the "bargain basement of real estate," promising to slash prices  15% and then another 5% if necessary to unload the condominiums, office  buildings and shopping centers seized by the government from defunct savings  and loan associations.  </P> <P> This is the latest unorthodox ploy of L. William Seidman, the outspoken  accountant in charge of cleaning up the S&amp;L mess. Seidman is leaving before  his term expires in 1991, unmistakably hurried to the exit by President Bush.  </P> <P> But he plans to depart with a flourish, shutting or selling 140 S&amp;Ls by  June 30 in a whirlwind of activity. And to move some of the vast inventory of  seized properties now ready for sale, he plans to use progressive price  slashing -- a merchandising technique more common to discount clothing stores.  </P> <P> Seidman has enjoyed the respect and admiration of many members of Congress, but  his sometimes obstinate independence angered the Bush Administration, which is  struggling with the ever-growing price tag for the S&amp;L bailout.  </P> <P> Seidman has been a zealous guardian of his powers and prerogatives, both as  chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which protects bank deposits,  and as the director of the S&amp;L cleanup. When someone once asked him why he  was waging a major fight over one seemingly obscure banking regulation, he said  flatly, "Turf is what this town is all about."  </P> <P> While expanding his powers, Seidman for a long time deftly managed to avoid the  political quicksands that have engulfed so many figures connected with the  S&amp;L debacle. When Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady suggested early in  1989 that depositors be taxed on savings to help pay for disposing of crippled  S&amp;Ls, Seidman dismissed the idea with a quip: "It's the reverse toaster  theory . . . instead of the bank giving you a toaster for making a deposit, you  give them one."  </P> <P> Ultimately, Congress decided to spread the burden on all taxpayers, using bonds  to raise the necessary billions.  </P> <P> The legislation, approved last August, made Seidman look like a winner: His  FDIC bank insurance fund was kept separate from the depleted and crippled  S&amp;L fund. And he was given the chairmanship of the Resolution Trust Corp.,  which oversees the dismantling of the hundreds of financially devastated  thrifts.  </P> <P> Seidman had "Congress eating out of his hands," said Bert Ely, an S&amp;L  consultant. "He was fighting effectively for the FDIC agenda, not necessarily  for everything the Administration wanted."  </P> <P> But Seidman began building a solid relationship with Congress earlier, from the  first days of his appointment in 1985 as FDIC chairman.  </P> <P> He took the high-profile banking regulatory job at age 64, capping a  distinguished career in business, the academic world and the federal  bureaucracy. The Grand Rapids, Mich., native has business and law degrees, and  began his career at Seidman &amp; Seidman, the family accounting business. He  built the company into a major national firm, leaving in 1974 to join President  Gerald R. Ford's "Michigan Mafia."  </P> <P> In the White House, Seidman was a special assistant for economic affairs, with  broad influence on legislative and budget policies. After the Ford  Administration ended, Seidman joined Phelps Dodge, a copper and minerals firm,  where he became vice chairman, and later served as dean of the business school  at Arizona State University.  </P> <P> In five years at the FDIC, Seidman dealt with the largest number of bank  failures since the Great Depression. In February, 1989, with the S&amp;L  industry losing millions of dollars a day, the White House gave Seidman  emergency orders, and his auditors seized more than 200 S&amp;Ls in 60 days.  </P> <P> His performance impressed Congress, which fashioned the S&amp;L bailout bill to  keep Seidman's broad powers largely intact.  </P> <P> The Administration became increasing miffed at Seidman's public discussions of  the difficulty and expense of cleaning up the S&amp;Ls. "This is essentially a  dirty business, telling people to stop doing bad things, telling (them) we will  put them out of business," he said.  </P> <P> "We'll be a lucky nation if we can dispose of the current backlog of insolvent  S&amp;Ls in 10 years," he said. "The bulk of the problems ought to be cleaned  up within five years -- if we don't have another avalanche of insolvencies."  </P> <P> This kind of talk became increasingly irritating to the Bush Administration,  especially in recent months, when Seidman began telling anyone who asked that  the price tag for the S&amp;L clean up would keep growing.  </P> <P> The last straw for the White House apparently came when Seidman indicated his  agreement with the General Accounting Office estimate that the thrift cleanup  could cost $400 billion or more.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE BALLOONING BAILOUT  </P> <P> The projected cost of cleaning up the nation's savings and loan mess continues  to mount as original assumptions give way to revised estimates. The ultimate  cost will depend on the number of thrifts seized by the government and the  amount of money recovered by selling their holdings. The rising estimates  reflect higher-than-expected interest rates, problems caused by shortcomings in  the bailout plan and delays in shutting down failed institutions. But some of  the confusion is caused by apple-and-orange comparisons. Here's a brief  rundown:  </P> <P> $175 Billion: The original White House estimate of total bailout costs, with  interest, over the 33 years required to pay off all the bonds the government  plans to issue. The estimate was based on optimistic economic and financial  assumptions.  </P> <P> $257 Billion: Last year's estimate by the General Accounting Office, an arm of  Congress, based on more up-to-date information than the White House projection.  Of the $257 billion, taxpayers would have been expected to contribute about  $139 billion.  </P> <P> $325 Billion-$500 Billion: A revised GAO estimate issued only last month. Part  of the added expense reflects a decision to stretch out the cost by issuing  40-year bonds instead of 30-year bonds. The GAO did not note the expected  taxpayer contribution.  </P> <P> $600 Billion: A more cynical long-term estimate offered by some thrift industry  observers.  </P> <P> These totals, however, exaggerate the real cost to the government of the  bailout. The Bush Administration originally estimated that it would take about  $90 billion in cash if all the depositors in failed S&amp;Ls were paid off  immediately. Independent analyst Bert Ely, whose estimates have proved more  accurate than those of the government, believes that about $125 billion in cash  would cover the costs of closing all failed institutions.  </P></p>

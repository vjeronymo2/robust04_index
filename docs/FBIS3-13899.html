The US is still in the process of  fully coming to terms with its status as the unchallenged global  power. There is, however, one area where there are not only no  signs of departure from the old cold war approach, but positive  evidence of efforts to perpetuate and even enhance the  traditional anti-Indian thrust of American policy in South Asia.  This was clearly hinted by the Raphels and Mallots of the State  Department last year that they were meant to prepare the way for  a clear-cut anti-Indian edge to US policy now seems obvious from  the Clinton administration's stubborn reluctance to heed the  decision of Congress to persist with the Pressler Amendment.  Since then Senator Pressler has found it necessary to reiterate,  more vehemently than before, his charge that the administration  plans to resume military sales to Pakistan banned by the 1985  amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. Pressler's assertion  that Pentagon is trying to achieve the aim of effectively  removing the amendment through the back-door, namely, by making  a "one-time exception" has now been confirmed by Robin Raphel in  her deposition before the Ackerman sub-committee. The  "exception" aims to clear the long-standing proposal to sell 71  F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan. Pressler has warned that the  withdrawal of the only piece of non-proliferation legislation  will have disastrous consequences.    Before the Soviet Union crumbled in a heap, the rationale  behind US mollycoddling of successive Pakistani military  dictators was a blind hatred of the "evil empire" that played  footsie with socialists in New Delhi. It would have been logical  if in today's unipolar context, Washington no longer found it  worth its while to accord preferential status to Pakistan. After  all, in purely economic terms the lure of an untapped Indian  market is worth more than the price of courting one Benazir  Bhutto. However, precisely the opposite is happening.    It is to be hoped that no security wiseacre will emerge in  New Delhi to underplay the proposed sabotage of the Pressler  Amendment as nothing but a ploy to prevent Lockheed, the  manufacturers of F- 16, from going under. It is some reassurance  that Narasimha Rao bluntly told Senator Pressler last month that  the removal of the Amendment would force India to review its  defence policy. The Prime Minister was, however, being  characteristically mild. The antics of the Clinton  administration call for an entire revision of Indian foreign  policy to take into account the threat from a democratic, but no  less "evil empire". Diplomacy is one facet of the  counter-offensive, but New Delhi may also find it prudent to  retaliate in other ways, namely by curbing its slavish  endorsement of US economic hegemonism. There are risks, but  India must be prepared to take them.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Cut in French overnight rate fails to impress AFTER the European exchange rate excitement and bond market rallies of the last week, the continental fixed-income markets slipped back yesterday on disappointment at the lack of any substantial interest rate cuts. The Banque de France snipped 25 basis points off its overnight rate, from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent. But, much to the market's disappointment, it left the five-to-10-day rate unchanged at 10 per cent, and the bond market edged lower. Some analysts had expected to see the five-to-10-day rate lowered to 7.75 per cent - where it was before the ERM crisis - and many market participants were disappointed that the central bank had not acted more swiftly to bring down interest rates, given the new 15 per cent fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism. The Matif's September futures contract ended at 121.92, down 0.18, while the 10-year OAT yielded 6.37 per cent, against 6.36 per cent at its previous close. GERMANY started the day on an upbeat note, with the Liffe bund futures contract opening at 97.26 and quickly reaching its high of the day at 97.36. However, bunds drifted lower as the market digested weekend press comments from Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank council member. Mr Gaddum warned against growing German rate cut hopes and added that it was by no means certain that the Bundesbank would set a variable rate tender for securities repurchase funds this week. Dealers said the market would be watching this week's repo closely to see if the rate fell from last week's minimum rate on one-month repo funds of 6.70 per cent - five basis points below the discount rate. FOLLOWING Congressional approval of President Bill Clinton's first budget, US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the market, sending long yields to new record lows yesterday. In late trading, trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up at 108 9/16 , yielding 6.469 per cent, a new all-time low. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.050 per cent. Prices firmed from the start, buoyed by last Friday's approval by the Senate of Mr Clinton's deficit-reduction package. Traders also reported strong interest from overseas investors, especially by the Brazilian government, which was said to need zero-coupon bonds to collateralise its debt agreement with commercial banks. Although Brazil later denied it had been buying zero coupons, dealers speculated that the US Treasury may have been in the market on Brazil's behalf. Sentiment was also aided by expectations of good demand at this week's auction of Dollars 11bn in 30-year bonds. It will be the last bond auction this year, and investors are said to be keen on the issue in spite of low interest rates. The bond was at a record low yield of 6.428 per cent in when-issued trading yesterday. THE combination of sterling weakness and new supply initially depressed the UK gilts market, although prices later recovered and the Liffe futures contract ended the day little changed at 111.15. Dealers said the July producer price data, released yesterday, was in line with market expectations, confirming the favourable inflation background. However, the Bank of England's announcement on Friday afternoon of a total of Pounds 1.5bn in assorted tap stocks dampened sentiment, according to some dealers. JAPANESE government bonds made strong gains, responding favourably to news of the US Senate's approval of President Clinton's deficit-cutting proposals and positive statements on the domestic front by the new finance minister. Comments by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister in new prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition cabinet, also helped to lift the market. Mr Fujii said that he opposed issuing deficit-financing bonds in order to fund a cut in income tax. The September futures contract rallied to close at 111.60, the highest level since late February, having opened at 111.13. In the cash market, the benchmark 10-year issue ended at a yield of 4.125 per cent, having ranged between 4.115 and 4.185 per cent.</p>

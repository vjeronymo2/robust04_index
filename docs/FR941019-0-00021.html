			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim final rule differs from the May 6, 1992 Interim Rule in several ways: (1) It implements several statutory changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and not reflected in the May 6 1992 interim final rule; (2) It implements a number of statutory changes made to the AHDP by the enactment of the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act and the Completion Act; (3) It further clarifies RTC policies relating to the disposition of assets within the AHDP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The RTC received written comments on the May 6, 1992 Interim Rule only from Public Citizen, Inc. Many of the recommendations have been incorporated in this interim final rule. Descriptions of specific comments, and several changes made in response thereto, are included in the following discussion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following are the principal changes being made to the regulations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The definitions of eligible condominium property, eligible multifamily property and eligible single family property are modified to substitute specific value limits for the former references to various sections of the National Housing Act of 1934, as amended (National Housing Act). In order to implement section 12 of the Completion Act, the definitions of eligible condominium property and eligible single family property are modified to permit specific maximum values higher than those set by the National Housing Act so long as Congress has appropriated funds for such purpose. To implement section 601 of the Refinancing Act, the definition of eligible multifamily property is modified to permit the inclusion of conservatorship properties, if Congress appropriates funds for that purposes. Public Citizen, Inc. requested that the definition of eligible multifamily property be extended generally to include otherwise eligible conservatorship properties. In view of section 12 of the Completion Act, this interim final rule goes as far in that direction as the RTC believes is permissible without a Congressional appropriation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Section 14(a) of the Completion Act is implemented in this interim final rule by a requirement that the RTC send notices to clearinghouses of the availability for sale of certain properties which are ``ineligible'' under the AHDP program. ``Ineligible properties'' include (a) properties that would otherwise be eligible condominium property or eligible single family property, but have values above the applicable AHDP limits and within certain higher limits set forth in the statute (if Congress has not appropriated funds to include such properties as eligible), and (b) properties that would be eligible multifamily property but for being owned by the RTC in its capacity as conservator (if Congress has not appropriated funds to include such properties as eligible). The clearinghouse is required to make such notice available to qualifying purchasers, as well as other purchasers, as appropriate and technical assistance advisors are permitted to perform a similar function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Consistent with the interim and final statements of policy discussed above, the definition of lower-income occupancy requirement(s) applicable to eligible multifamily properties sold in a bulk sale is revised to require that at least 15 percent of the units in each property must be made available for low- or very low-income families. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The marketing period continues to be 97 days for eligible single family property, but the definition permits a longer marketing period to the extent Congress appropriates funds for such purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Section 14(d) of the Completion Act is being implemented to increase participation by minority-owned and women-owned businesses in the AHDP. The interim final rule requires that brokers and RTC staff provide, to a wide range of minority-owned and women-owned businesses and minority-controlled nonprofit organizations, each engaged in providing affordable housing, information concerning the availability of purchase money loans under section 21A(c)(6)(A)(ii) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1441a(c)(6)(A)(ii)). Clearinghouses and technical assistance advisors are also authorized to provide such information to such parties. In addition to the explicit requirements, the interim final rule includes various definitions concerning this aspect of the AHDP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The definition of nonprofit organization is modified to limit the opportunity for for-profit individuals or entities to benefit from such status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The definition of public agency is clarified to include entities operating under executive, legislative or judicial authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Consistent with current RTC directive, the interim final rule requires that the RTC send clearinghouses notices containing information concerning properties with appraised values or values determined by the RTC which exceed the applicable AHDP values. These properties (including the ``ineligible'' single family and condominium properties discussed in paragraph (2) above) will not be marketed or sold as a part of the AHDP, and may be sold to any purchaser if the sales price exceeds the applicable maximum AHDP value. However, if the sales price falls below the applicable maximum value, these ``non-AHDP properties'' may only be sold, initially, to a qualifying purchaser. This change is consistent with a suggestion made by Public Citizen, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) The RTC's authority to issue a second Notice of Marketing Period for unsold properties has been expanded to cover single family properties and condominium units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) The provisions concerning eligible multifamily properties are being clarified to reflect that if a purchaser makes a commitment to reserve a higher proportion of properties for very low income families, that commitment must be reflected in the LURA for such property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) The provisions concerning rent restrictions applicable to AHDP properties are being clarified to reflect that family size adjustments for purposes of determining rent will be based on unit size, rather than household size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) The provisions describing the property listing which must accompany a Notice of Marketing Period are being revised to conform more closely to statutory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) In order to implement section 609 of the Refinancing Act, the RTC will be required to establish a net realizable market value for an eligible multifamily property, which value will be a minimum sales price in all cases, except for expedited sales to public agencies or nonprofit organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14) Clarification and an addition examples are provided as to the preference given, with respect to the bulk sale of eligible condominium properties, to sales that will benefit the larger number of very low- and low-income households. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (15) The provisions concerning bulk sales of eligible condomium property and eligible multifamily property are modified to permit the RTC, when a bulk package is being marketed, to sell individual properties to qualifying purchasers. Public Citizen, Inc. had suggested such a revision with respect to eligible multifamily property. This interim final rule goes a step further by making a similar revision with respect to eligible condominium property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (16) The provision which specifies the information to be provided in reports to Congress concerning the AHDP, has been revised so that it more closely tracks the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (17) The provision of &sect;1609.11 which addresses public agencies that acquire properties under the AHDP has been expanded to specify the particular lower-income requirements that apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

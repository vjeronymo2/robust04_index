			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Russian talks may lead to poll PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's constitutional convention is more likely to produce temporary legislation for early elections and a new division of powers rather than a new constitution. 'It's realistic, I think, and it could be the greatest success the meeting could achieve,' said Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, one of the leaders of the Civic Union alliance, which has the support of many managers of state-owned factories. The same conclusion emerged from remarks by other delegates as the convention, which is attempting to resolve Russia's power struggle, yesterday began discussing Mr Yeltsin's draft constitution in five separate working groups at the Kremlin. Delegates opposed to Mr Yeltsin signed statements of protest after the president refused to let his chief rival, the parliamentary chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, address the opening session on Saturday. Mr Khasbulatov stormed out amid chaotic scenes. Parliamentary leaders were huddled in the office of Mr Khasbulatov yesterday for talks on what to do next. In a growing rebellion, eight senior members of the 32-member ruling praesidium have complained about his dictatorial style and his failure to draw the right conclusions from Mr Yeltsin's referendum victory last month. The problem is the Congress of People's Deputies, the only legitimate vehicle for adopting a new constitution, which would see itself abolished. Early elections, however, not foreseen by the present constitution, would fill a new assembly which could legitimately adopt a constitution. An alliance of moderate nationalists claimed yesterday to have won the most votes in Latvia's first parliamentary elections since the Baltic republic regained its independence less than two years ago. However, many of its large Russian-speaking minority were excluded from the vote.</p>

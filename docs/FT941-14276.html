			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Patten opposes referendum on reform plans Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday voiced opposition to a referendum on political development, saying it would serve little purpose and would be bitterly opposed by Beijing. Mr Patten offered a spirited defence of his attempts to broaden the democratic franchise as he faced more than two hours of questioning from a House of Commons foreign affairs select committee. He appealed to Beijing to resume negotiations, which broke down in November on his proposals on arrangements for elections to be held this year and in 1995. Mr Patten said that, with opinion polls consistently backing his plans, a referendum would reveal little new. It was in any case up to the Legislative Council to decide on electoral procedure. He also noted that China was 'completely neuralgic' on the question. 'I'm not in the business of trying to tweak the Chinese tail.' Mr Patten said a referendum would also unnecessarily polarise opinion in Hong Kong. 'I've got enough experience never to say never but I'm not disposed to believe that it would be the right way forward for Hong Kong.' Questions from members of the UK parliament revealed a difference in priorities from their last report in 1989, which recommended direct elections to LegCo be drastically speeded up. Instead, they exhibited concern that Mr Patten's more modest attempts to widen the franchise only of indirectly elected seats had been too confrontational and made without sufficient consultation with Beijing. Some questions reflected criticisms of Mr Patten which the committee recently heard from Sir Percy Cradock, a retired senior diplomat, who described the governor's approach as reckless and counter-productive. Mr Patten rejected Sir Percy's allegation that he had refused Beijing's request for consultations on his proposals. He said Sir Percy, arguing for settlement with Beijing on the best terms available, failed to specify exactly what he would be prepared to settle for.</p>

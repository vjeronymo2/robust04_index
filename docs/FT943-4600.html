			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Business channel aimed at City Flextech, the fast-growing media group controlled by Tele-Communications, the largest cable television operator in the US, and Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, will today announce the creation of a European Business Channel. It is believed that the two companies are prepared to invest as much as Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.2m) in the venture and that an agreement has been reached with Videotron, the cable company, to carry the service to the City of London. The London-based channel, to be launched in the first quarter of next year, will start transmitting 18 hours a day before moving to a 24-hour-a-day service. It will be carried on the Eutelsat satellite system and will broadcast to cable networks and satellite dishes all over Europe. The plan is to launch a dual service - a conventional service of business news and features with material from Dow Jones business television channels in the US and the Asian Business Channel in which TCI is an investor. There will also be a more specialist digital service to be broadcast direct to the computer screens of market professionals. This is likely to compete with Reuters Financial Television, which runs a service aimed at foreign exchange, debt and treasury financial markets in London.</p>

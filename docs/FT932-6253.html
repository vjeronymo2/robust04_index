			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sanderson Murray to expand with Pounds 14m buy SANDERSON Murray &amp; Elder, the Yorkshire-based motor distributor, yesterday announced a Pounds 17.1m rights issue to fund the takeover of Skipper Group, another northern motor distributor and part of RTZ, the mining group. Sanderson is paying Pounds 14m in cash for Skipper. It will repay Pounds 11.8m of inter-company debt to RTZ to be replaced with bank borrowings from Barclays. SME's gearing, currently 26 per cent, will rise to 61 per cent after the acquisition, but is projected to fall to 50 per cent by the year end. Mr Tony Bramall, SME executive chairman, said the acquisition would more than double the number of dealerships that SME owned and would add three new manufacturers to its portfolio of franchises. The 10-for-9 rights of 17.4m new shares is priced at 102p. The shares rose 3p yesterday to close at 120p. Directors of SME have agreed to take up 4.6m shares and the balance - underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd - has been placed with institutional investors. Mr Bramall's 51.7 per cent beneficial holding will fall to 38.1 per cent of the enlarged company. Skipper was founded in 1961 and floated in 1964. The company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.05m on turnover of Pounds 196m in 1992. The loss stemmed materially from the company's contract hire car division which stopped taking on new business in August 1991. Some contracts have up to two years still to run. Skipper, which has net assets of Pounds 14.2m, made an operating profit of Pounds 900,000 after providing Pounds 596,000 exceptional charges against the closure of its commercial vehicle businesses. Interest charges amounted to Pounds 1.5m.</p>

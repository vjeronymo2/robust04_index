			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILLIES TRADE BEDROSIAN TO GIANTS, SAMUEL TO METS  </P> <P> The Philadelphia Phillies, who began Sunday as the worst team in baseball,  traded former All-Stars Steve Bedrosian and Juan Samuel in separate deals that  could make a major difference in both National League races.  </P> <P> San Francisco got Bedrosian, the 1987 Cy Young winner, and a player to be named  later for pitchers Terry Mulholland and Dennis Cook and minor league third  baseman Charlie Hayes. The Giants lead the Western Division by one game.  </P> <P> The New York Mets, unable to lure power hitters Joe Carter or Danny Tartabull,  obtained Samuel. The Mets, two games behind Chicago in the East, sent center  fielder Len Dykstra and pitcher Roger McDowell to Philadelphia.  </P> <P> "I know that they're trying to make some headway and make things happen and you  can't blame them for that," Bedrosian, 31, said of the Phillies.  </P> <P> Bedrosian, Samuel, Dykstra and McDowell each has had an off-year.  </P> <P> Bedrosian, who had 40 saves in 1987 and 28 last year, has six this season. He  was 2-3 with a 3.21 earned-run average and had gotten few save opportunities.  </P> <P> Samuel, 28, had been shifted to center field this season after playing second  base his entire career. He is batting .246 with eight home runs and 20 runs  batted in.  </P> <P> McDowell, 28, had lost his job as the Mets' right-handed closer to Rick  Aguilera. McDowell is 1-5 with four saves and a 3.31 ERA.  </P> <P> Dykstra, 26, did not like being platooned in center with Mookie Wilson. Dykstra  is hitting .270 with three homers and 13 RBIs.  </P></p>

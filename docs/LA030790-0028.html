"It's a little bittersweet."  </P> <P> Foster, who announced last fall that this season would be his last with the  Hurricanes, had a 78-71 record at Miami. His teams failed to earn a postseason  bid and attendance was rarely more than 3,000.  </P> <P> Sophomore Jerome Scott scored a career-high 22 points for the Hurricanes.  </P> <P> Cesar Bocachica had 19 points for the Golden Panthers (7-21).  </P> <P> TOURNAMENTS  </P> <P> Missouri Valley  </P> <P> Illinois State 81, Southern Illinois 78 -- Rickey Jackson made three free  throws in the final 1:26 as the Redbirds (18-12) upset the Salukis (26-7) at  Normal, Ill., giving Illinois State an NCAA tournament berth.  </P> <P> East Coast  </P> <P> Towson State 73, Lehigh 60 -- Kurk Lee scored 22 points to lead the Tigers to  the championship at Towson, Md., and their first NCAA tournament berth.  </P> <P> Devin Boyd added 13 points for the Tigers (18-12).  </P> <P> Dozie Mbonu scored 23 points to lead Lehigh (18-12).  </P></p>

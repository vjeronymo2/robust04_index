			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Compaq faces 'additional challenge' from IBM PC COMPAQ'S third-quarter sales rose by 50 per cent to Dollars 1.06bn, from Dollars 709m in the same period last year, in stark contrast to IBM's 'substantial decline' in PC sales, reported last week. Compaq's net income for the quarter was Dollars 49m, or 61 cents per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 70m in the third quarter of 1991 when the company took a pre-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 135m. 'Compaq shipped worldwide a record number of PCs in the third quarter, including over 200,000 in September alone, yet we entered the fourth quarter with a sizeable backlog,' said Mr Pfeiffer. 'We are getting much better at forecasting demand,' he added, 'and expect to begin meeting current demand on most products during the fourth quarter.' 'Despite our continuing market share gains, Compaq is fully aware of the fiercely competitive market that lies ahead and we are committed to take decisive and timely actions necessary to ensure continued success,' said Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive. IBM's launch of its new ValuePoint range of PCs yesterday, with prices for fully configured systems including a colour monitor starting at Dollars 1,299, 'is clearly an additional challenge,' Mr Pfeiffer said. On Monday, Compaq lowered US prices on several of its popular desktop and notebook personal computers in advance of IBM's anticipated ValuePoint product introductions. IBM also said it planned to match price cuts by competitors and the company adjusted the prices of its new ValuePoint products on the eve of their introduction in response to Compaq's price cuts. For the first nine months of 1992, Compaq reported net income of Dollars 124m, or Dollars 1.48 per share, against Dollars 64m, or 72 cents per share, last year. Sales advanced to Dollars 2.7bn from Dollars 2.4bn in the same period last year.</p>

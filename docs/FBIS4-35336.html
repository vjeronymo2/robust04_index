			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, vice </F> chairman of the Presidential Council, to the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY  in Aden; date not given]    [Text] The news media of the aggressive regime in Sanaa  have made it a habit to broadcast statements from some of the  regime's stooges about contacts the regime claims have been made  with those it calls the unionists in the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] and saying that the totalitarian regime in Sanaa is on the  brink of reaching agreement with them. We wish to categorically  confirm the following:    In the YSP there are no unionists or separatists. All are  unionists led by Brother President 'Ali Salim al-Bid who worked  for unity and voluntarily signed the union agreement. The issue  of contacts with any quarter whatsoever could only be legitimate  if they are made with the official state establishments of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen. The Sanaa regime has not made any  such contacts with any state establishments of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen. The YSP Political Bureau clarified this  issue in an official statement issued on 28 April.    These allegations by the Sanaa regime are intended to cause  confusion since that regime has failed militarily and  politically to achieve its dreams of hegemony, domination, and  occupation. We are not advocates of war but advocates of peace  and shall defend the Democratic Republic of Yemen and the lives,  possessions, and honor of its men and women, its people. We are  able, God permitting, to do all this.    We support a permanent cease-fire to save our country and  our  brothers from destruction and bloodletting. This can be  followed by negotiations between the Democratic Republic of  Yemen and the Sanaa regime to define future relations between  the two states.    We are advocates of unity but not on the basis of the former  unity. When a regime emerges in Sanaa believing in justice,  equal citizenship, human rights and all the ideals we cherish  and contained in the pledge and accord document, we shall then  discuss the issue of unity with that regime.</p>

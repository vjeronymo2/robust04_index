The area includes Cancun, Tulum, Cozumel and Isla Mujeres.  </P> <P> Coldwell said visitors to this region spend 70% more per capita than the world  average for tourism spending. Most hotel rooms in Cancun and Cozumel cost at  least $100 U.S. per night.  </P> <P> Antonio Abdon Srabillon, president of the Cancun Hotel Assn., said that hotel  owners have spent $14 million to restore the area since Hurricane Gilbert hit  in September, 1988.  </P> <P> More Mexico: Word is that Mexico will have unleaded gas throughout the nation  before next October. The publication "Mexico Now" also adds that crossing the  border in autos will be smoother in the future since the Mexican Immigration  Department has taken over the issuing of car permits, eliminating a second stop  at customs offices at border crossings.  </P> <P> Easier access: Bahrain has relaxed visa restrictions in a bid to attract more  foreign visitors.  </P> <P> Tourists, businessmen and relatives of residents will receive 7-day or 72-hour  visas automatically if they have valid passports, return air tickets, are not  seeking employment and do not pose a threat to the security, public order or  national interest of Bahrain, according to a government publication.  </P> <P> Immigration officials said the new rules were aimed mainly at foreigners in the  nearby gulf states of Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab  Emirates.  </P></p>

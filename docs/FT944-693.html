			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right product for TV target Sir, I write to congratulate Christopher Dunkley on his excellent and perceptive article regarding MTV (Television: 'For dedicated followers of fashion', December 21). I have two qualifications: First, MTV does occasionally step out of the seamless robe of pop music. It chose to feature one set of elections this year. Predictably, for a channel which embodies the idea of young Europe integrating, it was the June elections to the European parliament. Second, Dunkley cites Kylie Minogue's pop video Confide in Me as indistinguishable from the adverts it carries. That is as may be. But I have been using this particular example in hip speeches which I give to astonished youth audiences, as an example of a new product tailored for a Single European Market. Its use of five screened European languages to evince common teenage sentiments implies a common European youth culture. It is a pity that it is a petite Oz who leads the way in teaching us the fundamentals of business: first know your market then fashion your product appropriately.

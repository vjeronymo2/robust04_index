			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Shchegoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi June 23 TASS -- Abkhazia conditioned on Friday  the beginning of repair works at two major bridges over the  border river of Inguri on firm guarantees that they would not be  used by Georgia for combat purposes.    Deputy Premier Enver Kapba, the chief Abkhazian negotiator  at  the current talks with Georgia, told ITAR-TASS that all repair  works at the motor bridge will start only after Russian  peacekeepers are deployed to separate the conflicting parties.    "As far as the railway bridge is concerned, (Abkhazia) will  start repair works only when the problem of its political status  is settled," Kapba stressed.    The deputy premier told TASS that Abkhazia had handed over  to  the Georgian side a list of valuables removed from the Abkhazian  territory during the war. The list included aircraft, sea  vessels, motor vehicles, factory equipment and museum rarities  among other things.    "To continue our dialogue, it is essential that the Georgian  side reimburse at least a part of that damage," Kapba said.</p>

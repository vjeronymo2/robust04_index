			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Kenyan opposition rally draws huge support MR Martin Shikuku, interim secretary of Kenya's opposition Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD), addresses at the weekend the country's biggest political rally in two decades (above). About 200,000 people were urged to vote out President Daniel arap Moi in elections expected later this year. FORD was registered as a party earlier this month after Mr Moi's Kenya African National Union government in December bowed to mounting international and domestic pressure and switched to pluralism, ending more than two decades of one-party rule, Reuter reports from Nairobi. Several new groups have already been formed but FORD appears to command the most opposition support from Kenya's multi-ethnic population of 24m. Political analysts said the rally's turnout - one of the biggest since independence from Britain in 1963 - illustrated the growing threat to Mr Moi's 12-year rule.</p>

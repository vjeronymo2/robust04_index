			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 May (NA) -- Progressive Democratic  Party [PDP] Deputy Alberto Natale emphasized today that U.S.  Ambassador to Argentina James Cheek "should be declared persona  non grata over his obvious meddling in the domestic affairs" of  our country.    Natale criticized Cheek's position of "putting forth  pressure, with all the means at his disposal, to effect changes  in the patents law which would make it conform with the  aspirations of U.S. pharmaceutical laboratories."    In a press communique, the legislator says: "The ambassador  is confusing an expression of his compatriots' hopes of trade  interests with the implementation of pressure through blunt  threats, over the possibility that Congress will not fulfill  their aspirations."    The PDP congressmen bloc leader noted: "An old Louisiana  state law from the last century established that pressures are  being exercised every time efforts are made to achieve results  on a government decision by using any means other than resorting  to reason."    In this regard, Natale said: "This is exactly what Cheek is  doing and what, within diplomatic circles, is described as the  right of the recipient country [pais recipiendario] to declare  the official doing this as persona non grata."    Concerning the patents law, Natale indicated that we  Argentines "have been governed by Law No. 111 since 1864, a law  that we will change when the appropriate constitutional agencies  decide to do so, and not when it coincides with the interests of  foreign laboratories."</p>

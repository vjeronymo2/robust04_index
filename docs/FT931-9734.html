			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Moment of truth arrives for Opec - Oil traders are waiting to see if producer backing for a substantial output cut is more than just brave talk WHEN MINISTERS from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet tomorrow in Vienna, they will be faced with tough decisions on cutting oil output if they are to fulfil expectations of traders in the oil market. The traders are looking for a cut of at least 1m barrels a day in production and will push prices down in a spiral of disappointment if that is not agreed. But ministers may be encouraged in their discussions by the similarities between the market situation now and during the same period last year. Then, in a similar pattern to this year, oil prices slumped in the first quarter, forcing the producers' club to cut back its output ceiling by 1m b/d. Discord at last year's meeting caused much criticism of the deal, but demand held up later in the quarter and prices firmed. Opec cannot afford to be too complacent, however, as market expectations of a substantial cut in output are high. Mr Joe Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates said this week that prices could fall by as much as Dollars 2 a barrel if Opec members failed to institute a production cut of 1m b/d. The market is looking to Opec to rein in output to about 23.5m b/d, a cut of just over 1m b/d from the present ceiling of 24.58m b/d. But since members are producing some 25m b/d, they will have to cut actual output further. Mr Stanislaw said: 'the market no longer has any confidence in Opec to come up with an agreement that they will abide by. . . if they don't deliver (the 1m b/d cut), the market will give no credence to what they say'. Prices tumbled in the first quarter as market traders saw that Opec nations were not sticking by their November accord to cut output. But prices have been stronger in recent weeks following an initiative by Opec president, Mr Alirio Parra, who is Venezuela's minister of energy and mining, to persuade his colleagues to agree a cut. Mr Parra's tour of Opec capitals produced a strong show of political will for a production cut; but this must now be followed through with a tight accord. Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, the London brokers, believes the political will among members is good, but the arithmetic remains tricky. He is more optimistic about oil demand and believes the market can absorb just over 24m b/d in the second quarter as US consumption picks up. He expects US demand to improve by almost 2 per cent this year as recovery gets under way, but world demand will still be slow to pick up, rising by no more than 1 per cent for the year. Mr Youssef bin Omeir bin Youssef, United Arab Emirates' oil minister expressed Opec's high hopes of a price recovery yesterday when he said a 1m b/d cut in output for the second quarter would be enough to raise oil prices by at least Dollars 1 a barrel. The hopes of market traders and member nations are high: Opec now faces the tough bargaining that must accompany any cut in production.</p>

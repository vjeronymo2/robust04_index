			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / A choice between coffee and gold bullion Securities firms are bearing the scars of the weakening bond and stock markets - with the Goldman Sachs chairman retiring with 'tiredness' and SG Warburg this week shocking the London stock market with a Monday morning profits warning. But the investment banking community has come up with a timely alternative: commodities. Rising commodity prices erode manufacturers' profit margins and help generate the inflation that eats away at the real returns on bonds. It does not take a genius to work out that commodity prices are inversely correlated to bond and stock returns, although backroom boffins are nevertheless on hand to work out the precise coefficients. The timing is favourable, but all the same it is a tricky task to promote commodities as a respectable asset class that pension fund trustees would want to talk about in polite company. Perhaps that is why firms such as Goldman and JP Morgan are recommending only a cautious pension fund weighting of 5 per cent or so in commodities, although the logic of the optimisation calculations might suggest a considerably higher exposure. JP Morgan is the newcomer here, having just launched its own commodities index - the JPMCI - which is designed to act as a portfolio benchmark. It therefore rivals the already established Goldman Sachs version - the GSCI - which is the benchmark for the first index-tracking commodities fund, currently being launched by Barclays de Zoete Wedd as an offshore closed-end vehicle. There is an attempt here to shift commodities investment away from the traditional emphasis upon short-term price speculation and fit it within a long-term investment framework. A total return concept has been developed in which three kinds of return are generated. The price return is derived from the familiar risky exposure to the volatility of commodity values (moderated by diversification). The roll return comes from holding long positions and repeatedly rolling them over. Finally there is the collateral return, usually taken as the yield on an investment in US Treasury bills (the BZW fund will hold alternative short-term debt instruments to earn slightly more). Commodity markets still have some way to go to achieve complete respectability. Cowboys still abound in the shadowy world of speculative offshore futures funds, where charges sometimes run to 2 per cent a month, with a share of profits as well. Charges on the BZW fund, it should be said, are 1.25 per cent a year. The key feature here is benchmarking, which is familiar to institutional investors and allows a comparison with the returns earned on other asset classes. However, commodity indices remain a potentially dangerous area for the unwary. Whereas the Economist index has risen by more than 30 per cent this year, and hit a high on September 20, the widely-followed Commodities Research Bureau index is barely higher than on January 1, having peaked on June 17. These are price returns only. The JPMCI shows a total return of 23.5 per cent so far this year. It all depends on what you put into your commodity basket and how you construct the index. The CRB Index is equally weighted. The GSCI, however, is designed on the basis of economic weightings according to the value of world production - energy accounts for just over 50 per cent, 'soft' agricultural commodities about 40 per cent, base metals 6 per cent and precious metals only about 3 per cent. As for the JPMCI, it is designed to have particularly high negative correlations with bond and stock returns. It has a precious metals content of 23 per cent and no 'softs'. So the JPMCI has ignored the coffee price boom and the GSCI would scarcely register a bull market in gold. As ever, therefore, exposure to commodities is something of a hot potato. Undoubtedly there are speculative opportunities in commodities in the later stages of a global economic upturn. The timing is right. But for long-term investment institutions to get involved on a more permanent basis, they must have a very powerful need to reduce the volatility of their returns. And they will have to be careful about benchmarks: there is scarcely any gold in Goldman.</p>

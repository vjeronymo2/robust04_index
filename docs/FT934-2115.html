			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Vard sells two cruise companies AEA Investors, a secretive investment company run by senior figures from the US corporate world, is to pay Dollars 565m to acquire two up-market cruise liner companies from Vard, the loss-hit Norwegian group. Vard said its Miami-based subsidiary Kloster Cruise had signed a letter of intent with AEA for the sale of Royal Viking Line and Royal Cruise Line, which respectively operate two and three ships mainly on Caribbean cruises for American holiday-makers. The Norwegian group, which also operates two ferry lines in Europe, said the move would enable Kloster to concentrate on strengthening its position in the mass cruise market, through its remaining Norwegian Cruise Line operation, in a bid to restore profitability. AEA Investors is a privately-held New York venture capital and leveraged buy-out investment group whose shareholders consist mostly of wealthy former chief executives and chairmen of blue-chip US corporations. Mr Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, is also reported to be a member of the group. Since the early 1970s, when AEA was formed as a private investment vehicle for some of the wealthiest families in the US (including the Rockefellers, Mellons and du Ponts), the group has been acquiring small and medium-sized companies, mostly through leveraged buy-outs. It then ran them for a while before selling or floating them on the stock markets, often for a large profit. AEA's most recent deal was the Dollars 315m acquisition in September of the California-based Sola eyeglass lens business from UK group Pilkington. Losses have mounted recently at Vard, hitting NKr149m (Dollars 20.1m) in the first nine months of this year, compared with a loss of NKr3.23m in the same period last year. Part of its problem has been exposure to the four- and five-star segments of the cruise market, which have been the least profitable parts of the cruise industry in recent years. It intends to build on its present 12-15 per cent market share in the more profitable three-star market by acquiring at least two new or used ships to add to Norwegian Cruise Line's fleet of seven. However, analysts said Kloster would continue to face stiff competition from its bigger, better-capitalised rivals such as Carnival of the US, Royal Caribbean, a US-Norwegian operator, and Princess Cruises, a unit of P&amp;O of the UK. The deal with AEA involves AEA assuming Dollars 60m in advanced ticket sales, and a new ship commissioned by Royal Cruise due to come into service in early 1994. It will replace an older ship, which is not included in the sale. The restructuring of Kloster had been widely discounted in Oslo, pushing up Vard's share price by some 50 per cent over the past two weeks. It closed yesterday up NKr2 at NKr60.</p>

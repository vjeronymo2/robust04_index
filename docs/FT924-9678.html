			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (5): Waiting in the wings - Profile of Jean-Claude Juncker AT 37, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker is a young man seemingly in no hurry to assume what most Luxembourgers take for granted will be his destiny - to become prime minister, perhaps for a decade or two. The Grand Duchy's finance minister (he also holds the labour and social security portfolio), Mr Juncker has enjoyed a fast-track ascent through the ranks of government and of his Christian Social party - mirroring those of the current premier, Mr Jacques Santer, and his predecessor Mr Pierre Werner. But Mr Santer, aged 55, appears in no great haste to hand over the reins of power, and there has been widespread speculation that Mr Juncker might take a sabbatical as an EC commissioner in Brussels, starting at the beginning of next year. The suggestion was made to the Luxembourg government by Mr Jacques Delors. The Commission president was apparently impressed by Mr Juncker's performance during Luxembourg's EC presidency in the first half of 1991, when he helped steer negotiations on economic and monetary union (Emu) towards agreement in Maastricht, and brokered agreement on harmonisation of indirect taxes, a vital element of the single-market programme. The putative commissioner is non-committal about his future: 'It's up to the government to decide, and I am not privy to all its secrets.' If Mr Juncker does not, after all, go to Brussels, it may be because there is no obvious replacement capable of filling his shoes at the finance ministry. Born in the small town of Redange-sur-Attert, on the Belgian border, he inherited a taste for politics from his uncle, a Christian Social party MP and mayor of the northern city of Ettelbruck. Like many Luxembourg politicians, he has a degree in law (from Strasbourg), but has never practised. After leaving university, his first job was as parliamentary secretary for his party, and it was from this position that he was abruptly brought into government in December 1980, at the age of 28. Initially secretary of state (junior minister) for labour and social security, Mr Juncker was promoted to full minister in 1984. He inherited the finance ministry, one traditional stepping stone on the way to the premiership, five years later, and another, the chairmanship of his party, two years ago. The nearest thing he has known to a setback to his career was a serious car accident in 1989, in which he suffered a broken leg and collarbone. According to those who know him well, the accident has enhanced Mr Juncker's already strong sense of public duty, even mission, as well as his confidence in his own ability to carry this out. He presents a somewhat austere public image. Unlike many of his ministerial colleagues, he is no social glad-hander, and is notably frank and direct in conversation - something which has tended to make Mr Juncker a lightning rod for criticism from the domestic political opposition. Two years ago, when he introduced a realignment of personal income tax rates, he was singled out for attack because certain taxpayers, who had been favoured under the previous system, notably widows and divorced and separated women, found themselves less well off. Last December he was again in the front line, when Luxembourg decided to implement a reshuffle of VAT rates, intended to meet post-1992 EC requirements, a year ahead of schedule. But the personal criticism seems to leave him unmoved. Now, Mr Juncker has a new challenge - to bring home to Luxembourgers the fact that the free-spending days of the 1980s are over, as the 1990 tax reform and economic slowdown plunges the government budget into deficit for the first time since 1984. He says: 'I don't have the impression that (my) analysis has been much listened to during the past few years. I don't think politicians, or Luxembourgers themselves, have really understood that the fat years are over  -or even members of the government.' The message may be getting through, with Mr Juncker's draft budget for 1993, which takes an axe to or defers several big public works projects, including a new motorway, a national indoor sports centre and, most notably, the controversial modern art museum designed by IM Pei. It is a source of pride to Mr Juncker that Luxembourg is one of the handful of EC members which meets the Maastricht criteria for membership of the single-currency club, and he intends prudence to remain the watchword: 'Greece, Belgium and other countries show what happens when public spending gets out of hand.' He is a strong supporter of European union - and also of the EC Commission, which he views as a vital bulwark for the smaller EC nations against being steamrollered by their bigger neighbours. Mr Juncker has little time for politicians who blame the Commission and its supposed meddling for domestic problems. 'The Commission proposes, the Council disposes,' he says, and to suggest otherwise is 'mediocre thinking'. No wonder Mr Delors wants him in Brussels.</p>

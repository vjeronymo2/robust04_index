The Chinese official's remarks strongly hinted that North  Korea may be ready to accept international inspections. The  official also disclosed that China is poised to cooperate with  the new economic policy that North Korea has adopted.    China has publicly taken a neutral position on the North  Korean nuclear issue. In fact, however, China is said to have  urged North Korea to accept international inspections. The  Chinese official was confident of progress in U.S.-North Korea  dialogue, saying, "Compared with the situation six months ago,  (U.S.-North Korea) dialogue is making steady headway."    He also said: "The Workers' Party of Korea recently held a  plenary session of its Central Committee to adopt a very  important policy of rebuilding North Korea and its economy.  This policy is noteworthy." The official spoke highly of the  "three-first policy North Korea has adopted to develop trade,  agriculture and light industry."    The high-ranking Chinese official said: "I believe that  China will continue to develop its normal, cooperative relations  with North Korea based on the principle of equality and  reciprocity."    His comments made it clear for the first time that China  will  cooperate with North Korea in rebuilding Pyongyang's economy.</p>

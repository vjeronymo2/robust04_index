			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / US pressed over new laws on shipping The European shipping nations and Japan are stepping up lobbying of the US administration over proposed legislation which could damage non-US shipping interests. The legislation would impose penalties on countries which subsidise their shipbuilding and require ships serving US ports to apply US labour laws. The Consultative Shipping Group, an informal lobbying organisation representing 14 shipping nations, aims to increase pressure on the US administration, Mr Roger Clarke, its chairman, said. 'We wish to warn the US that if they persist with these measures they run the risk of endangering international shipping,' said Mr Clarke, who is also head of shipping policy at the UK department of transport. Concern about possible US retaliation against nations which subsidise their shipbuilding follows the adjournment earlier last month of OECD talks aimed at restricting shipbuilding subsidies. These talks are to resume in Paris on March 14-18. Failure to reach agreement could strengthen pressure for implementation of the Gibbons Bill, at present before Congress, and the Breaux Bill, before the Senate. Both seek to impose penalties on nations which subsidise shipbuilding. The second area of legislation is the Clay Bill, which would require vessels serving US ports to employ crews according to US labour laws and pay US labour rates, which would severely affect cruise shipping. The group is also worried about tough environmental conditions on tankers serving US ports.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Opposition groups agree on new party to fight Murayama Leaders of five reformist opposition groups in the Japanese parliament yesterday agreed in principle to form a single party aimed at regaining power from the old-guard coalition which won office last month. They plan to choose a name and resolve policy issues before the Diet meets again in September. The five include three former prime ministers - Mr Morihiro Hosokawa of the Japan New party, who headed a seven-member coalition formed a year ago, his successor Mr Tsutomu Hata of the Japan Renewal party, and Mr Toshiki Kaifu. Mr Kaifu, the most recent of the three to have defected from the right-wing Liberal Democratic party, which ran Japan for 47 years until last summer, served as LDP premier in 1989-91. For the past month Mr Kaifu has sat as an independent but has formed a parliamentary grouping called Koshi Kai. His former party is back in government in alliance with the Social Democratic party, the LDP's traditional rival, and the New Harbinger party, which had been a member of the previous two ruling coalitions. The other two members of the nascent political force are Mr Koshiro Ishida's Buddhist-backed Komeito, the clean government party, and Mr Takashi Yonezawa's Democratic Socialist party. Mr Yonezawa said last night it would take time to build consensus on policy issues and form a solid organisation. His party has at various times been close both to the SDP and the LDP. Together the five would have some 188 seats in the present 511-seat Diet. However, the next general election is likely to be fought on redrawn boundaries and with greater use of proportional representation. A government advisory panel is due next week to present proposals to Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the SDP prime minister, on a new electoral map for the country. Mr Hata said last night the new party 'needs to be strong in order to rival the LDP'. But one main motive for a formal merger is that under the new system big parties will qualify for an exponentially larger amount of state funds for campaigning than would be accorded to smaller groups.</p>

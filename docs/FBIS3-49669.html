The problem of the return of refugees, in his view,  must wait for the materialization of a peace agreement.    Akashi stressed that the challenges facing UNPROFOR in  Croatia were greater than those in Cambodia where he had worked  with a UN peace mission. For, he said, the protection force in  Croatia us working both on achieving and keeping peace.  UNPROFOR can do more than it has done so far, Akashi said and  added that Chapter Six of the UN Charter, under which his  mandate in Croatia has taken place, provides sufficient  potential, which have not been harnessed yet.    In this context, Akashi expects firm cooperation with the  Croatian authorities and hopes that some past problems in their  relations will be ironed out. Today, as he announced, Akashi  will talk to Ambassador Gerd Ahrens, a mediator between the  Croatian authorities and UN Protected Areas. The implementation  in practice of the economic and communications reintegration of  these areas in Croatia as a whole will be the main topic of  their talks.</p>

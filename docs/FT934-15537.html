			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (10): On the defensive - The Environment IT IS as much out of self-interest as concern for the country's natural habitat that Finland's forestry industry has got serious over environmental issues. As the world's second biggest exporters of forestry goods, the country's pulp and paper producers have had to respond to customer pressures to clean up their act or risk losing key markets. The green lobby, particularly in central Europe, has been vociferous in calling for tighter environmental standards, and the success of their campaign is openly acknowledged by Finland's senior forestry executives. 'If we rape our forests, pollute our rivers, and dirty our land, customers will say they don't want anything to do with us,' says Mr Jarl Kohler, managing director of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation. A boycott could have a devastating effect on an industry that is already under pressure from adverse market conditions and the trend towards recycling. The Finnish forest industry feels it has been unfairly forced onto the defensive on environmental questions because it is sometimes tarnished with the same brush as countries in tropical climates, which have gained a reputation for reckless destruction of their woodlands. It believes its record on tree-cutting, recycling, and emissions compares favourably with those of its main competitors, Sweden, the US and Canada. Finland has more wood today than ever before, thanks to a policy of 'sustainability'. Planting three or four new seedlings for every tree harvested means the country is growing 80m cubic metres of forestry a year, but only consuming 50m cu m of them. At the same time there have been significant changes to methods of cultivation and harvesting, designed to increase bio-diversity and minimise damage to the landscape. Large areas of forest are now less likely to be cleared at one go; instead, they will be gradually thinned. Harvesting techniques have also changed, with an emphasis on lighter machinery. 'Two-thirds of our forests are in the hands of private owners. It doesn't make sense for them to harm their livelihood,' says Mr Pertti Laine, director of the the federation's industrial and environmental unit. It is sometimes suggested that the recycling movement poses a serious threat to the future of the Finnish forest industry. The threat is overstated, firstly because recycled fibre can only be used for certain types of paper grade, such as newsprint, packaging and tissues, and secondly because there is a limit to the number of times paper can be recycled. With paper consumption continuing to grow, despite worldwide recession, recycling has not has yet had a significant impact on the production of virgin fibre. The Finns see recycling in the wider context of the recycling of carbon. Because trees absorb carbon dioxide, and therefore slow the greenhouse effect, wood is regarded as a perfectly natural recyclable raw material, providing new growth is systematically assured. That is why the Finns get hot under the collar about developments in some European countries, which legally require a certain percentage of magazine paper and newsprint to be produced from recycled sources. This could force Finland to import recycled paper, as its own paper consumption is too small for it to be able to base its production on domestically recycled material. Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, Finnish companies will continue to set up recycling plants close to big population centres in Europe. It is significant that the biggest Finnish forestry investment project announced this year is Enso-Gutzeit's scheme to build a DM800m newsprint plant, based on recycled paper, in the eastern German state of Saxony. Despite the market situation and the heavy losses they have experienced over the past two years, Finnish forestry groups have continued to make significant investments in environmental projects. Last year, environment-related investments totalled FM740m, or 12 per cent of total forest industry investments, compared with FM815m in 1991 and FM775m in 1990. Some 65 per cent of the money was spent on measures to combat water pollution, 33 per cent on air pollution control, and 2 per cent on solid waste management. Added to the investments they have already made over the last 10 years, the Finns can now point to a dramatic lowering of emissions of the major chemical pollutants. Emissions of sulphur dioxide last year were 18,900 tonnes, down 80 per cent since 1980, while emissions of organic chlorine compounds were down 60 per cent on their 1989 level at 4,900 tonnes. At the same time, consumption of chemicals like chlorine has fallen sharply, thanks to the introduction of new bleaching processes. This development has come largely in response to consumer pressure for 'totally chlorine-free' pulp and paper. The process of environmental improvement still has further to go. The next stage will come with the new generation of pulp mills, which will have almost totally enclosed water systems and minimal effluent when they start production in the second half of the decade.</p>

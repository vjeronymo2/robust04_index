"The shots sounded when it had become known that the  Economic  Freedom Party will not join Zyuganov's Communists and  Zhirinovskiy's respectable fascists in signing a document on  civil concord," the union said in its communique released on  Sunday.    According to the communique, the attempt to kill Borovoy "is  the start of red political terror and the first consequence of  the amnesty granted to political criminals and of the discourse  on civil peace and accord with communists and fascists."    The Democratic Union believes that the stand taken by  President Yeltsin will lead in Russia to "democracy without  democrats," who will be removed either "with the help of Soviet  courts -- witness the case of Vil Mirzayanov, or with the help  of political terror, as in the case of Konstantin Borovoy."    In this connection the Democratic Union "gives the Russian  president a month to cancel the amnesty, return the October  rebels to prison, and outlaw the extremist activity of  communists and fascists." Otherwise we shall consider ourselves  free to start forming on April 12th armed units to defend  ourselves, democracy, civilization and the Constitution together  with other radical democratic forces," said the Democratic Union  of Russia in its communique.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Butte Mining cuts loss to Pounds 0.54m Butte Mining, the UK quoted company whose main activity is prosecuting US lawsuits - it is seeking damages of Dollars 975m (Pounds 654m) from former managers and promoters - cut its loss for the year to June from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 540,000. Losses per share narrowed from 4.5p to 0.2p. The company said the reduced deficit resulted from the disposal of lossmaking assets and cost cutting. The company was unable to dispose of its shareholding in VAM, a lossmaking Australian gold producer, and a provisional liquidator was appointed in March. The liquidator has arranged for VAM to be refloated and, if this is completed early next year, Butte will receive about Pounds 350,000.</p>

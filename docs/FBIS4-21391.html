			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Danius Lygis, counsellor of the Parliamentary </F> Environmental Protection Committee: "How and Why the  Administration of the Environmental Protection Should Be  Restructured?"]    [Text] During the last decade not a single area of activity  has experienced so many administrative restructurings as the  protection of nature and then of the environment. There are  various reasons why no room is being found for environmental  protection. The main reason, in my opinion, is that  environmental protection is being constantly confronted to  economics and that is why it is compelled to "run from behind,"  to control and not to form the policies of the development of  state economy.    Only three years have passed since the reorganization, and  again there are plans to restructure the system of environmental  protection. Discussions of the draft law "On the Elimination of  the Department of Environmental Protection of the Republic of  Lithuania and On the Founding of the Ministry of the  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic  of Lithuania" have begun in the Parliament.    This restructuring has both supporters and enemies. Some  complain about haste, others about delay, and a third group is  proposing new variants of restructuring. To form a more  objective opinion, we should briefly survey the present  condition of the management of environmental protection in  Lithuania.    Following the restoration of Lithuania's independence in  1990, the environmentalists anticipated the dangers of the  future reforms and proposed a new model of environmental  protection (although they did not even agree among themselves  which model of administration they should choose). A Department  of Environmental Protection was established and it was  subordinate only to the highest, i.e., law-making power. Yet  such subordination was effective only up to the first obstacle.  For instance, any attempt to correct the activity of the  Department of Environmental Protection or to abolish  disagreements between it and other departments or local  administrations leads to a blind alley -- to put this into  effect, a parliamentary decision is necessary. But the  Parliament already has plenty of work, and a lot of time goes by  until such an organizational question is put on the Parliament's  agenda, except in the case of ecological problems or conflicts  on the national level that would make the Parliament react and  take decisions without delay. If the Department of Environmental  Protection would be part of the Government structure, a  governmental or the Prime Minister's decision would be enough to  take care of many conflicts. But the Parliament reserves the  right to control the activity of any minister and to express  lack of confidence in any minister.    The Department of Environmental Protection is not  functionally connected with the Parliament and only formally  reports to it once a year. The department exists next to the  Government and the Parliament. Because of such gaps that were  left in the model of administration, the institution becomes  unmanageable, begins to live for itself, and the department  loses the direct practical links. In the governmental sessions,  the department's leaders are limited to a mere deliberative  vote. Therefore it happens that the governmental structures  ignore the department's directives. In such cases, it is again  necessary to turn to the Parliament...    The essential shortcoming of this administrative model is  that it does not allow for a simultaneous solution of economic  and ecological problems, as it would be appropriate, but  separates them artificially. In fact, the Department of  Environmental Protection is limited to only a formal  participation when the Government prepares the strategic  programs of the reconstruction of economy, energetics,  transport, agriculture, and others. The department creates its  own programs for the protection of the environment separately  from the Government. They are not being coordinated, and the  result is an ineffective use of energy and a waste of funds.    Of course, the transformation of the department into a  ministry will not do anything good if the Government itself will  not slowly renounce economic functions and will not strive to  integrate management by issuing new ministry regulations. There  will be little change, if the internal structure of the future  ministry will be formed by disregarding the principle of the  delimitation of functions, responsibility and accountability.    During the discussions on the territorial administrative  reform, which took place in the Parliament at the beginning of  this year, the Prime Minister surveyed the future of the state  management and remarked that the Government is ready to pass the  economic functions to the local administrations. If this is  really the case, then the issue of property and other economic  questions would not impede the Government's execution of state  policy and the adoption of impartial decisions related to the  protection of the environment and the use of natural resources.    It is already clear that it is inexpedient to separate  control from the other functions of the future ministry. If the  Ministry of the Protection of the Environment has no right of  control, then it, in the words of V. Adamkus, is a "toothless  granny." Should two institutions be created that control the  same area? Somebody may gain from that, but it will not be  Lithuania's nature.</p>

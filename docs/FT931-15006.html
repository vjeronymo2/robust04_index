			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Dismay as Brazilian senate again delays decisive vote to deregulate ports AFTER two years' struggle, the Brazilian Senate last night again delayed the decisive vote on a controversial project to deregulate the port system, to the dismay of the business community and disappointment of international investors who regard port reform as a linchpin of modernisation. The delay is a blow to President Itamar Franco, bringing to a fruitless close this week's extraordinary session of Congress, convoked to pass such long-outstanding projects. Fiscal reform and new privatisation rules have also been delayed until next week. The proposed legislation, which would allow ports to be privatised and cut crippling port costs, is considered crucial to the government programme to boost exports, but is opposed by port constituency senators who have delayed the voting since February 1991. Brazil's 35 ports are riddled with bureaucracy, served by archaic equipment, subject to 49 different taxes, and governed by legislation unchanged since 1934. The Association of Exporters (AEB) says Brazilian port costs are the world's highest. At the port of Santos, charges amount to Dollars 51.3 a tonne against Dollars 4.5 in Antwerp. Mr Pratini de Moraes, head of the AEB, says: 'We're throwing away Dollars 5bn a year in exports and 350,000 potential jobs.' Some 97 per cent of all cargo into and out of Brazil passes through ports and these costs explain why, despite significant tariff cuts, trade into Brazil remains at 5 per cent of GNP, one of the lowest levels in the world. Exports have stayed stagnant at Dollars 33bn-36bn for a decade and port reform is seen as fundamental to the new government's plans to raise this to Dollars 50bn by next year. Mr Paulo Maluf, mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial centre, points out: 'We already have a geographical disadvantage: we are 8,000km from the US and 11,000km from Europe, so have larger freight costs. These, with our port tariffs, make it impossible to compete'. Reform is widely backed, but opposition by a few senators led by Mr Mario Covas, has led to continuous postponement. An attempt to introduce an amendment maintaining the stevedores' monopoly of labour has led to the latest delay. Mr Pedro da Motta Veiga, director of the Foreign Trade Foundation, says the delays are a 'depressing example of how slow Brazil is at sorting out its priorities'.</p>

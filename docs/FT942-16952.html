			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: From motorway to runway - National Express plans to expand its airport side Tonight a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 will descend through the cloud over Leicestershire and make its final approach to East Midlands, the regional airport owned by a company better known for coach travel than transatlantic flights. When the aircraft taxis to a halt it will be unloaded and refuelled by sub-contractors working for National Express Group, the long-haul coach operator. The group regards the nightly arrival from Newark, New Jersey, as testimony to its success in diversifying from road travel into airport operations. Less than a year since National Express acquired the airport from its council owners, its Pounds 27.1m investment has been transformed from a non-core activity into an integral part of its on-going business. Its importance to National Express was underlined last month when the coach operator unveiled a 36 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 6.8m) for 1993. Of that total, the airport contributed Pounds 2.2m after just five months as part of the enlarged group. Those profits were boosted by the arrival of a number of new carriers, including United Parcels Services, the US express mail business, which last summer decided to move its cargo operations from London Stansted to East Midlands. Growth, meanwhile, in charter and scheduled traffic has underpinned a 10 per cent increase in passenger numbers to 1.37m. By comparison, National Express's core long-haul coaches business struggled to take off last year. Passenger journeys on its UK express coach business fell by 6.6 per cent and turnover declined by 3.25 per cent to Pounds 92m. Although the group is confident coach travel will bounce back, it believes profits would be enhanced further by an enlarged airport portfolio. 'The vision now is to expand the airport side. I would expect us to have one or two more airports by next year, but we're being very selective,' says Mr Ray McEnhill, chief executive. The gamble for National Express is whether it can repeat the success of East Midlands at other airports. Mr McEnhill believes it can by adopting the same criteria which last July persuaded it to acquire the Leicestershire hub. National Express was attracted to East Midlands by its existing charter and cargo business and its location next to the M1 motorway. Such criteria rules out a number of airports - many of them no more than enlarged aerodromes - and narrows the group's target range to a few sites, most of them council-owned. Mr McEnhill's bargaining position for such airports has been strengthened by government policy. Public spending rules prevent local authorities from borrowing on the open market to fund airport expansion and - facing cash constraints elsewhere - several councils are said to be considering disposals. 'We've examined five or six likely sites and it won't be long before we select our target,' Mr McEnhill says. His attention is thought to centre on Bristol Airport, owned by the city council, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.9m in the 12 months to March 31 last year and saw passenger numbers increase by almost a third to 1.1m. National Express may consider an investment in Birmingham International, which is selling shares to fund an ambitious expansion programme, while airports at Coventry and Southend could also attract its interest. The group's ability to bid for such sites has been enhanced by the terms on which it acquired East Midlands. It funded that transaction with Pounds 17.5m of medium-term debt, a Pounds 3.75m rights issue and cash reserves, and still emerged with a strengthened balance sheet. The reason is simple. The airport's council owners sold the site at a Pounds 10m discount to its Pounds 37m book value, and it has since been revalued at Pounds 55.1m. National Express would like to repeat the exercise with other councils and is prepared to fund such acquisitions by either returning to the market or increasing gearing from current levels of 22.5 per cent. Industry trends have also played a part in persuading the coach group that runways offer better profit potential than motorways. While revenues from express coach travel have declined, regional airports have seen demand climb steeply. Their popularity has increased with mounting congestion at London's two main hubs and pressure on tour operators to offer more diverse departure points. Cargo carriers such as UPS, meanwhile, have been persuaded to move from the south-east by the promise of unrestricted night flights and easy access to the motorway network. Encouraged by the increased activity, National Express has decided to invest up to Pounds 3m on extending the East Midlands runway and enlarging the apron space - enabling the airport to handle the largest fully-laden aircraft. According to Mr McEnhill, these developments will see National Express emerge as a broadly-based transport group in which coach operations complement aviation activities. 'We make no secret of our desire to be an airport operator - it could account for more than 50 per cent of our profits in the near future.'</p>

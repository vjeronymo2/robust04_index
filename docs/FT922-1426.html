			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Change in law over pregnant women urged CITIZENS' Advice Bureaux are to press the government for tighter rules on the protection of pregnant women at work. The call follows evidence that women are being dismissed when their employers find out they are pregnant, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux claims in a report published today . The association is the latest group to lobby for increased legal protection for pregnant women ahead of the European Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg tomorrow, which is due to consider the issue. Both the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Labour party yesterday urged the government to agree to improvements in maternity pay at the meeting. The association, which has collected evidence from its bureaux across the UK, says that some employers' attitudes to pregnancy are 'hostile and uninformed'. Its report cites cases of women who were allegedly sacked for being pregnant or were denied their legal entitlement to maternity pay. Mr Tony Blair, the opposition employment spokesman, was joined by MEPs at a news conference to press the case for every mother in the EC having 16 weeks paid leave, remunerated at 80 per cent of their regular salaries. The UK government wants the payments to be at a lower rate, equivalent to statutory sick pay levels. The proposals on maternity pay are technically subject to qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers because they are designated part of the European Community's workplace health and safety responsibilities. However, it is thought unlikely that British objections will be overruled in a vote tomorrow: either maternity pay at the lower sick pay rates are likely to be agreed or the draft directive in its entirety could be scrapped. The Equal Opportunities Commission also backed the call for 80 per cent pay, saying that the issue would be a 'real litmus test of the government's commitment to recognising and supporting working mothers'. The commission said it objected to the proposed link between maternity pay and sick pay. 'Pregnant women are not sick. If the Council of Ministers should decide to link maternity pay with sick pay, then . . . British women would end up with only about 25 per cent of the average full-time women worker's wage', it said. Not in Labour. Social Policy Section, NACAB, 115-123 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9LZ.

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE SEEN AS CITY MODEL FOR CHILD CARE  </P> <P> The need for quality, affordable child care in our communities is becoming more  and more pressing.  </P> <P> As you noted in a recent editorial, Irvine is at the forefront in the area of  child care. On Dec. 15, 1987, the Irvine City Council, led by Mayor Larry  Agran, unanimously passed a resolution stating the child care policy of the  city: "That safe, affordable, quality child care facilities and services shall  be available to those who reside and/or work in the city of Irvine and are in  need of those facilities and services." (City Council Resolution No. 87-151).  </P> <P> The objectives towards accomplishing this goal include providing licensed child  care spaces for 60% of the children of employed parents living in Irvine by  1992; providing affordable child care services in the city, and promoting the  development of child care facilities in Irvine that are of the highest quality.  Progress toward that goal is reviewed annually by the City Council and  masterfully implemented by the city's child care coordinator and staff, in  cooperation with many groups from both the public and private sectors.  </P> <P> Child care is a top priority of Mayor Agran and the City Council. As a member  of the Irvine Community Services Commission, I hope that our city can serve as  a model for other cities in this area.  </P> <P> BEVERLY JACOBS  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

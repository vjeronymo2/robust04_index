			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: UK credit Meanwhile, it is likely that something more than hairs are being split in policy discussions between Westminster and Threadneedle Street. The Bank remains publicly concerned with metaphysical riddles, such as: When is a crunch not a crunch? (some hours of the Treasury Committee's time went on this not long ago); and: What is the underlying underlying rate of inflation (answers on not less than 10 sides of paper). Ministers are increasingly worried about votes. The latest statistics suggest they are right to be anxious. The CBI small firms survey confirms that there is indeed a credit crunch - if you are too small to borrow outside the banking system. It is small companies who complain that credit is sometimes difficult, and always too expensive (1 1/2 per cent a month from one clearer). The Bank of England calls that a fall in credit demand; the victims call it a squeeze, and all too often a fatal one. That is no way to treat pillars of their local Conservative Associations. Yesterday's weak credit growth figures also look forbidding. The brief beat-the-tax-increase retail boom was financed with astonishingly little borrowing; at these real interest rates, credit demand is indeed price sensitive. But officials should take care before they cite this as proof that 'policies are working'. They are likely to be accused of what a former chancellor called sado-monetarism. Politically switched-on dealers are likely to pay less than their usual attention to market signals from the Bank.</p>

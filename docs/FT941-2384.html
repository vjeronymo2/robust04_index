			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / The Markets: All eyes on the Federal Reserve - Global Investor The US Federal Reserve this week runs the risk of being damned if it does - raise interest rates, that is - yet even more damned if it does not. The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets tomorrow amid widespread expectations in the capital markets that it will approve a further tightening of US monetary policy. There are certainly good reasons for it to do so. Although a succession of statistics last week showed that inflation remains subdued, America's economic expansion has proved surprisingly robust in the first months of this year, and as labour and product market slack diminish, inflationary forces will start building. But it remains unclear how far and how fast the Fed will decide to push up rates following its initial turn of the screw, on February 4, when it tightened monetary policy for the first time in five years, with a quarter of a point increase in Fed funds to 3.25 per cent. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has spoken of wanting to move from an accomodative to a neutral stance, leaving the market guessing as to just what constitutes neutrality. But many analysts are anticipating a 4 per cent Fed funds rate by year end, while forward rates are suggesting that this level could be reached by mid-year. The Fed might decide in principle on further tightening tomorrow, while leaving an actual move until April, perhaps after it has had a chance to view the employment figures for March, due out on the first of the month. However, a failure to tighten within days of the meeting would risk further unsettling a jittery market. Its edginess was graphically illustrated on Friday when a visit at short notice by Mr Greenspan to the White House for a discussion on 'economic fundamentals' with Mr Clinton prompted a sharp sell-off in bond markets around the world. Mr Clinton, traders theorised, was trying to dissuade Mr Greenspan from increasing rates, though the White House denied that any messages on interest rates were given or received. Whatever the president's motives, the fact that the discussions took place so near to Tuesday's FOMC meeting points to a curious insensitivity on the part of both the White House and Mr Greenspan to the anxiety of the credit markets. If the Fed fails to tighten in the wake of the meeting, it will risk being seen as succumbing to White House pressures, and thus undermining its inflation-fighting credentials. Mr Greenspan has several options. The market's jitteriness makes its reaction to any tightening move particularly hard to judge. The Fed seems most likely to put another quarter point on Fed funds, which would fit with Mr Greenspan's reputation for gradualism. The danger in this course is that, rather than calming the market, it will simply keep it in a state of nervous suspense, waiting for the next 25 basis point increase. Some analysts suggest that an immediate half-point increase in Fed funds would dramatically underscore the central bank's inflation fighting credentials and end the Chinese water torture of slowly rising rates. The danger here is that it could spook the markets into thinking that the Fed views inflation as far more serious a threat than it really is. A middle way could be to accompany a 25 basis point increase in Fed funds with a rise in the psychologically important discount rate - the rate the Fed charges banks for loans - from 3 to 3 1/2 per cent. Whatever path is chosen, there seems a good chance that a rise in Fed funds will be accompanied by an increase in commercial banks' prime lending rates. Last week Morgan Guaranty, alone among the largest banks in keeping its prime rate below 6 per cent, moved it up in line with the rest of the market, possibly anticipating a further upward shift. Still, if Mr Greenspan plays his cards carefully it is possible that a Fed tightening this week could improve the tone of the market, rather than prompting the further sell-off which many analysts fear. After all, a quarter point on Fed funds is already well factored in to bond prices and last week the market showed encouraging signs of stabilising, before Mr Greenspan's summons to the White House. With uncertainty over the Fed's intentions out of the way, a market which is looking oversold might just rally. Japanese equities Is it time to substantially increase portfolio weightings in the Japanese equity market? After all, over the past week two prominent London analysts have redoubled their advice to do so. Mr Nick Knight, of Nomura, argues that the Nikkei index, which has been stuck in a trading range just over 20,000 is set for a rapid move to 24,000, with an outside chance of reaching 28,000. 'The bull story,' he says, 'is very simple and now difficult to refute - economic recovery, with profits explosion due to corporate restructuring with low inflation, low interest rates and high liquidity, all in a cycle which is way behind the US.' Mr Michael Howell, global strategist at Baring Securities, who focuses on flow of funds rather than traditional valuation criteria, says Japan tops his list of world stock markets. Liquidity is rising, helped by Central Bank intervention, while Japanese investors, with their lowest exposure to stocks in 13 years, have Y7 trillion in cash, banks and money market funds, which is ultimately likely to return to equities. Japan is certainly showing the first signs of light at the end of the recessionary tunnel, with a report from the Bank of Japan last Friday suggesting that the economy appeared to have ceased weakening. The general expectation is for a slow upturn, with companies sticking to conservative capital investment programmes and banks slowly strengthening their balance sheets, weighed down with non-performing loans. With only a modest fillip to personal consumption later in the year from the June income tax cuts, GDP growth for the year may only just be positive. Certainly, the fact that Japan is three years behind the US economic recovery suggests that the market has the potential to offer substantially greater capital gains than the US over the next few years, justifying some portfolio shifting. But with US earnings still rising sharply, too great a move could mean missing out on a final North American bull run. The greatest risk in Japan is another sharp rise in the value of the yen to the dollar, which could squeeze off the incipient recovery. The continuing trade friction between Washington and Tokyo means that the danger of the US talking up the yen is not going to go away. Japanese concessions over the past few weeks - including Friday's announcement of a sharp jump in semi-conductor imports - have taken a little heat out of the issue. But it may boil up again if the Clinton administration finds inadequate the unilateral market-opening initiatives which Tokyo is promising to produce shortly. Even so, it is hard to see the yen appreciating to greater than Y100 to the dollar, and it could fall to between Y100 and Y115 later in the year on the back of economic recovery and a falling trade surplus. The Oscars The big question facing Tinseltown is how many Oscar awards Steven Spielberg will pick up for the much-acclaimed Schindler's List. The awards will give a much needed fillip to Universal Studios and its parent MCA, owned by Japan's Matsushita Group, which were responsible not only for Schindler's List but for Spielberg's far bigger hit of last year, Jurassic Park. But the Oscars are not a particularly good guide to film industry investment stocks. Warner Brothers, the studio owned by Time Warner, may not feature prominently in the Oscars, but it has been top of the US box office league for the past three years, thanks in no small measure to its steady, long-time management team. Time Warner stock has been weak recently because its cable television arm has been hit by government-mandated rate reductions. But, with the multi-media age looming, the shares look cheap, and have the added attraction of a potential bid stock, since Canada's Seagram drinks group has built up a 13 per cent stake.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 17/3/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  ----------------- % change over period --------------                    US     Japan   Germany    France     Italy       UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash   Week           0.06      0.04      0.12      0.12      0.15     0.09   Month          0.29      0.19      0.51      0.54      0.71     0.43   Year           3.50      3.06      6.63      8.75     10.69     5.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year   Week           0.22      0.16      0.59      0.37      0.39    -0.66   Month         -1.41     -1.79     -0.50     -0.43     -0.90    -1.53   Year           3.39      5.28      7.59     11.73     20.45     7.07  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year   Week           0.67      0.33     -0.83      0.49      1.06    -1.13   Month         -2.62     -3.45     -1.49     -1.58     -2.25    -3.40   Year           4.03      5.25      8.25     13.99     27.76     9.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities   Week           1.3       1.9       0.4       1.4       1.5     -0.2   Month          0.1       5.9       0.7      -2.0      -2.5     -5.1   Year           7.3      21.6      26.9      21.5      43.2     18.1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 17/3/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          -------- % change --------                              Close       Week      Month       Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kemper Corp.

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The signature of a 'film star' chef - Giles MacDonogh meets Sirio Maccioni, a cook who has remained true to his Tuscan origins Chefs will not sit still in their kitchens any more. Every month some luminary of the profession flies in, while another flies out. Often they do more harm to their reputations than good: it takes a while to get used to a strange kitchen, a different brigade and the products of a different market. Occasionally their appearances have a fraudulent side, such as the visit by an Austrian chef who went home after the press preview leaving a monolingual skivvy to cope with a kitchen full of Pakistani chefs. Last week it was the turn of Sirio Maccioni, owner of Le Cirque, New York's most chi-chi restaurant, to visit London. He did not come alone. He brought Sylvain Portay, his chef, Sottha Khunn, his Cambodian chef de cuisine who has been described as the restaurant's 'secret weapon', and the pastry chef Jacques Torres. Anything they lacked in the way of culinary muscle was provided by Paul Gayler and his team at the Lanesborough hotel, on Hyde Park Corner. For a week, diners there could enjoy some of the three-star restaurant's signature dishes, such as the delicious, if simple, paupiette of sea bass wrapped in thin slices of potato and served on a reduction of Barolo wine; or the ostentatious (very New York) ravioli of foie gras thickly scattered with bite-size pieces of truffle; or the amazing desserts, one of which takes the form of an edible kitchen stove; or the creme brulee, which now figures on the menu of Paul Bocuse's restaurant in Lyon. Possibly even more delightful than the food was Sirio Maccioni, a man who has travelled a long way from his origins in the Tuscan spa town of Montecatini. Montecatini was useful to Maccioni in two ways: firstly, it was at the height of its reputation as a spa when he was a child, and the great and good were often to be seen taking the waters there; secondly it was also the birthplace of one Ivo Livi, a man who was rather better known under his nom de guerre: Yves Montand. Maccioni tells an amusing story of how Montand gained his French name. As a child the young Ivo, or Yves, went to live in Marseille. His grandmother, anxious that the boy should learn something of the language of his new land, used to summon him upstairs with a cry of 'Yves, Montes]' Montand, therefore became his name as he rose to pre-eminence as a French singer and actor. Montand was already a famous singer when Maccioni decided to leave home and try his luck in the kitchens of Paris. Montand had told him to use his name in his application to the Plaza Athenee Hotel, but Maccioni did not know that his friend was not called Livi in France and was struck by the indifference of the hotel manager at his interview. He was told he could come back when he spoke French. The ever-watchful Montand found him a job as a stage hand at the Folies Bergeres where he met Edith Piaf and a bevy of dancing girls. Two weeks later he returned in triumph to the Plaza Athenee. French food was in its post-war doldrums when Maccioni started at the Plaza Athenee. He remembers how the chef used to cook by the book: 'This sauce is a little runny. Put some flour in it.' From the Plaza Athenee Maccioni moved to Germany, then returned to Paris and Maxim. He was waiting for the chance to work in Britain. A restaurant in Fleet Street had offered him the job of maitre d'hotel but the position was not ready. Instead he went to New York and became maitre d'hotel at the Colony, then the smartest restaurant in Manhattan. Life magazine commented curtly: 'The new maitre d'hotel would be very good if he could speak English.' Montecatini helped him once again: as he surveyed the tables under his charge many of the faces were already familiar to him from the spa. All his customers fought for the possession of the best table. He put cards in his pocket: 'yes', 'no' to indicate to the likes of Frank Sinatra, Onassis or Niarchos whether they were in luck that day. Niarchos believed in getting his own way by the liberal distribution of Dollars 100 bills. Occasionally even baffled members of the public were tipped as he sailed out of the restaurant after a heavy lunch. Frank Sinatra became a family friend. When Maccioni's first son was born, Sinatra was at the hospital with a silver cup for the boy engraved with the legend 'To Mario from Francis'. In 1974 he opened Le Cirque, and has had the rare pleasure of seeing his New York restaurant remain at the top of the fashionable tree for two decades. Everyone wants Maccioni to be their friend. King Juan Carlos of Spain had always told him: 'When you are in Spain give me a ring.' Once, when he wanted tickets to the World Cup, he took him up on it. He was staying with chef Roger Verge at the time, another friend from Paris days: 'There's someone on the telephone for you. He says he's the King of Spain.' Another old friend is Ronald Reagan. When he was elected president he rang Maccioni: 'Here's Ron, are you coming to my inauguration?' Maccioni was temporarily nonplussed: 'Yes, I come to your coronation.' There wasn't a hotel room to be had, but Maccioni got a room and a driver, even if he managed to sleep through breakfast at the White House. In spite of his film-star status in the US, Maccioni has few illusions about America. He throws up his hands at the squeamish way Americans respond to fish or chicken heads, rabbits and other, unfamiliar foodstuffs. 'Make it fashionable and they'll eat it,' he says. He will not be swayed. On Tuesdays, diners are offered tripe, on Thursdays bollito misto, on Fridays Italian fish soup. He remains resolutely European and true to his origins in Montecatini. Asked why he employed no American chefs, he replied: 'I didn't know there were any.' Le Cirque, 58 East 65th Street. Tel: 794-9292.</p>

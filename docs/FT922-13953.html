			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Arts: Yuppie-Yuppie Land - Cinema HOOK (U) Odeon Leicester Square THE DOCTOR (12) Odeon West End, MGM Chelsea AT PLAY IN THE FIELDS OF THE LORD (15) Plaza, MGM Trocadero KIUCHI ICA Please pass the plate around. Today's collection is for the 'Save The Yuppie' fund. Yes, brethren, I know you are probably thinking: Why save the yuppie? After all, they were a menace to enlightened society in the 1980s, with their portable telephones and dreams of eternal upward mobility. But brethren - and sistren - we are talking of saving the yuppie from himself. And so we come to Steven Spielberg's Hook. Peter Banning (Robin Williams) is a stressed executive who flies to London with his family to stay with his grandmother-in-law, the 'real' 92-year-old Wendy Darling (Maggie Smith). When not shouting Dollars 5m deals down his cordless instrument, he listens to the old dear recall how she and her siblings inspired Mr JM Barrie next door. Ah, their tales of Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up] Ah, the antics of their fantasy villain Captain Hook] But hold on, here comes Hook himself (Dustin Hoffman) and his henchpersons, borne into town on a supernatural hurricane. Good heavens, he is snatching away Banning's bairns and transporting them to Never-Never Land. Can Banning heed the squawkings of Grandma Wendy and take that leap of faith that will turn him into a flying child like PP himself? Can he rescue the tots? He can. But it takes two-and-a-half hours and the price for filmgoers is a mawkish paean to infantile regression from a director who after a promising early career - Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, ET - has now been mugged by Central Typecasting and persuaded to become the Peter Pan of Greater Hollywood. What dismays us about Hook is not so much the hook itself: the plot premise about an overgrown yuppie 'finding himself' by becoming a child again. It is the way we are attacked with that and other hooks long after they have theoretically hooked us. Every scene mauls us with its overstatement. Spielberg's London is a rapist Disneyland, pinioning our imaginations with its sickly painted Big Bens and winsome snow-flurries. Spielberg's Never-Never Land is a riot of overdone tweeness with its wacky galleons, kitschy jungles and half-dozen moons. And the Lost Boys are a group of multi-ethnic street urchins whose racial representativeness loudhails Political Correctness at us. Only Julia Roberts as a slinky, husky Tinkerbell reminds us there is a naughty grown-up world out there somewhere. In all other respects, I loathed this film. It represents the worst that Hollywood can now do to us: the in-your-face lectures about the sanctity of childhood; the a la mode political attitudinising; the drippy waste of Robin Williams, who used to make a healthy living from standing at a microphone and deriding the pious values here enshrined; and the turning of Dustin Hoffman (with Mr Hoffman's help) into a witless English-accented fop - Terry-Thomas out of Lionel Jeffries - as unmenacing as he is unfunny. Some things at least in the film are too ludicrous to loathe. The press-show audience freely guffawed at two early shots in which a baseball game spectator wields a Sony video-camera, the maker's name emblazoned on the strap. Sony, in case you forgot, now owns Tri-Star Pictures which made Hook. This technique is called product placement. If Sony requires any advice on where to place their products - for example, this film - I shall be only too happy to help. * Save The Yuppie Part 2: The Doctor. This is the tale of Dr William Hurt, a successful but callous surgeon who sings and cracks jokes as he fishes about in your aorta. As Dr Hurt might quip, he aorta know better. And by the end of this spiritually improving drama directed by Randa Haines (Children Of A Lesser God) and written by Robert Caswell from a book based on his own experiences by Dr Ed Rosenbaum, Dr Hurt has come to know better. For he gets a tumour on his larynx and is soon in a 'Physician, heal thyself' situation. Can he trust his fellow MDs? Will his marriage (to Christine Lahti) fall apart under the strain? Will he fall for hairless but still beautiful chemotherapy patient Elizabeth Perkins? We have never seen so much fuss about a life-or-death operation. We know where we are being led: along the hospital corridor floor following the coloured stripe with matching wall-signs that read 'Radiation, barium enemas and de-yuppification.' Problem is: Hurt is good at the yuppie part, the high-flying scalpel-wielder more concerned with the insides of his wallet than those of his patient. But he is hopeless at the humane transformation presumed to follow on the dose he receives of his own medicine. * Yuppie redemption, we note with relief, is nowhere in sight in At Play In The Fields Of The Lord. The acquisitive instincts here are the age-old ones of land- and soul-grabbing. Deep in the Amazon jungle, a Brazilian commandante, hungry for rainforests, wants to bomb the local Niaruna Indians from their villages. But two rival white missionaries (John Lithgow, Aidan Quinn) want to keep them in place as sitting targets for Christianisation. Meanwhile their wives, Daryl Hannah (beautiful and liberated) and Kathy Bates (repressed frump) add tension to the imperfect Eden. And a local air pilot with Cherokee blood (Tom Berenger) drops from the sky to befriend the Indians against both church and state. Peter Mathiessen wrote the novel, though as directed and co-scripted by Hector Babenco (Pixote, Kiss Of The Spider Woman) it plays more like James A. Michener with a twist of Maugham. The scenery has you gasping. Rivers sinuous and gleaming as anacondas twine through dense jungle; star-high mountains wreathe themselves in mist or spill measureless waterfalls. Whenever it peers down from God's viewpoint, the film looks its Dollars 34m; whenever it peers up from the Indians' viewpoint - directed with real verve and conviction - it looks its six-month schedule preceded by three months of training and rehearsal for the non-whites. If only the white actors had been allotted the same. Their characters are from Cardboard City and they know it. Assembled from old packing material, they creak their way through the God-fearing tirades, the blackwater fever bereavements (Aidan and Katy lose little Billy), the sudden mad scenes (Miss Bates), the let's-go-native binges (Berenger) and of course the back-to-nature nude river bathing (Hannah). 'I realised it was important to the story and not the least exploitative' says Miss Hannah of this scene. Yes, well . . . The film lasts three hours and six minutes and is not, I admit, boring. But I kept wishing Werner Herzog had been parachuted into the director's chair to lend a little true madness, a little searing obliquity of vision. In Babenco's hands, the story's final disenchantments - the Indians lose faith in men and Gods, the whites in the virtues of the missionary position - are as thudding and predictable as quarterly bills landing on your doormat. Finally, a small but perfectly formed treat: Kenchi Iwamoto's Kikuchi. A surreal chamber drama from Japan, is shot in a bluish glow, it tells of a lonely, maladjusted youth (Jiro Yoshimura) who works in a basement laundry by day and lives a Peeping Tom existence by night. As deadpan as a Keaton comedy, as richly weird as an early David Lynch film.</p>

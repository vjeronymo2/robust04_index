			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): British or French Inheritence Tax? - Briefcase Q&amp;A My mother-in-law has come to live with us in France. She has all her assets in the form of cash, stocks and shares, and chattels. Assuming she remains domiciled in the UK, am I right in thinking her assets in France will be subject to French inheritance tax, and those in the UK or Channel Islands to British inheritance tax? Thus, would it be worth dividing her assets between the countries so as to take advantage of the abatements available in each? Generally speaking, those domiciled in the UK are liable to UK inheritance tax on their worldwide assets, irrespective of where they are. This means that, prima facie, her French assets would be within the UK tax net, relief being given for any French tax paid. As I understand the position, the estate of a non-French domiciliary is taxable only in respect of assets in France. You should confirm this independently. As the French assets appear to incur tax in two countries, recourse must be had to the Anglo-French Inheritance Tax Treaty. Under this, the French-sited property will be subject to French tax but the UK will allow a credit for it. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> YZERMAN, DETROIT HAND MINNESOTA FIRST DEFEAT, 4-3  </P> <P> Steve Yzerman is considered by many as the third-best player in the National  Hockey League. But the two top players, Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux, get so  much publicity, the star of the Detroit Red Wings is comparatively unknown.  </P> <P> Yzerman, who led the Red Wings to the title in the Norris Division last season,  made sure Wednesday night at Detroit that there are no more unbeaten teams in  the NHL.  </P> <P> Yzerman, who had 65 goals last season, contributed two goals and an assist to  lead the Red Wings to a 4-3 victory that ended the Minnesota North Stars'  unbeaten streak at six games.  </P> <P> The North Stars, who opened last season with just one victory in their first 10  games, fell to 5-1-1, but lead the Norris Division by four points. Last season  they didn't win their fifth game until they played their 23rd.  </P> <P> Yzerman set up the first goal before the game was five minutes old. He fed  Gerard Gallant, just back from a five-game suspension, and Detroit led the rest  of the way.  </P> <P> Both Yzerman goals were in the second period to help the Red Wings build a 4-1  lead.  </P> <P> "I don't care where I'm ranked," Yzerman said, "I just want to help win games."  </P> <P> Montreal 2, Calgary 1 -- The Canadiens wish that talented rookie Stephan Lebeau  had been around last spring for the playoffs.  </P> <P> Lebeau scored early in the final period at Montreal to give the Canadiens the  victory in the first meeting this season between the Stanley Cup finalists. It  was just the second loss in eight games for the Stanley Cup champions.  </P> <P> Lebeau has scored four goals while helping the Canadiens post a 5-3-0 record.  </P> <P> St. Louis 9, Pittsburgh 3 -- In their first meeting last season at Pittsburgh,  the Blues were humiliated.  </P> <P> Mario Lemieux had eight points and led the Penguins to a 9-2 romp.  </P> <P> This was a time for revenge. Brett Hull scored three goals and assisted on two  others. Linemate Sergio Momesso had two goals and four assists in the one-sided  victory.  </P> <P> To make the night complete for the Blues, they held Lemieux scoreless.  </P> <P> New Jersey 5, Philadelphia 3 -- Soviet star Viacheslav Fetisov scored his first  NHL goal in an early outburst at East Rutherford, N.J., to lead the Devils to  their second victory over the struggling Flyers.  </P> <P> Fetisov's 35-foot blast was the opening score in a three-goal run in 2:01 that  gave New Jersey a commanding lead. The Devils scored four times on Pete Peeters  on their first seven shots.  </P> <P> The Flyers, without their No. 1 goalie, Ron Hextall, who is sitting out a  12-game suspension, are 1-5-1 and in last place in the Patrick Division. They  lost to the Devils in the season opener at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Toronto 4, Vancouver 3 -- The Maple Leafs are willing to take anything they can  get. They gladly accepted a fluke goal by Ed Olczyk at Toronto to end a  four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Olczyk, from a poor angle, slid the puck across the ice and it hit goaltender  Steve Weeks' skate, and caromed into the net to break a 3-3 tie early in the  last period.  </P> <P> Hartford 2, Buffalo 1 -- It was a meeting between two of the best defensive  teams in the league at Hartford, Conn.  </P> <P> Whaler goaltender Mike Liut stopped 24 shots to lower his league-leading  goals-against average to 1.67. He has allowed only five goals in 179 minutes.  </P> <P> Defenseman Sylvain Cote scored out of a goal-mouth scramble with just 3:11 left  in regulation to give the Whalers the victory.  </P> <P> Edmonton 7, Winnipeg 2 -- Jari Kurri had two goals and an assist at Edmonton to  lead the Oilers to an easy victory over the Jets.  </P> <P> The victory moved the Oilers to within a point of the second-place Kings in the  Smythe Division and dropped the Jets deeper into the cellar.

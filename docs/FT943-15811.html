			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: MPs condemn pay-out to former Severn Trent chief A group of Labour MPs yesterday condemned a six-figure pay-out to the former chairman of one of the regional water companies and urged Ofwat to act to protect consumers from similar 'excesses'. A total of 54 MPs headed by Mr Richard Burden, MP for Birmingham Northfield, used a parliamentary early day motion to attack 'a half-million pound pay-off' to Mr John Bellak, former chairman of Severn Trent. The payment came to light in the company's annual accounts, which showed that, on top of his salary package of Pounds 230,300, Mr Bellak was paid Pounds 512,626 in compensation for early retirement. This latter figure consisted of Pounds 404,829 for 'early termination of his service contract' and Pounds 107,797 for future pension payments. The motion deplored the payout before going on to note 'that during his term in office, Mr Bellak ruthlessly promoted the privatisation of the water industry despite evidence that the majority of the public he was supposed to serve opposed the sell-off; further notes that Mr Bellak's remuneration since privatisation was boosted by a series of salary rises and by share option deals while water prices soared and public accountability diminished; believes that it is a disgrace that the water companies should be making multi-million pound profits and making large payoffs to top executives when pensioners and low income families cannot afford to pay their water bills; and demands that Ofwat take immediate action to protect consumers from the excesses of the private water companies.'</p>

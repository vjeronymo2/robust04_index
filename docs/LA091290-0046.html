			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAO WARNS OF BANK FAILURES, FEDERAL BAILOUT  </P> <P> The General Accounting Office warned Tuesday that the nation's banking system  is in such fragile condition that a recession could bring on the failure of  several major banks, wiping out the federal deposit insurance fund and making a  taxpayer bailout necessary.  </P> <P> In unusually pessimistic testimony, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, the  head of the agency, told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs  Committee that the banking industry is plagued by billions of dollars in losses  not yet identified by federal regulators.  </P> <P> "Not since its birth during the Great Depression has the federal system of  deposit insurance for commercial banks faced such a period of danger and  uncertainty as it does today," Bowsher said.  </P> <P> His warning was prompted by a new GAO study of 300 large and troubled banks  that identified 35 institutions as in danger of failing within a year, with  potential total losses ranging from $4.4 billion to $6.3 billion. Those figures  would take a massive bite out of the insurance fund, which had dwindled to $13  billion at the end of last year.  </P> <P> The bank insurance fund protects deposits of as much as $100,000 and has the  ultimate support of Congress and the President, who have pledged that insured  depositors will not lose a penny.  </P> <P> Keeping that promise in the case of savings and loan deposits will cost the  taxpayers between $90 billion and $130 billion, without including the future  cost of interest on the bonds sold to shut insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off their  depositors. Federal officials now say that it may be necessary to keep some  weak thrifts open under close government supervision to avoid adding to the  rising cost of the financial rescue operation.  </P> <P> The banking industry generally is considered much healthier than the ravaged  S&amp;Ls, but Bowsher's strongly worded testimony Tuesday warned of possibly  dangerous problems ahead.  </P> <P> L. William Seidman, the man who runs the deposit guarantee system as chairman  of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., has told Congress that the fund is  under stress and could lose $2 billion or more this year. However, Bowsher was  much gloomier Tuesday, describing a disaster waiting to happen and suggesting  that Seidman's corps of bank examiners has not found the real extent of bank  losses.  </P> <P> Federal officials must "dig deeper" in examining the banks, Bowsher said,  calling for on-site examinations of problem institutions on an annual basis and  for more frequent certified reports by accountants on banks' financial health.  </P> <P> Bankers quickly moved to dispel any linkage between their industry and problems  of the S&amp;L business.  </P> <P> "You can't equate it to the situation in the savings and loan industry -- they  are totally distinct," John W. Spiegel, chief financial officer of SunTrust  Banks, based in Atlanta, said after an American Bankers Assn. press conference  in New York on the industry's health.  </P> <P> The number of banks on the government's problem list dropped to 1,000 last  year, down from nearly 1,600 in 1987, according to Spiegel.  </P> <P> "The biggest, most significant thing is that banking institutions are  diversified in nature compared to thrifts," he said.  </P> <P> The GAO study discovered 35 impaired banks, situated principally in the  Northeast and Southwest, with a high risk of failure. Bowsher did not identify  the banks but said that none are among the nation's 10 largest banks.  </P> <P> About 15 of the 35 banks had failed as of Aug. 13; and, if all collapsed into  insolvency, the losses could run as high as $6.3 billion, according to the GAO.  "A significant number of other banks," also primarily in the Northeast and  Southwest, "are at risk to fail within the next few years, particularly if  their regional economies continue to deteriorate," Bowsher said.  </P> <P> Failure of the sick 35 institutions and the other weak regional banks would  "severely" injure the insurance fund, which has dropped by $5 billion in the  last two years.  </P> <P> "A recession could exacerbate this problem, causing failure of other large  banks beyond those we have identified, exhausting the fund and resulting in a  taxpayer bailout," Bowsher warned.  </P> <P> His testimony appeared to startle members of the Banking Committee, who  seemingly had become inured to bad news about the ever-mounting cost of the  thrift crisis.  </P> <P> "You've given us a very serious warning," said the committee chairman, Sen.  Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). "We have got to take steps to deal with the  problem. There is a lot of phony accounting and failure to recognize true  costs."  </P> <P> Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah), the committee's ranking Republican and a former  chairman, said: "I don't want to be part of another fiasco."  </P> <P> "The public is obviously concerned about Iraq . . . but there is not a more  important issue than the strength of our financial structure and the economy,"  Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) said.  </P> <P> On the House side, Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) said that he will offer  legislation requiring banks to increase their contributions to the insurance  fund by $23 billion. "Perhaps now we can get some action to beef up the bank  insurance fund," said Annunzio, chairman of the financial institutions  subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee.  </P> <P> "We must act immediately to make certain that the bank insurance fund does not  require a taxpayer bailout," he said.  </P> <P> Staff writer James Bates contributed to this story from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

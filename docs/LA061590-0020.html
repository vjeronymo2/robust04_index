			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> GETTING ON JUVENILE HALL'S CASE  </P> <P> A lawyer for Orange County was quick to label a decision Wednesday on the  treatment of youngsters confined at Juvenile Hall as "a vindication of our  staff." Not so fast. The judge's decision was sound and sensible, but it was no  vindication.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Linda H. McLaughlin imposed strict new guidelines on the  county facility for troubled youngsters. The whole tone of her 49-page decision  was one of grave concern about past procedures.  </P> <P> It is true McLaughlin did not outlaw putting juveniles who become unmanageable  in a "rubber room" or tying them down to a bed if their behavior was dangerous  to themselves or others. But the decision in no way endorsed business as usual.  </P> <P> McLaughlin concluded after five weeks of testimony that the Juvenile Hall staff  was "not trained or qualified to make the decision to tie down a minor or  confine a minor to the rubber/safety room." That, she said, could only be done  by a psychiatrist trained in evaluating the physical and psychological safety  of the minor.  </P> <P> In a "clear emergency," when one was unavailable, the decision could be made by  duty officers who had been certified by a psychiatrist as trained and qualified  to make such a call. McLaughlin also said review policies should be instituted.  That the county voluntarily agreed in mid-trial to switch to fleece-lined  leather cuffs for restraints showed it already was getting a message it needed  to hear.  </P> <P> While Judge McLaughlin's ruling fell short of outlawing tie-downs and rubber  rooms altogether, it should serve as a sobering reminder they can be used only  when absolutely necessary and under adequate guidelines and review.  </P> <P> McLaughlin indicated that she is aware of the potential for violence by these  very troubled young offenders. But they also must be dealt with humanely. The  decision introduced important controls, and sent a message that not only must  the county be on watch, but that the court is on the watch, too.  </P></p>

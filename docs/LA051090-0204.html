			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> NEW PARENT GROUP ATTACKS SCHOOL PLAN  </P> <P> Three weeks after the Newport-Mesa Unified School District board voted to  reopen Lincoln Elementary School for fourth, fifth and sixth grades only, more  than 100 parents attended Tuesday night's board meeting to ask members to  reconsider their decision.  </P> <P> Speaking for a newly formed group, Newport-Mesa Parents for Quality Education,  Don Danks told the board that "full and open consideration" was lacking before  the board acted on the issue on April 17.  </P> <P> At that meeting, the board voted 4 to 3 to alter the grade configurations of  schools in the Corona del Mar High School zone. Prompted by increasing  enrollments at Andersen and Harbor View elementary schools, the board  designated those two schools, as well as Eastbluff Kindergarten Center, for  kindergarten through third grade, beginning in 1993. All area students that  year will attend Lincoln for grades four through six.  </P> <P> The parents have been objecting to the new plans because they like the  continuity of kindergarten through sixth grade in neighborhood schools, and say  that not enough research has gone into the proposal to group all the older  elementary-school children onto one campus.  </P> <P> Danks asked the board to begin the process of looking into possible  alternatives for the three schools affected by the move.  </P> <P> Danks was one of five people to speak to the board on the issue. Since the  Lincoln reopening was not on the agenda, the board was restricted from  responding to the comments under state law. Board President Judy Franco asked  audience members to return for the May 22 board meeting, when staff members are  scheduled to report on implementation plans to reopen Lincoln as the new middle  school. Lincoln has been closed for six years.  </P> <P> Expressing frustration, parents gathered outside after the meeting and Danks  indicated that Tuesday's attendance was necessary to demonstrate continued  commitment to the issue.  </P> <P> "We need to remain very calm and rational. . . . All we wanted to do is to let  the school board know that there is a large contingent of parents concerned  about this," Danks said, adding that the group hopes to draw a large crowd of  supporters at the May 22 meeting. "We want to fill the room and have them  coming out the doors."  </P> <P> Danks said the parents group has raised about $20,000 in pledges, which will be  used for parent education, direct mailings and other administrative costs.  </P> <P> The group is examining the possibility of legal action should the board refuse  to reconsider its vote, Danks said.

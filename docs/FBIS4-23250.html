			<p>BFN     [Text] Abuja, 2 Apr (NAN) -- The minister of state for  foreign affairs, Chief Anthony Ani, has described as "fruitful,"  the outcome of his recent diplomatic mission to five southern  African countries, where, he briefed the respective leaders on  the dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon over the Bakassi  Peninsula.    Answering questions from newsmen in his office today on the  outcome of the visit, Chief Ani denied claims that Nigeria  allowed Cameroon to seize the initiative from her, in embarking  on extensive diplomatic campaign to win support for its claim  over the peninsula. He said that Cameroon's claim which is  hinged on the Anglo-German Treaty of March 11, the only treaty  which allegedly ceded the peninsula to her, could not stand  because the said treaty was never ratified by the British  Parliament. Chief Ani showed newsmen a photocopy of the Hansard  of the British Parliament of July 1913, which showed that the  treaty was never ratified, as debate on it was stalled because  of a protest by the Obong of Calabar who sent a delegation to  Britain during a debate on the issue.    He reminded Cameroon that Nigeria once fought a civil war  and  could have no problem raising an army of 1 million men, adding,  "but we want all forces of destruction to be turned into forces  the peaceful resolution of the border dispute with our  Cameroonian bothers."    The minister said that Nigeria was ready to co-operate and  work together with Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon for  the exploitation of the resources available in the Gulf of  Guinea. "Let us sit down as brothers and look at all the  documents available to both sides on the Bakassi issue and on  the basis of this, determine who actually owns the disputed  territory," he said, adding if after then we are unable to agree  we can take the matter to the OAU. Chief Ani said that Nigeria  was ready to assist France to extricate itself out of the mess  it (France) has found herself as a result of her direct  involvement in the dispute on the side of Cameroon. He however  warned that if France decided to remain intransigent and  uncooperative, we reserve the right to take whatever step we  deem fit to protect our interests.</p>

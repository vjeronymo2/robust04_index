			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Cronyism row for Italian diplomats A SIMMERING row over political favouritism in Italy's diplomatic service has boiled over just as the government announced two apolitical appointees to the European Commission in an attempt to break away from party cronyism. Mr Antonio Ruberti and Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi will replace Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana and Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi as Italian commissioners. Mr Ripa di Meana, who returned to Rome earlier this year as environment minister, was in charge of the EC's environmental activities, while Mr Pandolfi is in charge of research. The two appointments mark a further effort by the government of Mr Giuliano Amato to break away from the stranglehold of the main political parties, which previously had almost automatic claims to jobs such as Italy's EC representation. Although Mr Ruberti, now research minister, has been a Socialist MP since April's general elections, he has the reputation of being a non-party technocrat who was formerly a professor of engineering at Rome university. The choice of Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, currently director of political affairs at the Foreign Ministry, is even more telling, as it is the first time a non-politician has been awarded such an important representative job. The appointments come just as Italy's state council decided to freeze 120 promotions in the diplomatic service on the grounds of alleged political favouritism. Resentment has been growing among Italy's diplomats at the apparently headlong rise of some younger colleagues, often those who have benefited from close contacts as personal attaches to ministers. Matters reached a head under Mr Gianni De Michelis, the former Socialist foreign minister, who is now under investigation in a political corruption scandal.</p>

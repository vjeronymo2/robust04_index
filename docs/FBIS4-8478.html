			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "Reserve Storage for Nuclear Fuel </F> at Paks"]    [Text] Officials in Paks hope that, in accordance with the  signed agreement, Russia will take the spent fuel from the  nuclear power station in Paks. At the same time, due to the  uncertain domestic situation in Russia, officials in Paks began  preparations for the construction of a temporary storage  facility, to make sure that there will be no need to stop the  power station in case of obstacles in the transportation of  spent fuel.    Although environmental protection experts in Moscow argue  about the agreement to transport the spent fuel rods to Russia,  Paks officials hope that the Russian side would abide by the  agreement after all. At the same time, Balazs Kovacs, head of  the information office of the nuclear power station in Paks,  told us that, due to the uncertain situation, they are already  prepared for the construction of a temporary storage facility.  The fuel rods must be placed to lie dormant for five years in  Paks prior to transportation to Russia. If they only keep  adding spent fuel to the storage facility, it will become full  by 1995, and if there are no other possibilities of storage, the  nuclear power station will have to be shut down, a power station  which supplies almost half of Hungary's need for electric power.  It is not expedient to take such a risk and, therefore,  preparations are under way in Paks to build a temporary storage  facility.    As is well known, the joint English-French consortium  Alsthom, a firm that has gained considerable experience in the  construction of such facilities, won the right to construct the  storage. The necessary environmental study has been done, and  its evaluation is currently under way. Power station experts  expect an answer in about one month. The technical plans are  also being drawn now, but construction has not yet been started  because there is no authorization yet. Only the land is being  prepared for construction.    The experts are also conducting information activity among  the people living in 12 settlements around the facility.  Several people oppose the storage, and a civil movement against  the storage has been formed. However, officials in Paks hope  that they will succeed in convincing the opponents of the  project that the facility is not dangerous. The hearing of the  population is still pending, something required by law; no power  station in Hungary can be built without this.</p>

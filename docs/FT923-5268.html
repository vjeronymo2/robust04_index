			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Power prices National Power and PowerGen have an enlightened self-interest in focusing attention on the nuclear levy and its impact on industry's electricity bills. Their regulator is again asking questions about pool prices, although he found no evidence of price fixing last year. The generators are also locked in sensitive talks with British Coal over long-term coal supply contracts. A worthy argument about who bears the cost of nuclear power provides a welcome diversion. Industry, though, is certainly right to worry about energy costs. Subsidies in the form of cheap coal - and the low rate of return demanded of some regional electricity boards - have been lost since privatisation. In a business like chemicals the cost of power is a key component in competitiveness since many other input prices are fixed on world markets. It is difficult to prove UK manufacturers are operating at a disadvantage, but the nuclear levy is is the one component of power pricing equation still in the gift of government and an obvious target for lobbying. But the attention of the market, and of big electricity consumers, is unlikely to be switched for long from the issues of competition and coal. Energy users yesterday welcomed PowerGen's proposals on the levy, but would no doubt also applaud a full enquiry into pool prices. Industry will also be suspicious of paying any form of hidden subsidy to British Coal through higher electricity prices. Both issues have to be resolved if the generators are to continue to justify a lower yield than other privatised utilities.</p>

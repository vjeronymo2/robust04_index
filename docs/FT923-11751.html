			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Steady growth seen at BAA airports PASSENGER traffic at airports run by BAA is showing a steady recovery from the depressed levels of 1991, said Mr Brian Smith, chairman, seen above left talking to Sir John Egan, chief executive, at yesterday's annual meeting. BAA's passenger traffic should grow between 5 and 8 per cent in the year to March 1993, representing a 2 per cent improvement on 1990, he said. Over the longer term, the growth rate should settle down at 4 per cent. BAA shares rose after the annual meeting, but closed 7p lower at 644p in a falling stock market. These figures concealed a 'very depressed' market for UK domestic traffic, dominated by business travellers, said Mr Smith. The brightest spot was in long haul travel, where passenger numbers were 8 to 10 per cent higher than two years ago. Recent deregulation at Heathrow had led to a growing number of airlines that wanted to use the airport, said Mr Smith. 'Passenger numbers (at Heathrow) actually grew by 2 per cent in the year ending March 1992.' On future projects, Mr Smith said that consultations with contractors had begun on the Pounds 800m fifth terminal at Heathrow, while the preliminary work had started on the Paddington Station to Heathrow rail link. The rail service should open in 1997, he said.</p>

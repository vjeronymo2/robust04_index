			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / US unemployment at four-year low The US unemployment rate dropped to 5.9 per cent last month, its lowest rate for four years, but other statistics published yesterday showed the pace of job creation slowing. The department of labour said the number of jobs outside the farm sector rose by 239,000 in September to 114.1m, after seasonal adjustment, with private sector employment rising by 174,000 to 95m. Most economists said this growth was more modest than expected, even though it was offset by an upwards revision to non-farm jobs in August. Financial markets had hoped the employment report, the first significant indication of September's economic conditions, would give a clear picture of whether the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates again to slow the economic expansion to a less inflationary pace. But the data offered mixed signals. After an initial fall, the US Treasury 30-year bond climbed  17/32 to 95 9/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.907 per cent late in the session. Stocks followed bonds upwards, the Dow Jones Industrial Aver age finished 21.87 higher to 3,797.43. In all, the number of jobs in the US has risen by 3m so far this year, but the pace of job creation has slowed from an average of 396,000 a month in the first quarter to an average of 258,000 a month over the July to September quarter. These figures are based on a labour department survey of businesses, and are generally regarded as more accurate than the survey of households, which is used to produce the overall unemployment rate. That rate has fallen from 6.7 per cent in January to 5.9 per cent in September, but interpretation has been complicated by a change at the beginning of this year in data collection methods. Nevertheless, the current rate is lower than most economists' estimates of the 'natural rate of unemployment', below which workers start to bid wages up. Average hourly earnings in the private sector rose by 0.3 per cent last month to Dollars 11.16, and stand 2.6 per cent higher than they did a year ago. But with an increase in overtime, weekly earnings averaged Dollars 386.14, up 0.6 per cent on last month and 3.2 per cent over the last year. While many Wall Street economists argue that interest rates will have to rise again to quell inflationary pressures, businesses have been worried that the Fed, which raised its short term interest rates for the fifth time this year on August 16, might choke the economy into a recession.</p>

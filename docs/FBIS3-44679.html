			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Short commentary" by Cang Mang (5547 5413): "A Wise Move"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Government journal, FEDERAL REGISTER,  recently published the findings of an investigation which  acknowledged that the Qinghe sock factory did not export its  products to the United States, and that this is unlikely to  happen in the future. Hence, the so-called "case of Beijing's  Prison No. 1 exporting goods to the United States" -- which was  concocted in 1991 by Wolf, a member of the U.S. House of  Representatives -- has finally come to light.    In Sino-U.S. trade and other bilateral ties, problems and  misunderstandings of one kind or another may occur; this is  quite natural. The problems can be resolved easily and  misunderstandings can eventually be dispelled as long as the two  sides respect each other and hold consultations based on equal  footing, with sincerity and cooperation. With a serious and  earnest attitude, the U.S. Federal Government, in cooperation  with the Chinese Government, meticulously investigated and  eventually drew realistic conclusions on the case, which had  remained "unsettled" for more than two years.    On the question of prison goods, the policy of the Chinese  Government is clear and its measures are resolute. As early as  10 October 1991, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economy and  the Ministry of Judiciary jointly promulgated the "Regulations  Reiterating the Ban on Export of Prison Goods." According to  the provisions, prison enterprises do not have the right and are  not allowed to carry out activities involving foreign trade and  economy. Responsible officials of the Chinese departments  concerned, emphasized this position on numerous occasions.  Since the signing in Washington on 7 August 1992 of the  "Memorandum of Understanding on Banning Exports of Prison Goods"  between the representatives of China and the United States, the  Chinese side has strictly enforced the relevant provisions of  the memorandum. Meanwhile, China's concerned departments also  offered positive cooperation to U.S. political figures,  including Representative Wolf, during their visits to Beijing's  Prison No. 1. All of this fully indicates the sincerity of the  Chinese side in resolving the question of prison goods.    In recent years, U.S. Government and public figures have  visited China one after another. Through what they have seen  and heard, most of them have gained a practical understanding  and an objective and a just appraisal of the tremendous progress  made in China's reform over the past decade or so, which has  further increased their confidence in the future of Sino-U.S.  ties. Nevertheless, a handful of people still have prejudices  against China. In spite of the facts, they spare no efforts to  create trouble, mix up black and white, confuse the public, and  harm Sino-U.S. relations, eventually resulting in an unpleasant  conclusion. We hold that there should be more sincerity and  less prejudice in order to improve Sino-U.S. ties.    Since the Sino-U.S. Seattle summit, a good development trend  has appeared in Sino-U.S. relations. China is the largest  developing nation, while the United States is the most developed  nation in the world, and the two sides share a wide range of  common interests. As long as both sides are sincere and make  efforts to increase mutual understanding and trust, we believe  that the obstacles in bilateral relations can be removed and  that Sino-U.S. ties can be established on a solid basis.</p>

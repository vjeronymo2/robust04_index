			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: A unitary coal business would offer the industry more security Sir, The theme of Tony Jackson's article ('No more buried treasure', August 9) was that UK coal reserves, and the collieries which work them, have a value only to the extent that coal production is - or can be - profitable. I do not dispute that general principle. Where Mr Jackson's analysis was deficient - apart from his underestimation of the technical difficulties and costs of mothballing collieries - is his lack of appreciation of how the UK coal industry's efficiency has advanced in recent times. Since the national strike of the mid-1980s British Coal collieries have achieved real unit cost reductions averaging 5 per cent each year. We can and will maintain this rate of progress. The figure of Pounds 2.3bn which Mr Jackson quotes as the 'subsidy' inherent in British Coal's prices to the electricity generators is open to serious dispute; the figure is, in any event, out of date, because it was calculated on the basis of British Coal's 1990-93 contracts with the generators now expired - not the current ones. At privatisation, the new owner of British Coal is likely to find that it has more collieries capable of matching the price of imported coal, delivered to the UK customer, than it can find a market for. The crux of the problem is that the size of the UK coal market will be constrained by possible sales volume imposed largely by the excessive building of new gas-fired power stations - rather than by the relative cost of UK and imported coal. Whether the UK coal industry will have a viable future beyond expiry of the present coal contracts in 1998 will be determined by the extent to which it is able to retain and reinvest the profitability which its efficiency ought to justify. The key issue here is privatisation structure; as Mr Jackson acknowledges, the life of a fragmented UK coal industry is likely to be nasty, brutish and short. While British Coal will be able to compete with imports within the UK, it will not normally be able to compete in export markets. This will place enormous bargaining strength in the hands of the electricity generators when it comes to renegotiating the present coal contracts. A unitary coal business would be best placed to counter that strength, as well as being best able to spread the risks inherent in all mining operations, particularly those undertaken in UK geological conditions. It is true, as Mr Jackson points out, that in terms of employee numbers British Coal is now but a shadow of its former self. But surely that does not justify the insouciance with which he contemplates our complete demise?

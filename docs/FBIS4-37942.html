			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Rafiq Khalil al-Ma'luf in Washington and Randah </F> Taqiyy al-Din: "Dembri Escalates on Sahara Issue and Does Not  Rule Out Madani's Release"]    [Text] France yesterday reaffirmed its "full solidarity  with Algeria, calling for a political dialogue in the country  that would lead to legislative elections as soon as possible."  Algerian Prime Minister Kokdad Sifi said after a meeting with  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe that stability in his  country concerned not only Algeria but also "its close and  distant neighbors and all Europe." Algerian Foreign Minister  Mohamed Salah Dembri said that he would not rule out the release  of Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] Leader Cheikh Abbasi Madani.  The Algerian minister escalated his country's position on the  issue of the Western Sahara and warned of the consequences of  holding a dishonest referendum.    At a press conference he held Wednesday evening [22 June] in  Washington, Dembri said that he discussed with the U.S.  officials he met with the question of the Sahara crisis,  particularly the question of support for the UN plan. "We  discussed the difficulties which appeared in the past few months  as far as fulfillment of the appropriate prerequisites for an  impartial and fair referendum, the most important being the  determination of identity, the number of voters, organization of  the election campaign, and the required guarantees after the  referendum. These matters have not been tackled yet. They  should be tackled in accordance with the Security Council  resolutions through direct negotiations between Morocco and the  Polisario. We encourage that. At the same, if the negotiations  led to a Moroccan-Saharan Evian...why not?"    The Algerian minister said that the U.S. side confirmed  continued "support for the UN plan and for the solution of the  outstanding problems."    Asked about the possibility of an Algerian-Moroccan  confrontation, he replied that Algeria is a state with  responsibilities, does not want adventurism over the region's  stability, and is willing to work for the promotion of the  necessary solutions "but we warned all parties, including the  United Nations, that if no impartial referendum is carried  out...that might lead us to a situation similar to what happened  in Angola ...."    The Algerian minister expressed satisfaction with the  results  of his talks with senior officials in Washington, especially  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Presidential National  Security Adviser Anthony Lake. He said that President Bill  Clinton's administration showed understanding and support for  the Algerian Government's reform steps in the political and  economic fields.    He saw "the observations made" by the U.S. side "as part of  the exchange of views" between the two governments, and said  that Algeria is not prepared "to seek advice on how to run our  own home" because that would be "like interference in our  internal affairs."    The Algerian minister confirmed that he explained to the  U.S.  side the efforts his government is making "for an open dialogue  with all on the condition of respect for the constitution, the  rule of law, the component of the national identity, separation  of Islam from the political debate, plurality, the republican  regime, and exclusion of violence as a means of reaching power  or staying in power." He added that Washington expressed  support for that and for the expansion of participation, and  condemned terrorism. He considered that the U.S. criticisms on  human rights violations were aimed directly at "terrorist  practices and not the Algerian authorities."    He noted that Secretary Christopher expressed the  administration's satisfaction with the "serious approach" of the  government and "its way of reviving the election process as soon  as possible." He added that there was an exchange of views on  the need to enlarge the circle of dialogue which, he said, "is  open to everyone without exception, only barring elements who  take up arms against the rules of the political game." He added  that the U.S. Administration wished to see "the dialogue  broadened at the earliest opportunity to ensure the success of  the political process. That is also our hope. We in Algeria  are working for broader participation...."    He also said that Christopher told him that the U.S. press  reports of a change in the position of the administration and  reapprochement with the opposition "did not reflect its  position."    The Algerian official said that he noticed that some U.S.  officials had misunderstood the facts of what is happening in  Algeria as some of them still believed that what used to  happened in the days of the government of Abdesselam Belaid "is  still happening now."    Asked about the possibility of releasing Cheikh Abbasi  Madani, the Algerian opposition leader, he replied: "Everything  concerning the issue of the prisoners is possible in a  democratic regime because that is linked to the powers of the  head of state. I do not know if there is any possibility in  this connection but I do not rule out such a possibility...."    Asked about the nature of the differences between France and  the United States on the situation in Algeria, he replied that  he knew the nature of the U.S.-French differences "but we  proceed on the basis of: What interests does Algeria have with  France and what interests does it have with the United States?"  He said that Algeria occupies the top position among the Arab  states in terms of trade and economic relations with France, and  comes third after Saudi Arabia and Egypt in its trade and  economic relations with the United States. "With the Americans  and the French we discuss common interests...and we do not waste  time on the differences. At the same time, when they behave in  a manner denoting interference in our affairs, we tell them that  is unacceptable...."    In Paris, Mokdad Sifi met on his last day in France with  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.    After the meeting, which was held at the Quai D'Orsay, the  French minister said: "We exchanged views on the situation in  Algeria and the region. I restated to Sifi France's position  since he became prime minister. It is a position of full  solidarity with Algeria. We wish Algeria stability because it  is a part of a region of direct interest to France. We had  expressed the hope that Algeria would start economic reforms in  the direction of a market economy. That is now being done. As  regards the agreements signed with the IMF, they were very  positive and we have honored our commitments in them. France  has made large contributions to international and bilateral aid.  We had also expressed the hope that a political dialogue would  begin with all parties which agree to join. We have received  assurances that this is what is happening now. I welcomed the  fact that the European troika ministers have visited Algeria to  confirm that position which is also France's position."    In reply to a question from AL-HAYAH on the difference  between the U.S. and the French positions on the situation in  Algeria, Juppe said: "We discussed this issue with President  Clinton who recently visited Paris. There was an identity of  views. President Clinton assured us that he supports the  stabilization process and the economic reform program in  Algeria."    Asked if Sifi's visit was more economic than political, he  replied: "There are two aspects to his visit. Stability in  Algeria depends on the success of the economic reform in  improving the conditions of the population. The Algerian prime  minister stressed to us the need to improve the standards of the  population, provide work opportunities, and improve living  conditions, but that must be coupled with political dialogue  with anyone willing to abandon the knives and the Kalashnikovs.  That should begin quickly in order to lead to legislative  elections as soon as possible."    Sifi said that he agreed with everything Juppe said, and he  emphasized that he found that "our French partners understand  our situation and the challenges we face, particularly as they  have placed Algeria's problem in the broader framework of  European-Maghreb relations." He aded: "We are satisfied with  that assessment which was also confirmed to me by the officials  I met with in Europe. They conveyed to me their multifaceted  support in all fields to enable Algeria to end its crisis and  contribute to the region's stability. Stability concerns  Algeria first but it also concerns its near and distant  neighbors as well as all Europe."</p>

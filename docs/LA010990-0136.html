			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ANDERSON 76ERS PAST PACERS  </P> <P> Charles Barkley scored 32 points and Hersey Hawkins 27, but Ron Anderson made  perhaps the greatest contribution Monday night at Philadelphia as the 76ers  beat the Indiana Pacers, 120-116.  </P> <P> Anderson, who was traded from Indiana to Philadelphia before the start of last  season, came off the bench to score 21 points, including nine in the fourth  quarter. His two free throws with seven seconds remaining helped clinch the  victory.  </P> <P> "It's nice to win against them, but it's really old hat now and nothing really  extra special," he said.  </P> <P> Anderson, who has struggled with his shooting this season, made nine of 16  shots.  </P> <P> The Pacers, who shot 61%, made 10 of 17 three-point shots. Reggie Miller made  four of six three-pointers and finished with a career-high 38 points.  </P> <P> George McCloud's three-point basket with eight seconds to left narrowed 76ers'  lead to 118-116 before Anderson's free throws clinched it.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 126, Charlotte 113 -- Greg Anderson scored a season-high 28 points at  Milwaukee to lead the Bucks to their eighth victory in nine games.  </P> <P> Charlotte, the NBA's only winless team on the road, is 0-13 as a visitor this  season and has lost 14 consecutive away games dating to last season.  </P> <P> Ricky Pierce scored 23 points, and Alvin Robertson and Jay Humphries each added  17 for the Bucks.  </P> <P> Armon Gilliam had 25 points and J.R. Reid 21 for the Hornets.  </P> <P> Dallas 110, Seattle 96 -- The Mavericks, avenging a 47-point loss in their last  meeting against the SuperSonics, got 21 points from Rolando Blackman at Dallas.  </P> <P> Seattle's leading scorer, Dale Ellis, was assessed two technical fouls and  ejected in the second quarter, bringing to an end a 256-game streak in which he  reached double figures in scoring. Ellis scored six points.  </P> <P> The Sonics defeated the Mavericks, 117-70, in November in a game that some say  led to the firing of Coach John MacLeod.  </P> <P> Xavier McDaniel had 19 for Seattle.  </P> <P> Orlando 111, San Antonio 102 -- Scott Skiles hit a key three-point basket and  Otis Smith sank five free throws in the final 1:09 at Orlando as the Magic  ended an eight-game losing streak.  </P> <P> The victory was only the third in the last 19 games for the expansion Magic,  but all have come against division leaders -- the other two against the Lakers  and Chicago Bulls.  </P> <P> Reggie Theus had 23 points for Orlando and Smith came off the bench to score  21. Mark Acres had 14 points and a career-high 15 rebounds.  </P> <P> David Robinson had 32 points for San Antonio.  </P> <P> Portland 108, Sacramento 96 -- Kevin Duckworth had a season-high 26 points and  Clyde Drexler added 25 as the Trail Blazers beat the Kings at Portland.  </P> <P> Trailing, 75-73, at the end of the third quarter, the Trail Blazers had an 11-0  run midway through the fourth to jump ahead and deal Sacramento its 13th defeat  in 14 games.  </P> <P> Danny Ainge, who scored 11 consecutive points during 15-0 third-quarter run by  the Kings, finished with 24.  </P> <P> Warriors 139, Nuggets 122 -- Rookie Tim Hardaway had 19 points, 10 rebounds and  19 assists to lead the Warriors at Oakland.  </P> <P> Mitch Richmond scored a season-high 32 points and Chris Mullin added 30, for  the Warriors, who won their fourth consecutive game. Michael Adams led the  Nuggets with 26.  </P> <P> Playing without head coach Doug Moe, who was back in Denver recovering from the  flu, the Nuggets trailed by one at halftime. The lead see-sawed in the third  quarter before the Warriors scored the final 14 points of the period to take a  103-94 advantage.  </P></p>

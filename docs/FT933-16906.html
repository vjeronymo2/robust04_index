			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Gilt sentiment tested by disappointing auction THE UK government yesterday carried out its biggest ever borrowing exercise, but the auction of Pounds 3.25bn of gilts was also one of its most disappointing. The cover - the ratio of offers to accepted bids - at the Bank of England's auction was only 1.1, the worst level for five years and well down on the market's forecast of at least 1.5. Long gilt futures at first fell sharply. However, the market's faith in UK economic trends, in particular low inflation, helped prices to more than recover the lost ground. This enabled the Bank of England to announce another Pounds 800m of 9 per cent gilts due 2008 in the late afternoon. The low level of bidding initially raised concern that gilt yields might have to rise to enable the government to meet its Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement for 1993-94, pushing up costs. The government is, however, well advanced with its fund raising. In the first three months of the year it has borrowed Pounds 19.5bn, two thirds through auctions and the rest through taps or gilt sales. Yesterday's auction of 8 per cent gilts due 2003 was targeted at overseas investors who prefer 10-year bonds. Overseas buyers, particularly from Japan, have been piling into UK gilts recently, attracted by low inflation, slow recovery and a strengthening pound. But sterling's recent rally against a number of European currencies has diminished the opportunity for currency gains. Demand has also been checked by a rise in gilt prices, with remaining appetite to some extent sated by three small taps at the end of last week, totalling Pounds 850m, and some unofficial gilt selling. Mr Andy Tweed, a gilts specialist with BZW, said: 'The market has been pigging itself with sweets before the main meal.' Most economists were surprised by the low cover and the unusually large 'tail' - the gap between the lowest accepted bid price and the average bid price. Mr George Magnus, economist with SG Warburg, said: 'It was very disappointing, especially after the flurry of overseas buying that the market has seen for the past couple of weeks. 'But the fundamental economic reasons why people have wanted to buy gilts over the past two weeks have not changed.' Bonds, Page 34; Lex, Page 24</p>

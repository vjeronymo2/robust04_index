			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses rise on French rate cut A FURTHER cut in French interest rates lifted senior bourses yesterday, and although the Bundesbank held rates steady, its former president Karl Otto Pohl said he expected the German central bank to relax its tight monetary grip next year, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw the next best thing to an earnings upgrade as DB Research recommended Siemens after Wednesday's results, cyclicals responded to an improvement in sentiment and the DAX index rose 23.16 to 1,535.37 in turnover rose from DM4.6bn to DM6.5bn. Siemens rose DM13.80 to DM572.50 after an 8.9 per cent rise in net profits and an unchanged dividend. Mr Gunter Dielmann at DB Research said that the group had underperformed the DAX by 5 per cent since late September on bearish expectations about the results which, in the event, were at the top end of expectations. Strength in carmakers, steels and engineering reflected a technical recovery after poor performance in recent weeks. Weakness in the construction sector, where Holzmann dropped DM13 to DM922 and Hochtief by DM11 to DM1,009, followed reports that the industry was cooling down further. Schering and Dresdner Bank were the only two DAX stocks to show a loss. The pharmaceuticals company fell 50 pfg to DM738 on a fall in nine-month net profits. The bank stayed under pressure from its planned DM750m eurobond issue with equity warrants attached, closing DM3 lower at DM353. PARIS saw gains in interest rate-sensitive stocks as the CAC-40 index ended 23.05 higher at 1,821.51 in heavy turnover of FFr3.3bn. BNP CIs put on FFr11.10 to FFr380 and Schneider added FFr21 to FFr585. LVMH, which had fallen last week on fears of a trade war between the US and Europe, jumped FFr148 or 4.1 per cent to FFr3,740 on hopes that the Gatt talks would end favourably. Saint-Gobain dropped FFr10 to FFr525 on disappointing nine-month sales which led several brokers to downgrade their earnings forecasts. Peugeot lost another FFr5.10 to FFr490.90 due to the poor outlook for domestic car sales. MILAN interpreted reports of a reorganisation at Fiat as a sign that the group was about to sell off some of its subsidiaries, and shares linked to Fiat rose sharply. But a company spokesman said later that the plans outlined by Fiat's managing director, Mr Cesare Romiti, did not involve any asset sales. The Comit index fell 1.8 to 448.19 in turnover estimated at around Wednesday's L305bn. Trading was also influenced by the end of the account today as operators adjusted their portfolios. Analysts expect the market to perform well in the December account on year-end window-dressing and the prospect of further positive developments on the budget and the government's privatisation plans. Among Fiat group shares, Cogefar, its construction unit, rose L405 or 19 per cent to L2,540 and Rinascente by L900 to L7,900. Fiat was fixed L37 lower at L4,457 but then rallied to L4,650 after hours. STOCKHOLM fell 1.2 per cent in heavy trading as the dollar faltered and domestic interest rates climbed. The Affarsvarlden General index shed 8.10 to 714.50 in turnover of SKr573m after SKr486m. Astra A shares fell another SKr4 to SKr585 on its nine-month earnings report but the B shares were steady at 573. The forestry company, Korsnas, was the day's winner with a gain of SKr11 or 15 per cent to SKr84 after the holding company, Kinnevik, increased its bid for the company. COPENHAGEN continued the advance prompted by Tuesday's repo rate cut, writes Hilary Barnes, with banks up by 4.2 per cent and shipping by 4.3 per cent as the all-share index put on 7.19 or 2.7 per cent to 269.21. Danske Bank rose DKr8 to DKr40 and Unidanmark by DKr10 to DKr143. Novo Nordisk rose DKr15 to DKr525 on forecasts of 15 pre-tax profits growth in 1992 after a slightly disappointing third-quarter result. AMSTERDAM was lifted by the dollar and a pleasing third-quarter earnings report from Royal Dutch. The CBS Tendency index ended up 1.3 at 105.10. Royal Dutch added Fl 2.10 to Fl 147.70, as dealers were encouraged by the company's positive outlook for the fourth quarter. BRUSSELS closed higher as the interest rate cut in France fuelled expectations of a similar move in Belgium. The Bel-20 index rose 7.45 to 1,142.83 in turnover of BFr1.12bn. Among banks, Kredietbank added BFr150 to BFr5,890.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- November 12 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1048.69  1051.23   1054.15  1057.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1111.72  1116.02   1118.30  1120.52 Hourly changes          13.00    14.00    15.00   Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1059.09  1059.14  1060.62  1059.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1122.51  1121.41  1121.87  1120.89  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Nov 11      Nov 10     Nov 9 FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1045.16++   1054.50   1043.29 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1108.98++   1117.70   1108.00                            Nov 6     Nov 5 FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1038.28   1038.93 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1111.70   1109.13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1061.09 ; 200 - 1123.76 Low/day: 100 - 1048.69  200 - 1111.72 ++Partial  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

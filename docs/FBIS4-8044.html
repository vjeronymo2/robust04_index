			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 8 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav  Government is taking stern measures against illegal foreign  currency transactions in an effort to maintain stability of the  national currency -- dinar.    By the end of next week, the federal parliament is under  summary procedure to adopt amendments to the law on foreign  exchange operations. The amendments stipulate that buying and  selling foreign currency at the rate higher than the official  one is a criminal offense.    Under the government proposal, the law is to ensure a  uniform  rate of the dinar be applied in all financial transactions. The  dinar is currently pegged to the German mark, one dinar to 1  German mark.    The issuing of the dinar is under strict control as of  January 24, when the Federal Government launched a programme  aimed at restructuring the monetary system and effecting  economic recovery.    The new dinar, 100 percent covered with gold and foreign  currency, was introduced at the time when the monthly inflation  recording 313 million percent threatened to invite a total  monetary collapse.    The emergence of an unofficial, so-called 'Staeetzung'  exchange rate, in inter-company financial dealings was assessed  by experts as a phenomenon jeopardizing the programme, although  it has not become rampant.    Early in the week seven persons were arrested in Belgrade on  grounded suspicion that they were involved in illegal  trafficking of one million German marks at blackmarket exchange  rate.    The Serbian Government, too, has announced a number of new  measures aimed at stabilizing the dinar and the economy. Thus,  Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic said Thursday the 30-percent cut  in public expenditure would be put on the Serbian parliament  agenda.    He also said there would be a sizeable cut in the planned  budget deficit. Many taxes are also to be lowered.    The biggest obstacle in the way of stabilization of economic  and monetary flows is a total blockade imposed by the U.N.  Security Council on May 30, 1992.</p>

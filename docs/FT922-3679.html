			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Viag buys into shipping concern VIAG, the fast-growing German conglomerate, is to enter the international shipping, freight and warehousing business through the purchase of a one-third stake in Kuhne &amp; Nagel (K&amp;N). The German group, which is understood to have an option on a further 10 per cent, will shepherd the Swiss-based concern to a flotation within the next three years. The deal constitutes a rapid change of partners for Mr Klaus-Michael Kuhne, sole owner of K&amp;N since the start of this year, when he bought back a 50 per cent stake held by the Lonrho group. K&amp;N sales last year rose 13.4 per cent to SFr4.8bn (Dollars 3.3bn), although net income fell 43 per cent to SFr19.6m because of a one-off SFr23m charge related to a reduction of the company's stakes in transport companies in Spain and Italy. For Viag, the move lifts its tally of 'core' businesses to eight. It presently relies on electricity and gas production and distribution for around half its earnings. Other mainstream operations include aluminium and chemicals. Group sales and earnings rose over 20 per cent last year, thanks mainly to acquisitions.</p>

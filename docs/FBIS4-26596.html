			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ye Jundong (0673 0193 2639)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Chen Junsheng, state  councillor and director of the State Flood Control and Drought  Relief Headquarters, and a central joint work group led by him  went to the main dike along the Bei Jiang in Guangdong today.  They extended their regards to the cadres, people, commanders  and fighters of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], and officers  and men of the armed police working on the forefront of  combating floods there. They fully affirmed the work done in  the preceding period by the party, government, and army  organizations in Guangdong in combating floods and dealing with  emergencies.    Chen Junsheng was briefed by Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin,  Vice Governor Ou Guangyuan, and other responsible comrades on  the flood control work along the Bei Jiang dike in the preceding  period. After inspecting some dangerous sections and spots, Chen  Junsheng said: An interim success, better than expected, has  been achieved in the flood control along the Bei Jiang dike.  The work has been done comparatively well because the  provincial party committee and the provincial government have  provided effective leadership, each has attended to its duties,  the party, the government, the army and the people have made  concerted efforts, and the officers and men of the PLA units in  Guangzhou have played a key role at a crucial moment.    Chen Junsheng said: While strengthening the Bei Jing dike,  great attention should be paid to removing silt and obstacles.  In order to enhance flood regulation capability in the future,  flood regulation and storage projects should be built over the  Bei Jiang and the Xi Jiang in the Zhu Jiang valley.    Chen Junsheng issued some instructions on Guangdong's flood  relief work in the next step.    At 5 pm, Chen Junsheng and his party went to the flood  control work site of the PLA units in Guangzhou. On behalf of  the party Central Committee, the State Council and the Central  Military Commission, they gave their regards to PLA commanders  and fighters there, and encouraged the latter to make persistent  efforts to achieve new success in combating floods.

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> WOMAN REPLACES JAPANESE CABINET MEMBER WHO QUIT IN SEX SCANDAL  </P> <P> Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu handed a key Cabinet job to a woman today, hours  after its holder resigned in a flap over an extramarital affair.  </P> <P> Mayumi Moriyama, 61, director-general of the Environment Agency, was named to  replace Tokuo Yamashita, 69, as chief Cabinet secretary, a highly visible post  that includes speaking on behalf of the government and coordinating Cabinet  affairs. She is the first woman ever to hold the post.  </P> <P> Yamashita's is the second sex scandal to hit the conservative Liberal  Democratic Party in two months. Sosuke Uno announced his resignation as prime  minister in July amid allegations he had an extramarital affair with an  ex-geisha.  </P> <P> Moriyama's appointment was widely seen as intended to contain damage caused by  the latest scandal, but analysts and party officials expressed doubt about  whether she has enough experience to handle the current situation.  </P> <P> "I was just appointed, and I can't really tell what it is going to be like,"  she said in a news conference. "But as far as my near 40-year professional  experience is concerned, I never felt any handicaps for being a woman."  </P> <P> Yamashita announced his resignation this morning after apologizing for an  extramarital affair with a bar hostess 43 years younger than he is.  </P></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Inquiry into medical fees: Carsberg referral attacks heart of private practice BRITAIN'S consultants might have been forgiven if they collectively missed a heartbeat yesterday when Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director general of fair trading, announced that he was referring the fee rates charged for supply of private medical services to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In the last two years there has been a sharp rise in fees for private medical work in the guidelines published by the British Medical Association, the professional body for doctors and consultants in the UK. The guidelines reflect the average rates for private work charged by consultants around the country. The referral comes at a highly sensitive time for the private health sector. Increases in insurance premiums - which finance the bulk of activity - have continued to outpace inflation dramatically during the recession. Some insurers have, amid growing fears that private health could price itself out of the reach of many of its customers, accused hospital operators of doing too little to contain rising costs. The BMA insists it simply issues guidelines, and does not set recommended fee rates as stated by the OFT yesterday. But a number of medical professionals say private consultants' fees have crept up from below the BMA guidelines, which have become a baseline in the three years since they were published. The guideline fees went up by about 10.5 per cent in the 1990 BMA review, and by about 16 per cent on many operations in the latest review published last week. Under the guidelines patients seeking private health treatment in the UK might pay as little as Pounds 35 for minor ear surgery and more than Pounds 8,000 for a liver transplant involving hours of work. The schedule stresses: 'Consultants must always decide themselves on the appropriate fee for the service provided.' The 54-page list of guideline prices for about 1,500 medical procedures was first produced in 1989, after several years of study by the fees working party, created in 1985 on the instructions of its annual meeting and led by Mr John Chawner, now chairman of the BMA consultants' committee. Previously consultants had been guided by the list of payments approved by BUPA, but they now appear to be increasingly guided by the BMA schedule, which typically has higher rates. The MMC will discover that there is little information publicly available on how much doctors earn from private practice. BUPA - which, as one of the largest private medical insurers, has a substantial amount of information on the fees charged by doctors - refused to comment on the details of the inquiry, but pledged to co-operate fully with the inquiry. A study by the King's Fund health care think tank earlier this year estimated that consultants in London received Pounds 175m in private practice fees in 1989-90 - more than the Pounds 153m spent by NHS health authorities on consultant services in the capital. Mr William Laing, director of Laing and Buisson, a specialist medical publisher and consultant, estimated that 12,000 of Britain's 19,000 consultants carried out private work in a market with an annual turnover of about Pounds 500m. 'On average they earn as much from private practice in a day as they do for the rest of the week in the NHS,' he said. Private health care insurers have complained about the BMA guidelines since their introduction because of the effect of increasing medical rates and reducing fee competition. That message had filtered through to the OFT by early this year. Mr Roy Forman, chief executive of Private Patients Planning Group, said many doctors had historically charged below the guideline rates and a small number had charged more - but rates were now converging towards those in the BMA schedule. Mr Tim Baker, business development manager with Norwich Union Health Care, said: 'There have been problems within the medical profession about setting prices for a long time. And there has been pressure from medical insurers.' Behind the OFT's referral lies a concern to contain private health charges familiar in the US and other European countries, where insurance-based systems have sent costs spiralling for decades. The Office of Health Economics estimates that private health care expenditure per head in the UK in 1990 was Pounds 88. In the US it was Pounds 827, in Germany Pounds 290 and in France Pounds 270. The US devotes twice as big a share of its national income to health as Britain. Wherever healthcare is paid for by patients who claim the cost back from insurance companies, there is an absence of downward pressure on costs. The patient, after all, will pay any bill within reason and is unlikely to question medical charges if the cost can be passed straight on to the insurer.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Scepticism grows over access to Japan's markets THE Japanese government's deregulation programme has been billed as an initiative that will add trillions of yen to domestic demand and create a million jobs, but many foreign companies in Japan are sceptical that tinkering with a few rules and regulations will actually open Japan's doors to more foreign imports, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. A group of foreign-affiliated companies' managers in Japan has launched a scathing attack on the government's efforts to enhance access to Japan's markets and has called on the government to take concrete measures such as setting targets for foreign market share in specific products and industries, in order to realise the full benefits of deregulation. In a report published this week, the Foreign-Affiliated Companies Management Association notes that no matter how many laws are changed, the bureaucratic red tape that hampers foreign penetration of Japanese markets is unlikely to change without a fundamental change in the way government offices are run and in the attitude of public officials. The FAMA report cites cases in which foreign companies' efforts to market products in Japan have been thwarted by the action and attitude of government ministries rather than by official regulations. For example, a German-affiliated company attempting to import a new kind of health drink to Japan was required to submit confidential product data to Japanese customs only to be kept waiting for one year before official approval was given. Meanwhile, a Japanese company began marketing a similar product and the German company was forced to give up plans to sell the product in Japan, the report states. In another case, a European company had its application for a foreign executive's visa held up for nearly a year because he had not gone to university, prompting the justice ministry to view his academic background as that of foreign blue collar workers, against whom Japan has a closed labour policy.</p>

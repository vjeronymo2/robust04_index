			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Arts: Delightful Mr Shaw - Alastair Macaulay reviews The Devil's Disciple The greatest pleasure of the National Theatre's new production of George Bernard Shaw's 1897 play The Devil's Disciple is that it puts us for over two hours in the company of Shaw himself. Who, we soon feel, is the best company in the world. In life-and-death situations, he never loses his sense of humour; amid busy narrative passages, he never loses an opportunity to throw in serious points. The play never stagnates into sheer dialectic; about every five minutes, Shaw adds some new twist to the plot that takes us by surprise. A pity that this staging is not a lot better - but it does nothing to get in Shaw's way. The Devil's Disciple, set in New England during the American War of Independence, contains three archetypal Shaw male characters. The first is Dick Dudgeon, a charming buccaneer, so fiercely determined to reject Puritan repression that he is content to be known as 'the devil's disciple'. The second is Anthony Anderson, a Presbyterian minister and also a man of action committed to the American cause. The third is the British general John Burgoyne, a leader who can survey both minor incidents and the vast pattern of history with an endless supply of sardonic humour. Though they are utterly distinct characters, you can hear in all three Shaw's own voice - irreverent, audacious, authoritative, ironic, wonderfully funny. Amid these three humorous heroes is a humourless heroine, as urgent and complex and fresh as Shaw loved his heroines to be. She is Anderson's wife Judith, who finds herself in more than one extraordinary dilemma. Should she let one man go to his death to save another? Should she follow the dictates of her heart or her duty? Shaw called his play 'a melodrama'. Would that Christopher Morahan, the director, had a higher conception - a more dramatic conception - of what melodrama can be. And would that British actors today had a surer sense of how deadly seriousness and ironic humour can co-exist in the same person at the same time. Richard Bonneville is an amiable actor, but he has neither the devil-may-care freedom of spirit (and body) nor the appealing glamour to make Dick a hero. His most original effect - to have the jitters just before mounting the gallows - is a mistake. Like Paul Jesson, who plays Anderson, he fails to press home the character's moments of terrible seriousness. Jesson's transformation from a quiet priest into a passionate man of action is funnier than I had realised it could be, but it carries little conviction. Daniel Massey by contrast, plays General Burgoyne as easily as falling off a log. He can switch - even during the course of a sentence - from languid irony to vehement urgency. If anything, he overdoes this relaxation of manner, but that is an error on the right side. To turn from him to the younger Bonneville and Jesson is to be alarmed: perhaps only actors who grew up in days of empire can know how to blend commanding power with casual impishness? What is good about Helen McCrory's Judith is so good and so right that you wonder why she leaves parts of the role so tepid. She has the self-consciously erect Puritan carriage, the mixture of moral probity and emotional vulnerability, and also the inquiring freshness. In some scenes, it is she who turns up the dramatic tension in an instant. So why is she so subdued in the scene of Dick's arrest? Morahan and his set designer, John Gunter, place the action very much to the front of the Olivier stage, with the result that when the actors are turned to speak to each other across its wide expanse, not all of them are always perfectly audible. But it is easy to find this kind of fault. The evening belongs to Shaw, and the production does not steal it from him. In repertory at the Olivier Theatre</p>

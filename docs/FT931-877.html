			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Helene makes recommended Pounds 5.5m paper bid for Gabicci HELENE, the clothing distributor, yesterday launched a Pounds 5.5m recommended bid for Gabicci, the USM-quoted casual clothing group. The all-share bid, which offers 2.043 new Helene shares for every Gabicci share held, was recommended by a majority of the Gabicci board. Helene has also received undertakings to accept from some Gabicci directors and institutional shareholders, who together hold 30.1 per cent of the company. However, two Gabicci executive directors are opposing the offer and criticised the absence of a cash alternative. Last month Gabicci's share price rose from 33p to 47p following the two groups' admission of merger talks. The offer values Gabicci shares at 48p, a 45 per cent premium to the price before merger speculation began. Gabicci closed up 1.5p on the day at 42.5p and Helene stabilised at 23 1/2 p. The dissident directors said that the two groups were not a good fit and Helene's financial position was weak. They said Helene has net assets per share of about 5p compared with Gabicci's 60p. One analyst said Helene's Pounds 4.58m placing last June meant it was unwilling to offer cash to Gabicci's shareholders and that Gabicci, which has suffered in the recession, had been looking for an offer for more than a year. The deal would strengthen Helene's weak balance sheet, the analyst said. Both companies released results yesterday. Gabicci announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 476,000 (Pounds 538,000 profits) for the six months ended December 19. The group made an exceptional charge of Pounds 537,000 which included the costs of abortive merger talks and a provision for a bad debt. The charge also covered a severance payment to Mr Michael Abrahams, former managing and finance director. Turnover fell to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 11m). Losses per share were 3.3p (3.1p earnings) and the interim dividend has been omitted (1.4p). Helene reported pre-tax profits for 1992 of Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 2.61m) on turnover of Pounds 76.8m (Pounds 73.5m). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 412,000 (Pounds 737,000) relating to the liquidation of Major Minor Childrenswear. The recommended final dividend is 1.36p (same) giving a maintained total of 2.01p out of earnings of 2.39p (2.48p).</p>

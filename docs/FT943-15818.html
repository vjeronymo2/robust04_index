			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Salomon issues profit warning Salomon yesterday revealed it would report a loss of about Dollars 200m (Pounds 131.5m) in the second quarter because of a poor performance from its securities brokerage unit, Salomon Brothers. The loss shows how the rise in US and European interest rates and the slump in international stock and bond markets have hurt Wall Street. After an unprecedented three years of profits growth, securities industry earnings have slowed in the past two quarters because of rising US interest rates. Higher interest rates put up firms' cost of capital, cut demand for securities underwriting services, and damp investor interest in financial markets. Salomon, which reported a steep fall in profits to Dollars 66m in the first three months of 1994, is unlikely to be the only firm hurt by turmoil in the markets. Last week Charles Schwab, the discount securities brokerage firm, warned that its earnings would be flat in the April to June period, and analysts expect other big securities firms to report a decline in quarterly profits in coming weeks. In a brief statement yesterday Salomon attributed the second-quarter loss to poor results from Salomon Brothers' client-driven business. Typically, bond trading firms such as Salomon make money from their client-driven business by profiting from the difference between the price at which they buy bonds and the price at which they then sell those bonds. In recent months, however, there have been more sellers of bonds than buyers, and Salomon was left at the end of the quarter with a large inventory of bonds which had declined in value. The firm also suffered losses on its proprietary trading operations, where it uses its own capital to trade in financial markets. Here, analysts said Salomon probably made several wrong bets on the direction of interest rates and securities prices. Although Salomon said overall group results would have been worse but for an improved performance from Phibro, its commodities trading business, news of the profits warning hit Salomon's share price, which fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

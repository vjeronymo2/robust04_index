			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak accuses Sony of patent infringement EASTMAN Kodak has filed a suit against Sony, one of Japan's leading electronics manufacturers, in a patent infringement dispute that could have broad implications throughout the consumer electronics industry. Kodak alleges that Sony's video cassette recorders, camcorders (video cameras) and other audio and video recording products infringe upon a patent that the US company obtained in 1981 covering a new type of recording head for magnetic recording devices. Industry analysts say that the same technology is widely used throughout the consumer electronics industry. Kodak declined to comment on whether it has granted patent licenses to other manufac-turers. According to the complaint, which was filed in Texas, Kodak has been attempting to reach a licensing agreement with Sony since the late 1980s. Kodak is asking the court to issue an injunction to prevent Sony from selling products in the US that allegedly infringe its patent. The US company is also seeking treble damages, although it does not specify the amount, and has asked for a jury trial. Sony's sales in the US last year were over Dollars 6bn, of which VCRs and video cameras represented a significant portion. Sony America declined to comment on the suit. The damages covered by the Kodak claim could be substantial, said Mr Jack Kelly of Goldman Sachs. He said the suit against Sony might encourage other manufacturers of recording equipment to seek licenses from Kodak. Kodak is awaiting a decision from the Japanese patent office on whether it will grant a similar patent in Japan. The patent application, which was filed in 1981, has been opposed by several Japanese companies.</p>

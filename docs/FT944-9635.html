			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Wanted, a braver Budget - Why last year's moves to encourage more investment may have been too cautious A year ago, Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, introduced three measures in his Budget that were designed to increase the flow of equity capital to small companies. The Enterprise Investment Scheme, Venture Capital Investment Trusts and extension of capital gains tax roll-over relief together represent one of the most concerted efforts to use fiscal incentives to coax life into young companies. Small-business watchers described the Budget as 'the best ever' for small business. But as the chancellor polishes his plans for another Budget on November 29, how have last year's measures affected small companies' ability to raise capital? The answer is very little at the moment, as investors have been slow to come forward. Some accountants and intermediaries say the tax breaks are a well-intentioned attempt to address a shortage of early-stage finance, but that there must be changes if they are to be effective. Enterprise Investment Scheme. Intended to finance non-property-based trading companies, the EIS replaced the Business Expansion Scheme last December after the latter had become a vehicle almost exclusively used for assured tenancy investment schemes. The ghost of the 1980s property boom lives on in the new EIS rules, however. To prevent the growth of property-based schemes, the new rules require a qualifying company to have no more than 50 per cent of gross assets in land and buildings. As John Orpen, partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand says, there are many companies, including small manufacturers, whose main asset is their building. A number of EIS schemes designed to finance perfectly legitimate trading companies have therefore fallen at this property hurdle; investors have been worried that if balance sheets weaken as a result of poor trading, they risk losing their EIS tax benefits by breaching this property rule. Orpen believes speculation on property value inflation no longer figures in the minds of investors. The Enterprise Investment and Business Expansion Schemes Association agrees and has asked the chancellor in its Budget submission to drop the property rule. There is also a problem of perception. The most recent BES schemes were tax-driven. Now the EIS is addressing investors whose prime concern must be the prospects of the underlying business. The 20 per cent up-front tax relief, down from 40 per cent under the most recent BES schemes, is not wildly exciting - sponsors will charge about 8 per cent to issue an EIS prospectus, leaving a net tax break of only 12 per cent. The uptake has consequently been low. Where the government was expecting about Pounds 125m to be invested in EIS schemes this year, Tim Villiers, chairman of the EIBESA, says a fraction of this has been raised. 'Jerry's Home Stores was quickly over-subscribed but nothing else has raised its full subscription,' Villiers says of the schemes. The EIS Company, a London-based consultancy, says only about a dozen schemes have been launched. Robert Lowe, director of Johnson Fry, the largest sponsor of BES, says his company has launched no EIS schemes. 'We don't think it makes sense for major sponsors,' Lowe says. 'What may be happening is that a sort of cottage industry is developing at a regional level with local accountants putting together deals. Maybe this is what was intended (by the government)'. Capital gains tax roll-over relief. The most recent change to this law last November allows investors to shelter capital gains by reinvesting in a private trading company up to three years after the gain is realised. Not only was the deferral of capital gains tax liability extended to cover the sale of almost any asset, the investor need now only re-invest the gain to receive the relief. Orpen and other intermediaries believe roll-over relief could be the most significant of the chancellor's capital-raising instruments as there are no restrictions on the amounts that can be invested. Inevitably, tax-based products are beginning to emerge. Johnson Fry has launched a scheme to raise up to Pounds 50m for Pioneer Oil and Gas, a private company that will buy North Sea assets already producing gas and oil and with proven reserves. Because investors are deferring their CGT liability, they are effectively receiving an interest-free loan from the Inland Revenue. It is within the new CGT roll-over relief rules, but it hardly constitutes support for capital-constrained trading companies. Venture Capital Investment Trusts. After months of listening to the pleas of the investment trust and venture capital communities, the government is likely to produce new rules in the next finance bill. The most recent proposals suggested the VCITs would look like personal equity plans that invest in unquoted companies. Much of the lobbying suggested the VCITs would fail if the government did not raise the proposed maximum investment in each portfolio company from Pounds 1m and did not introduce some form of front-end or CGT roll-over relief. It is early days for all three schemes. None of the schemes are well established - or well understood yet by investors. Furthermore, the stock market's recent performance has not encouraged investors to think of buying shares, let alone hold some of their portfolio in unquoted investments. No one expects the government to make sweeping changes in this year's budget. But the government would appear to have erred too far on the side of caution, some small company observers say. Unless it listens to some of the criticism, the schemes may flush out only a minimal amount of expansion capital despite the early promise.</p>

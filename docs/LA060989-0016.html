			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE SCHOOL FORMULA IS OUT OF LINE  </P> <P> When I first heard the terms of the settlement of the L.A. School strike, I was  flabbergasted. Where did Los Angeles find the money to give their teachers a  24% hike?  </P> <P> I wondered how the L.A. schools could possibly manage their money so much  better than other districts.  </P> <P> Alas, I discovered that they don't manage their money any better. In fact, they  don't have to.  </P> <P> The reason they don't have to manage their money better is simple: The Los  Angeles schools get a lot more money per student than any of the surrounding  school districts.  </P> <P> While the state has pumped billions of new dollars into education in the last  few years, these additional billions have been unequally distributed. Some  districts receive far more to spend on their children than others do.  </P> <P> How did this unfair situation develop?  </P> <P> Basically, the large, powerful urban districts used their political muscle to  rig the funding formulas to get an unfair share of education dollars. They  channeled more of the education budget into their special-interest programs  called "categoricals," from which they take almost all the money. This leaves a  smaller percentage of the education funding available for the basic education  programs that are funded equally for all districts through the traditional "per  student" mechanism.  </P> <P> While the categorical programs were established for noble purposes, taken as a  whole they have terribly distorted the way education dollars are distributed.  Some children are shortchanged while others have money heaped on them. As a  result of this distortion, the amount spent per pupil is now even more unequal  than when the court first ordered the state to equalize school funding more  than a decade ago. Let's look at some examples.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles schools get $1,045 per student in categorical funding while  Glendale gets only $194 per pupil and Pomona gets only $484.  </P> <P> The figure in San Jose is $1,346, which amounts to $1,152 more per child than  Glendale and $862 more per child then Pomona. Put another way, a high school  with 2,000 students in San Jose receives about $2 million more than the same  size high school in Glendale or Pomona.  </P> <P> The same is true for almost all the districts in the state. Los Angeles gets  $581 more than the average district statewide. And San Jose gets $882 more.  </P> <P> But, you may ask, "Don't Los Angeles and San Jose need more money because they  have larger numbers of poor people, and don't many of their students speak  little or no English?" Sadly, the facts undercut this argument. Glendale has 5%  more limited-English pupils than Los Angeles, yet gets $851 less per student in  categorical funding. Pomona has even more poor families than Los Angeles and  14% more than San Jose, but Pomona received $561 less per pupil than Los  Angeles and $862 less than San Jose.  </P> <P> This unfair distribution didn't come about by accident.  </P> <P> The funding formulas have been manipulated in several ways to achieve this  unfair distribution.  </P> <P> Arbitrary limits were placed on the allocations for some of the categorical  programs so that districts that already have them get first call on the money.  As a result, money allocated for these programs goes to districts that have  previously received it and nothing is left over for any additional district  whose students also meet the criteria.  </P> <P> The formulas for determining eligibility for some categorical programs are  completely out of date. The districts that are already receiving the money have  blocked attempts to update the formulas to reflect changes in student  population. By doing this they have prevented districts with just as many needy  children from getting the funds.  </P> <P> Some of the criteria were established in a totally arbitrary way. Programs with  names that sound praiseworthy are really thinly disguised ways that districts  with politically powerful legislators can direct extra money into their own  districts.  </P> <P> Some formulas aren't based on assessment of need at all, but are instead simply  an additional percentage of the total district budget.  </P> <P> In other words, districts that are already getting more then their fair share  get even more money, while the remainder are locked into receiving a smaller  share. Many legislators are appalled at this unfairness and we have proposed a  plan to close the gap in the amount spent per student.  </P> <P> We would fund all categorical programs at their present level, but instead of  further aggravating the disparity in funding levels by adding a percentage  increase on top of these unfair formulas, we would allocate $397 million to  bring underfunded districts up toward the statewide average of spending per  child on these programs.  </P> <P> Our proposal calls for substantial increases for all school districts, large  and small. The large urban districts would still get the lion's share of our  education dollars, but for the first time we would be closer to spending equal  dollars for each pupil.  </P> <P> Isn't it time that we reject the use of political muscle to apportion the  education budget, and instead give all students equal funding? Our kids  certainly deserve it.  </P></p>

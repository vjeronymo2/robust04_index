Earlier Admiral Chistos Liberis, the chief of staff of the  Greek armed forces, announced in Athens that the four Serbian  aircraft were downed 55 miles (90 kilometers) west of Banja Luka  between 0430 GMT and 0500 GMT.    The NATO spokesman said the Serbian aircraft had ignored  orders to land relayed to them by NATO aircraft enforcing a  no-flight ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of operation Deny  Flight.    In Athens, Admiral Liberis made the announcement to  journalists who were awaiting the end of talks between Defense  Minister Gerassimos Arsenis and visiting British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd.    In Sarajevo, UN sources said a Serbian aircraft was shot  down  by NATO aircraft over the central town of Zenica early Monday  morning. The Serbian plane had taken off from Banja Luka, they  added.    A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees said the humanitarian airlift into Sarajevo and all  movements to Serb-controlled areas were being suspended.</p>

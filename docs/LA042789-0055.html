			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A grand jury returned the first two indictments in the Central Park attack on a  28-year-old woman jogger, who remained in a coma for a seventh day, officials  said. Details of the sealed indictments, including the exact charges, were not  released. The two teen-agers had been arrested on charges of first-degree rape,  second-degree attempted murder and first-degree assault. The grand jury  reviewed confessions from some of the eight youths arrested in the rape and  assault of the Wall Street investment banker, the source said. One of those  indicted confessed to police that he hit the young woman with a pipe, court  papers show. After she fell, he told police, he struck her again and another  youth stripped off her shirt, the documents said. The other indicted teen-ager  admitted fondling the woman's breasts, court documents say.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh by an </F> unidentified correspondent; place, date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondet] Dear Comrade: You just lead a  government delegation on a visit to Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia.  Could you please tell us the objective of the delegation's visit?    [Nguyen Khanh] The objective of the government delegation's  recent visit to the Syrian Arab Republic, the Arab Republic of  Egypt, and the Republic of Tunisia was to consolidate the  longstanding friendship and cooperation between our country and  these countries. It was also to thank our friends for their  past warm support for our people's struggle for national  independence and unification and in our current cause of  national construction. The visit was also aimed at obtaining  more practical results from the economic and cultural  cooperation between our country and those friendly nations than  in previous years when conditions were not as ripe.    We also called on the Palestinian state leaders at the  Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters in Tunis. We  reiterated our people's unswerving support for the Arab and  Palestinian peoples' just struggle for their basic national  rights.    [Correspondent] Dear Comrade, what were the results of the  government delegation's visit?    [Nguyen Khanh] The government delegation's visit to these  three countries brought about very fine results. The leaders of  the host countries gave us a very warm and solemn reception.  The presidents, prime ministers, and general secretaries of the  ruling parties of the host countries received our delegation.  They all maintained that the Vietnamese Government delegation's  official visit was a new indication of the solidarity and  friendship between Vietnam and their countries. They all  expressed the desire to broaden economic and cultural  cooperation with Vietnam soon to coincide with Vietnam's good  political relations with Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia.    During the visit, our government delegation signed trade  agreements with the governments of Syria, Egypt, and Tunisia,  thus creating more favorable conditions for promoting trade ties  between Vietnam and the host countries. As we see it, there are  very bright prospects for our country and the host countries to  exchange goods and enter into joint ventures to manufacture  products in which one country has an advantage. There are also  very bright prospects for our country and the host countries to  cooperate in culture, information, tourism, cadre training,  archaeology, and scientific and technological research. Each of  the host countries has famous historical relics from ancient  civilizations in addition to such world wonders as the pyramids  of ancient Egypt and the ancient city of Balmyra in Syria. We  reached agreement with our friends on exchanging visits between  business, cultural, artistic, and scientific research  delegations in the future.    Thus, our visit consolidated our friendship and cooperation  with these traditionally friendly countries and contributed to  promoting mutual understanding as well as economic, trade,  cultural, and scientific cooperation.    [Correspondent] Based on your contacts with the leaders of  the host countries, could you please tell us about their  impressions of our country and people?    [Nguyen Khanh] I think that the Syrian, Egyptian, and  Tunisian state leaders nurture profound feelings and show great  respect and love for Vietnam and its people. When they were  university students, the prime ministers and other state  officials of Syria and Egypt actively participated in the  struggle against the wars of aggression in Vietnam. They  praised Vietnam for its achievements and spoke highly of the  Dien Bien Phu victory. In their words, the Vietnamese people  deserve the respect and admiration of the whole world because we  struggled and made sacrifices not only for Vietnam, but for all  oppressed peoples. I also think the state leaders, government  officials, and people of the host countries highly value the  achievements made in Vietnam's renovation process. They are all  hopeful that Vietnam can make quick progress in every field and  become an economically and culturally developed country within  Southeast Asia.    [Correspondent] Thank you comrade.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Vaganov: "The Days of the Nuclear Device </F> in Adit 108-K Are Numbered. But First They Must `Scare Up' 1  Billion Rubles and Eight Meters of Heavy-Weight Concrete"]    [Text]  <H5>  Details </H5>   "The Russian side will provide for financing and performance  of the entire complex of work for dismantling the nuclear device  and the material part of the physics experiment FO-100-SZhR in  adit 108-k at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground according to a  schedule agreed upon by the parties." So goes the first article  of the "Agreement Between the Russian Federation Government and  the Republic of Kazakhstan Government for Dismantling the  Nuclear Device Placed at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Testing  Ground Before It Was Closed," signed in Moscow on 28 March 1994.    Effective 25 October 1990, a year's moratorium was  unilaterally introduced on nuclear testing. This step was  undertaken by the country's top leaders without serious  consultation with members of parliament and specialists. As a  result, a nuclear device with a capacity of 0.4 kilotons  (equivalent to 400 tonnes of trotyl charge) was left prepared  for underground testing in adit 108-k.    The time period of the moratorium had not even expired when  on 29 August 1991, Nursultan Nazarayev, by an order to close the  Semipalatinsk Testing Ground, ruled out the possibility of using  it further for conducting underground tests. This situation  applied fully to the physics experiment OF-100-SRZh that had  been prepared at site 108-k.    Thus this nuclear charge, small by today's standards, lay in  the adit cut in the granite monolith of Degelen at a depth of  126 meters. Incidentally, the verb "lay" does not quite fit the  real state of affairs. Without careful continuous technical  service this unintentional unique experiment--never before in  world practice has a nuclear charge remained so long, four  years, outside warehouse premises--threatened to end with an  uncontrollable nuclear explosion at any moment. With the  collapse of the USSR the situation at the Semipalatinsk test  site, which had become a constituent part of Kazakhstan's  national nuclear center, evoked constantly growing alarm. Last  winter, as a result of a series of accidents in municipal  utility networks, the system for maintaining the normal vital  activity of the city of Kurchatov--the capital of the test site,  as they called it--was put almost completely out of commission.  Consideration was also given to the question of emergency  evacuation from it of the Russian military unit that served,  among other things, the nuclear charge in adit 108-k (see  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 24 November 1993). (Before that 27,000  people had already left the city, mainly military and civilian  specialists providing support for nuclear research.)    Work on the present agreement began in the autumn of 1992.  But in reality up until the last moment it was not completely  certain that it would be signed during President Nazarbayev's  official visit to Russia. The fact is that at the end of January  1994 Kazakhstan made a proposal to include in the text an  additional article making it incumbent on the Russian side to do  "special work to clean up after the activity related to the  nuclear device." The Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic  Energy would not agree to this proposal and was able to convince  the Kazakh side to withdraw it.    Be that as it may, by the end of 1994 the nuclear charge was  to have been dismantled and removed from the adit, and all the  material part of the experiment was to have been moved unimpeded  to the Russian Federal Nuclear Center (All-Russian Scientific  Research Institute of Technical Physics--VNIITF) in  Chelyabinsk-70. Specialists of the VNIITF in conjunction with  the All-Russian Scientific Research and Planning Institute of  Industrial Technology carried out the project entitled "Opening  and Eliminating Object 108-k."    It is possible to judge the seriousness of the task facing  them if only from the fact that as of the first half of 1993 the  estimated cost of the work was R650 million. In the opinion of  certain of the experts at the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the  Russian Federation, the real cost would exceed a billion.  Incidentally, there is nothing surprising here: After all, adit  108-k is essentially an extremely complex engineering and  technical structure. It is 592 meters long. The nuclear device  is housed in the so-called end box (KB). The protective  shock-absorbing complex, which is actually supposed to guarantee  maximum safety when conducting the nuclear explosion, consists  of several load-bearing elements: the first section--a concrete  ring 49 meters long, and 19.5 meters--from especially  heavy-weight concrete with a metal filler; the protective  sealing element seven meters in length made of concrete, and  several other sealing elements.    The project envisions opening the adit and drilling a  bypass.  This working should provide access to the end box from the rear  side through an eight-meter concrete wall. The opening of  concrete protective elements and drilling the bypass were to  have been done by the blast-hole drilling method. The concrete  wall in the immediate area of the end box was to have been  opened with mechanical picks. The overall volume of mining work  will amount to about 1,233 cubic meters, and the volume of work  for dismantling cable lines and metal elements--about 114 tonnes.    The agreement also envisions a scenario if for one reason or  another it is impossible to extract the nuclear device. In this  case it is to be destroyed right in the end part of adit 108-k  with an applied charge of chemical explosive that will  completely preclude the release of nuclear energy.    On 12 April of this year the deputy prime minister of the  Russian Government, Oleg Soskovets, signed an order to the  Ministry of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation, the  Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the  Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of  Internal Affairs, and the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear  and Radiation Safety: "Request that you take measures to  implement the agreement."  <H5>  From NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Files </H5>   Since 1961 at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground 348  underground nuclear explosions have been conducted, of which  five were under the program for working on the application of  nuclear explosive technologies for industrial purposes.  Underground explosions were conducted with nuclear explosive  devices placed in both horizontal (215 explosions) and vertical  (133 explosions) workings.</p>

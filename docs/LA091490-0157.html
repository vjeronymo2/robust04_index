			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> LOW-VOLTAGE OUTING FOR NEW KIDS;  </P> <P> CONCERT: THE POP PHENOMENON FAILS TO HARNESS THE ENERGY OF AN ADORING SOLD-OUT  AUDIENCE.  </P> <P> New Kids on the Block operated like a true American industry on Wednesday at  the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa: The kid-pop phenomenon from Boston made  plenty of money, but it wasted a great deal of energy.  </P> <P> A considerable resource was on hand waiting to be harnessed -- a sold-out house  of nearly 19,000 fans, the vast majority of them deeply infatuated girls just  tingling with potential energy.  </P> <P> New Kids, the object of one of the most pervasive outbreaks of puppy love in  pop history, didn't have the foggiest notion how to focus that abundance of  adoration and make it explode. Oh, the girls screamed like little Beatlemaniacs  the whole time. But this was a crowd primed to scream at almost anything --  even the stagehands' pre-show adjustments to a tarpaulin covering the set  caused an uproar.  </P> <P> Instead of concentrating and multiplying their fans' hysteria, the five New  Kids (who headline Dodger Stadium tonight) gradually drained it during a  plodding, two-hour show that wasted considerable time on disorganized patter  and antics. Maybe the group's members, who range in age from 17 to 21, figured  that a tightly-organized, quick-paced performance would confirm that they are  just pale markings on their producer Maurice Starr's blueprint for a white  Jackson 5. So they decided the way to establish some personality of their own  was to hang loose, investing the show with a playground feeling that involved  lots of yakking and hollering, not to mention interminable stretching of songs.  </P> <P> But pacing and high energy were New Kids' only hope. With its repertoire of  Starr-written sweet-nothings that skim the surface of teen romance, this bunch  certainly wasn't going to climb any expressive peaks on the strength of its  material.  </P> <P> The chief slacker was stubble-faced Donnie Wahlberg, who spent considerable  time carving out an oh-so-calculated, bad-boy persona. He quickly went  overboard and managed to make himself truly obnoxious. At one point, Wahlberg  picked up a stuffed toy tossed his way as a gift offering and heaved it back  into the audience with this peeved admonition: "You oughta stop throwing  things." Maybe the fans and their parents ought to stop throwing away money on  New Kids paraphernalia bearing this lout's likeness.  </P> <P> The New Kids launched most of their best ammunition at the start, with  fire-pots flashing, lasers glowing and all five members engaging in some  energetic hoofing. But after a brisk opening 15 minutes or so, the time-killing  began with a long, laborious introduction of the group's five-piece backing  band. After that came an extended series of solo and duo turns by all the New  Kids except oldest member Jonathan Knight, a serious candidate for the Andrew  Ridgeley Award for superfluous presence in a pop act.  </P> <P> If there's any real promise cocooned in New Kids, it lies with Jordan Knight,  the 20-year-old singer who carried most of the show's musical load. Knight, the  handsomest and by far the most talented New Kid, turned in a solid performance  that showcased a generally assured falsetto, some limber dance moves and an  appealing, earnest personality. Nobody else in the group came close to cutting  it vocally. Danny Wood's grating, off-key singing was about as bad as it gets  on a major stage.  </P> <P> Judging from this show, accusations of lip-syncing leveled against the New Kids  have been exaggerated -- or perhaps those accusations have caused the group to  become more honest. As the abundant flaws made clear, this singing was live,  except for some incidental (though still unacceptable) use of taped backing  vocals during the more fevered dance numbers.  </P> <P> Before anyone starts congratulating New Kids for their probity, it should be  noted that the show was preceded by a video-screened McDonald's commercial,  courtesy of the New Kids' tour sponsor. Remember just a few years back when the  mere appearance of a corporate logo on a banner was considered a sell-out? If  music fans don't express a distaste for commercials at concerts, we're sure to  see them all the time.  </P></p>

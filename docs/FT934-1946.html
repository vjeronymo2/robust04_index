			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Much scope for UK in Delors proposals Sir, The government's initial response to the Delors white paper on the economic regeneration of Europe is disappointing. In its proposals for infrastructure investment ('Paper calls for big new investments in 'info-highways' and infrastructure', December 8) the white paper offers the potential for a prosperous future based on a competitive European economy. The white paper contains plans for the development of a common European information area, a concept that was set out at the Copenhagen summit in June. The plans represent a much-needed response to the US proposal to create a national information infrastructure and the Japanese intention to build a telecommunications network that will enable them to make the most effective use of information in the next century. What makes the government's response so disappointing is the fact that Britain would benefit more than most European countries from the investment. Not only does Britain have some of the strongest telecommunications companies, it also accounts for the largest part of the information services sector in Europe. In the 19th century, Britain had the vision to invest in the development of a railway network. It is ironic that, at the end of the 20th century, short-term preoccupations are preventing the government from responding to a similar need for investment in the information infrastructure.

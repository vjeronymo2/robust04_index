			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Arresting Right-Wing Lawbreakers Urged--The Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 2 February says in a page-8 editorial that  "law- abiding citizens cannot be blamed if they gain the  impression that right-wing extremists are getting away with  proverbial murder simply because they threaten violence and  civil war. The storming of the World Trade Center last year was  an obvious example of how no action was originally taken against  the right wing." "A warrant was issued almost 2 months ago for  the arrest of Willem Ratte, fugitive leader of the right wingers  who occupied Fort Schanskop in Pretoria. Since then he has  appeared at several right-wing rallies." "It would appear that  the police are unwilling to take him in, perhaps also for fear  of violence. This failure to act against the right wing is in  sharp contrast with the early morning raid last year on the  homes and offices of more than 70 senior Pan-Africanist Congress  members. At that time the authorities did not hesitate to act,  even at the risk of derailing the negotiation process." "We are  not advocating intensified action against the right simply to  try to create the impression that equally firm action is taken  against both right and left, but when people, regardless of  color or political conviction, break the law, they must be  arrested and punished according to the law."    Police Must Earn Public Respect -- A second editorial on  page  8 says that "it is with increasing concern that we note  admissions by policemen in the Rand Supreme Court that they lied  during the police investigation into the shooting incident last  year between bodyguards of the ANC's Mr. Walter Sisulu and the  police." "It is beyond comprehension that policemen, who ought  to know better, can place the whole police force under suspicion  by such lies. As it is, the police are already going through a  credibility crisis, which could increase as 27 April draws  nearer. We do believe, however, that the majority of police  strive honestly to live up to their motto, we protect and we  serve. It is for their sake that we plead with all policemen:  Always act in word and deed in a manner which will earn the  respect of the public."    Intimidation Casts Shadow Over Democracy -- The Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 3 February in a page-8 editorial regrets  that "it is a pity that the National Party [NP] could not  present a `normal' election list because, according to President  F. W. de Klerk, intimidation in black areas prevented this. As  a result a shadow is cast over the deployment of democracy. If  potential candidates are intimidated in such a manner, one can  only imagine how much pressure there is on ordinary supporters.  Mr. Nelson Mandela's repeated plea that the election campaign  should be free and fair has apparently not reached the black  communities, or is being ignored. Nevertheless, now that the NP  has an election team, it must begin to use them visibly.  Campaigning must not be done only by a handful of white party  leaders. Black and colored people as well as Indians must  become part of the voter recruiting effort. That is the best way  of making a really new NP known."    Success for Joint East Rand Plan Urged -- A second editorial  on the same page of the 3 February BEELD states that "the joint  rescue plan for the black townships on the East Rand is of vital  importance, not only for the tattered communities at whom it is  aimed, but in a sense for the whole country. The East Rand plan  is the first one drawn up after consultation with all political  role players, the local community, and the security forces. For  this reason it has a better chance of success that previous  plans, even though success is not guaranteed. The black  community on the East Rand is not the only one where the social  fabric has been reduced to the point of total anarchy. Similar  situations exist in parts of Natal and the Western Cape .... so  what is being done now on the East Rand will have to be  duplicated in several other areas. This East Rand rescue plan  will, therefore, provide an early indication of whether the  country has a chance of success in the massive task of  stabilization and upliftment which must be tackled after the  April election. If it succeeds, chances are good that the same  success will be repeated elsewhere too. Failure will be a  forecast of misery for virtually the whole country."</p>

Liang  Lifeng, on behalf of the Guangdong Committee of the China  Democratic League, made a speech at the meeting pointing out  that although Guangdong had made great achievements in  agricultural reform, it had not fundamentally changed  instability in agriculture's position, instability in  agricultural production, and instability in the peasants' minds.    A sharp decrease in farmlands and a rapid increase in the  population are Guangdong's important characteristics upon  entering the 1990's. In 1992, the net decrease in the  province's farmlands amounted to 1.1423 million mu, equivalent  to the area of a medium-sized county; whereas in the first three  years of the 1990's, the population increased by 1.6667 million  annually, equivalent to the populations of two medium-sized  counties. In 1992, the province's per capita possession of  farmland was 0.56 mu, 74 percent of the amount in the previous  10 years. Facing this grim situation, a provincial meeting on  protecting farmlands held at the end of last year clarified that  farmland in the province should be increased instead of being  reduced. On this point, Liang Lifeng suggested formulating a  policy to actively support and encourage the work of restoring  and expanding farmland, adding that certain percentages of the  taxes and charges collected by land management departments from  renting out and transferring farmland should be used for  restoring and expanding farmland.    Last year's decrease in Guangdong's grain production was the  third decrease, subsequent to 1991 and 1992. It was also the  second major decrease since the founding of the PRC (the first  happened in 1985). It is true that to a certain degree, natural  disasters caused this major decrease, but a more important  factor was the reduction in the acreage of farmland. An  authoritative person said that Guangdong should have at least 50  million mu of land planted to grain, but last year Guangdong's  grain acreage had fallen below the critical line, to stand at 48  million mu. The cost of growing grain is high, 50 kg for 47  yuan; but the selling price is low, 50 kg for 42 to 55 yuan. So  the peasants are far from being able to get average profits from  social production. "Low grain prices have hurt the peasants"  and have caused their initiative in grain production to drop.  Liang Lifeng appealed by saying: First, investment in  agriculture, which is a "weak industry," should be increased.  Last year, Guangdong's agricultural investment accounted for  only 7.27 percent of its financial expenditure, a decrease of  5.81 percent in comparison with 1980. The percentage of  agricultural investment in financial expenditure should be  raised to 10 to 12 percent. Second, grain protection prices  should be raised; the grain protection price of 50 kg for 70  yuan, which has been fixed by the provincial government, should  be observed. Third, agricultural loans should be ensured so  that they are used for grain and other agricultural production.  Fourth, it is necessary to develop economies of scale.</p>

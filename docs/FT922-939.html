			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Southern Business shows 10% advance to Pounds 7.11m SOUTHERN Business Group, the photocopier and vending machine supplier which has had its share price overshadowed until recently by criticism of its copy agreements and accounting practices, has announced a 10 per cent increase in interim profits. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 6.47m to Pounds 7.11m in the six months to March 31 helped by recent acquisitions. Mr David McErlain, chairman, said an aggressive marketing programme launched a year ago led to a small increase in copy volumes. Turnover was 10 per cent higher at Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 24.9m), reflecting organic growth, the impact of acquisi-tions and some price increases. Mr McErlain said the group continued to consider opportunities for further acquisitions complementary to its activities which offered a good potential return on the initial investment. Forward contracted income, revenue the company stands to receive from outstanding contracts, increased by 2.3 per cent to Pounds 305m. Net borrowings were stable at Pounds 2.8m with gearing at 5 per cent. Earnings per share were 8.8 per cent ahead at 4.93p (4.53p) and the interim dividend is raised by 11.7 per cent to 1.15p (1.03p). The company has recently renewed a five-year agree-ment with Canon, which accounts for about 85 per cent of the photocopier machines Southern Business supplies. The shares closed unchanged at 110p.</p>

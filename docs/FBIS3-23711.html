			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Malyutin: "Ministry of Communications </F> Tightens Control Over Development of Cellular Networks"]    [Text] On the evening of 2 February an expert commission of  the Russian Ministry of Communications ceremonially announced  the results of the competition for the best plans for the  organization of cellular mobile communications networks on  Russia's territory. Minister of Communications Vladimir Bulgak  spoke at the ceremonies and announced a number of innovations in  the ministry's policies, including the toughening of  requirements for the operating companies that have received, as  a result of the competition, the right to acquire licenses to  provide cellular communications services under standards GSM and  NMT-450N in a number of Russia's regions.    According to Leonid Varakin, the expert commission's  chairman  and director of the Central Research Institute of  Communications, in selecting winners consideration was given, in  part, to the completeness of plans and the possibility of their  implementation, as well as to the "amount of the uncompensated  contribution." In regions where only a single applicant  submitted a proposal, it was decided not to determine a winner  in order not to violate the principle of competition, despite  the fact that the organization of cellular communications  networks in those regions is put off at least until the next  bidding.    As Aleksandr Krupnov, first deputy minister of  communications, reported, the losers will get their  contributions back. The winners, on the other hand, still have  to apply for licenses and pay for them within three months.  According to Mr. Krupnov, the amount will be approximately $3.00  per inhabitant of a region. It is planned to spend the money  thus collected to prepare regions' infrastructures for the  development of cellular networks.    Companies that won the competition must start offering  cellular communications services before 2 February 1995.  Otherwise, according to Mr. Bulgak, the operators will lose  their license. Another example of the tightened controls over  the development of cellular communications networks in Russia  that the minister of communications announced will be the  establishment of two regulating committees (one per standard).  Their job, in part, will be to ensure the linkage between  different regions' networks.    Among the potential consequences of the competition that has  just concluded, many specialists mention, first and foremost, a  sharp intensification of competition among the producers of  cellular communications equipment.

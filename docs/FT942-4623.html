			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Carbide challenges EU plastic decision Union Carbide, the US chemicals company, has challenged yesterday's go-ahead from the European Commission for a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) plastics joint venture between the Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch/Shell and Italy's Montedison. The two European companies had made last minute concessions on their control of polypropylene manufacturing technologies to overcome accusations they would breach EU competition law. But Union Carbide said it was considering an appeal to the European Court of Justice. 'We do not share the European Commission's view that the changes to the proposed venture eliminate anti-trust concern,' said the company. The joint operation, known as Montell, will have a market share estimated by Shell at 18-19 per cent, making it easily the world's biggest polypropylene manufacturer. Polypropylene is a tough plastic widely used by the car industry for items including bumpers and battery casings. The Commission approved the deal on condition that Montedison kept control of its proprietary method for the polypropylene manufacture, Spheripol. Shell Oil, the US arm of Royal Dutch/Shell, already has control over another manufacturing technology, Unipol, through a separate venture with Union Carbide. The concessions put forward ensured Montell would not contravene EU competition rules, said the Commission. The main undertaking offered by the two parties is a commitment to keep separate two rival technologies for polypropylene production. Montedison will keep Spheripol separate from the joint venture in a distinct, new enterprise called Technipol. Normal competition rules will apply to any commercial discussions held between Montell and Technipol, said the commission. Montedison agreed to divest itself of a joint venture it has with Petrofina, the Belgian petrochemicals company which had also objected to the creation of Montell. The Montell venture is partly intended as a way of ridding Montedison of Dollars 2.2bn of its debt. It is understood that the amendments to the deal demanded by Brussels will not have a significant impact on this process. Montedison's continued control over its sought-after polypropylene technology could benefit the group, which will continue to license the technology to Montell's competitors.</p>

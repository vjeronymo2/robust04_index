			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANIMAL CONTROL DEPT. GETS NEW DIRECTOR  </P> <P> The director of the Orlando Humane Society in Florida, who has a reputation for  turning around troubled operations, has been tentatively hired to head Los  Angeles County's beleaguered Department of Animal Care and Control.  </P> <P> Frank R. Andrews, 57, will succeed Brian Berger, who resigned in May after the  Board of Supervisors voted to remove him in the wake of allegations of  mismanagement and reports of missing animals.  </P> <P> Board chairman Ed Edelman said Andrews "has a history of taking departments  that have had difficulties and turning them around. . . . He will be able to  bring to Animal Control some needed management skills and relate to the outside  groups that are concerned about care of animals."  </P> <P> Andrews previously served as director of the Michigan Humane Society, where he  oversaw animal control services in the Detroit area. He is a former city  councilman from Galion, a small city outside Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> Andrews will take over the $75,000-a-year job Aug. 7, after expected  supervisors' approval Wednesday. The department operates six animal shelters  that handle about 95,000 animals a year.  </P></p>

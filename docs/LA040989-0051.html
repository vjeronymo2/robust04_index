			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLIONS AT STAKE IN SUIT CHALLENGING HOW PROP. 13 ALLOCATES PROPERTY TAXES  </P> <P> Several Southeast cities could gain millions of dollars more a year in tax  revenues if a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the property tax  allocation system under Proposition 13 is successful.  </P> <P> Lakewood, for example, could get as much as $3 million more a year and Compton  $1.4 million, depending on how the courts rule on the suit being pressed by  Compton and four other small Los Angeles County cities. They are arguing that  their residents pay more property taxes than their city governments get back  under the tax distribution system created to implement Proposition 13.  </P> <P> "It violates the principle that the people that pay the tax ought to get the  benefit from it," said John Sturgeon, attorney for the five cities.  </P> <P> But Long Beach would lose about $7 million a year in property tax revenues if a  court rules in favor of the small cities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Join in Challenge  </P> <P> Carson, El Segundo, Rancho Cucamonga and Temple City have joined Compton in  challenging the allocation formula, which favors cities that had high tax rates  before Proposition 13, the statewide tax revolt referendum approved by  California voters in 1978.  </P> <P> "This lawsuit is not about Proposition 13," said Rodney Smith, economic  consultant for the petitioners. "It is (about) the way the legislation was  written that allocated the property taxes."  </P> <P> Of 85 cities in Los Angeles County, Smith said, "there are only a few that are  benefiting (under the allocation system). Most are losing and the reason is  that (prior to) Proposition 13, the tax rates levied by the cities were very  skewed. There were a handful of high tax rate cities (but) most were relatively  low."  </P> <P> Proposition 13 limited taxes to 1% of assessed valuation and restricted  increases in the assessments to 2% annually, meaning the tax rate is the same  for taxpayers regardless of the city. On the distribution side, however, the  revenues are given back to the cities according to what their tax rates were  prior to Proposition 13, meaning cities that had high rates now receive get  back the biggest share of the tax dollar.  </P> <P> For example, Compton residents, who enjoyed a lower-than-average tax rate  before Proposition 13, paid property taxes totaling $14.9 million in 1986-87  but their city government got back only $1.58 million.  </P> <P> That is about 14 cents on the tax dollar, according to data Smith supplied for  the petitioners. By comparison, Smith says, the city of Los Angeles, which had  a high tax rate before Proposition 13, got back about 36 cents on the tax  dollar.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Cities Harder Hit  </P> <P> Some cities are even harder hit in terms of the property tax dollar. Temple  City, for instance, does not get a single tax dollar back even though its  residents paid $7.5 million in property taxes in 1986-87. The city did not have  a property tax before Proposition 13.  </P> <P> "We were excluded forever" from receiving benefits, Temple City Manager Karl  Koski said of his community, which has never levied a property tax.  </P> <P> About 33 cities in the county did not have a property tax or were not yet  incorporated when Proposition 13 was passed, says Sam Olivito, executive  director of the California Contract Cities Assn., which is supporting the suit.  </P> <P> The suit was filed in the state Supreme Court a month ago but the court  declined without comment to hear the case. Last week, however, attorneys for  the petitioners were filing suit in San Bernardino Superior Court. That county  was chosen, he said, because Rancho Cucamonga is located there and is one of  the biggest losers under the allocation system.  </P> <P> The suit was originally filed with the state's highest court because the issue  is constitutional and the decision could affect cities statewide, Sturgeon  said. He had urged the court to act quickly because cities have to begin  planning their 1989-90 budgets soon.  </P> <P> Temple City Councilman Ken Gillanders, who initiated the research leading to  the suit, was not perturbed by the action by the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "It'll just take a little longer to resolve, but the constitutional issues are  the same," he said. "It will ultimately find its way to the Supreme Court."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 270 Cities Would Benefit  </P> <P> If the suit is successful and the allocation formula is changed, 270 cities  statewide would benefit, said Olivito of the Contract Cities Assn. The group,  which has written to the court in support of the action, represents 65  California cities, 46 of them in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The suit asks the court to order Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties to  correct the alleged inequities. The counties were named as respondents in the  suit because they collect residents' property taxes and distribute them to  cities.  </P> <P> The suit suggests that a fairer distribution system would rely on the total  value of properties in a city to determine what proportion of the tax-revenue  pie it should receive.  </P> <P> Temple City would have gained about $1.46 million in revenues in fiscal 1986-87  under the proposed system.  </P> <P> The biggest winner among the petitioners would be El Segundo, which would have  received $7 million more that year. The city had a property tax of 0.15% in  1987.  </P> <P> As with Long Beach, six cities in the San Gabriel Valley, including Pomona and  Pasadena, would lose hundreds of thousands of dollars each year if the court  orders the allocation formula changed. The city of Los Angeles would lose  almost $117 million.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that the current revenue allocation system violates a  provision in the state Constitution requiring that taxpayers directly benefit  from the taxes they are paying.  </P> <P> Cities with high pre-Proposition 13 tax rates receive more than their fair  share of revenues, violating another constitutional provision mandating uniform  taxation, the suit says.  </P> <P> Los Angeles, which had the county's highest property tax, 2.76%, in 1978, is  cited as profiting the most from the current system. The city received at least  $117 million more in property tax revenues than its residents paid in the  1986-87 fiscal year, said Smith, the consultant for the petitioners.  </P> <P> Los Angeles would bear 95% of the losses under the proposal, Smith said.  </P> <P> Smith stressed that county tax revenues are in a separate pool from the cities'  revenues and would not be affected by the outcome.  </P> <P> Olivito said the petitioning cities have long felt that "something just wasn't  right" and have repeatedly approached the state Legislature about the problem.  </P> <P> "We've been trying to find a solution for the last 10 years, and we haven't  received a dollar," he said. "The issue just kept snowballing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALLOCATIONS OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE  </P> <P> A suit filed by five Southern California cities attacks- the way that property  tax revenue is allocated to cities. Their suit challenges the constitutionality  of the distribution system that was enacted to implement Proposition 13. If  successful, the suit could shift millions of dollars among city coffers  statewide. The following is a breakdown of the tax revenue received by cities  in the Southeast/Long Beach area under the existing system and the distribution  under the proposed reforms.  </P> <TABLE

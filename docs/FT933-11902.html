			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Telefonos de Mexico rises 12.9% TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's telephone monopoly, recorded a strong 12.9 per cent increase in profits in real terms for the second quarter after a pick-up in long-distance and local telephone traffic. The group earned second-quarter net profits of 2.089bn pesos (Dollars 674m), compared to 1.851bn pesos in the second quarter last year. It posted revenues of 5.973bn pesos, an 8.6 per cent increase in real terms. 'The figures are encouraging. Given weak economic growth, the increase in national long distance volumes and general increase in revenues was impressive,' said Mr Neil Perry, head of research at Baring Research in Mexico City. Telmex's local call revenues grew by 17.8 per cent, compared with 11.2 per cent in the first quarter. National long-distance revenues increased by 4.7 per cent, and international long-distance revenues were up by 2.8 per cent. The better-than-expected revenues offset a slight decline in operating margins, caused by wage increases in April and rises in maintenance costs. Telmex suffered exchange losses of 110m pesos in the second quarter, more than double losses in the first quarter, mainly because of continued weakness of the peso against the yen. Telmex installed 184,000 lines in the second quarter, bringing total lines in service to 7.08m, 11.5 per cent more than the second quarter last year. Its cellular subsidiary nearly doubled its subscribers to 191,304.</p>

The U.S. side is just not making enough  marketing effort," the source said.    Last week, the U.S. and Japan failed to reach agreement on  liberalizing the Japanese insurance market, one of the three  priority areas under negotiation in bilateral framework trade  talks.    U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that to  address the trade issue, policy recommendations will be drawn up  by the end of the week which could include revival of the  punitive Super 301 trade measure.    The source indicated the Japanese Government has few new  measures up its sleeve to respond to the retaliatory measures  the U.S. may take.    "We are already doing everything we can to reduce Japan's  trade surplus," he said.</p>

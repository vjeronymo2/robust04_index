			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRULY WEIRD OR JUST PRETENDING?;  </P> <P> THE HISTORY OF LUMINOUS MOTION BY SCOTT BRADFIELD (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $17.95; 273  PP.; 0-394-57875-9)  </P> <P> One of my favorite episodes of the "Mary Tyler Moore Show" involved Mary and  Rhoda attending a party given by friends of a younger man Mary was dating. The  generation gap widened perceptibly when one of the young folks decribed his  idea of a good time as going downtown, acting weird, and hoping someone would  notice.  </P> <P> This first novel by a San Francisco native who currently teaches at the  University of Connecticut at Storrs betrays a similar desperation for attention  at any price. Every page, every sentence, proclaims, "Hey, look at me, I'm  mind-boggling, shocking, totally outrageous." The writer's stance places the  reviewer in a neat predicament: Do I denounce this novel as the latest  manifestation of a decadent society -- and risk taking my place with the  hapless philistines of yesteryear who trounced innovative artists from  Baudelaire to Burroughs? Or, do I rush to pay tribute to this book as the  product of an extraordinarily original mind -- and risk taking it at the  author's estimation instead of at my own? Or, might it really not be best to do  what experienced New Yorkers do when a lunatic acts up on a the subway: Ignore  it -- and risk letting it go its way uncriticized?  </P> <P> "The History of Luminous Motion" sets out at once to shock the reader with its  craziness and violence while short-circuiting any objections by contradicting  its own premises. It is narrated in the first person by a brilliant, weird,  psychopathic 8-year-old named Phillip who writes like a brilliant, weird,  psychopathic 18-year-old. Phillip takes a pretty good line for a teen-ager, but  only by putting his words into the mouth of a little boy can the author be sure  that they are truly astonishing. The only problem is, Phillip doesn't sound  like a little boy, not even the little superboy he's supposed to be. He sounds  like a very big boy who's taken one too many creative-writing classes.  </P> <P> We first meet little Phillip traveling in the back seat of his Mom's car: "No  matter where we went we seemed to be where we had been before. We were more  than a family, Mom and I. We were a quality of landscape. We were the map's  name rather than some encoded or strategic position on it. We were like an MX  missile, always moving but always exactly where we were supposed to be. There  were many times when I thought of Mom and me as a sort of weapon."  </P> <P> Mom, for her part, says things like, "Culture's just a scheme of rules and  regulations we've all quite happily agreed to. It's not all cliches, baby . . .  Culture's got our best interests at heart. Culture's just the walls of a house.  It's that house I always told you we lived in, only I didn't realize the house  was culture before."  </P> <P> After years of driving from town to town, picking up strange men, Mom finds a  man named Pedro to provide her and Phillip with a real home. Phillip has a hard  time adjusting to "normal" life. He seems, at first, jealous of Pedro, but then  seems to like Pedro. He decides to kill Pedro, who, in return, makes posthumous  appearances advising Phillip on how to kill his real father, who, shortly after  Pedro's demise, conveniently returns to the picture. As Mom retreats into  alcoholism, Dad shows up to look after the family. He's a good provider,  showering the boy with presents and sound advice. Mom, still strung out and  withdrawn, becomes pregnant. Phillip moves toward patricide even though --  perhaps because -- he likes Dad: "I was going to return Dad to that world where  he truly belonged, that fundamental world of basic particles which breathed  underneath our realer world of mere events."  </P> <P> Phillip has lots of portentous ideas about mass, energy, matter and reality,  and what goes on in your head, and stuff like that. He makes a pair of friends:  Rodney, a premature juvenile delinquent, and Beatrice, an infantile  Marxist-feminist (although of course she, like the boys, is finally too clever  to fit into any mere category) -- and they sit around drinking, smoking,  sniffing glue, investigating Satanism and concocting poisons for Phillip's  father.  </P> <P> No, this is not a socially aware novel about victimized children from broken  homes who are corrupted by evil influences. As the narrative makes clear, the  evil is far more radical. We are invited to view it in several ways: as a  manifestation of mass, energy, motion, time-space, et al.; or as a special  condition of this particular boy's mentality; or as the intersection of mind  and matter. The reader may well find himself wondering whether the "brilliant"  metaphysical ruminations are supposed to make Phillip's crimes more interesting  or whether the crimes are supposed to add excitement to the ruminations.  </P> <P> In the end, our narrator "grows up": becomes "normal" -- or so he says. If  we've learned anything by now, we've learned not to trust him. He is returned  to the bosom of his family. Dad is recovering from the wounds Phillip inflicted  on him, Mom has given birth to the baby she was expecting, but Phillip seems to  believe that this is a new, foster family.  </P> <P> To give credit where due, the writing is skillful, the concept genuinely  offbeat. But does it pass the acid test of being a book one regrets having to  put down and looks forward to picking up? No. It could be argued that no  genuinely new or original work would be appreciated, judged by such a standard;  that no work dealing with repellent subject matter would pass such a "taste"  test. But, far from being original, this novel is another latecomer in the  tedious line of bad- seed stories, most recently exploited by Knopf editor  Gordon Lish in his novel about murder in the sandbox. Whether the subject  matter is phony or genuine is hard to say. It strikes me as phony, but I don't  think it finally matters very much whether this novel is echt pathology or only  a cunning forgery.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] -- The State Duma has  adopted a statement on a memorandum:  <H3>  STATEMENT of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the  Russian Federation Regarding the Adoption of the Memorandum on  Accord and Decisions on the Amnesty </H3>   On 23 February 1994, after discussing the legislative  initiative of the Russian Federation president on the  declaration of amnesty in connection with the adoption of the  Russian Federation Constitution, the State Duma adopted a  package of documents which are inseparably linked among  themselves: "The Memorandum on accord;" the decision "On the  declaration of amnesty in connection with the adoption of the  Constitution of the Russian Federation;" "On the procedure for  implementing the decision `On the declaration of amnesty in  connection with the adoption of the Constitution of the Russian  Federation;'" "On the declaration of political and economic  amnesty;" and on recognition of the the decision of the State  Duma "On confirmation of the membership of the commission to  investigate the events from 21 September to 4 October 1993" of  16 February 1994, which is no longer valid.    The adoption of these decisions has been dictated by the  firm  conviction that it is impossible to extricate Russia from the  nationwide crisis without an amnesty for all those who  participated in the well known events of 1991 and 1993, and it  is impossible without stable civil peace. During discussion of  the issue and through the joint efforts of the absolute majority  of the State Duma deputies, a formula has been found for social  reconciliation and for achieving nationwide accord. The basis  of the formula is formed by a striving for constructive  cooperation with the president of the Russian Federation, with  the Government of the Russian Federation, and with all power  structures and political forces, for the sake of consolidating  society, and toward an understanding of the great responsibility  for the revival of Russian statehood, and for the construction  of a new Russia.    The Council of the State Duma Council believes that the  decisions on amnesty offers thousands of Russians who have  regained their freedom the chance to become actively involved in  the creative work of all constructive social forces for the  benefit of the Fatherland. However, if any of them lacks the  common sense, the heart, or desire to take the road of accord,  the State Duma, in conformity with the spirit and letter of the  decisions adopted, will find an opportunity, jointly with the  president of the Russian Federation, to take measures which do  not allow the situation within society to be destabilized. The  State Duma is prepared to examine constructive proposals for a  mechanism to implement the resolutions stated, and also to  examine a draft memorandum, agreed with other bodies of state  power, on the responsibility of state institutions and  politicians to preserve civil peace and public order in Russia.    [Dated] Moscow, 28 February 1994</p>

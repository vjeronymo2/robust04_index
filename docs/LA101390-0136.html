			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGING DIO'S PRAISES  </P> <P> I vehemently must attack Jim Washburn's criticism of the Dio concert (Calendar,  Sept. 26).  </P> <P> Washburn's negative, anti-heavy metal mind-set makes me wonder what criterion  The Times uses to hire hard-rock music reviewers.  </P> <P> Dio's singing has never been better. He was commanding, elegant, captivating,  (with) a stage presence unequaled by any performance I have seen anywhere (from  Bolshoi ballet to Bowie). His diction was sharp as he sang songs that embraced  love, betrayal or the ambiguous undercurrents of a mystical world.  </P> <P> Dio has assembled talented musicians and stage designers to produce a stellar  show molded around the general theme of his albums complete with a simple but  sinister set, a fusillade of colored lights and, of course, a few clots of  gelignite-type flashes. It was fun to see Jens Johansson play Bach on a  keyboard suspended by cables that shot out smoke and an explosion as it was  hauled up and away.  </P> <P> A great show. Great entertainment. Heavy metal will change and continue to  slide surreptitiously into our society, movies, TV commercials. And I think it  is time for critics to search out the better bands, read the lyrics and brave  those clangorous chords, those whorls of cataclysmic angular sounds. Hold tight  and educate yourselves. Listen to Dio, Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Metallica,  Queensryche, Def Leppard and such.  </P> <P> There is more beer and violence at a baseball game.  </P> <P> KENT METHMANN  </P> <P> Carpinteria  </P></p>

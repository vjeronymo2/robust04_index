			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Letter: Observance is of the essence Sir, You reported that, in order to enhance subsidiarity, the European Commission wants to 'devolve much responsibility for implementing EC law to member states' ('Brussels drafts plan to end EC power struggle', October 13). That might be popular among some of them but would be an idiotic policy. In the post-1992 internal market, universal confidence that everyone is fully observing the common rules will be of the essence. Self-policing won't achieve it - on the contrary. Although snooping can never be popular for those being snooped on (perhaps that is why Brussels is anxious to divest itself of that duty), increased, vigorous and efficient activity by the Commission's independent inspectors, backed by the Court of Justice as required, is likely alone to provide the roots of mutual trust. Otherwise, as Juvenal once put it, quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Adam Fergusson, 15 Warwick Gardens, London W14 8PH</p>

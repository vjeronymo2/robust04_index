			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING WOES ARE JUST PLAIN GARBAGE  </P> <P> How could you print such a negative article when we are all doing our best to  make recycling a success?  </P> <P> I cannot believe recycling can be the chore Kennedy purports it to be.  </P> <P> She and her nine housemates are all obviously young men and women since most of  them are students. They, of all people, should be ready, willing and able to do  their part in making our world a better place to live.  </P> <P> If we senior citizens can make the effort and take the time to recycle our  papers, glass and plastic, surely the younger generation can do the same. I  rest my case.  </P> <P> GENEVA WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

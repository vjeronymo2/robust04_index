			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Harald Bruning in Macao] </F>   [Text] Portugal's new "state secret law", approved by the  parliament in Lisbon in February, was gazetted in Macao  yesterday. Macao's Governor, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, was  reported to have insisted that the Portuguese law be enforced in  Macao.    According to the law, "documents and pieces of information  whose knowledge by non-authorised persons is susceptible to  putting at risk or causing harm to the national independence,  unity and integrity of the (Portuguese) State and its internal  and external security" fall under the state secret category.    For the first time in Portugal's legal history, the Macao  Governor as well as the head of state, parliamentary Speaker and  Prime Minister, has the power to classify on his own initiative  certain documents and information as state secrets.    Civil servants and military personnel in Portugal and Macao  contravening the state secret law face criminal and disciplinary  proceedings.    The law states that the "protection of classified documents"  was directed against "acts of sabotage and spying and leaking of  information". A special parliamentary committee of the Assembly  of the Republic in Lisbon is to oversee its implementation.    Portuguese media reports said Vieira asked last year for the  right to classify documents in view of the enclave's transition  towards Chinese rule from 1999. The reports maintained there  was a need to protect Portuguese "state secrets" in negotiations  with China over Macao "directly by the Macao Governor and not  just through Lisbon".</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Russia finds new heroes in the nouveaux riches When Mr Sergei Mavrodi, the president of the troubled MMM pyramid scheme, was arrested in a dramatic raid last week a crowd of angry Russian investors gathered outside his apartment. But instead of baying for the blood of the man who gave them a painful initiation into the rites and risks of capitalism, the investors clutched banners reading 'Hands off Mavrodi]'. The strange mood of the investors - who have seen the value of their MMM stock tumble from Pounds 35 to 77p over the past two weeks - is part of a broader transformation gripping Russia. For 70 years party apparatchiks ruled this country but, increasingly, Russia's new heroes are its capitalists. Moscow's bustling streets bear witness to the fact that Russia is in the grip of a cash fever. For the first time since the Bolshevik revolution thousands of Russians have become extremely wealthy, and although many of Russia's new capitalists work as hard as any Wall Street banker after dusk they have none of the western bourgeoisie's inhibitions about flaunting their newly acquired riches. The most bruised egos in Moscow today belong to foreigners, once the city's unchallengeable upper crust but now a pale shadow of Russia's new biznesmeny. A few years ago, only foreigners could escape the wretched Soviet world of queues and scarcity but today they have begun to mutter about their enfeebled lot. 'I can't dine in Moscow's best restaurants very often any more, only the Russians are rich enough to afford them,' complains one British businessman. One of Moscow's top pop radio stations recently replaced its American disc jockey with a Russian after advertisers said that their best customers were now locals. The English language billboards advertising western consumer goods which invaded Moscow a few years ago are steadily being replaced by Russian advertisements. Even western diplomats have begun to complain that the most beautiful Russian girls no longer grace their receptions, preferring to be feted by Moscow's homegrown nouveaux riches. Moscow's health clubs are dominated by muscle-bound Russians sporting gold chains. On Sundays they escort girls in bikinis and full make-up to the Chaika swimming pool, once a foreign enclave. The new assertiveness of Russia's elite was on display this weekend at Marika, one of Moscow's trendiest night clubs where the cover charge is a hefty 150,000 roubles (Pounds 45). This Saturday night, the American boys were on the defensive. The electronic message board flashed slogans in Cyrillic rather than in English. Forlornly eyeing a scantily clad Russian girl who was cavorting under Marika's strobe lights with a female friend, a handsome Princeton graduate explained that he dared not ask her to dance because the week before he had approached a statuesque blonde with disastrous results. Natasha, it emerged, was escorted by a diminutive Russian whose silent bodyguards made altogether too evident their disapproval of her new transatlantic friendship. Willowy companions such as Natasha are one of the obligatory status symbols for Moscow's nouveaux riches. The young women - the truly successful entrepreneur brings along at least one for each arm - are part of a package that includes a fleet of gleaming Mercedes, and a bevy of burly, gun-toting bodyguards. Rich Russians - who range from former Soviet factory directors to a new breed of entrepreneurs who have graduated from dismal communal apartments to fabulous wealth - realise that their collective preoccupation with ostentation is an anomaly. 'An established bourgeoisie is conservative in its habits,' explains Mr Sergei Zverev, deputy director-general of the Most financial group, owned by the richest man in Russia, Vladimir Gusinsky. 'But here, everything is upside down.' Many ordinary Russians, for whom the extravagances of the nouveaux riches remain an unattainable marvel, have sensed this transformation, and the genius of the MMM investment fund was to tap into their desire to become a part of it. Mr Mavrodi, who is to be held by police for a further 10 days, offered his compatriots an ostensibly painless way to acquire that which has replaced the Communist party card as the ticket to power in the new Russia: capital.

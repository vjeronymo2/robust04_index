			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] On 15 April, Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and  defense minister, received a draft offer for a "peace package"  with Syria, to be given to U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher in order that he relay it to Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad.    Staff work on the formulation of the "peace package" with  Syria was conducted by Major General Ilan Biran on behalf of  Rabin. Biran, who over the past several months had no IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] assignment, will assume duty as  commander of Central Command today. Professor Itamar  Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States and head of  Israel's delegation for negotiations with Syria, also  participated in drafting the document. Parallel with the work  on the "peace package" for the Syrians, the IDF has begun  preparing a list of security demands Israel will present to the  United States to compensate for the peace risks.    The "peace package" with Syria presents the principles of  the  offered arrangement, and does not detail the depth of withdrawal  and the time needed for its implementation. Israel will suggest  to Syria that the details be worked out in direct discussions on  the expert level.    The "peace package" with Syria is made of four basic  elements: withdrawal from the Golan, peace relations, security  arrangements, and a timetable for the implementation of the  withdrawal and the normalization. Among other things, the  Israeli offer to the Syrians will include the following points:    -- A commitment in principle to withdraw. The offer does not    contain a pledge to fully withdraw from the Golan Heights.    -- Full peace relations, including embassies, open  borders, and    economic ties.    -- A gradual implementation of the withdrawal over years.    -- Establishing normalization and relations between Israel  and    Syria right after the first stage of withdrawal, while the  IDF    still holds a significant part of the Golan Heights.    -- A future discussion of water resources on the Golan.    -- Security arrangements that will include demilitarizing  zones,    force reductions, warning stations; and the deployment of  an    international force to supervise the implementation of the    arrangement.    The security arrangements will be reciprocal, but not  symmetrical: Syria will be asked to demilitarize a larger  territory than Israel.    Senior political sources yesterday said that the United  States does not demand that Israel currently detail its stands  beyond a general description of principles because Israel is way  ahead of Syria in presenting its stands. Syria has not yet  drafted a similar offer.    The presentation of the basic components of the "peace  package" was at the center of Rabin's meeting with U.S.  President Bill Clinton in Washington last month. Israel pledged  to present the package to Secretary of State Christopher so that  he relay it to the Syrians during his upcoming visit in the  region. According to reports received in Israel recently,  al-Asad is expecting the Israeli offer from Christopher.    Parallel with the arrangement with Syria, Israel will  demand that the United States bolster Israeli security, and  assist in implementing and guarding the arrangement. Rabin  discussed the issue with the heads of the U.S. Administration,  and the issue was also broached in meetings Ambassador  Rabinovich held with U.S. officials, but it has not yet been  raised in contacts between the Israeli defense establishment and  the Pentagon. Rabin will discuss the security demands with  Christopher.    Israel will not ask that military aid be expanded, only that  its current level of $1.8 billion annually be maintained, as  Clinton promised. Among the ideas raised in internal  discussions were the placement of large amounts of U.S. arms and  ammunition in Israel ahead of time; expanding the use by the 6th  Fleet of the Haifa port; a deployment of armed U.S. Navy vessels  along the Israeli coast to serve as the launching pad for  intervention forces in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf, and  Africa; expanding Israeli access to U.S. warning systems and  sophisticated armament. Israel will also demand that strategic  and political coordination with Washington be tightened.  [passage omitted]    The offer for an arrangement with Syria recently drafted by  the Foreign Ministry, which includes a full withdrawal from the  Golan Heights as its working assumption, was prepared without  any connection to the staff work prepared upon the request of  the prime minister.

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / ITV merger plans worry advertisers Advertisers have protested to fair trading and television regulators about concentration of TV advertising sales that will take place after proposed mergers in the industry. The Office of Fair Trading last week extended its investigation into Granada's Pounds 700m bid for London Weekend Television and is believed to be looking at concerns expressed by the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers. The society has told the OFT and the Independent Television Commission that sales houses may have too much power. Laser, the LWT sales house, also sells for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. The Time Exchange, the Granada sales house, is a joint venture with Scottish and also sells for Grampian and Border. The two sales houses have more than 40 per cent of the ITV advertising market.</p>

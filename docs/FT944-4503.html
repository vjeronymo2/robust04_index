			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Exemplary exporter pips big name to prize A fast-expanding company making reflective foul weather safety clothing for the police, emergency services and outdoor workers last night narrowly won the 1994 national export award sponsored by the FT Exporter, National Westminster Bank and the Institute of Export. Edward McBean &amp; Co, which employs 270 people in Cumbernauld, north-east of Glasgow, squeezed past drugs giant Zeneca Pharma International, which turns over Pounds 100m, to take victory by half a percentage point in the eight-company final. Zeneca narrowly lost last year in the award's first year. McBean's Pounds 7m turnover includes only Pounds 2.25m of exports but the judges from NatWest, KPMG Peat Marwick and the institute were swayed by its being an example that any other business could follow. Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the institute, said: 'Zeneca is a very fine company some thought should have won. But McBean is an excellent role model for companies of any size - especially smaller ones. Its managers demonstrated firm understanding of exporting principles, good management of risk and control at all levels of the company of the whole exporting process.' The finalists are winners of regional heats based on paper submissions who then undergo rigorous on-site audits by independent export experts. Two other regional winners from 1993 also made the final. Apollo Fire Detectors of Havant, Hampshire, earned Pounds 11m of its Pounds 20m turnover selling in 56 countries, a 51 per cent rise in export sales in 12 months. The other, Valpar Industrial, of Bangor, near Belfast, makes pythons - snake-like bundles of insulated, refrigerated tubing - and exports 60 per cent of its Pounds 3m annual sales. Other finalists included Reyrolle Switchgear, the Rolls-Royce subsidiary which exports Pounds 36m of heavy electrical equipment from Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, and IMI Air Conditioning, part of the IMI group, which has sales of Pounds 16m and exports a quarter of the output from its factory in Brighouse, West Yorkshire. Powell Duffryn International Fuel won the Coventry heat and Sherman Treaters, an adhesion specialist exporting 75 per cent of its Pounds 5.5m sales. won the Swindon heat.</p>

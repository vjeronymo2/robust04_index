			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> For the first time since Hungary's 1956 anti-Soviet revolt, official radio  broadcast a speech Premier Imre Nagy made in Budapest while Soviet troops and  tanks crushed the uprising. The broadcast was seen as another step in a  reassessment of that period in Hungary's history and the show trial that led to  Nagy's execution in 1958. The speech Nagy gave on radio on Nov. 4, 1956,  declared, "At dawn today, Soviet forces began an attack on our capital,  obviously with the aim of toppling the legal, democratic Hungarian government."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of reports on  noteworthy events and commentary marking the 33d anniversary of  the Interior Ministry (Minint), monitored from Havana Radio in  Spanish on 6 June.    Orlando Contreras delivers an "Our Opinion" commentary on  the  anniversary, hailing the Minint for playing a leading role in  the fight against crime. Contreras congratulates Minint  employees for achieving success with the people's support.  (Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1155 GMT 6 June 94)    The announcer of the "Doing Radio" newscast says the station  wishes "to congratulate, very early on this beautiful Monday  morning, our Minint fighters, who today celebrate their 33d  anniversary." Later in the cast, the announcer says: "We love  our Minint comrades, who today celebrate their 33d anniversary.  They certainly have a right to celebrate!" (Radio Rebelde  Network in Spanish 0900 GMT 6 June 94)    The announcer of the "First Thing" newscast sends "special  greetings, very special greetings, to the Minint forces, who are  celebrating their 33d anniversary today. Therefore, our  greetings to all those, who in one way or another, work in or  have something to do with the foundation and creation of the  corps." (Radio Progreso Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 6 June 94)    The "Doing Radio" newscast features the participation of two  members of the Jose Marti Pioneers, who "salute and  congratulate" all the Minint members, "particularly those who  work in the traffic-accident prevention and security  departments" and "prevent traffic accidents, which cause so many  deaths, injuries, and damage in the country." They reassert  that, upon celebrating their anniversary at this crucial moment,  Minint members "will aptly fulfill their duty as they have done  on other occasions, when carrying out their missions. They have  served our people for 33 years and we reassert our greetings. We  urge them to continue to fulfill their duty." (Radio Rebelde  Network in Spanish 1155 GMT 6 June 94)    Journalist Fernando Sanchez reports from Ciego de Avila  Province that "events on this anniversary have been extensive  and varied in this territory," including a mass wedding in which  the 14 people who got married are Minint members, "meaning they  have double ties -- duty and love." The report indicates the  newlyweds took a wreath to the Jose Marti monument in Ciego de  Avila's capital. Also, local "Minint Commander Colonel Miguel  Leiva Rangel presided over the festivities and awarded  promotions and distinguished service medals." (Radio Rebelde  Network in Spanish 1155 GMT 6 June 94)    Journalist Teresa Valenzuela interviews people on the  street,  who comment on the Minint anniversary. One says he has always  "supported the special Minint brigade because it deals with the  enemy and criminals on the street." Another says he admires  "their determination and courage when facing any criminal. They  act with decisiveness and are confident about the work they  carry out." A third one says we has "a high opinion of the  Minint comrades, taking into consideration that their work is  always full of danger and difficulties. It is truly a corps that  serves the people." The last person emphasizes that "the Minint  anniversary is not something you celebrate only with the Minint  members; it is an anniversary to celebrate with all the people."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yegor Gaydar, leader of "Russia's Democratic </F> Choice" party: "We Are Not Building Paradise -- We Are Trying  To Build a Normal Life"]    [Text] The first congress of our party, "Russia's  Democratic Choice," was held 12 June. Why are we creating it?  Why have I, who am not overfond of "party building," considered  it my current duty to spend all my efforts and time on creating  the party?    To avoid getting bogged down in details and in order to  highlight the main points, I offer an initial perspective.  Let's imagine that we -- like Solzhenitsyn and his family, for  instance -- have not been in Russia for 20 years and have now  returned. We were expelled from the USSR in 1974 and we are  returning to Russia in 1994 and traveling from the East to  Moscow.    I think that as conscientious people we will single out  several main features characterizing Russian life today.    The nauseating, decaying system of state hypocrisy has  disappeared. It is a case not only of freedom of speech,  political freedoms, and so forth. The newspapers and television  are not filled solely with politics. For all their shortcomings  -- persistent and crude advertizing and other unpleasant  elements -- people nonetheless see life in the mirror of the  mass media. After all, in 1974 what we had was simply a mad  country. We were told lies to the effect that there were no  poor people, no crimes, no ecological or other man-made problems  in the USSR -- there was just shock labor, the issue of orders,  and a "sense of profound satisfaction." This cardboard lie has  disappeared -- and it is stupid to argue about whether that is  good or bad. The new life is real, the former life was  fictitious.    Much else has disappeared with the lies -- party meetings,  interference in private life by the state, fear of the KGB and  informers, the constant feeling that "abroad" was some kind of  sweet "forbidden fruit." The world has been opened up to us  from all sides. You can go wherever you like as long as you  have the money, you can get any currency, we have any  information about other countries, we can watch all their  movies, buy any of their goods, and so forth. From being a  camp-country we have become an open country. Once again: There  is much that we may not like in the outside world and in our own  country but we can choose, our blindfold has been taken away.  Our life is not ideal, it may be bad, but it is real, not a  life made up for us by someone.    The lines -- a main feature of the Soviet way of life --  have  disappeared. By Western standards we have a very poor range of  goods and insane prices. But let's think -- if goods, including  necessities, have increased in cost so insanely, why are people  mostly calm, why are there no general strikes, and why -- thank  god! -- are there no barricades, rebellions, and so forth? Why  do all the calls of the "intransigent opposition" remain just  talk, however much they try to provoke the people to violence?  The answer is obvious. If life had indeed deteriorated  drastically the country would long ago have been drenched in  blood. Yes, life is hard, often unfair. But if we compare it  not with paradise but with what we were used to, the conclusion  is clear: As a whole we have not started to live worse. An  apartment, an automobile, and simple respectable clothing and  food were always almost inaccessible to an honest man while  thieves -- both state thieves (the nomenklatura) and ordinary  criminals -- always had all that in abundance. Today life has  become a little more normal: We no longer have to "chase after"  things and get them on the black market in humiliating  circumstances. We "only" have to earn money -- and today that  is the chief, the only problem of a normal person.    That can be put to the credit of "perestroyka" and then the  reforms. We have stopped standing on our heads -- although,  alas, we have not yet found our feet.    Hence the first aim of our party. It has gathered together  those who are active builders and supporters of today's hard but  natural human life. And our first "conservationist" task is to  prevent a return to the old ways.    We also adopt a "conservationist" stance on  military-strategic questions.    In other words, we are opponents of demagogic plans to  restore the USSR's military-imperial might. Matters can go no  further than demagoguery here -- in reality Russia has no  strength for such a resurrection. But this demagoguery itself,  which distracts people from real tasks, is also very dangerous,  especially as what are incredible funds for peace time -- over  20 percent of the budget expenditure goes on the army --  continue to be spent to the accompaniment of this demagoguery.  We are in favor of a relatively small, mobile, combat-capable,  professional army. Of course such an army will not give us the  opportunity to maintain superpower ambitions but Russia cannot  afford them and does not need them. Russia must consciously  leave the race for a place as a superpower. In fact that is  what has happened.    The same applies to borders. We have the precise borders of  the Russian republic. Attempts to revise them and to expand  them can only lead to catastrophe -- you only have to look at  Karabakh to understand what "territorial disputes" are. The  USSR cannot be restored -- however badly the CIS republics may  be living they will not surrender their independence just as  there is no country in the world which will surrender it  voluntarily. But for Russia it is not only impossible but  unnecessary to restore the USSR -- Russia has always been the  giver to the "fraternal republics" and indeed to other  "fraternal" regimes -- in Angola, Cuba, and Afghanistan....  These are all vestiges of the imperial trumpery which gratify  some people's vanity but which the country cannot afford today.    Normal economic relations with the CIS republics are being  set up and will develop without solemn oaths -- it is simply  that they are more interested in this than we are.  Incidentally, we should not reduce trade problems to interstate  relations. Enterprises, dealers, and bankers will find for  themselves and already are finding partners -- we are simply  doomed to collaborate. But collaborate as equals. We shall not  sacrifice the interests of Russia, the Russian economy, and  Russian people to maintain a "single and indivisible" power.    The defense of Russians' rights is a special issue. To be  honest, Russians in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus have  always been "second-class" people. When -- while we still had a  united USSR! -- the first pogroms against Russians occurred in  Dushanbe (1990) Moscow kept silent in fear -- to avoid offending  the "fraternal republic." The great empire never cared a jot  for the interests of the individual person and sacrificed them  for the sake of imperial interests. It is here that Russia must  display vigor -- only, of course, it must not fuel hysteria, not  squeal and wave its arms "Zhirinovskiy-style."    But the main tasks for which we are creating the party are  not to preserve what has been achieved but to help advance along  the path of reforms.    The main problems lie in the economic sphere. And it is here  that the question is being decided of whether Russia will become  a great power in the modern sense of the world and join the  ranks of the leading countries or will be a semicolonial country  with nuclear weapons and a large territory.    We have one global economic aim: freeing enterprising people  from the state's fetters, and then they will raise Russia as  destroyed Germany, Japan, the previously backward Korea, and  other countries were raised up after the war. Capitalism is not  an ideal system, it is simply that nothing better has yet  developed in the world. Only private interest can be a real  motivating force of progress. For that we need several  conditions: We must facilitate and simplify the creation of new  enterprises, develop a simple and stable taxation policy, where  possible avoid stifling small enterprises with taxes, promote  the creation of a normal credit system, and firmly elaborate a  bankruptcy mechanism. The main thing is political stability,  when a person knows for sure that the state protects his  property. These conditions can in general become the point of  departure for the most mobile section of business -- small  business. Small enterprises are closest of all to the real  owner, they are less subject to bureaucracy and react flexibly  to the market.    A more complex issue involves large-scale military  production. We should not fear the slump which is now taking  place. In a certain sense this is a correct and inevitable  process and a necessary element in structural restructuring.  After all, we can sense for ourselves that production is  declining but the living standard is not declining with it.  That means the lion's share of what is no longer being produced  was not vitally necessary.    But something else is also obvious. The decline in  production has two main negative aspects:    Unemployment. Serious in itself when it exceeds a certain  level, it threatens to cause a mass sociopolitical eruption.    The collapse of high-technology production. It threatens to  relegate Russia to the ranks of the third world countries.    Three tasks stem from this:    -- Creating new jobs, primarily in the construction sphere.  The construction of housing, roads, and the entire  infrastructure is a necessary and very promising business. It  could quite well draw into its orbit a substantial proportion of  people who are without work and enterprises which are changing  their profile.    -- A "selective" point-by-point policy for supporting  promising high-technology production facilities.    -- Help for competitive industry. For this we do not need to  engage in "head-on" protectionism -- that leads only to  monopolism and the stagnation of production. But we need to do  everything to encourage (tax benefits, guarantees of  noncommercial risks, and so forth) the creation of joint  production facilities and the introduction of modern technology  into our industry.    All this is closely linked with financial policy. The stable  upsurge of the necessary production facilities and the  normalization of the economy are impossible under conditions of  high inflation. Thanks to a reduction in the growth rates of  the money mass last fall to 10 percent a month by this spring  inflation had been successfully educed to the same level. But  that is still a very long way from the financial stabilization  needed for serious investments in production.    Everyone understands that financial discipline is essential.  Everyone knows that a production slump is inevitable. It is  obvious to everyone that "growth spots" in the economy are  connected primarily not with "giants in the desert" but with the  swarm of small and medium private enterprises. That is the  theory, common sense, and interest of society and the state.  Realistic policy is made not so much under the influence of  these general matters as under the influence of personal and  group interests.    Today's policy is a policy pursued by a bureaucracy in the  interests of a bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is not a swearword. It  is a social stratum of managers, primarily economic managers, a  stratum that is specific and is needed in the country. But  Russia's trouble has always been that it is not the bureaucracy  that has worked for the country but the country that has worked  or the bureaucracy. The officials' interests are the same --  controlling the distribution of financial wealth and material  resources. They will not help all private business -- only  those businessmen who have become 'theirs,' who have grown akin  to them, and who give bribes. They will not help renew leader  cadres at enterprises -- they will not remove themselves! Any  written law (on bankruptcy, on the sale of lossmaking  enterprises, and so forth) they will in practice distort in  their own way.    So we see our social and political goal in ensuring that it  is not bureaucracy but society which becomes the decisive  political force. There is one path here -- reducing the degree  of state influence on the economy. Demonopolization and  privatization should serve this goal. But laws alone are not  enough here -- what is needed is a strictly oriented political  will. The will of a party which sets as its task the  transformation of a bureaucratic society into a civil society.    The struggle against bureaucracy is no less important (and  difficult!) than the struggle against crime. Only by placing  both under control will we be able to "expand" the social area  and give breathing space to vigorous, lively people who are the  only ones on whom we can pin our hopes as builders of the future  Russia. In just the same way the destruction of the tough  bureaucratic system will make our society open -- open not to  the outside world but "internally open," so that a person will  be able to move far more freely than at present within the  social area, achieving everything by his own abilities and not  by bureaucratic connections. That is not only a condition for  economic progress but exceptionally important of itself --  important for the reaction of a more human, humane, and normal  society..    I have not listed all the party's aims. But the main thing  is clear: We are in favor of a normal path of development for  Russia, in favor of private ownership and democracy. We are  against imperial ambitions: territorial, military,  bureaucratic, and ideological. They say that today our slogans  are "unfashionable." Perhaps. But they are based on common  sense.    Hence our methods. The methods of a calm, correct policy.  We are not building paradise -- we are trying to build a normal  life. Violence is not our method, and, moreover, we know how  ineffective it is. At the same time in some situations we  cannot avoid it -- however sad it may be, I do not dissociate  myself from the government's 3-4 October actions, I take  responsibility for them and continue to see no alternative to  them. Only thus could we trample underfoot the embers of of  civil war. We are in favor of an open society and an open  policy, including open, tough, but persuasive and precise  polemics. I hope no one will accuse either the party or me  personally of demagoguery and vagueness.    We are in favor of a party with clean hands. That is what  all politicians say, but it seems to me that we have real  grounds for this. At any rate I do not know which of our active  workers could has been accused of corruption even once. Those  democratic politicians whose reputation was not irreproachable  have left "Russia's Choice" one way or another or initially  belonged to other parties. On the other hand those who are  known as decent people who do not chase after money and position  but on the contrary have been imprisoned for their convictions,  support our party. Almost all the former dissidents in the  State Duma belong to the "Russia's Choice" faction.    We are not romantics. I can clearly see even the  psychological portrait of the person to whom our party could be  close: a sensible man consistent in his convictions, someone  who does not seek external effect but real results. We are in  favor of a capitalist Russia but that does not mean that  entrepreneurs make up the basis of our party. We are glad to  have them, as we are glad to have workers, private farmers, and  so forth, but our party will be a party of intelligent people,  whatever professional or social labor they perform. The party  of those who think not only of the present but also of the  future of their children, the future of Russia.</p>

"I told him the timing is important in taking  economy-spurring measures," Yohei Kono told reporters after  emerging from a meeting with Hosokawa at the premier's official  residence. "I also emphasized it would be a disaster if  meaningful and substantial stimulus steps were not taken this  time," he added.    Kono quoted Hosokawa as replying he will strive to do what  is  necessary to boost the economy as early as possible.    The Hosokawa cabinet is scheduled to announce Thursday a  massive economic stimulus package expected to total 15 trillion  to 16 trillion yen, Japan's largest pump-primer ever, to cope  with the economic slump. Although the premier explained that  his government and ruling coalition parties are in the final  stage of building consensus on a large-scale income tax cut, he  did not touch on how the government proposes to finance the tax  reduction, Kono said.    On Japan-U.S. relations, Kono said he stressed the  importance  of Hosokawa having a successful summit with U.S. President Bill  Clinton next week.    The Japanese and U.S. leaders will meet in Washington on  February 11 to assess progress in the bilateral framework trade  negotiations.    In the meeting with Kono, Hosokawa was accompanied by  Foreign  Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura.    Kono attended the meeting along with Ryutaro Hashimoto,  chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council.    Asked about possible future meetings with Hosokawa, Kono  replied he will confer with the premier if he thinks it will be  "meaningful," adding he has no plan to hold such talks on a  regular basis.</p>

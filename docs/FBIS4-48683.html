			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 23 May (AFP) -- Banza Makalay, deputy  chairman of the Popular Movement of the Revolution [MPR], the  former single ruling party of which Marshal Mobutu is still the  chairman, has accused the Zairian opposition of prolonging the  political crisis in Zaire. "The MPR, he said, has nothing to do  with the long delay in choosing a transitional prime minister  and the opposition has itself to blame for not being able to  control the ambitions of its members." The future prime  minister of Zaire must be presented by the opposition which has  not succeeded in agreeing on one candidate.    Banza Mukalay was addressing in Lingala -- one of the  national languages -- several thousand activists who gathered in  Kinshasa on 22 May to mark the 27th anniversary of the  foundation of the MPR .    The radical opposition LE POTENTIEL newspaper, which  reported  this meeting in today's issue, estimated participants at 50,000  and said it was a "big resurrection of the MPR" which has not  held any rally since 1991.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Swaps team finds no 'timebombs': Concerns raised over the technicalities of dealing by institutions THERE are 'no specific unexploded timebombs' waiting to shake the legal foundations of London's financial markets, Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said yesterday. But there are any number of less significant legal difficulties which hinder the efficient workings of the markets. Lord Alexander was speaking on the publication of the report of the Legal Risk Review Committee, which he had chaired. Established after the local authority swaps saga - when the House of Lords ruled that councils could not engage in the swaps market, and thus did not have to meet their liabilities under swap contracts - Lord Alexander's committee had set out to identify other potential problems which could undermine the workings of the financial markets. It concluded that institutions which act as counter-parties in the London markets need greater certainty that they will not be tripped up by legal uncertainties. Creating a solid legal platform on which financial business can be conducted is essential to London's position as a financial centre, the committee concluded. Top of the list of concerns of market participants is the problem highlighted by the local authority swaps debacle: are some bodies active in the markets dealing outside their particular legal or constitutional powers  -ultra vires - thus making their contracts legally void? Following European legislation, and the 1989 Companies Act, companies in Britain are no longer affected by the ultra vires rule. However, a wide range of other institutions are, including local authorities, building societies, industrial and provident societies - which include co-operatives, credit unions and most housing associations - and friendly societies. Then there are nationalised industries, and some statutory water and harbour companies. Even some insurance companies and banks can be affected, depending on the statutes under which they were founded. Pension funds could also find themselves acting outside their powers, if their trust deeds are not sufficiently broadly worded. The development of new derivatives markets leaves open the possibility that some funds are technically unable to participate. Potentially, anyone dealing with these institutions could find themselves unable to enforce a contract, if it is later found that the body concerned did not have the power to enter it in the first place. But it is not always clear what powers are available to each type of institution. Building societies, for instance, are allowed under section 23 of the Building Societies Act to engage in any hedging transaction designed to 'reduce the risk of loss'. For anyone dealing with a society, it is impossible to determine whether this requirement is being met. Another example is the power of local authorities to get involved in stock lending - when a body lends shares it owns to others in the market and collects a fee in the process. Some authorities do not engage in the practice because of legal uncertainty, while others are less concerned. According to the Alexander committee, restrictions on what particular institutions can do may be sensible, but it is unfair to expect third parties to police these rules. Ultra vires transactions are relatively rare, but the effect of the rule is not merely to create an unnecessary and unjust risk, but also to diminish the creditworthiness of the bodies which it was intended to protect, the committee concluded. While the ultra vires rule causes the greatest anxiety in financial markets, comments to the committee indicated that the ability to net claims against each other came a close second. This is the power available to an institution, on the insolvency of a market participant, to set off one claim against another and only to settle the net amount. Netting and offset cause particular concern as they relate to the position of agents such as brokers or trustees, the committee found. Also, 'some difficulties were thought to arise in ensuring effective netting in new and complex products and across a range of different activities'. If these are the issues at the top of the markets' list of concerns, many others are also included. Among them are the ability to enforce security interests over particular assets; the operation of the Financial Services Act, in particular the provisions of section 47 which outlaws market manipulation; and the provisions of section 151 of the Companies Act, which prohibits a company from giving financial support for the purchase of its own shares. These are some of the oldest chestnuts of the financial world, if not its 'unexploded timebombs'. Having turned them up, though, the Alexander committee has provided little hope that it can do better in solving the problems than other committees before it.</p>

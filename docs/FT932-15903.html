			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Norwich may switch Pounds 20bn life fund from gilts to equities NORWICH UNION, the mutual insurance group, is considering switching part of its Pounds 20bn life fund from gilts into equities, it announced yesterday. This would be a reverse of the switch into bonds which NU made in autumn 1991, when the weighting of fixed interest in its life fund was increased from zero to 16 per cent. At the same time it made cuts of up to 9 per cent in the maturity payouts to with-profits policyholders. It did this predicting that the annual return on equities this decade would be 8 per cent, against 6 per cent for bonds. NU's average inflation prediction for the decade was 3.5 per cent. Continuing sales of property during 1992, combined with strong performance by the gilts market, have raised NU's bond holding to 26 per cent, with 19 per cent in property and 55 per cent in equities. Yesterday, Mr Philip Scott, general manager for finance, said the switch into gilts had created an investment profit for the fund of Pounds 100m. But he added: 'There's a feeling that returns from gilts are not going to be as attractive in the next two years as they were in the last two years.' Norwich Union plans to move back into equities later this year, although no definite decisions have been made. Its inflation prediction for 1994 has been altered to 4.5 per cent. This switch would be made easier by the improvement in free assets which Norwich Union also announced yesterday. NU's free asset ratio was only 6 per cent at the end of 1991. Under the Department of Trade and Industry's reserving requirements, solvency can be improved by moving from equities into fixed interest, and by cutting bonuses. NU's free asset ratio is now 9 per cent, while its free reserves are Pounds 2.7bn, compared with Pounds 1.8bn in 1991 and Pounds 2.0bn in 1990. The company was also helped by a return to profit in its general insurance arm, which made Pounds 13m worldwide, following a Pounds 165m loss in 1991. This allowed a transfer of Pounds 21.7m to the life fund. Lex, Page 20</p>

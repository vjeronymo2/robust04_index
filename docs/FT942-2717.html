			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow boosted by strong economic data Wall Street Blue chips registered solid gains yesterday in a favourable reaction to strong economic news, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.93 ahead at 3,811.34, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.32 better at 461.93. New York SE volume was 256.4m shares. The secondary markets lagged behind, however, with the American SE composite dipping 0.49 to 441.78 and the Nasdaq composite softening 0.87 to 734.97. While the Dow industrials never completely decoupled from the trend in bonds yesterday, the benchmark index did assert a measure of independence in the morning. The day's economic news was consistent with the view that the economy was on a sound footing, in spite of the recent rise in interest rates. However, many investors, particularly in the Nasdaq market, were concerned by the inflationary implications of the fresh data. The Commerce Department said that housing starts had climbed 2.6 per cent in May, confounding expectations of a 0.8 per cent decline. Initial claims for unemployment benefit showed a marked decline of 11,000 compared with last week. Thirdly, the monthly survey of business conditions by the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia was generally upbeat. All three reports were clearly unfavourable to bonds, and prices dropped again in early trading. Nevertheless, blue chips opened in positive ground and remained there. A subsequent reversal by bonds, thanks to a softer tone in commodity prices, was a bonus. A final burst of program trading, linked to today's 'triple witching' expiration of options and futures, brought the Dow to its highest level of the day at the close. In a switch from the trend early in the week, Exxon assumed the leadership in the index's modest rally. Most of the other components moved in a very narrow range. Exxon, which had reached a 52-week low during the previous session, recouped Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 58 7/8 as bargain hunters came to the fore. A commitment by Opec ministers meeting in Vienna to hold current crude oil production levels helped the issue's cause, although most other energy stocks were little changed. Chevron, however, slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 44 1/4 after Mr Eugene Nowak, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, sharply reduced his estimates of the group's operating income. Utility issues were generally weaker and the Dow Jones Utility index fell 1.31 to 184.95. Entergy, a New Orleans-based gas and electricity supplier, dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 after analysts came away from a company briefing with a pessimistic view of its growth outlook. Both Merrill Lynch and Kidder Peabody downgraded the issue. Merrill Lynch also lowered its rating on Wisconsin Energy, the stock weakening Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 . Several banking shares suffered sharp setbacks. Analysts said the sector was due for a correction after the heavy demand which followed the recent rise in short-term interest rates. Shawmut National fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 21 3/4 after trading was briefly halted on an order imbalance. NatWest Securities lowered its 1994 earnings estimate for the company. First Chicago shed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 50 3/4 , NationsBank Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 1/4 and Wells Fargo Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 155 1/2 . On the Amex, Hasbro was marked down Dollars 3 to Dollars 28 1/2 after issuing a profits warning.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> MALATHION FOES BEGIN TO SWARM;  </P> <P> PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO MEDFLY SPRAYING HAS SUDDENLY GROWN FROM NEIGHBORHOOD  GRUMBLING INTO AN ORGANIZED POLITICAL MOVEMENT.  </P> <P> Actress Rue McClanahan of the hit television series "The Golden Girls" was  shooting a new movie in Norwalk last month when she first heard the ominous  whup-whup-whup of helicopters above her.  </P> <P> McClanahan and most of the film crew were inside a building at the time, but  she winced at the bitter smell of malathion swirling around her in the night.  </P> <P> A few weeks later, McClanahan stood defiantly at a noisy protest in downtown  Los Angeles with actor Jon Cypher of "Hill Street Blues" and 150 other  demonstrators, singing to the tune of "Frere Jacques": "Malathion, malathion,  fills the air, they don't care. . . . "  </P> <P> Not to be outdone by just two celebrities, the organizers of a demonstration a  week later in West Los Angeles called in six cast members of the television  show "Cheers," including Ted Danson (Sam the bartender), Kirstie Alley (Rebecca  the bar manager) and Rhea Perlman (Carla the waitress).  </P> <P> The cast spoke to the crowd, mugged for the TV news cameras and then took off,  leaving a gaggle of gas-mask clad demonstrators to march on to Westwood  Village.  </P> <P> "Now it's really taking off," crowed Michael Bell, an organizer of the event.  "I'm feeling flush at this point. Stars are sexy. They give us entree, like a  skeleton key to power."  </P> <P> In a town where a protest isn't a protest until Hollywood turns out, the  opposition to malathion spraying has blossomed into a potent force, replete  with ample supplies of sign-waving demonstrators, political backing and, of  course, celebrities.  </P> <P> Just two months ago, the complaints about spraying were barely an annoying buzz  around the ears of state officials engrossed in their aggressive air campaign  to combat the 372-square-mile Medfly infestation -- the largest in Southern  California's history.  </P> <P> At the time, the only public official who took a stand against spraying was  Monterey Park Mayor Pat Reichenberger, who peppered fly eradication officials  with a barrage of complaints. At one demonstration in Orange County last month,  just two people showed up.  </P> <P> But in just the last few weeks, public opposition to malathion spraying has  grown from a grumbling neighborhood affair to an increasingly organized  political movement.  </P> <P> State officials fear that this increasingly visible movement of celebrities,  politicians and neighborhood protesters could force an end to spraying and  allow the pesky Medfly to spread throughout the state -- a disastrous prospect  that they say would result in up to$200 million in crop losses, higher fruit  prices and millions lost because of quarantines on California fruit.  </P> <P> Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the state Department of Food and  Agriculture, conceded that every time the helicopters take off for their  nighttime forays, the state inches closer to losing the hearts and minds of the  public below.  </P> <P> "Our hope is that before it gets there, we will be able to eradicate this thing  and get out of L.A.," he said.  </P> <P> Siddiqui believes that the Southern California Medfly war will be over by June.  </P> <P> But for opponents of aerial malathion spraying, who maintain that the  pesticide, even in minute doses, can cause neurological damage, diarrhea,  rashes and a host of other ailments, the spraying has already gone on for too  long.  </P> <P> Southern California demonstrations in the last month have drawn up to 150  people, talk of a fruit boycott to protest the spraying is building and a savvy  coalition of grass-roots groups has even set up a toll-free malathion hot line:  1-800-GO-TOXIN.  </P> <P> City councils in Monterey Park, Duarte, Huntington Beach, Garden Grove,  Westminster, Brea and Cypress, as well as the Los Angeles and San Marino school  boards, have taken formal action in just the last two weeks demanding an end to  malathion spraying or urging the state to rely on alternatives.  </P> <P> Orange County, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and Westminster filed suit  against the state Thursday, seeking an injunction against malathion spraying in  their cities that night. A Sacramento judge rejected the request, but the  cities vowed to continue filing suits until the spraying stops.  </P> <P> "I knew it was an uphill battle," said Marilyn Wiczynski, Garden Grove's deputy  city attorney. "But we're not going to stop."  </P> <P> In what has been the most serious political attack to date, state Sen. Art  Torres (D-Los Angeles) unveiled two bills Tuesday that would effectively stop  the state's aerial campaign by banning repeated malathion spraying and  requiring proof of the safety and effectiveness of the pesticide.  </P> <P> While the bills face certain warfare in the Legislature, Torres said at least  it sends a signal to spraying supporters and state bureaucrats that the easy  days of spraying are over.  </P> <P> "This marks the end of our quiet frustration and resignation," said Torres,  chairman of the Senate Toxics and Public Safety Management Committee.  </P> <P> The anger over malathion spraying is nothing new to California.  </P> <P> Veterans of the 1980-82 Medfly war in Northern California recall helicopters  being shot at by disgruntled homeowners, Red Cross evacuation centers being set  up to shelter spray zone refugees, and even some residents sobbing in the  street for fear of what malathion might do.  </P> <P> That infestation -- still the largest in the state's history -- spread to over  1,496 square miles in eight counties and required as many as 24 sprayings in  some spots.  </P> <P> Siddiqui, a veteran of that earlier Medfly war, said 17 cities officially  banned aerial spraying over their turf during that infestation. The state went  ahead and sprayed anyway.  </P> <P> The city of San Jose went so far as to ban state helicopters from its airport.  The state then shifted its takeoffs and landings to a Catholic cemetery and  kept the location secret for security reasons.  </P> <P> "I've seen demonstrations with 5,000 people," said Siddiqui, adding that he has  received only about 175 letters complaining about the current spraying program  -- a minor outcry compared to the Northern California Medfly war.  </P> <P> But Siddiqui's boss, Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss, said he is  always concerned that the opposition could stop the spraying. With at least six  more months of spraying to go, Voss said, there is plenty of time for outrage  to build.  </P> <P> "Every time we do this, the temperature goes up," he said.  </P> <P> The department maintains that malathion is safe in the minute doses used in  aerial spraying. In fact, state officials say, it's safer than a standard pet  flea collar.  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Health  have both cleared the use of malathion for aerial spraying, saying that the  amount used -- about 2.4 ounces per acre -- poses no significant danger to  humans, Siddiqui said.  </P> <P> Malathion is a pesticide commonly used by the agricultural industry and home  gardeners to kill such insects as aphis, red spider mites, mealybugs, leaf  hoppers, fleas and houseflies. The warning label on a bottle of malathion spray  cautions users not to swallow or inhale the pesticide in concentrated form.  </P> <P> But its defenders say that it is one of the safest pesticides in existence and,  when diluted to the level used in aerial spraying, is harmless to humans.  </P> <P> In 1981, B. T. Collins, then director of the California Conservation Corps,  tried to drive that point home by drinking a glass of diluted malathion.  </P> <P> The mere mention of Collins' performance today evokes sighs of pity from  anti-malathion protesters. "God, I hope he wasn't planning on having children,"  one said recently.  </P> <P> The passage of nine years has only intensified opposition to aerial spraying,  which took place in parts of Southern California in 1980, 1981 and 1982 and  again in 1987, 1988, 1989 and now 1990.  </P> <P> Opponents of aerial malathion spraying say that while people may be willing to  accept occasional fly wars, four straight years have been enough to raise  doubts about the efficiency and safety of the sprayings.  </P> <P> Since the discovery of a single Medfly in Elysian Park last July 20, about 50  cities have been sprayed, some as many as four times, according to eradication  program spokeswoman Anita Brown.  </P> <P> Affected areas are now sprayed every 21 days, but that will jump to every 15  days in April, and then every seven days in June if the infestation continues.  State officials figure that some cities may be sprayed as many as 12 times by  the end of June.  </P> <P> "I think the state has got to come through and say that there is a deadline,"  said Pasadena Mayor William Thomson. "If they don't do that, we, like a lot of  other cities, will reach the saturation point and say, 'No more.' "  </P> <P> Rising out of this sticky malathion goo has been a veritable alphabet soup of  protest groups, such as Safe Alternatives to Fruit Fly Eradication (SAFE),  Citizens Against Urban Spraying (CAUS), Residents Against Spraying Pesticide  (RASP), Coalition Against Malathion and Garden Grove Residents Against  Malathion Spraying (GGRAM).  </P> <P> A cadre of veteran activists from a variety of causes celebres have jumped into  the fray.  </P> <P> Carol Rosin, a speaker at several rallies, was one of the leading opponents  against the Star Wars space defense system; Phyllis Rabins, a CAUS member, has  been a perennial gadfly in the battle to clean up the Operating Industries  landfill in Monterey Park, and SAFE's Michael Bell is a longtime animal rights  activist.  </P> <P> But many demonstrators had never been involved in an issue before they saw the  tiny malathion drops on their cars or heard the thundering flights of  helicopters overhead.  </P> <P> Jean Hinsley, a Norwalk housewife and a sales representative for a fashion  company, said it was only after she got sick after a night of spraying that she  launched into her campaign against malathion. Hinsley polled 100 households in  her neighborhood to see if they suffered from the same problems, and later  organized a demonstration on a busy corner of Rosecrans Avenue. Only 20 people  showed up.  </P> <P> "It felt futile," she said. "At the time, it was a little discouraging. Lonely  would be an accurate term."  </P> <P> Monterey Park Mayor Reichenberger, who declares that she is no environmentalist  and is proud to be a smoker, said she became involved after her son felt ill  after one night of spraying.  </P> <P> She had received "just a couple of complaints" from constituents before then,  but she felt angry enough to start her own campaign.  </P> <P> "I just felt so strongly about it," she said. "I had never paid much attention  to it before."  </P> <P> Reichenberger has become one of the more visible figures coordinating the  political opposition to malathion spraying.  </P> <P> Since she became involved, the mayor has appeared before 15 city councils  (including her own, which passed a resolution Monday demanding an end to  malathion spraying), 35 neighborhood groups and appeared on television four  times.  </P> <P> At least six cities have passed measures against spraying since Reichenberger  began her campaign in November. Officials in West Hollywood, Los Angeles,  Pasadena, Norwalk, Monrovia, Burbank, Anaheim and Laguna Beach are also  considering various actions in the next few weeks. As a sign of the building  momentum, even cities that haven't had a single drop of malathion fall on their  soil, such as Pomona, have jumped in.  </P> <P> "If they can't prove it's safe, we don't want to be guinea pigs down here,"  said Pomona Mayor Donna Rice, who has already sent a letter of protest to the  state.  </P> <P> Resolutions and ordinances are only symbolic gestures since the state's  authority to spray under a state of emergency declared last August by Gov.  George Deukmejian overrides any local authority.  </P> <P> But if there is one area where the opposition has managed to score a victory,  it is in the battle of the television cameras.  </P> <P> The pro-malathion forces are led by publicity-shy Los Angeles County  Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy and state Food and Agriculture director  Voss, who are about as visible as a Medfly in deep winter.  </P> <P> But bring out Ted Danson or Kirstie Alley -- now you've got a media event.  </P> <P> "We bring them out for the same reason People magazine puts them on the cover,"  said Doretta Zemp, the head of Coalition Against Malathion. "Let's face it,  sports and entertainment people are like royalty in this country."  </P> <P> Zemp said she managed to get six members of the "Cheers" cast at Tuesday's West  Los Angeles demonstration because of John Ratzenberger, who portrays Cliff the  mailman on the series. The actor has been a longtime supporter of environmental  issues and markets a biodegradable packing material called Eco-Pack.  </P> <P> A few days before the demonstration, Ratzenberger asked one of the show's  assistants to call Zemp. "You have any celebrities?" the assistant asked.  </P> <P> Zemp jumped at the chance. "It's what the general public wants," she said.  "They want a king and queen."  </P> <P> Many of the celebrities have a longstanding involvement in environmental  issues. Consider Danson, who founded the American Oceans Campaign, an  environmental group advocating the protection of the oceans and sea life.  </P> <P> Danson told the anti-malathion rally: "I'm not really here to make a huge  statement today. I'm here to educate myself. (But) something does not feel  right. You have to admit it's a little strange that you have to run out and  cover your pools and your sandboxes and tape your windows."  </P> <P> But regardless of their backgrounds in environmental issues, the value of the  celebrities, Zemp said, is that they are simply listened to, as Cypher proved  at Sen. Torres' press conference Tuesday at Huntington Drive Elementary School  in El Sereno.  </P> <P> After Torres announced his two bills to stop repeated aerial sprayings, several  speakers, including Cypher, took center stage before the television cameras.  </P> <P> "As Chief Daniels, I know a lot about cover-up," he said in a stern, cop-like  voice. "I charge them (state officials) with covering up the information you  will hear today."  </P> <P> The crowd of about 100 parents, schoolchildren and community activists broke  out in cheers.  </P> <P> Cypher, whose Mt. Washington neighborhood has been sprayed several times, was  followed at the microphone by a series of other speakers who decried the  dangers of malathion and the insensitivity of the state.  </P> <P> As they spoke, signs proclaiming, "Stop Poisoning Us!" or "Boycott California  Fruit!" bobbed lazily above their heads; children milled around the schoolyard  toting orange-and-black paper Medfly masks.  </P> <P> After the last speaker finished, Torres was presented with his own Medfly mask  and the assembled reporters and camera crews began to pack up their equipment.  </P> <P> Just as the crowd started to dissipate, Cypher suddenly burst out in a deep,  booming, theatrical voice, chanting: "Just say no to oranges! Just say no to  oranges! Just say no to oranges!"  </P> <P> Everyone turned to look.  </P> <P> Then the crowd erupted: "Just say no to oranges!"  </P></p>

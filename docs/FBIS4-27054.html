			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Mexico is very much  interested in developing trade relations with China, Mexico's  ruling party leader said today.    Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, chairman of the ruling  Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI), told XINHUA that his party's  presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, is giving great  importance to the development of trade ties with Asian  countries, especially with China, since it feels that China will  be a world economic power with its current economic growth rate.    The PRI leader said Mexico is very much interested in  continuing its economic ties with China as Mexico is a big  market for China, and vice versa.    Asked about the anti-dumping measures that the current  Mexican Government imposed against a series of Chinese products  last April, the party leader said it would be better if trade  regulations provided fair treatment to both countries.    "The products we export to China are those that compete  correctly and adequately with others and China's exports to  Mexico are based on equal and fair treatment," added Ignacio  Pichardo Pagaza.    The PRI leader described trade with China as "of great  importance" to Mexico, which believes that "China is going to  play an increasingly important role in the economic development  of Asia and we want to be present in that process."    The two countries can do other types of businesses together  apart from goods export, such as bilateral cooperation in the  petroleum industry sector where each country has its own  technology, said the PRI leader.    "In this way I see a very brilliant future for relations  between Mexico and China," the PRI leader said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Unification Board [NUB] urged North  Korea today to earnestly abide by the Armistice Agreement and  normalize the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] as soon as  possible.    Through a spokesman's statement, the NUB pointed out that  North Korea's suspension of the MAC function and demand for  replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement with  the United States is a violation of Article 61 of the Armistice  Agreement, which states that the agreement can only be amended  upon mutual agreement between North and South Korea, and Article  5 of the basic agreement between the South and the North.    The NUB stressed that until an alternative replacing the  current armistice organization is provided, the agreements  should be earnestly abided by and any action intended to make  the current armistice organization defunct cannot be justified.    The NUB pointed out that, at a time when the North Korean  nuclear issue is at a critical point, North Korea's threatening  of the current armistice system is intended to delay the  resolution of the nuclear issue and blur the essence of the  issue, and strongly urged North Korea to show a sincere attitude  toward the resolution of the nuclear issue as soon as possible.</p>

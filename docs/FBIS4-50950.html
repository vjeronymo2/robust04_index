			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" by correspondent Chang Ping (1728 5493): "Li </F> Peng Stresses During Visit to Shanghai That Pudong Policy  Remains Unchanged"]    [Text] Shanghai, 23 May -- Chinese Premier Li Peng as he  toured Shanghai today reiterated that the central policy toward  Pudong remains unchanged. Informed sources revealed that  Premier Li Peng and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday  afternoon. Accompanying them to Shanghai are Chen Jinhua, State  Planning Commission minister, and He Chunlin, State Council  General Office deputy secretary general.    Premier Li Peng and his entourage toured and inspected the  "Jinqiao Export Processing Zone" and "Waigaoqiao Bonded Area,"  two of the four small key development zones in the New Pudong  District, in company with Shanghai party secretary Wu Bangguo  and Mayor Huang Ju.    After listening to reports by leaders of the New Pudong  District, Premier Li Peng and his entourage visited the bonded  capital goods market showing keen interest.    The Shanghai Hitachi Electrical Appliance Company Limited, a  Sino-Japanese joint venture which was visited by General  Secretary Jiang Zemin earlier this month, welcomed Premier Li  Peng and his entourage. It was extremely rare for both the  highest party and government leaders to visit on two different  occasions in the same month the same foreign-capital company.  The Chinese and Japanese management staff of "Shanghai Hitachi"  felt greatly honored.    This afternoon, Premier Li Peng listened to work reports by  Shanghai party and government leaders and persons-in-charge of  departments at the municipal party committee office building in  Kangping Road. It has been learned that Li Peng will assist  Shanghai in solving certain practical difficulties during his  visit.</p>

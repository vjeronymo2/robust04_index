			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Draft deal on enforcing no-fly zone in Bosnia THE US, Britain, France and Spain reached broad agreement yesterday on a draft UN Security Council resolution allowing military action to enforce an air exclusion zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina, diplomats said, Reuter reports from the United Nations. The western nations hope to present the text to the full Council on Tuesday or Wednesday after Geneva peace negotiations on the war in Bosnia are expected to end. But Russia was said to have reservations over several paragraphs in the text, which has been under consideration for weeks to enforce a no-fly zone for military planes and helicopers established by the council in October. Few details were available immediately but diplomats said they thought the resolution would contain a 30-day warning period before military action could be taken. The draft will leave vague how much firepower to use to stop Serbian or other aircraft flying over Bosnia. But the envoys said Nato powers would have an understanding among themselves to begin military action by intercepting planes before going moving to bombing airfields as the US advocates. The operation would be under the jurisdiction of the Security Council but UN Protection Force commanders in Bosnia would be notified in advance of any action, the sources said. The UN has recorded over 300 violations, mainly by Serbian combatants, since the no-fly zone was established in October. But only nine violations were reported during the first week of January, seven of them from Serbian aircraft, two by Croatians. The self-styled parliament of the Bosnian Serbs is to meet on Tuesday to decide the fate of the constitutional proposals for Bosnia-Hercegovina agreed in Geneva this week, official Serb sources said yesterday, Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor, writes. A Serb official in Pale, the rebels' main base in Bosnia, said the meeting would take place there but the venue might still change. Meanwhile, Mr Cyrus Vance has 'no plans' to step down from his job as co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, Mr Fred Eckhard, his spokesman, said yesterday. Mr Eckhard, commenting on a British report that Mr Vance was intending to leave, said: 'We're working pretty much at fever pitch right now; there is no question of his leaving the conference now.' Over 1,500 journalists and staff have been sacked from Serbian radio and TV in what the independent Serbian TV union condemned as a political purge following the victory of extremist nationalist forces in last month's Serbian elections, writes Anthony Robinson. 'We are angered that the victorious party, personified in Milorad Vucelic, the head of Serbian radio and TV, has declared open warfare against its political opponents in the media before it has even resumed power,' it said. 'The expulsions will be just a prelude to a country-wide persecution unless the people behind the purge are stopped,' added a statement by the opposition Serbian Renaissance Movement. 'Lists of desireable and undesirable citizens have been compiled in all enterprises and institutions.'</p>

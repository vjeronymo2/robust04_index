			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (1): Standing up to recession - Nissan started a bandwagon of inward investment that is transforming Tyne and Wear's economy, but pockets of long-term unemployment remain a serious problem. Last year's riots damaged a carefully nurtured image but, paradoxically, they may even have strengthened the region's case TYNE and WEAR is undergoing long-term and continuing economic change, creating problems as well as benefits. The overall picture is summed up by Mr Paul Briggs, chairman of the north- east region of the Confederation of British Industry. 'In the north-east we have changed the fabric and means of business. The economy is being reconstructed. Productivity is infinitely higher. The biggest development of the last 10 years has been the amount of inward investment and the new demands it has imposed on quality and performance. We have now got to grow many more businesses in the region. 'On the other hand, the problem is a rump of unemployment which is very difficult to overcome. There is a bad educational problem. We need a multi-skilled workforce, not labourers. 'This raises a major social question and will require an integrated approach. The link between business and education must improve and involve government, local authorities, schools, further education colleges, universities and the training and enterprise councils." The urgency of this social question was not fully recognised either regionally or nationally until last September, when riots erupted on Tyneside. Their impact on most people outside the region was worsened by an unawareness of underlying problems because of a concerted 'talking-up' of the region's attributes to impress inward investors. This campaign had justified itself by attracting Nissan to Tyne and Wear in 1985. 'We now have nearly 50 Japanese companies, nearly 12,000 jobs and Pounds 1.7bn from them in the region,' says Dr John Bridge, chief executive of the Northern Development Company (NDC), a consortium with public and private sector support. The NDC is now targeting Korea and Taiwan and the first trickle of companies has arrived, but that is only part of the story. In the 18 months to last October, foreign inward investors started 83 projects, creating or safeguarding 8,000 jobs, with an estimated Pounds 1bn of capital spending. Thirty-seven involved European-based companies, 24 were from the Far East, and 22 from the US. Far East investors accounted for 40 per cent of the jobs. In addition, 37 projects involved relocating UK companies, creating another 2,400 jobs. Not all this activity went into Tyne and Wear. The NDC acts for the whole north-east and Cumbria, but Newcastle is the regional capital and service centre and its conurbation of 1.13m people has the largest population. What is good for the north is good for Tyne and Wear. Generally, the influx has broadened the economic base and helped Tyne and Wear to withstand recession better than most of the south of Britain. Moreover, 40 per cent of output is now exported - inevitably so, since the inward investors have mainly come for easier access to European markets. This, coupled with very few people or businesses mortgaged up to the hilt, has helped insulate the local economy from the problems of southern England. Why the inward investment is needed is that only half a generation ago a third of the north-east's workforce was employed in shipbuilding, steelmaking or coalmining. Closures have seen the figure drop to only 3 per cent now. This long-term decline of basic industry is condemned by Mr Doug Henderson, MP for Newcastle North and one of the Labour party's trade and industry spokesmen. He is glad of Nissan's arrival but says it does not yet herald economic revival for an area which has consistently been near the top of the UK unemployment league. The search for work is the issue. In Tyne and Wear, for example, shipbuilding has been reduced to the high-tech warship yard of Swan Hunter. Amec, in the shape of its Press Offshore subsidiary, has been another indigenous success, as have the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group - formerly NEI - and Vickers, builders of the battle-proven Challenger tank. But the need for higher productivity has limited the numbers of jobs they can create. Most new jobs require qualified workers such as at two emergent Tyneside information technology businesses, Quality Software Products and Sage. 'You don't need labourers carrying buckets of rivets around Swan Hunter any more,' says Mr Neville Trotter, MP for Tynemouth and Tyne and Wear's only Conservative in the House of Commons. The Meadow Well estate, where the riots began, is in his constituency. Politically, reconstructing the regional economy has been a race to reduce unemployment to manageable levels before the social problems boiled over. The rate for Tyne and Wear was 11.8 per cent last December  - the latest detailed figure - with another 0.8 per cent on employment training. In addition, 12.6 per cent of under-18s were out of work and another 62 per cent of them were in youth training. There were 1,708 vacancies advertised in Jobcentres; one for every 38 unemployed claimants. Absolute numbers are down at least a third on the levels before Nissan's arrival, but the concentration of long-term joblessness into pockets has accentuated the differences between the haves and have-nots. Newcastle's submission for urban funding in the government's City Challenge competition says more than half the people under 24 in the West End district are out of work. Only one in 50 who attend the local comprehensive school leave with five or more GCSE passes. Within the West End, beside the river, is the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation's impressive Newcastle Business Park. British Airways has set up a computerised telephone-sales operation there. Only the brightest have a chance of anything other than a menial job. In spite of the efforts of many decent local people, these are the conditions in which is developed an underclass with a criminal culture. An inevitable result - as has happened following other UK urban riots in the past 12 years - is that the blame has been put almost entirely on criminals, with only a token acknowledgement of the conditions which enabled them to flourish. Mr Trotter says about 100 professional criminals rioted because the police had started to crack down successfully on their Meadow Well base. Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of the development corporation, talks of 'criminal gangs' impeding the building of community networks among decent people. Mr Bob Tilmouth, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce, says: 'There were two reasons for the riots: crime, and a badly managed housing estate. They were a great sadness to the community, but they were criminal in origin.' Dr Bridge says: 'They put crime on the shopping list of things companies wanted to know about. Tokyo TV was a problem because it was a negative, but people soon realised that it's no worse here than overseas. It's less of problem than was the one they used to ask about - industrial relations. They don't ask about labour relations at all any more because those problems don't exist.' But Mr Tilmouth adds: 'The riots have stiffened our resolve. There is still a long way to go. Many of us are determined to press on harder than before.' Indeed, the riots may help Tyne and Wear sell its case, which often looked almost too good to be true when it was merely promoted, rather than argued. The argument is strong: an entire sub-region has largely pulled itself up by its bootstraps and started to transform a declining, failing economy into a growing one. Mr Kit Pumphrey of Newcastle stockbrokers Wise Speke sums up a growing mood: 'All my life we have been running to stand still against industrial decline. Now we have a chance to build and grow. We have turned a corner and have much more power to help ourselves.'</p>

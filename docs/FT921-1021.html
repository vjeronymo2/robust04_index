			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: VNU declines 20% to Fl 117m VNU, the Dutch publishing group, posted a 20 per cent decline in 1991 net profit to Fl 117m (Dollars 62.5m), in line with the company's earlier forecasts. Despite the downturn, the dividend is to be maintained at Fl 3.60 per share. The company blamed the profit fall on a sharp decline in advertising volume in the UK and the Netherlands, which hit its business press sector and its Dutch daily newspaper businesses. Cost-cutting and reorganisations were able to offset only part of this decline, VNU noted. Operating profit declined by 12 per cent to Fl 202m. Sales were only fractionally higher at Fl 2.74bn, compared with Fl 2.72bn in 1990. VNU's profit decline stands in contrast to profit increases recently reported by the Netherlands' two other major publishers, Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer, which are relatively more protected from recession by their activities in scientific, legal and medical publishing.</p>

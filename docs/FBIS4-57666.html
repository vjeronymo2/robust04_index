			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for  21 August 1994.    Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De Leon, the presidential candidate of  the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, says he is willing  to meet with the Zapatist National Liberation Front, EZLN, if  that will help the peace process in Chiapas. He is worried that  the situation is being used for propaganda purposes by the Party  of the Democratic Revolution, PRD. In Manzanillo Municipality,  Colima Department, when asked if he would be willing to form an  alliance as suggested by other parties, he replied that this  only demonstrates that these parties are unsure of winning the  upcoming elections and demonstrates the incapacity of their  leaders to govern the country. He added the PRI is not divided  internally and will enter the election in full strength.  Regarding the many changes that have taken place in the  government, Zedillo said government officials who do not follow  the president's directives should be removed. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 16 May 94)    PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo met with the  Permanent Indian Council at the PRI national headquarters. The  meeting was attended by representatives of all ethnic groups in  the country. Santiago Caceres, an Indian leader from Guerrero,  says Indians have been treated like children, not adults.  Ernesto Zedillo admitted development has not reached the Indian  communities. Zedillo said the support given to these  communities should respect their customs, without paternalism.  The Indian communities need genuine, participative, and  determined support so that their conditions as equals, as  established in the Constitution, can be demonstrated by their  overcoming their needs. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in  Spanish 0430 GMT 17 May 94)    Leopoldo Gonzalez Quintana, national press secretary for the  Mexican Democratic Party, said foreign observers should be  invited to give their impartial judgments of the elections. On  the other hand, Francisco Ortiz Mendoza, press secretary for the  Popular Socialist Party, says the party opposes the presence of  foreign observers because it is the Mexicans who must vote and  oversee the results of the election. He added that the  anomalies that have been observed in the electoral lists are no  reason for them to be disqualified or invalidated.

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Lloyd's and its casualties THERE ARE two separate issues to examine when considering what Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, should do to cope with the impact of the losses of 1988-90 on some of its members. First: was there wrongdoing? Did Lloyd's business practices unfairly penalise innocent new members, sucking them into syndicates with a higher than average chance of encountering heavy losses? This is the issue that Sir David Walker, former chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, has been examining; his report is due next month. If Sir David finds that there were systemic weaknesses at Lloyd's which allowed abuses to take place, those members affected will have a strong case for sharing the burden with their fellows. This is a moral issue, turning on questions of natural justice, equity and fairness. The second issue looks similar, but is in fact different. If there was no wrongdoing, or if it was confined to a limited number of cases, should there nonetheless be a general sharing of pain within the market, to ease the plight of those worst affected by the losses? Both those who answer yes to this question and those who answer no have made great play with moral issues. Here, though, the strongest arguments have always been coldly commercial. A bail-out was, said its advocates, the only way of digging Lloyd's out from under the blizzard of legal cases that threatened to overwhelm it and its reputation. It was worth every member's while to pay up, to preserve the future of Lloyd's and the income it would generate in years to come. Commercial reasons Logically, the question of wrongdoing precedes the question of a general bail-out. Lloyd's has chosen to answer the questions in reverse order. Yesterday, the Lloyd's council announced that it has rejected the arguments for a bail-out. Appropriately, it reached its decision for straightforward commercial reasons. The losses of its worst-hit 2,500 Names are so great that setting aside a fund to compensate them would have gobbled up too much of Lloyd's capital. And anyway, half those Names are no longer members; giving them help would do nothing to strengthen the market's future capacity. The arithmetic did not add up, so no bail-out. Instead, brokers and managing agents are to be asked to contribute to Lloyd's hardship committee, chaired by Mrs Mary Archer. Even with extra cash, it cannot work quickly. Of the 1,185 members who have applied to Mrs Archer's committee, only 95 have so far been offered a settlement, and only 39 have accepted. These settlements, says Mr Alan Lord, Lloyd's outgoing chief executive, allow distressed Names to keep their houses till they die, living 'not opulently but quite as well as many people you would expect to meet in a small country village'. Rustic bliss The prospect of rustic bliss will not stop the lawsuits. Lloyd's council must have known that. Its decision against a bail-out scheme represents its best judgment of the balance of commercial advantage, a judgment it is there to make. That does not exempt it from greeting the Walker report, when it appears, with an appropriate response. If the report points to wrongdoing or negligence, Lloyd's will find itself urged to compensate those members affected with funds drawn from the membership generally. It would be wrong for the council, in considering this issue, to cite the decision against a general bail-out; instead, the appropriate precedent is Lloyd's contribution out of its members' funds to the settlement of lawsuits over the losses of the Outhwaite syndicate. As well as dealing with the legacy of past losses, Lloyd's must turn its attention to the future. Here, the most urgent need is to build capital rapidly to maintain market share and offset the withdrawal of disenchanted Names. Yesterday's other decision - to create a 'stop-loss' fund that will prevent Names from being wiped out in future  - will offer some limited help. But the best hope of an influx of new funds lies in the proposal to admit corporate capital. Lloyd's now believes that this will not require a change in the law; it is talking of introducing corporate capital from the beginning of 1994. Such a change cannot come too soon.</p>

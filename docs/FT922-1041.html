			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Sterling futures dip LETHARGY dominated the UK money markets for the second day running, although high German money growth figures injected a little life into sterling futures. Dealers said an increased realisation that there would be no swift cut in UK interest rates was prompted by sterling's low position on the EMS grid and hardened by the unexpectedly high figure for German money supply. As a result, volumes on the sterling futures market returned to more acceptable levels following Monday's dismal turnover of only 7,698 lots. The September short sterling contract opened slightly lower at 90.24 and was sold down to 90.16. It then rallied slightly to close 7 ticks down from Monday's close at 90.18 on respectable turnover of 21,623 lots. A trader commented: 'The German money supply figures were higher than expected and knocked the futures market back, but it was a sign of the market's bullishness that it was able to hold at the 90.17 level.' Interbank rates were mainly steady throughout the day, with only the very short-term rates showing any signs of life. The overnight interbank rate touched 8 per cent at one point and the one-week rate slipped briefly below 10 per cent as shortage in the market was quickly taken out by the Bank of England. However, the more representative one to three-month rates remained within a very tight range and closed virtually unchanged at around 10 1/16 per cent. The Bank of England's initial forecast liquidity shortage was around Pounds 850m, down on recent days and less than half Monday's figure. It shifted down to Pounds 700m later, the bulk of it representing exchequer transactions. The Bank rolled over the shortage into next week by taking Pounds 637m of short-term band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. It later bought a further Pounds 50m of the same paper at the same rate. In the French money markets, call money continued to be under upward pressure from an income tax payment deadline that has drained bank balances, and rose  1/16 to straddle 10 per cent, the level the Bank of France has set as an informal ceiling in recent months. Three-month funds were unaltered at 10 1/16 per cent.</p>

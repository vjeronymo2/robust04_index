			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Haiti Press Agency, AHP, the  situaton remains confusing in the northern Haitian village of Le  Borgne following a shoot-out that took place last weekend  between a number of armed civilians and a number of military  from the Le Borgne outpost. The Haitian military authorities  have yet to make public any official version of the incidents in  Le Borgne.    AHP says that reports by Inter Press Service mention several  people being killed during the attack, without specifying which  side suffered the alleged losses. AHP reports, further, that a  number of sources, which coincide, make mention of many arrests  in the Le Borgne area, including that of Le Borgne mayor  Belizaire Fils-Aime and a rural policeman. Several houses were  also reportedly burned down.    It should be noted that there is no telephone link between  Port-au-Prince and Le Borgne.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. REJECTS FLA. CALL FOR TOTAL CALIFORNIA MEDFLY QUARANTINE  </P> <P> Turning down Florida's suggestion that all of California be quarantined to  combat the Medfly outbreak, the Agriculture Department said today that it has  no immediate plans to expand the quarantine beyond Southern California.  </P> <P> "We feel our quarantine procedure and the area that is quarantined are adequate  at this point to prevent the spread of Medflies," said USDA spokesman Larry  Mark.  </P> <P> He said the decision was made Wednesday after the National Plant Board Advisory  Council, meeting here, recommended no change for at least 30 days.  </P> <P> Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner last week urged the department to  order the entire state of California under quarantine to fight the Medfly, one  of the world's most destructive pests.  </P> <P> The worst outbreak was a decade ago in the area south of San Francisco.  </P> <P> USDA enlarged the quarantine area May 8 to include parts of Los Angeles,  Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. A Medfly quarantine also is in  effect for part of the Miami Springs-Hialeah area of south Florida.  </P> <P> The Medfly attacks more than 200 varieties of fruits and vegetables, and citrus  is especially vulnerable, with losses of 25% to 50% of production likely in  cases of severe infestation.  </P></p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Nigeria meets UK over debt NIGERIA will seek UK support for its plan to revive a lapsed reform programme and reschedule its Dollars 27.6bn external debt today when Mr Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the country's transitional council, meets Mr John Major, the British prime minister. The Downing Street talks are seen as critical to Nigeria's efforts to win international backing for last month's budget, designed to pave the way to a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund and to rescheduling negotiations by mid-year. The military government of President Ibrahim Babangida is due to complete the transition to civilian rule in August. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, last month stressed during a visit to Lagos that there was 'not a chance' of persuading Nigeria's creditors that the Trinidad terms for debt relief could be applied before an IMF deal. The terms, announced by Mr Major in October 1991, allow for the write-off of half of an eligible country's official debt and long-term rescheduling of the balance.</p>

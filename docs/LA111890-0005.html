			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, YOSEMITE!  </P> <P> Unhappily, Dolan's question "Who owns Yosemite?" may be answered before the  contract renewal date in 1993. With the foregone conclusion of acquisition of  MCA by the giant Matsushita Electric Industries Co. of Osaka, Japan, the  control, as it now stands, of "the most scenic valley in the world," a national  shrine and symbol of the beauty and majesty of our land, will no longer be in  the hands of its rightful owners -- the people of America.  </P> <P> RALPH FRYE  </P> <P> San Bernardino  </P> <P> Maura Dolan responds: Word of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s interest in  purchasing MCA Inc. did not surface until after the Los Angeles Times Magazine  had gone to print with its Yosemite package. Since then, National Park Service  director James Ridenour has told the chairman of MCA Inc. that the federal  government would prefer to keep the Yosemite concession in American hands.  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / People: Blunt-talker at Hartstone Hartstone Group, the hosiery and leather goods company which has seen its share price tumble from 272p in March to a low of 86p last night, has appointed Shaun Dowling, a non-executive director, as deputy chairman. The announcement comes just weeks before the company is expected to report its annual profits for the year to March 31. About two months ago, Hartstone warned of expected exceptional charges of Pounds 8.5m relating to the restructuring of its recently acquired Franch and Spanish hosiery companies. Dowling, aged 59 and reported to be a blunt-talker, is a former director of Guinness and holds directorships at ML Holdings and Enterprise Computer, among others. He is expected to give greater focus to the group's operational development, an area in which the recently acquisitive Hartstone has come under close scrutiny. Dowling has been a non-executive director of Hartstone since September 1991. The City welcomed the appointment although some analysts speculated that Dowling's post was the result of institutional pressure for changes following the sharp decline in the share price. However, a company spokesman denied that the group had come under pressure from shareholders.</p>

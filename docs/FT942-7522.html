			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Full marks for M&amp;S It has become a stock market tradition to greet Marks and Spencer's full year results by marking down its shares. Last year worries about the company's annual pay award were behind the fall. While M&amp;S has delivered on its promise that higher pay would be earned through productivity gains, yesterday's figures contained an unexpected Pounds 16m pension charge. Since that amounts to 2 per cent of profits and is likely to be repeated, it could be argued that the 3 per cent fall in the shares yesterday is a rational response. Yet M&amp;S's management has little control over the pension charge. In areas which matter there is no reason for disappointment. Turnover growth in the UK of 9 per cent over the full year - and rather more in the second half - is ample evidence that the 'outstanding value' campaign has got the top line moving again. Market share has been increased at the right point in the cycle, without giving anything away in terms of margin. Rising raw materials costs may squeeze margins this year, but productivity gains leave M&amp;S well placed to cope. Doubters who predicted that its food business would be ravaged by price competition from the supermarket giants have also been firmly rebutted. If M&amp;S has a problem - other than the irritation of another poor performance in Canada - it is deciding how to invest its cash flow. After the chastening experience with Brooks Brothers an acquisition looks unlikely. The financial services business can support itself and overseas capital spending of Pounds 63m is not enough to stop M&amp;S accumulating cash. A credible solution on that score would reinforce the group's formidable momentum.</p>

Presidential candidates for the Institutional Revolutionary  Party (PRI), National Action Party (PAN), and the Party of the  Democratic Revolution (PRD) viewed the announcement of an Armed  Forces unilateral truce with satisfaction.    Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI presidential candidate in the  upcoming August elections, stressed that what is important at  this moment is that the Indians' human rights and lives be  respected. In an allusion to Chiapas, he also hoped "that this  cease-fire will be permanent so that we can find peaceful  solutions to the problems that afflict this area that is so dear  to Mexicans."    PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said that the  cease-fire is only the first step that should be taken to  reestablish peace and recommended that both sides "confine to  quarters" their troops to achieve conditions for dialogue. "What  should be done now is to declare amnesty for everyone, release  prisoners, guarantee medical attention for the wounded, and  appoint a governor who has the backing and consensus of the  people of Chiapas," added Cardenas. The unilateral truce  announcement was, according to Cardenas, the result of pressure  exerted by various sectors of society that had demanded a rapid  political solution to the conflict.    PAN (the country's second electoral force) presidential  candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos believes that Salinas de  Gortari has made a "sensible decision," a decision that all  political groups agreed with from the beginning. Likewise, he  wants conditions rapidly established that will solve the root  cause of the insurrection, such as attention to the historical  problems of the area and many others "where bullets have not  talked." Fernandez de Cevallos called on his electoral rivals to  "abstain from actions and behavior that in some way could imply  opportunism or be offensive to the people of Chiapas and society  in general."    The Permanent Agrarian Congress, which groups together 11  peasant organizations, gave its support to the president's  decision and defined it as "a firm step to attain peace."    Saul Gonzalez, chairman of the Grand Commission of the  Senate, believes that the dialogue between the insurgent  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and the government will  have to take place under conditions of equality and flexibility.  In addition, he said, the bases should be laid so that the  rebels can reenter national political life with the political  party that best responds to their beliefs.    Political expert Pablo Gonzalez Casanova said that it is a  mistake to think that the Chiapas conflict can be resolved in  the short term, although he believes that the government decreed  cease- fire is a positive event in the search of peace.  Gonzalez, who is in Ocosingo, one of the villages most affected  by the clashes, said that the recent cabinet changes show that  at last there have been deeds rather than words in Mexico.    Monday's government changes included the dismissal of  Government Secretary Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco and the  appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis, up to now foreign  secretary, to the post of peace and reconciliation commissioner  to Chiapas.    According to various analysts, President Salinas de  Gortari's  decision to decree a cease-fire is the first concrete step to  act politically in the Chiapas armed conflict, abandoning the  military option after proving its uselessness in resolving the  crisis.</p>

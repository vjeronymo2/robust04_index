			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Arts: BBC haunted by the Thatcherite dream - Television IF debate about the future of the BBC is to remain at the level of 'Yah boo, you're a pseudo-Leninist' and 'Gerroff, you Bourbon in red braces', we may as well give up hope of maintaining the level of excellence hitherto achieved in radio and television in Britain and hand the whole shebang over to the satellite people. The 'Leninist' thrust was one of several delivered by Michael Grade, one time BBC television supremo but these days chief executive of Channel 4, and the 'Bourbon' riposte came from Duke Hussey, chairman of the BBC governors. For those of us concerned with programmes rather than personalities, it is agony to know that, lying beyond this squabble, there is an important debate which never seems to come out into the open. To be fair, Grade has made the first real effort. Delivering the keynote speech at the Edinburgh Television Festival, he accused the BBC governors of political appeasement, and BBC top brass of abandoning their heritage by axing resources, creating a culture of secrecy through editorial dictatorship, and of stifling talent. He also laid into John Birt, director-general in waiting, whom he described as 'a trappist monk, unable to speak publicly', and lambasted Birt's scheme for 'producer choice' which is supposed to introduce market forces into the heart of the corporation. Down on the BBC gundecks, Grade's swipes were greeted with rapture by a staff which, even by its own high standards of moodiness and paranoia, has been especially depressed - almost despairing - recently. The feeling among the troops is that they have carried on a BBC tradition of excellence in programme-making, often for rewards well below those in the private sector, but that the organisation is now being changed, lock, stock and barrel, and its ethos cast carelessly - even unknowingly - aside in a series of moves which might be described by a soccer commentator as 'getting your retaliation in first'. Their own management, it seems, is busy transforming the BBC into a Thatcherite dream - despite the fact that Thatcher herself has been deposed, Britain's administration has moved on and become less hostile towards the corporation, and the Government's own discussion paper on the future of the BBC is not due until this autumn. Many of the powder monkeys fear that, long before they or the listeners and viewers have had any chance to put an oar in (despite the recent array of internal consultative committees), the BBC will have been changed into an organisation marooned on the 'high ground' of broadcasting, and concentrating - at the expense of its traditional strengths in popular entertainment - on a style of serious journalism much favoured by the serious John Birt and his proteges from London Weekend Television's current affairs department, who now fill so many key posts in the BBC. In the ranks, it is seen as the puritanical Cromwell and his New Model Army driving out the cavaliers. The puritan style, known as 'Birtism' and often characterised as 'Stalinist' because of its centralised editorial structure, serves as a symbol for all the changes being introduced, including 'producer choice'. The managers see this as a way of devolving true choice to individual producers, allowing them to use, say, the cameraman they want rather than the one nominated from the roster; the intention is to put pressure on overheads. Yet in the ranks, the very phrase 'producer choice' is widely seen as an example of Orwellian Newspeak, a way of putting the full burden of costing on to individual producers who will in future be charged for everything from make-up to ballpoint pens. . . everything, that is, except the cost of carrying what they see as the notorious BBC bureaucracy with its chauffeur-driven limousines and country house hotel weekends: the very things, say those on the lower decks, on which producers would most readily choose to economise, and the very thing for which independent programme-makers - against whom BBC producers are now to be measured - do not have to pay. Furthermore, though BBC producers are to be allowed to go outside the organisation to find cheaper editing suites or scanner vans, the BBC's editing suites and scanner vans will not be allowed to compete for outside custom. Opponents maintain that this will destroy the BBC's talent base in the craft industries, which has done so much to make the corporation into a (many would say the) world leader in programme making. However, having raised our eyes from the Grade-Hussey bout to look at the background problems, it is necessary to step back again and take an even longer view of the underlying principles. On the whole, politicians are suspicious of broadcasters and broadcasting. It strikes them as a business with nearly as much power as their own - more, it seems sometimes - and even less responsibility or answerability. Conservative politicians are particularly opposed to broadcasting being run by uppity intellectuals. If we must have this modern fourth estate, they would rather it was run by businessmen with the sole purpose of making a profit; there are few profits in investigative journalism or arrogant Death On The Rock-style exposes. Businessmen can be relied upon to concentrate on game shows, soap operas, and tabloid journalism of the human interest variety, not a lot of embarrassing stuff about security scandals and police corruption. Even though ITV was largely run by businessmen it was, for historical and social reasons, deeply impregnated with BBC values. So the Thatcherites introduced franchise auctions which, from next January, will ensure that virtually nothing is shown in peak viewing time which does not make a profit. That should take care of ITV. But the BBC is a much bigger, older, tougher problem. It was created at a time when the scarcity of technical resources, specifically wavelengths, was seen as necessitating a monopoly, and thus a collectivist system of support. By the 1980s collectivism was seen in Downing Street as synonymous with socialism, socialism was synonymous with communism and so the BBC was a hotbed of reds, QED. What was needed was the firm smack of market forces to bring the arrogant BBC into line with everything else in the country: education, local government, trade unions, industry and so on. When Margaret Thatcher was succeeded by John Major, many broadcasters who believed that the BBC should resist the call of the market heaved sighs of relief. Since the licence-fee system provided two highly successful national television services and five highly regarded radio networks for less than the cost to the viewer of a single movie channel on the Astra satellite, and since the BBC had proved year after year, its superiority in international programme contests, its future should, surely, be secure. Thus it comes as something of a shock to them now to hear their own bosses countering Grade's charges with Thatcherite arguments about competing in the marketplace. Yet this may not be the BBC's worst problem. Much has been said about the corporation's need to maintain its success in the popular sector of the programme spectrum if it is to sustain its claim on the licence fee, and it is a reasonable argument. Yet what should really have been worrying Mr Hussey this week is not just Mr Grade's attack, but the fact that the BBC seems to have lost the sympathy of David Attenborough, probably the most highly regarded broadcaster this country has ever produced, and of John Tusa who was a superb television broadcaster and more recently an inspiring managing director of the World Service. Attenborough now says that the very things which gave the BBC its unique stature and strength are being destroyed, and Tusa says he is leaving. It would be bad enough to lose its soap opera audience, but once the BBC loses the loyalty of Britain's middle class intelligentsia, it may as well start folding its tents.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] According to the ``estimate for the FY94 nuclear  energy related accounts,'' the government's entire budget  relating to nuclear energy, excluding the Ministry of Education  (i.e., for eight government agencies including the Science and  Technology Agency (STA), MITI and the Foreign Ministry) will be  about &yen;458,711 million, a 1.7&percnt; increase from this  fiscal  year.    The nuclear related accounts of MITI and STA were reported  in  an earlier edition. In addition, the Foreign Ministry's account  will be &yen;4,866 million, a 6.9&percnt; increase over this  fiscal  year. In addition to the &yen;4,102 million budgeted for Japan's  contribution and share of expenses in the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), &yen;332 million for Japan's share of  expenses in the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and  approximately &yen;20 million for the cost of participation in  international conferences, &yen;432 million has been newly  budgeted for contribution to the nuclear energy safety support  fund.    The Ministry of Transport requested the same amount as this  fiscal year, about &yen;34 million, to continue surveys and  analyses needed to confirm the safety of transporting of  radioactive materials, and to draw up safety standards for  transporting of radioactive materials.    The nuclear energy related account for the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) will be increased by  1.4&percnt; to about &yen;68 million. MAFF has budgeted &yen;45  million for the Tsukuba agricultural research interchange center  (the RI training facility), and about &yen;24 million for  startup expenses for eradication experiments and prevention of  breeding of arimodoki [phonetic] beetle in the Amami Islands,  Kagoshima Prefecture. At the same time, MAFF has eliminated the  budget for the urimi [phonetic] fly infestation prevention  project in the Amami Islands.    The Okinawa Development Agency account will be slashed  25.1&percnt;  to &yen;625 million. The allocation for the urimi [phonetic] fly  infestation prevention project in Okinawa will be cut back  substantially to &yen;566 million, while about &yen;60 million  will be added to begin eradication experiments and prevention of  breeding of the potato beetle.    The Ministry of Health and Welfare will allocate the same  amount as this fiscal year, about &yen;300,000, to the cost of  monitoring, control and guidance for medical equipment and  pharmaceuticals.    The Ministry of Home Affairs also will allocate the same  amount as this fiscal year, about &yen;2 million, to provide  guidance for nuclear disaster countermeasures.</p>

			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (19): Tourism targets seem not too fanciful  -One of the world's cheapest countries for western visitors is trying to do more to attract them THE SHARP fall in the value of the rupee in recent years has helped to make India one of the cheapest countries in the world for the western tourist. The government has ambitious plans to take advantage; the tourism industry, though encouraged by the level of ministerial enthusiasm, is sceptical about the chances that these will be achieved. India has set lofty targets for tourism in the past - and failed to reach them. Its share of world tourism traffic has remained at 0.4 per cent over the past five years and its foreign exchange earnings from tourism have remained at Dollars 1.3-1.5bn. Last month Mr Madhavrao Scindia, civil aviation and tourism minister, announced that he wanted India's share of world tourism to rise to 1 per cent within five years. By the end of the century he wants both foreign exchange earnings and employment in the sector - currently 14m  - to double. The country's lacklustre performance last year, previously designated as a year for tourism, is explained in part at least by events outside the industry's control. The Gulf War upset the best-laid plans of all the countries in the region and the violence surrounding the Indian general election campaign made the sub-continent less attractive still. 'The tourism ministry does not have an in-house astrologer,' says Mr Scindia. 'If we had one he would have cancelled the year for tourism before it began.' Mr Scindia, an effective railways minster between 1985 and 1990, is viewed as a breath of fresh air by tour operators and hoteliers, even though his reputation has been tarnished recently because of controversies over civil aviation. His plans for tourism include improving the quality of the infrastructure, particularly transport, increasing foreign investment and easing the vast array of government controls and bureaucracy which hold back the industry and providing financial encouragement for hotel building. Compared with the performance of its neighbours, India's targets do not seem so fanciful. Even if it were to raise the annual number of its tourist arrivals from 1.7m to 3m or 4m, it would still not equal the 4m-plus already achieved by Singapore and Malaysia. The main advantage that those two countries have over India is their geographical position. According to Mr AK Gupta, joint secretary at the ministry of tourism, at least 80 per cent of those who visit countries belonging to the Association of South East Asian Nations come from within Asean. India's problem is that it is relatively isolated from the main sources of tourism. 'The foreign tourist has to make up his mind,' says Mr Gopta. 'India is not a country for an impromptu visit.' Nonetheless, India's infrastructural problems do not make it easy for spur-of-the-moment visitors. Internal flights within India are often booked some days in advance and, while anyone with corporate contacts can usually arrange a late booking, that is of little use to the leisure tourist. To help ease the congestion, the government has inaugurated an open skies policy whereby independent operators can set up airlines between the main cities. Three companies are already flying between them about 15 737s but the foreign exchange expense of setting up in the business has led to problems for other potential entrants. Meanwhile, progress has been made in making Indian Airlines flights more punctual and the tourism ministry says 86 per cent on trunk (metropolitan) routes are on time. More customer-friendly policies, such as warning passengers of impending delays, are being introduced. To bring more people into the country, the government has eased rules on charter flights. Whereas an airline would previously have to wait six months for clearance to bring in a chartered flight, arrangements can now be made within 24 hours, says the tourism ministry. It expects the number of charters to increase to at least 400 in 1992-93, against a previous norm of 125. To achieve its targets, India will also need to spend far more to increase the number of its hotel rooms. There are now some 44,000 in the approved sector, perhaps half of what is needed. Upmarket hotel chains are already planning significant expansion. The Welcomgroup has a Rs1.6bn development plan for the next three years which is expected to increase by 50 per cent its capacity from the present 2,300 rooms. Last month's government tourism plan increased from 3 to 5 per cent the interest subsidy available to some two- and three-star hotels, while discontinuing subsidies for four- and five-star rated hotels. Investment in hotels and other facilities will also be encouraged in special tourism areas where tax concessions will be made available. This reflects a government desire to move away from the previous even-handed approach to the various regions. Fifteen specified circuits and destinations are being identified for concentrated marketing and development. That should take some of the pressure off the Golden Triangle of New Delhi, Agra and Jaipur which, in peak tourism months at least, is close to full capacity. The government's decision to sell 60 per cent of its equity in 24 hotels managed by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation could also increase the supply of quality accommodation. Foreign companies are being invited to take stakes of up to 40 per cent in the hotels which will be marketed in batches of four. It remains to be seen how interested foreign companies will be in joining ventures in which the government will still hold 40 per cent of the equity. A further deterrent is that the hotels, which comprise one of the largest chains in the country, have staff-resident ratios twice as high as private sector hotels. Foreign investment in private sector tourist enterprises has also been made possible through recent liberalisation. The high price of land in cities will remain a brake on development, particularly on two- to three-star hotels which are needed more urgently than pricier units. All of these developments have encouraged the tourism industry that real change is in the offing, but grievances remain. The Indian Association of Tour Operators says the government's introduction of a 20 per cent tax on foreign currency payments at hotels where nightly rates exceed Rs1,200 will weaken the enthusiasm of foreign tour operators to organise trips to India. The association also wants the government to allow more luxury cars to be imported. which it says are needed for the industry. Few in the industry are confident that the government can achieve all of its targets, but growth in tourist arrivals and foreign exchange receipts of between 10 and 15 per cent a year is considered eminently plausible.</p>

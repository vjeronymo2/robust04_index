			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS' LATE SURGE OVERCOMES MARINA, 7-3  </P> <P> The legend has gone, but the understudy is filling in admirably.  </P> <P> Todd Gragnano, who quarterbacked Los Alamitos High School to three straight  Empire League championships, is now at the University of Nebraska.  </P> <P> But senior quarterback John Collins learned enough in three years to hit Tyler  Cashman with a 29-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter, giving Los  Alamitos a 7-3 victory over host Marina High.  </P> <P> "Todd's a good friend of mine," Collins said, "so I've been around him, and  when I get out there, I think, 'I gotta do what he did.' Although I know my  limitations, I have high expectations."  </P> <P> Collins completed 14 of 23 passes for 158 yards.  </P> <P> With Marina leading, 3-0, in the fourth quarter, Collins lofted a wobbly pass  to Cashman for the only touchdown of the game, and Eric Wallace kicked the  extra point.  </P> <P> Marina's No. 1 fullback, Shawn Fulford, carried the ball more times for more  yards -- 26 for 113 -- than the entire Los Alamitos team (13 for 65).  </P> <P> Fulford's two-yard apparent touchdown in the first quarter was nullified by a  penalty, and Dan Armstrong gave Marina the early lead with a 28-yard field  goal.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes was not satisfied.

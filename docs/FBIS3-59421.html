			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Padori and Z.P. Mokrova: "`Wild' Gasoline </F> Pumps on the Macedonian-Serbian Border: A Black Market With the  Blessings of the State"]    [Text] In conjunction with the incident last Sunday at the  Macedonian-Yugoslav border near the village of Dojane, in which  two MVR [Ministry of Internal Affairs] officials and one ARM  [Army of the Republic of Macedonia] soldier who were guarding  the state border were kidnapped, it turned out that what was  involved was the smuggling of fuel--the topic of much gossip and  an activity well-known to government authorities, although they  do not lift a finger to stop it. And, after an evening's tour  around the Kumanovo-Tabanovce region, it became obvious that the  incident was a coincidence; nothing was meant by it. Both the  "wild" and the "tame" gasoline pumps (not including those of  Makpetrol) are largely pouring derivatives for the enterprises  of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. It is understood  that the price for one liter of diesel is 1.8 German marks, and  that fuel is available in unlimited amounts.    Greek and Bulgarian gasoline, and perhaps even some from the  "Skopje" refinery (?) [as published], is sold exclusively for  vehicles with registrations from Gnjilane, Vranje, and Kraljevo.  But, as is pointed out both at the customs section at Tabanovci  and among the inhabitants of Kumanovo, who have noticed  especially increased traffic toward the north, there is  obviously one purpose--the smuggling of fuel.  <H5>  Gasoline in Little Kegs and Plastic Bottles </H5>   Througout the day yesterday, the dozen or so illicit pumps,  as well as the legal private pumps that we observed, were  operating mainly for FRY citizens. As we traveled from Kumanovo  to Tabanovci, the first pump, working nonstop, was at the "Koka"  enterprise in the village of Pukovsko. There, the automatic  dispensers worked without interruption, and the fuel was flowing  into little kegs, canisters, and the reservoirs in tractors,  trucks, animal-drawn vehicles, and motorized cultivators. The  price was known: one German mark per liter. A kilometer away,  the pump at Rajkovo house did not operate yesterday; the tanks  were full and right next to the pump were three underground  cisterns, awaiting "sales." There were also some pumps near  Recica village, but the most often used one was at the Banjka  enterprise, next to which, waiting to be unloaded, were seven or  so tanks.    At a farm near Recica village, the pump, which was located  in  the middle of a field, was operating beautifully; the fuel was  pumped from four automatic dispensers for gasoline and one for  diesel. And let us not even mention the roads connecting these  locations, because they are not in conformity with any "planning  or town ordinances." What is important is that the marks roll  in as if on a conveyer belt. At each vehicle we stopped, the  drivers with whom we talked said the transportation was being  carried out successfully. But, of course, along the auxiliary  roadways. This means that the border is being crossed illegally  through the fields and that only a minority, those with  explosive cargoes, go directly to the ramps [legal border  crossing] at Tabanovci.    Yet another place where fuel was sold yesterday is the  "Keramika 2" pump in Agino village, where, in one truck with  Kumanovo registration, there were as many as 15 little kegs,  each containing 10 liters of fuel! Around both the temporary and  the permanent locations for the sale of fuel, we found hundreds  of vehicles whose owners diligently "organized" this dangerous  cargo. They poured it into plastic Coca-Cola bottles, stowed it  in the bodies of their cars, and some people skillfully lined  the area under the chassis with metal containers. As an  inhabitant of Gnjilane told us, the really artistic smugglers  are from the other side of the border. There, the fuel is sold  like hotcakes for three to four marks per liter, and the  "smugglers" earn vast amounts of hard currency in cash for only  three- to four-kilometer trips.    What is being done by the customs officials, police, and  border stations in our country, as well as the inspectorate and  those state insitutions that are charged with granting licenses  to erect gasoline stations?  <H5>  Every Other Person -- A Smuggler </H5>   The chief of the customs post at the Tabanovce highway  crossing, Traje Pesevski, explained to us that it was not  possible to get rid of the fuel smugglers. Every second vehicle  tries to carry fuel illegally, but the methods used to conceal  the fuel border on science fiction. The containers, the big and  small cans and the plastic bottles, are conventional, but it has  reached the point that entire tanks are being built into car  seats, which are then reupholstered; in place of spare tires,  there are complete "tankers"; and other "clandestine" places are  also found in spaces at the bottom of the doors and even in the  engines. As a result, there have been three cases of cars  catching on fire.    According to Customs Official Toni Nikolovski, up to two  metric tons of fuel a day, which were given to Sileks, have been  confiscated thanks to the efforts of customs. There was a case  in which 460 liters of fuel were confiscated from a single "101"  [as published], and up to a ton has been confiscated from buses.    The real problem is posed by the surrounding natural  approaches to the fields and the country roads. As Mome  Jovanovski says, such "black" communications lines are sought in  order to provide complete security at the borders. As a result  of expedient measures, sometimes up to 200 people a day end up  in the opstina [township] court in Kumanovo, which is authorized  to deal with illegal trade and the illegal transportation of  dangerous materials.    According to the authorities from the border crossing, a  resolution should be promulgated to give the responsible  inspection bodies, which already have obligations in this area,  the duty to track the sale of fuel, and even to check those who  grant permission for the locations for the sale of gasoline.  <H5>  Authorized "Incompetence" </H5>   When rumors about illicit gasoline pumps developed, their  removal fell within the purview of the Ministry of Urbanization,  Construction, Communications, and Ecology. According to Ljupco  Todorovski, a chief inspector at the ministry, this business in  fuel is located in Tetovo and Kumanovo and on the border with  the FRY. In Tetovo, there were 32 "wild" gasoline pumps, of  which 15 were outside settled areas. All of these are now in the  process of being removed. In fact, 18 such pumps were  disassembled by their owners, and 14 were subjected to more  forceful measures. In the Kumanovo region, 10 such "wild" pumps  have been discovered; there are orders for six to be demolished,  and measures are in progress with respect to the other four.    Meanwhile, the inspecting bodies are facing a number of  problems, which are in large measure the result of the  instability of the local administration and which mean that all  these difficulties wind up in one place--at the ministry.  Particularly surprising is the fact that inspectors' equipment  is completely substandard. They did not have a car nor the  special skill required for this work, because the fuel should be  handled by trained people.    Another aspect of this is that, along with last year's  relaxation of regulations on gasoline pumps, little attention  was paid to who was opening gas stations or where. The approvals  were usually given without problems; in addition, the inspectors  are not authorized to deal with these pumps. The permission for  the location, administrative consent, and approval for the sites  are issued only in the ministry with the signature of the  minister. Furthermore, this process is not mindful of the safety  of the citizens (in densely populated areas) with regard to  transportation (without special access roads). Consider, for  example, the construction of the gasoline pumps on the  expressway and the highways (the western highway); there are  specially designed plans for the location and for all the  components of such a site. Thus, on the road to Tetovo, two  pumps (belonging to Fersped) were to be erected, facing each  other, and near the village of Zelino, another two private ones,  side by side! Issuing the permits to the enterprises and  individuals resulted in a situation in which instead of the  flowing of fuel being a function of the traffic, the opposite  effect was achieved; the pumps were exclusively for the interest  of the individuals. At the same time, plans to widen the road  linking Skopje - Tetovo - Gostivar and Ohrid were not  considered, so one day these gasoline pumps will be exactly in  the middle of the road! They will have to be torn down, and with  that, the 600,000-800,000 German marks invested (if they were  built in accordance with regulations) will be gone for good....    The apathy of the responsible market inspection service  bears  a good share of the guilt for the regular smuggling of fuel from  Macedonia to the FRY. Evidently, they scarcely move from "the  central office" and cannot take credit for any particular  achievements. The previously mentioned road is a good  example.... But whether they are worried or indifferent--that is  a good question!    In any case, in view of the open smuggling and the incident  on the border, which was obviously not authorized, the state  should "pull" the reins that it is holding a little more  forcefully. In the past, if nothing else, more concerted action  should have been taken, and there is no doubt that even a slight  effort would have prevented the situation from becoming as bad  as it is now. Is it necessary for another incident like the one  last year to occur, or even a more serious one to compel action  -- this is, at the moment, uncertain. However, one thing is  certain: fuel from Macedonia travels northward, earning millions  for the "smugglers," who probably have their "fingers"  everywhere, even in the government... and this is no  exaggeration....</p>

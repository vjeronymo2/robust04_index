			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Jobs and schemes MR NORMAN Lamont's offering, for all his borrowing of the opposition's slogans, cannot honestly be described as a Budget for jobs. How could it be, with unemployment expected to pass the 3m mark in today's February figures, and to carry on rising throughout this year and probably 1994 too? The pertinent question is whether the combination of Mr Lamont's macroeconomic helmsmanship and his Budget innovations will together deliver lower unemployment than would otherwise be the case. It may seem masochistic to lament an omission of detail from Mr Lamont's performance. But the discussion of the likely course and importance of economy-wide labour market trends, both in his speech and the Treasury's Red Book, is inadequate. The developments in pay, productivity and the exchange rate that are needed if unemployment is to fall fast are either too obscure, or too painful, for the Treasury's economists to analyse. Yet the implicit message is clear enough: massive unemployment is here to stay. The Treasury's pessimistic growth projections imply unemployment above 3m throughout this parliament. This will be so unless there is a further fall in the real cost of labour, either through a further sterling depreciation or a sustained period in which real wages grow more slowly than underlying productivity. But to mention the former would court disaster in the markets, while the latter would not play well politically with voters who are to be punished by higher taxes in the next two years. High real wage growth, at the expense of permanently higher unemployment, appears to be deeply ingrained in Britain. But it is difficult to understand why the chancellor felt it necessary to compound the problem by a 1 percentage point increase in National Insurance employee contributions, effectively a tax on lower-paid employment. Yet the government also deserves modest praise. Its package of training and employment schemes for the unemployed is an imaginative step in the right direction. Particularly encouraging are the four pilot Workstart schemes which will enable the long-term unemployed to transfer their welfare benefits as a subsidy to a private-sector employer. This is a more desirable way of getting the unemployed back to work than poorly paid, temporary public or voluntary sector jobs. Regrettably, the whole employment package is much too small. Extra spending of Pounds 125m, creating space for only 100,000 additional participants, looks puny alongside long-term unemployment of more than 1m. The government should plan for a significant increase in the 1,000 initial Workstart places, if the trials are successful. The additional places should perhaps be targeted at the 200,000 people aged between 18 and 24 out of work for over a year. The demand for the government's new schemes will be rising for a number of years. So must the supply.</p>

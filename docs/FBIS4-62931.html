			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 18 May -- "Nothing but rubbish -- that's how  one has to describe reports in some of the media that I would  dissolve the present parliament if I became president," said  former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, candidate for the post of  Ukrainian president, in an ITAR-TASS interview today. "This is  nothing more than a pre-election political game," he stressed.    But the essence of this "game" is as follows. Parliament did  not recognize the powers of people's deputy of Vladimir Grinev,  co-chairman of the interregional reforms bloc. Straightaway  some of the media reported that the former deputy chairman of  the Supreme Soviet, entering into an alliance with Leonid  Kuchma, had allegedly stated: "If Leonid Kuchma is elected  president, he will dissolve this parliament."    "The Supreme Soviet doesn't have to be dissolved, but  re-elected. Otherwise we will not be able to adopt a new  constitution and solve many other vitally important problems,"  the presidential candidate stressed.</p>

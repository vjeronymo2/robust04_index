			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Indonesia rates at 7-year low Indonesian interest rates have fallen to their lowest level for more than seven years, raising hopes that consumer spending, which has been sluggish since 1991, may begin to pick up, writes William Keeling in Jakarta. Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the largest state bank, yesterday lowered its deposit rates by half a percentage point to 11.5 per cent for one month money, a move swiftly followed by 19 private banks which announced a full point drop in deposit rates. A fall in lending rates across the board may follow with Bank Niaga, a leading private bank, yesterday dropping its prime lending rate 1.5 percentage points to 19 per cent. While interest rates vary wildly between banks, deposit and lending rates on average have now fallen by one-third in the last 12 months, mirroring the central bank's steady reduction of the government bond rate from an average 16.5 per cent a year ago to a current 8.5 per cent. The spread between deposit and lending rates, however, is expected to remain high with many banks still battling with portfolios dogged by non-performing loans. Some bankers are also concerned a lowering of interest rates now is unjustified and may cause the economy to overheat next year.</p>

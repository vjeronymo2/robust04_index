			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BT profits fall may be cloud with silver lining DESPITE THE sharp decline in profits, caused largely by the cost of its redundancy programme, British Telecom's results provided evidence of underlying strength. Together with a generous increase in the dividend, it proved enough to keep the company's shares buoyant yesterday. The main grounds for optimism are: Earnings. Excluding the cost redundancies and losses on four disposals, BT's earnings per share were slightly ahead of the corresponding figure for last year. In the fourth quarter they were up more than 11 per cent on that basis. Volumes. Volume growth in domestic calls was negligible, but there was 6 per cent growth in international calls despite increased competition from Mercury. Operating costs. BT has shed nearly a third of its staff in three years; 19 per cent went last year alone, reducing gross staff costs by 8.1 per cent. The current workforce of 171,000 is set to be cut by a further 30,000 over the next two years. Gearing. Strong cashflow allowed BT to cut its net debt from Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 1.76bn and gearing from 21 per cent to 14 per cent. BT should have eliminated its debt by 1996, giving it large capacity to finance acquisitions. Moreover, the profits decline together with a 2 to 3 per cent loss of market share over the year may help deflect calls for a review of BT's prices by Oftel mid-way through the term of the existing agreement, which is due to run until 1998. As one analyst put it: 'if allowing the competition to get more of a foothold reduces regulatory pressure, it could make BT more not less attractive to investors.' The unexpected Pounds 750m deficit in BT's pension fund failed to ruffle the City. BT's payment of some Pounds 1.1bn to the pension scheme this year will come from the balance sheet which will be offset by the receipt of Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from the sale of its stake in McCaw, the US cellular telephone company, to American Telephone and Telegraph. Nonetheless, analysts are not uniformly ecstatic. Liberalisation is a two-way process: if BT breaks into the US, AT&amp;T will get into Britain, and is already challenging BT to sharply cut wholesale call rates. At home, cable companies are fast building local phone networks, some offering discounts on BT prices which will become more tempting still once the re-sale market expands and portable telephone numbers are allowed. Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, insists the company has a masterly 'cable defence strategy.' He refused to give details yesterday but it appears to consist mainly of reminding deserters to other carriers of the virtues of being directly connected to the BT network.</p>

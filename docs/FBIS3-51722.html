			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Argentine Fishing Undersecretariat -- whose  head, Fernando Gutierrez, tendered his resignation two weeks ago  -- has been abolished.    This decision was made after a two-hour meeting between  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Felipe Sola, the  agriculture, livestock, and fishing secretary. This was  reported by Sola yesterday during a news conference.    The fishing functions will be exercised by the agriculture  secretary, supported by a group of advisers who will not exceed  the number of advisers already used by Gutierrez.    Sola will be supported by Felix Cirio, the under secretary  for agriculture and livestock production and markets, who will  replace incumbent Roberto Baltar in the Fishing Directorate, and  Agrarian Economy Under Secretary Jesus Leguiza, who will  contribute with statistical data on catches, fleets, and fishing  economic reviews. Sola said: "This point definitely represents  a weakness for us." [passage omitted]</p>

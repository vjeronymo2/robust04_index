			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / People: 'People motivator' for Extel Gavin Shreeve, formerly editor and publisher of The Banker magazine, has moved to Extel Financial in the newly created position of managing editor of the data products division. Extel, strong in the provision of securities data for back office funds valuation and administration, is this year moving into real-time prices, designed to take the Extel name into front office trading rooms at securities houses and fund management operation in the UK, continental Europe and North America. 'While Reuters prices at the level it does in the UK, there is a niche in the market for us,' according to Stuart Clark, director in charge of data products. Clark says the new role of managing editor is an amalgam of the posts of City editor, in charge of news gathering, and business operations manager. 'Gavin is a people motivator. He has a wide range of contacts. And he has the analytical skills. Ours has always been very much a culture of data collection, not analysis.' Clark also forecasts early changes in the news service - which has hitherto not shone. Shreeve moves after five years at The Banker, part of Financial Times Business Information, where he says his main contribution has been to make the magazine 'much more technical, as well as much prettier'. Like Shreeve, who had his own magazine Middle East Money before joining The Banker, the new editor, Australian Stephen Timewell, is also a Middle East specialist, with an MA in Middle Eastern studies Chicago University. The two know each other from days on Middle East Economic Digest and Timewell, having already been on The Banker two years, is keen to stress continuity. 'More on emerging markets and banking structures; and more listings and analysis,' he promises. ***** John Evans has been appointed managing editor of STANDARD &amp; POOR's Equity Information Services; Matthew Windridge, formerly head of research and strategy at Banque Paribas capital markets in London, has joined as director of research and strategy. ***** Brian Cooke, formerly director, investment services division at Extel Financial, has been appointed a director of ROLFE &amp; NOLAN, and president and ceo of Brokerage Systems Inc. ***** If proof is needed that running a City public relations firm is a high-risk affair, Keith Lewis, chief executive of Streets, Britain's second oldest public relations outfit, has been made redundant on the eve of the firm's annual Summer party for the financial press. Although he is not being replaced directly, many of his responsibilities have been taken over by David Millham, executive deputy chairman, who only joined Streets in April after he was made redundant from Shandwick, the world's biggest public relations firm which he helped found. Millham, who used to work with Lewis at the Financial Times, says that Lewis left after a policy disagreement with TKI, Streets' Dutch parent. ***** Leopold Joseph, the small London merchant bank, has appointed Sir Charles Frossard as a non-executive director and deputy chairman of its Guernsey operations, Leopold Joseph Holdings (Guernsey) Limited. The chairman of the Guernsey bank is Sir George Blunden, and Leopold Joseph boss Robin Herbert says the two know each other well. Sir Charles, who is 70, retired, after ten years as Bailiff of Guernsey, in February. 'His extensive knowledge of the Channel Isles will be a great help to our business,' says Herbert. ***** Chris Tappin, formerly chairman and chief executive of SPIRAX-SARCO ENGINEERING, is now executive chairman and Tim Fortune (below left) has been promoted to group md. Chris Ball, Graham Marchand and Marcus Steel have been appointed directors. ***** Simon Harris is leaving the board; David Meredith is promoted to director - finance and Peter Smith appointed company secretary. ***** Peter Quast (below right) has been promoted to md of REDIFFUSION SIMULATION, a subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft Company. ***** Douglas Cuthbertson has been promoted to director of finance of NORTH HOUSING ASSOCIATION on the retirement of John Cassidy. ***** Christopher Dyson has been appointed director of selling for THOMAS GOODE.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: CHANGING OF GUARD AT HOMEFED CORP.  </P> <P> HomeFed Corp. President Robert F. Adelizzi has been named chief executive of  the savings and loan holding company, taking over day-to-day management from  Kim Fletcher, who will remain board chairman.  </P> <P> Adelizzi joined San Diego-based HomeFed, parent of HomeFed Bank, in 1962 and  has been its president since 1981.  </P> <P> In an interview, Fletcher said his primary reason for vacating the chief  executive's job at the $18-billion thrift is to give Adelizzi the opportunity  "to move up and assume more responsibility and be rewarded in title at the same  time."  </P> <P> "Bob has done an outstanding job as president and chief operating officer,"  Fletcher said. "We have worked together as a team for over 20 years, and it's  only right that he be given the recognition."  </P> <P> Fletcher, 62, said HomeFed has no mandatory retirement age and age was not a  factor in his decision to step down. He has been HomeFed chairman since 1979  and chief executive since 1969. CHRIS KRAUL  </P></p>

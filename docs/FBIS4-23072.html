			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B. M. Levin; UDC 621.396.67.01] </F>   [Abstract] An expression is derived which links the input  resistance of a symmetric two-sided slot antenna on a circular  infinitely long metal cone and the excited vertex with the input  resistance of a metal vibrator whose shape and dimensions  coincide with those of the slot. The input resistance of the  slot and metal vibrators on a cone and pyramid are calculated  with a method based on calculation of the wave resistance of a  homogeneous line of infinite length. A radiator placed along the  edges of a pyramid is easier to implement th an a conical  radiator in the shortwave range or at lower frequencies. The  conical and pyramidal radiators examined here have a constant  and purely active input resistance, which provides a high  matching level. If the radiator has finite dimensions, the range  of frequencies is limited, but still rather wide. Figures 4;  references 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

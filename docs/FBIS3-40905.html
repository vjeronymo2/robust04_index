			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received]  <H3>  Joint Statement by the President of the Russian Federation  and the President of the United States on Non-Proliferation of  Weapons of Mass Destruction and the Means of Their Delivery </H3>   [Text] President Yeltsin and President Clinton, during their  meeting in Moscow on January 14, 1994, agreed that the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their missile  delivery systems represents an acute threat to international  security in the period following the end of the cold war. They  declared the resolve of their countries to cooperate actively  and closely with each other, and also with other interested  states, for the purpose of preventing and reducing this threat.    The presidents noted that the proliferation of nuclear  weapons created a serious threat to the security of all states,  and expressed their intention to take energetic measures aimed  at prevention of such proliferation.    -- Considering the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of  Nuclear  Weapons as the basis for efforts to ensure the non-proliferation  of nuclear weapons, they called for its indefinite and  unconditional extension at conference of its participants in  1995, and they urged that all states that have not yet done so  accede to this treaty.    -- They expressed their resolve to implement effective  measures to limit and reduce nuclear weapons. In this  connection, they advocated the most rapid possible entry into  force of the START I and START II Treaties.    -- They agreed to review jointly appropriate ways to  strengthen security assurances for the states which have  renounced the possession of nuclear weapons and comply strictly  with their non- proliferation obligations.    -- They expressed their support for the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] in its efforts to carry out its safeguards  responsibilities. They also expressed their intention to  provide assistance to the agency in the safeguards field,  including through joint efforts of their relevant laboratories  to improve safeguards.    -- They supported the nuclear suppliers group, and agreed  with the need for effective implementation of the principle of  full-scope IAEA safeguards as a condition for nuclear exports  with the need for export controls on dual-use materials and  technology in the nuclear field.    -- They reaffirmed their countries' commitment to the  conclusion as soon as possible of an international treaty to  achieve a comprehensive ban on nuclear test explosions and  welcomed the decision to begin negotiations at the conference on  disarmament. They declared their firm intention to provide  political support for the negotiating process, and appealed to  other states to refrain from carrying out nuclear explosions  while these talks are being held.    -- They noted that an important contribution to the goal of  non- proliferation of nuclear weapons would be made by a  verifiable ban on the production of fissile materials for  nuclear weapons and by the most rapid conclusion of an  international convention to this effect with the widest possible  participation of states and on a non-discriminatory basis.    -- They agreed to cooperate with each other and also with  other states to elaborate measures designed to prevent the  accumulation of excessive stocks of fissile materials and over  time to reduce such stocks.    -- They agreed to establish a joint working group to  consider:    -- including in their voluntary IAEA safeguards offers all  source and special fissionable materials, excluding only those  facilities associated with activities having direct national  security significance;    -- steps to ensure the transparency and irreversibility of  the progress of reduction of nuclear weapons, including the  possibility of putting a portion of fissionable material under  IAEA safeguards. Particular attention would be given to  materials released in the process of nuclear disarmament and  steps to ensure that these materials would not be used again for  nuclear weapons.    -- The presidents also tasked their experts to study options  for the long-term disposition of fissile materials, particularly  of plutonium, taking into account the issues of  non-proliferation, environmental protection, safety, and  technical and economic factors.    -- They reaffirmed the intention of interested organizations  of the two countries to complete within a short time a joint  study of the possibilities of terminating the production of  weapon-grade plutonium.    -- The presidents agreed that reduction of the risk of theft  or diversion of nuclear materials is a high priority, and in  this context they noted the usefulness of the September 1993  agreement to cooperate in improving the system of controls,  accounting, and physical protection for nuclear materials. They  attached great significance to further joint work on the  separate but mutually connected problems of accounting for  nuclear materials used in the civilian an military fields.    Both presidents favored a further increase in the efforts to  prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons.    -- As the heads of the countries that have the world's  largest stockpiles of chemical weapons, they acknowledged  particular responsibility for eliminating the threat posed by  these weapons. In this context, they declare their resolute  support for the convention on the prohibition of chemical  weapons, and their intention to promote ratification as rapidly  as possible and entry into force of the convention not later  than 1995.    -- To promote implementation of a comprehensive ban on  chemical weapons, they welcomed the conclusion of the  implementing documents for the Wyoming memorandum of  understanding and agreed to conclude work in as short a time as  possible on the implementing documents for the bilateral  agreement on the destruction of chemical weapons.    -- The presidents reaffirmed their desire to facilitate the  safe, secure, timely, and ecologically sound destruction of  chemical weapons in the Russian federation and the United  States. The applauded the joint chemical weapons destruction  work plan recently concluded between the two countries which  leads the way for the united states to provide additional 30  million dollars in assistance to support an analytical chemical  laboratory in Russia to facilitate chemical weapons destruction.  The United States also agreed to consider appropriate  additional measures to support Russia's chemical weapons  destruction programme.    -- They reiterated the importance of strict compliance with  the convention on the prohibition of biological and toxin  weapons and of continued implementation of measures in  accordance with the Russian- American-British statement of  September 1992, which provides inter alia for the visits of  facilities and meetings between experts in order to ensure  confidence in the compliance with the convention.    -- They supported convening a special conference of the  states' parties to the convention on the prohibition of  biological and toxin weapons in order to consider measures that  would contribute to transparency and thereby confidence in  compliance with the convention and its effectiveness.    The presidents expressed the determination of their  countries  to cooperate with each other in preventing the proliferation of  missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction.    -- They welcomed the conclusion of the bilateral memorandum  of understanding between the Government of the Russian  Federation an the Government of the United States of America  signed in September 1993, noted the importance of this agreement  for ensuring mutually beneficial cooperation between Russia and  the U.S. in the field of space exploration, and agreed to  collaborate closely in order to ensure its full and timely  implementation.    -- The U.S. welcomed Russia's intention to join the Missile  Technology Control Regime [MTCR] and undertook to cooperate with  Russia in facilitation of its membership at an early date. The  Russian Federation and the United States of America are certain  that further improving the MTCR, including the prudent expansion  of membership, will help reduce the threat of proliferation of  missiles and missile techologies in the regional context as well.    The presidents of the two countries agreed that, in addition  to strengthening global norms of non-proliferation and working  out agreements to this effect, close cooperation is essential in  order to develop policies on non-proliferation applicable to  specific regions posing the greatest risk of proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.    -- They agreed that nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula  would represent a grave threat to regional and international  security, and decided that their countries would consult with  each other on ways to eliminate this danger. They called upon  the DPRK to honour fully its obligation under the Treaty on the  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its safeguards  agreement with the IAEA in connection with the treaty, and to  resolve the problems of safeguards implementation, inter alia,  through dialogue between IAEA and DPRK. They also urged full and  speedy implementation of the joint declaration of the ROK and  the DPRK on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.    -- They support efforts to reach agreement on the  establishment of a multi-lateral forum to consider measures in  the field of arms control in non-proliferation that could  strengthen security in South Asia. They call on India and  Pakistan to join in the negotiation of and become original  signatories to the treaty banning nuclear weapons test  explosions and the proposed convention to ban production of  fissile materials for nuclear explosives and to refrain from  deploying ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of  mass destruction to each other's territories.    -- They agreed that Russia and the U.s., as co-chairs in the  Middle East peace process, would actively promote progress in  the activity of the working group for arms control and regional  security in the Middle East, striving for speedy implementation  of confidence-building measures and working toward turning the  Middle East into a region free of weapons of mass destruction,  where conventional forces would not exceed reasonable defense  needs.    -- They firmly supported the efforts of the UN special  commission and the IAEA to put into operation a long-term  monitoring system of the military potential of Iraq, and called  upon Iraq to comply with all UN Security Council resolutions.</p>

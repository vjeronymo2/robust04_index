			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Michio Sakamura] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 6 May -- It has been learned that the  Taiwan Government has proposed to the Japanese Government that  it put into effect voluntary export restraint (VER) for Taiwan  in return for Taiwan's liberalization of automobile imports from  Japan. In a bid to join the General Agreement of Tariff and  Trade [GATT], Taiwan has held trade talks with its trading  partners to discuss reducing its import ban items, and it is the  first time that Taiwan has put forth a concrete step to relax  import regulations. The Japanese Government, however, is  reacting against the Taiwan offer, claiming that "the VER runs  counter to the basic principle of GATT" (according to the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry). Hence, Japan and  Taiwan are likely to face rough sailing in their trade talks.    At present, Taiwan allows only the import of Japanese-built  automobiles with more than 3,000-cc engine displacement which  are not built in that country. For this reason, Japanese  automakers have formed joint ventures with Taiwan automakers for  local production of automobiles or exported their automobiles  built at their plants in the United States to Taiwan. In Taiwan,  the demand for Japanese-built cars has been growing and it is  highly possible that Taiwan's full liberalization of automobile  imports from Japan will deal a blow to the Taiwan automobile  industry. For this reason, the Taiwan Government intends to  protect the domestic automobile industry by asking the Japanese  Government to adopt the VER which sets the total number of  Japanese-built automobiles to be exported to Taiwan.    The Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs held a meeting with  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo in  late April at which the Taiwan side expressed a willingness to  allow Japanese automakers to make phased exports of small  Japanese-built automobiles with about 2,000-cc engine  displacement to Taiwan. The Taiwan side, however, proposed that  Japan apply the same VER and the same import monitoring system  to Taiwan as it does to the United States and the EU in return  for the trade concession. As measures for the phased exports of  small Japanese-built automobiles, the Taiwan side proposed that  the rate of tariffs for them be set in two categories and a  "tariff quota formula" that restricts the import of low-tariff  Japanese-built automobiles be introduced.    The Japanese Government takes the position that the VER is  incompatible with the objective of GATT, but it plans to decide  on its stand while examining the "tariff quota formula."    In an attempt to join GATT, Taiwan has held trade talks with  its trading partners to discuss ways to open its market. It is  now examining the possibility of freeing Japanese firms from the  ban on their participation in bidding for construction projects  for nuclear power plants and steel plants.</p>

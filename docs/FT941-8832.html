			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixed feelings on German rate cut prospects There were mixed feelings about today's Bundesbank meeting, some dealers around Europe talking about the possibility of a German rate cut and others, particularly the French, almost giving up on the prospect after a four months' wait, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Reinhard Fischer, a partner at Research Vision in London, agreed that the current consensus was against a rate cut today, observed that the Bundesbank had managed to wrong-foot the markets about 80 per cent of the time, and argued in favour of the proposition, as follows: German inflation was down, with a year-on year figure of 3.5 per cent in January against a 3.8 per cent average for the final quarter of 1993; Buba has said that the German recession is not over yet; There was a 'window of opportunity' in the currency markets, with the D-Mark strong against the dollar in the aftermath of the US/Japanese trade talks collapse; and There were indications that German M3 is slowing after its seemingly inexorable growth in 1993. Admittedly, said Mr Fischer, there was no clear evidence yet of the M3 slowdown; the German repo rate, so often an indicator of key rate cuts, was firmly cemented at 6 per cent; and there was the possibility of industrial strife, particu-larly in Germany's metal based industries. However, he said, the balance of argument was in favour of a cut, especially since the next Buba meeting, on March 3, fell just ahead of the first of 19 election dates for various constituencies and groups to be held in Germany this year. FRANKFURT consolidated Tuesday's post-bourse gains on the interest rate theme and added a little more, the Dax index closing up 20.99 at 2,136.61, or 5.90 ahead of the previous afternoon's level; the post-bourse yesterday was relatively quiet. Turnover rose from DM6.7bn to DM8.6bn. Front-line interest rate sensitive stocks rose in echelon, led by Deutsche Bank, up DM20.50 at DM829.50, and Dresdner, DM12.80 better at DM422.80, although utilities seemed relatively subdued. In carmakers, Volkswagen was relatively weak, closing 50 pfg lower at DM445.50 after Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the company's senior debt. PARIS reflected the view that hopes for interest rate cuts today had all but evaporated, although there remained a few who still believed that the Bank of France might move independently and shave a quarter of a percentage point off domestic rates. The CAC-40 index improved 6.35 to 2,264.32 in below average turnover of FFr4.5bn. Rhone-Poulenc added FFr2.20 to FFr150.40 in spite of reporting profits at the lower end of most analysts' expectations. The recently privatised chemicals and pharmaceuticals company also said that it did not expect a significant recovery in profits before 1996. ZURICH extended its blue chip recovery, the SMI index rising 43.1, or 1.4 per cent to 3,033.4. Banks were lifted by SBC's 36 per cent rise in 1993 profits which exceeded analysts expectations and took SBC bearers up SFr16 to SFr506. Ciba bearers were relatively weak, rising only SFr2 to SFr910 on the news that Pharma Vision, the investment fund, might sell its stake in the company. AMSTERDAM moved higher for the second day in succession with Hoogovens advancing Fl 2.10 to Fl 63.40 on news that it had been exempted from fines imposed by the EU on a number of steel manufacturers for operating a cartel. The AEX index finished up 1.71 at 431.61. Fokker drifted down a further 80 cents to Fl 20.70, up from a session low of Fl 19.70, in further reaction to its planned job cuts. MILAN saw a build up of volume towards the close but general activity throughout the session remained subdued. The Mibtel index put on 39 to 10,771 . Montedison attracted attention and the shares closed L58 higher at L1,179, although traders were unable to report specific news that could have warranted buying. Fiat was another of the day's risers, up L97 at L4,800 in spite of a Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade of its commercial paper. STOCKHOLM saw Ericsson Bs rise SKr18 to SKr360 after gains on Wall Street, and the Affarsvarlden General index put on 23.40, or 1.5 per cent at 1,435.10. OSLO was lifted by gains abroad, general optimism on the Norwegian economy and two more gold medals at the Lillehammer Olympics, the all-share index rising 10.56, or 1.6 per cent to 678.50. ATHENS rallied after three consecutive losses, investors betting that the government would not make changes at the National Economy ministry where the minister, Mr George Yennimatas, is facing health problems. ISTANBUL saw a further 8 per cent gain to bring its rise on the week so far to 27 per cent. The composite index added 1,247.83 to 17,681.32. Brokers remarked that a semblance of stability had returned to the currency markets, helping to inject a note of optimism. Turnover was down to TL899bn after Tuesday's TL1,259bn.

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Handicap of mutuality Sir, The managing director of the National Mutual Life Assurance Society advances (Letters, September 9) 'a very strong argument' for mutuality, viz. that mutual offices do not have to pay dividends to shareholders. If the argument had validity one would expect to find (which one does not) that mutual offices can offer better terms, or show more favourable maturities for with-profit policyholders than proprietary companies. Can it be that the managements of mutuals are less effective precisely because they lack the stimulus of being directly answerable to shareholders? There has been more than one case in recent years of a rescue operation mounted to protect a mutual office's policyholders from jeopardy. It is virtually impossible to devise a voting structure for mutual offices which fairly reflects the diverse interests of policyholders. Moreover such offices are unable to finance expansion by the issue of equity capital, which is a serious disadvantage for all but the largest mutual offices. Mutuality is a mixed blessing for building societies and is a positive handicap for life offices and their policyholders. Ralph Instone, 18 Fairacres, Roehampton Lane, London SW15 5LX</p>

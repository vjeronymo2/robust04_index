			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Man in the News: White mayor's burdens - Richard Riordan Richard Riordan, the financier and property developer elected mayor of Los Angeles this week, has been described as 'LA's version of Ross Perot'. A multi-millionaire who has never held public office, Riordan spent Dollars 6m of his personal funds to sell himself to LA voters. Like Perot, Riordan won votes by promising to apply his business skills to create jobs and improve the economy. Unlike Perot, however, Riordan must now move beyond criticising the political establishment and demonstrate his ability to use his office, rather than his money, to influence events in the second-largest US city. His personal wealth of about Dollars 100m has been derived from investment banking and property after he was left Dollars 80,000 by his father, a New York Irish immigrant who became a department store president. Riordan was the youngest of eight children, and graduated from Princeton with a degree in philosophy and Michigan with a law degree. He moved to LA in 1956 to work for a law firm. By 1984 Riordan had formed an investment banking firm with two partners, and was on the board of Mattel, the toymaker, which faced insolvency when the video game market crashed. He was a leader of a group of investors which bailed out the company in a Dollars 200m-plus buy-out. About 800 Mattel workers in southern California lost their jobs when their factory closed. Riordan netted an estimated profit of at least Dollars 20m. The problems he faces as mayor could dwarf his former business challenges. Next month, he will take over the leadership of a city still scarred by last year's riots, bristling with racial tensions and struggling to boost its flagging economy. Riordan's first priority must be to repair the damage of a bitter and divisive election campaign. Although he won 56 per cent of the votes cast in Tuesday's election, his supporters were predominantly white, suburban and affluent. He won 67 per cent of the white vote, but only 14 per cent of the black vote, according to a poll by the Los Angeles Times. Among Asian-Americans, 31 per cent chose Riordan; and 43 per cent of Hispanics voted for him. Former business associates disagree that Riordan played on the fears of white voters, accentuating racial tensions. 'I've known Dick for 20 years, and he is conservative on some issues but a social liberal on others. He will represent all the people of Los Angeles,' said Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. Riordan pledged on Wednesday to 'unite Los Angeles', but minority groups remain sceptical. 'I'm not particularly optimistic,' said Dolly Gee, co-chairman of Asian Pacific Americans for a New LA, a coalition of Asian community groups. 'Other than his recent attempts to appeal to community groups, he does not have much of a track record on being involved in the poorer sections of the community.' While acknowledging Riordan's philanthropy, Ms Gee said: 'Giving money to charitable groups is not synonymous with having an understanding of the problems.' The mayor-elect 'lacks hands-on experience in trying to unite the divergent interests of different segments of the community'. However, Riordan has tried to dispel concerns that Los Angeles will be governed by a 'group of white men in suits'. 'My administration will be made up of Democrats, Republicans and independents, people of every race, creed, colour and sexual orientation,' he said. His first appointment has been to name his business associate and campaign chairman, William Ward-law, who was also involved in President Bill Clinton's California campaign, to lead the effort to hire members of the new city administration. Others who might be involved include a handful of minority supporters. In particular, Riordan must reach out to the black community, which solidly backed his opponent in the mayoral race, Michael Woo, a Chinese-American liberal. Riordan's ability to work with state and federal government will be crucial in his attempts to revive LA's economy. Despite having presented himself as a 'political outsider' during the campaign, his connections in Sacramento, the state capital, as well as in Washington, are already evident. On Thursday, Riordan met California governor Pete Wilson, a fellow Republican. LA's business community can be relied on to rally round the mayor-elect. 'We support his efforts to retain jobs, not raise business taxes, and increase the number of police officers on the street,' said Mr Remy. Yet even Riordan's supporters question whether his business skills can solve LA's problems. Mr Remy notes: 'It is one thing to negotiate to buy a building or a parcel of land and quite another to deal with the intricacies of city, state and federal politics. That can be very frustrating.' Nor does the business community wholeheartedly support one of the main planks of Riordan's election campaign - a plan to privatise such city services as rubbish collection and to lease the Los Angeles International airport to private operators to raise funds to pay for 3,000 extra police officers. It already appears that Riordan may have to find other ways to fulfil his campaign promise to expand the police force, thus reducing crime and attracting business. Raising taxes might not be the answer, as this could alienate important Republican supporters. The question is whether Riordan, the businessman, can become Mayor Riordan, the political consensus builder. 'Dick has not been outside the political process, he has been a close observer through his many dealings with the city,' says Mr Remy. Indeed some regard him as the 'consummate insider'. 'He is a political power broker who has exerted his influence through political contributions,' says Ms Gee. As mayor, Riordan will have a forum but few funds. His immediate problem will be to attract state and federal money to resolve the city's looming Dollars 500m budget deficit. He will be judged, however, on his ability to win the support of those who either didn't vote for him, or didn't vote at all.</p>

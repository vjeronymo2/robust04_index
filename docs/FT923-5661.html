			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / World looks to shouting Panic: The Serbian leader must now deliver MR Milan Panic did a lot of shouting at the London conference on the former Yugoslavia this week. He shouted at the participants, he shouted at the press, and he shouted at Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia. But those who know him say this stems from his frustration about what is happening to Serbia, his place of birth. As prime minister of the unrecognised Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, Mr Panic, a millionaire who emigrated to the US three decades ago, is desperate to bring Serbia out of its isolation. The only obstacle is Mr Milosevic. When he was appointed by Mr Milosevic last July, it was rumoured that the Serbian president would use Mr Panic. 'Milosevic thought Panic would get Serbia off the hook, lift the United Nations sanctions without doing anything substantial, and at the same time keep Milosevic in power,' said a Serbian journalist. 'He was mistaken', he added. Since July, Mr Panic has chiselled away at the constitutional powers of the Serbian president through moving them out of Mr Milosevic's influence and enhancing the Yugoslav federal institutions. For instance, Mr Panic is now defence minister of the Yugoslav federal forces. Last week, he replaced Mr Mihalj Kertes, the federal deputy interior minister responsible for the ethnic cleansing of Croats in the Serb-controlled northern province of Vojvodina. At the London conference, Mr Panic matched theatre with substance. When Mr Milosevic attempted to speak, Mr Panic interrupted saying he was more entitled to represent the Yugoslav state. As Mr Milosevic growled throughout the conference, Mr Panic promised UN and EC officials that he would comply with all the documents agreed at the conference. More than that, he said that if Mr Milosevic did not implement the conference agreements, he would sack him: 'I expect Mr Milosevic to comply - or else]' The question is whether Mr Panic can deliver both at home and abroad. He has to convince Serbs that his policies will lead to the lifting of sanctions. To achieve this, he will need the support of the Serbian media, which is under the control of Mr Milosevic. He will also need public opinion behind him. But people are resentful of the international community placing all the blame on Serbia, and none on Croatia. The media is crucial. Mr Panic will have to use it to persuade Serbs it is in their interests to accept the return of autonomy to the ethnic Albanians, and dilute the prejudice and hatred fuelled by nationalism. Earlier in the week, Mr Panic met Mr Ibrahim Rugova, president of Kosovo, and reassured him, that, unlike Mr Milosevic, he would accept the mediation of the London conference to negotiate the future status of ethnic Albanians. If the UN and EC are placing some of their hopes for stability in the Balkan peninsula in Mr Panic, in return, Mr Panic wants support from them. He wants the Serbs, particularly in Croatia, to be granted ethnic rights and autonomy. But what he eventually wants is the recognition of a Yugoslav state, free of sanctions and back in the international fold. Yesterday, a British official said no one republic could be the legal successor to the former Yugoslavia. 'It will have to be negotiated by all the former republics,' he said. Besides, he added, 'Panic has to deliver the goods.'</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Tennis: Top tipster by a distance ADRIAN COOK first, the rest nowhere. That was the outcome of the Racing Post's 1991 national tipsters' competition in which Cook, who tips for the Post under the nom de course Diomed, won a Pounds 2,100 prize by giving 2,015 winners from 6,390 tips (strike rate: 31 per cent). All tipsters had a bank of Pounds 1,200 to play with. When Cook was profiled in the Weekend FT five weeks ago, he was Pounds 178 clear of his nearest rival. By year's end, Cook had stretched that lead to Pounds 200, finishing with Pounds 900 in the bank. The 25 per cent reduction in Cook's original bank (from Pounds 1,200 to Pounds 900) is a perfect measure of how difficult it is to make betting pay when confronted by high commercial rake-offs. The competition's runner-up was Robin Goodfellow of the Daily Mail (Pounds 700). The worst performers were Templegate of the Sun (Pounds 382) and Man on the Spot of the Sporting Life (Pounds 281). Cook, 38, said this week that his favourite races for tipping purposes were eight to ten-runner middle-distance handicaps, both on the Flat and over jumps. His worst: sprint handicaps. Essential information: Cook himself bets only once a year or so. He thinks it is a mug's game.</p>

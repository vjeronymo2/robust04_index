			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Scapa hits Pounds 22m and buys French tape maker Scapa Group, the industrial materials group which mainly supplies the paper industry, yesterday announced a European acquisition, a second enhanced scrip dividend and an 11 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.2m. The group is buying Barnier, a French specialist tape manufacturer, from the Borden Group in a deal worth Pounds 20m. The Blackburn-based company said this developed its strategy of building a substantial international business in specialist tapes. Barnier, which exports a third of its products, last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m on sales of Pounds 25m. Scapa, which entered the speciality tapes market in 1986, has since made acquisitions in the UK, France and Italy. The Barnier acquisition will be funded from Scapa's existing cash resources. Barnier, founded in 1917, employs 260 people and has two manufacturing bases in Valence, France, with further sales and distribution operations in Dusseldorf and Barcelona. Mr Harry Tuley, Scapa's chairman, said: 'Annual turnover from our specialist tapes businesses will now be in excess of Pounds 70m, making us one of the largest manufacturers of specialist adhesive tapes in Europe.' Group sales for the six months to September 30 rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 187.2m. Scapa said only five percentage points of that was organic growth, the rest coming from acquisitions and the effect of foreign currency translation. Earnings per share increased to 6.1p (5.7p) and the interim dividend is lifted from 1.6p to 1.65p. Scapa is again offering an enhanced scrip worth 2.475p, an increase of 50 per cent over the cash dividend. BZW is offering a cash alternative worth at least 2.426p, worth 98 per cent of the enhanced scrip. Mr Tuley said Scapa had made a second enhanced scrip issue because the group could still profitably employ the cash saved in the business, but the board would not seek to renew the authority for issuing enhanced scrip dividends next year. The chairman said the results demonstrated Scapa's resilience against a background of continuing economic recession in its main markets, and the group had increased market share. The extended recession had been coupled with continuing problems of over-capacity in the paper industry in both western Europe and the US. Scapa is about to open a new plant for engineered fabrics in Malaysia, the group's first factory in its rapidly growing markets of south-east Asia.</p>

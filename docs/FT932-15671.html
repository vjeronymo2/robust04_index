			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Cigarettes burn top-brand consumer stocks - Wall Street WALL STREET'S love affair with brand-name consumer stocks ran on to the rocks this week. On Monday and Tuesday, heavy selling hit a wide range of consumer issues which, in turn, lopped a few points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The spark for the sell-off was the surprise decision by food and tobacco group Philip Morris to cut the price of its top branded cigarettes, Marlboro. in an attempt to win back customers lost to cheaper brands. Investors were unnerved by the move because it showed thatan industry-leading company recognised that top-brand goods can lose market share to much cheaper brandless products. For the best part of a decade, investors have supported brand-name consumer stocks on the premise that these companies could maintain earnings growth by raising the prices on their best-known products - which, supposedly, were immune from competition from discounters because massive promotion and a strong, well-established image had guaranteed consumer loyalty. However, recent experience with the world's best-selling cigarettes, seems to have shattered that illusion. With smokers switching from Marlboro to discounted generic brands in increasing numbers, Philip Morris was forced to do something to stem its loss of market share. Other than spending even more on advertising and promotion, its only choice was to cut the price of Marlboro. This momentous decision left investors reeling: if it could happen to Marlboro, arguably one of the world's most famous products, it could happen to any other brand name. Consequently, they wasted no time in selling stocks such as Colgate-Palmolive, Heinz, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kellogg, Campbell Soup and Coca-Cola. So unsettled were investors that they unloaded a wide range of consumer-related stocks including retailers such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Sears, Roebuck. Wal-Mart appeared to be a particularly unfortunate victim, given its remarkable recent earnings growth and solid prospects. However, there was some logic to the sell-off. Wal-Mart's February same-store sales figures were disappointing; Home Depot was looking extremely expensive with a price-earnings ratio of almost 60; and Sears' shares had enjoyed an excellent run of late on recovery hopes and were probably due to take a breather. Such explanations aside, however, the heavy selling still was unnerving. The brand-name consumer stocks and fast-growth discount retailers have been a mainstay of the market for years. Any substantial reversal in this stalwart group could mark a big turning point in the market's longer-term prospects. Fortunately, when investors rushed out of consumer stocks, their money did not leave the market altogether. Funds were switched to other sectors. This week, it was the turn of cyclicals, cars, timber and transportation stocks to benefit. Cyclicals were an obvious choice for investors suddenly disenchanted with consumer stocks. The economy continues to grow at a solid, if unspectacular, pace and the likes of Caterpillar, International Paper and Alcoa should churn out good earnings over the next year or so as the pace of business activity across the country, and eventually overseas, picks up. Likewise, car-makers. Over the past few months, there has been a growing feeling of confidence in the big three - a sense that all of them have turned a corner. It is no surprise that, as of Thursday, Ford shares were standing at a 52-week high while Chrysler and GM were within spitting distance of similar peaks. While forestry product stocks may have been something of a cyclical play, they drew most of their strength this week from the so-called 'timber summit' meeting in Oregon between the logging industry and environmentalists, chaired by a consensus-seeking President Clinton. Although the summit failed to heal the divisions between the two sides, investors were cheered by reports that the president probably will avoid any initiatives that might depress timber industry profits. Finally, airline stocks had an excellent week. All the major carriers posted big gains, in the process lifting the Dow Jones Transportation Average to a record. Several factors were behind the buying. One was United Airlines reporting a 17.4 per cent jump in March passenger traffic and also announcing big cuts in capital spending. There was also news from Washington DC that a joint committee of congressional and presidential experts is to investigate ways to help the industry survive its seemingly never-ending crisis.  -------------------------------------------- Monday          3379.19   +    8.38 Tuesday         3377.57   -    1.62 Wednesday       3397.02   +   19.45 Thursday        3396.48   -    0.54  --------------------------------------------</p>

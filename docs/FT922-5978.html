			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Kabul leader may stay on AFGHAN interim President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi yesterday hinted that he might not step down when his two-month term of office expires at the end of next month. Public demand, he said, might require him to continue. His remarks come at a time when Afghans are debating whether the continuation of his term would promote peace in the embattled country. Under current arrangements, he is due to hand over to a new administration prior to national elections. In Islamabad on the second day of a visit to Pakistan Mr Mojaddedi said many were asking him to remain, though it was not his intention to stay on for as long as two years. Afghan mujahideen guerrillas who took power in Kabul late last month may have killed and tortured dozens of former government officials and security force members, Amnesty International said yesterday, Reuter reports from London. Amnesty, the London-based human rights organisation, said it had received unconfirmed reports of guerrillas killing up to 40 security force members who had been taken prisoner on April 30.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour party sets up policy reviews THE Labour party's ruling National Executive Committee yesterday agreed to set up internal working parties to examine its policies on Europe and constitutional reform. The NEC settled terms of reference and part of the membership of the first two 'policy commissions', established under the party's new scheme for scrutinising each area of its appeal to voters. The brief given to the group conducting a review of policy on Europe and the European Community, is 'to review and prepare proposals on Labour's policies and approach on the European Community and on the wider issues relating to Europe as a whole'. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, who switched party policy from wishing to withdraw from the EC to favouring full participation in Europe, will be one of the review group members. The second group, dealing with constitutional reform, will consider such issues as how to provide the best protection for fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, and how to reflect regional aspirations. Its proposals should aim to ensure policies 'consistent with (Labour's) fundamental objectives of securing fairness, social justice and individual liberty for all people in equal measure, and achieving a wider, more open democracy'. Both groups have been told to produce their first report by next April, when they will be considered by the new National Policy Forum, an elected body representing all sections of the Labour party. The Conservative party received more than Pounds 2.8m in donations from British industry in 1991, according to a Labour survey published yesterday. According to the survey of the 1991 annual reports of around 1,500 businesses, 171 companies gave a total of more than Pounds 2.8m in direct donations to the Tory party, an increase of more than Pounds 220,000 on the previous year. The biggest single donation, of Pounds 130,000, was made for the second year running by United Biscuits, which increased its donation by more than 16 per cent. It was one of five donors that gave more than Pounds 100,000.</p>

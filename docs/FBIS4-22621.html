			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Kvyatkovskaya, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA </F> correspondent: "Elected Somewhat Dishonestly..."]    [Text] The silence of the mass media on the subject of the  past elections does not at all mean that the subject has been  settled and that people are satisfied with the very peculiar  Central Election Commission interpretation of the concept of  democracy. Up to the present time, many of the candidates whose  civic equality was infringed are attempting to defend their  constitutional rights, legality, and justice with the help of  the Procuracy in people's courts and the Constitutional Court.  But the voters are supporting those who despaired, got tired,  and understood the lack of promise of these efforts with  sympathetic and stimulating telephone calls; they say, after  all, we believed in you, and we participated in the elections  only for your sake...    Popular wisdom says that a drop of water grinds a stone.  And,  apparently, the people in their wisdom are always correct.  Because a miracle almost happened: In the end, the people's  court in one election district declared the elections invalid.    This is a precedent, and it is worth discussing in greater  detail. It seems that back on 9 March the Tyulkubas District  commission for District No. 134 composed an act that declared  the elections in the district invalid. It checked for two days  the statement of candidate M. Mermankulov concerning a  prejudiced attitude toward him on the part of precinct  commissions in Kazgurtskiy Rayon and established that actually  in their calculations the precinct commissions reduced the  number of votes given to him in one case by 21, in another--by  39, and in a third--by 17, etc. This was verified in a spot  check with the opening of a package of ballots of a total of six  precincts, and in all six similar "reductions" were permitted;  moreover, not only were Mermankulov's votes reduced, but also  those of all the other candidates from the six who were running,  except for the deputy chief of the Kazgurtskiy Rayon  administration, A. Kubeyev.    The district commission did not begin to confirm whether  this  was done intentionally or accidentally, considering this not to  be in its jurisdiction. Therefore it limited itself only to the  direct guidance of Article 65 of the Code on Elections, which  concerns violations in vote counting--it declared the elections  invalid.    It must be assumed that this decision did not come easily to  the district commission.    From the information given by the district commission to the  people's court: "In a spot check opening of packages of ballots,  violations committed by precinct commissions in counting votes  were disclosed. In six precincts the number of votes given to  Mermankulov was artificially reduced almost by 180. Great doubt  was also raised by the fact that almost one-third of the ballots  were not folded in half before they were dropped into the ballot  boxes. For this, it was necessary to conduct a special expert  analysis. After discovering the indicated violations, the  district commission approached the Central Election Commission  for advice. A.I. Artamanov, secretary of the Central Election  Commission, proposed displaying more independence. After this,  the commission decided to declare the elections invalid and  refused to sum up the voting in the entire district..."    It is a great pity that such a clear indication of civic  courage becomes the property of the public only now, a month  after the peak of the events. Otherwise we would have long ago  been able somehow to get and publish the decree of the Central  Election Commission of 15 March. This decree has historical  significance for our young sovereign state, because it lays out  the "theory of partial pregnancy." The voter, after all, is a  crowd, a primitive mass, a woman can be pregnant or not  pregnant, and elections can be honest or falsified. But  according to the theory of the Central Election Commission, the  tally of votes can be not quite honest, with massive  falsifications, but at the same time not have an effect on the  election results. How is this? Here is a quotation from the  decree of the Central Election Commission:    "As the checkup showed, the precinct election commission  committed technical errors in counting the votes with respect to  all the candidates included on the voting ballot. However, they  did not influence the outcome of the elections.    "The Central Election Commission decrees:    "1. To cancel the decree of the district election commission  on the elections of deputies of the Supreme Council of the  Republic of Kazakhstan for the Tyulkubas Election District No.  134 'On Declaring the Elections Invalid.'    "2. To declare the elections in the Tyulkubas Election  District No. 134 of the South-Kazakhstan Oblast valid.    "To instruct the district election commission to sum up the  elections."    This long quote from the decree is given here especially so  that our reader can catch the iron character of the Central  Election Commission from its tone and style and its absolutely  firm will. Its decrees regarding the legally unregistered  candidates did not at one time distinguish themselves with such  firmness, and were only in the nature of a recommendation.    But now once again from the report of the district  commission  to the people's court: "The district commission responded to all  telephone instructions of the Central Election Commission to  tally the votes with a refusal. Only after written instructions  of the Central Election Commission of 15 March 1994, and under  pressure from the supervisory workers of the oblast  administration, did the district commission depart with its  materials to Kazgurtskiy Rayon, where in fact the precinct  commissions themselves were checking their own results of the  voting, and it is very difficult to make a judgment about their  objectivity. But it is on the basis of these results that the  summing up was not conducted until 17 March 1994."    Is it worth commenting on anything in this quotation? No.  After all, to the editorial staff the reader is not a primitive  mass at all. He will understand everything even without a  commentary. And he will reach his own conclusions.    We will only add a little information. The candidates whose  rights were infringed upon have filed a complaint against the  Central Election Commission with the soviet rayon people's court  of the city of Almaty under the chairmanship of I. Baygesiyev,  and the materials and circumstances of the elections in the  134th District have been examined. Many facts were revealed  indicating the ingenuity of the administration when it becomes  necessary to resolve problems in its own interests. For example,  elders came from the village of Sharankhan of Kazgurtskiy Rayon  and talked about the great "concern" shown for the villagers  during the elections. Just before the elections, members of the  precinct commission came to their village, went to all the  homes, and asked all the adults to sign lists of voters. At the  same time, they did not offer to fill out ballots. And they  explained that it would not be necessary to go to any elections  after this...    I think that it was not easy for Judge I. Baygesiyev to  reach  a decision on the elections in the 134th Election District.  However, could it have turned out any other way, given the  aforementioned testimony of the elders? Even under the heaviest  pressure? Probably not. Facts are a stubborn thing.    M. Mermankulov, who succeeded in making the first breach in  the blind wall of lies and illegality, is a former author of  KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA. He has written articles in the newspaper  about the need to establish a single investigative committee,  and he was and remains among those who are against corruption. I  wanted to meet with him and congratulate him on his victory. But  the meeting had to be postponed. After all, the decision of the  court on the invalidity of the results of the elections in the  134th District was adopted back on 5 April, but the Central  Election Commission has still not uttered even a sound in this  regard: It has not made a decision, it has not commented on the  case for the press, and it has not disclosed its own profound  feelings with respect to the falsifications.    Will the Central Election Commission suddenly ignore the  whole Tyulkubas story as if it did not happen? As it has until  now ignored many cases of violations of the law. We should  obviously wait a little before congratulations.</p>

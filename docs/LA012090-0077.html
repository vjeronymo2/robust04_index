			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP SOCCER ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ORANGE MAKES THINGS PERFECTLY CLEAR BY BEATING LAGUNA HILLS  </P> <P> Orange High School's 2-0 victory over host Laguna Hills in a boys' soccer match  Friday helped clear up what would have been a cloudy picture.  </P> <P> The victory improved Orange's record to 11-0-2 overall and 9-0 in the Pacific  Coast League. Laguna Hills, trying to gain a tie for the league lead, fell to  14-3, 7-2.  </P> <P> "We wanted to make that third-round game (against Orange Feb. 7) mean  something," Laguna Hills Coach Scott Johnson said.  </P> <P> Instead, the Panthers strengthened their hold on first place.  </P> <P> Tres Martin had 12 saves in recording his seventh shutout of the season for  Orange, ranked second in the Southern Section 2-A Division.  </P> <P> "We wanted to clinch league, go undefeated and beat them here," said Orange  halfback Ricky Heimer, who scored his ninth goal of the season. With 16 minutes  remaining, Heimer scored on a rebound of Tim Huhn's shot.  </P> <P> Huhn accounted for the first goal when he broke free down the left sideline and  beat Laguna Hills goalkeeper Kirk Brown 13 minutes into the second half.  </P> <P> The assist went to Heimer, who predicted afterward: "We're going to win CIF,"  he said. "Righetti (ranked No. 1), forget it. They may as well go home."  </P> <P> For 50 minutes it looked as if both teams would go home empty-handed.  </P> <P> "You've got to be patient in a game like this," Heimer said. "If you wait for  it, it will come."  </P> <P> Said Martin: "The key was they (Orange's forwards) just kept on pushing it up  field and we got those breakaways."  </P> <P> Martin and Justin Zayas, a 5-foot-6 fullback, anchored a defense that shut down  Laguna Hills' leading scorer, Brian Slayback.  </P> <P> "They didn't take many shots that he (Martin) had to make great saves on,"  Orange Coach Ed Carrillo said. "And with Justin (Zayas) in back, we can attack  and push harder."

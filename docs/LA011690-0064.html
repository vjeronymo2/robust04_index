			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH FOR THE WINTER;  </P> <P> HUNTING: GENEROUS LIMITS, WARM WEATHER AND PRIVACY MAKE NORTHERN MEXICO A HAVEN  FOR AMERICAN DUCK HUNTERS.  </P> <P> The wake-up call comes at 4 a.m., and by 6:40, after more than 30 miles of dirt  roads and a few more miles by air boat, the duck hunters are in their blind on  Lobos Bay.  </P> <P> Fred Missildine, who has a shooting school at Sea Island, Ga., says, "Good  wind."  </P> <P> "Perfect," says Jack Jansma, a charter fishing-boat operator from Grand Rapids,  Mich.  </P> <P> The wind is from the west, behind the hunters, so the ducks, which land into  the wind, will hear the calls, see the decoys and fly straight into the guns,  out of the rising sun.  </P> <P> And here they come.  </P> <P> As they circle for their approach, Jansma notes that several are mergansers,  "less of a quality duck," he says. "Teals are much better table fare."  </P> <P> Missildine jokes that he is not so particular: "If it flies, it dies."  </P> <P> But he, too, is selective. In Mexico, one can afford to be. There are no other  hunters on the bay. They have thousands of ducks to themselves. They start  shooting at 6:46. At 8, outfitter-guide Frank Ruiz comes back in the air boat  to see how they're doing and collects 21 dead ducks drifting across the bay.  </P> <P> "You can shoot 30 (altogether)," Ruiz says. "I'll be back in a little while."  </P> <P> Missildine settles back into the blind.  </P> <P> "That's the first time I've ever heard anyone mention a limit in Mexico," he  says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BETTER ALL AROUND  </P> <P> More ducks. That is the primary reason some American duck hunters have  preferred to hunt in Mexico over the past decade. The limit is 15 a day, 45 in  possession. Compared to the ever-shrinking limits of four along the Pacific  Flyway and three on the continent's other three flyways, the Mexican limit is  quite liberal -- and, in some cases, loosely observed.  </P> <P> The season is about two months longer, until March 10. The last California  season closed Jan. 7.  </P> <P> The weather is better. In Mexico it's not necessary to be cold, wet and  miserable to be a duck hunter.  </P> <P> Finally, hunters can use lead shot anywhere, whereas in most areas of the  United States they are restricted to less-effective steel shot.  </P> <P> "But the Number 1 reason is, I get to shoot a lot," Missildine said. "I'd be  happy at home with 10 ducks, but I'm not going to pay $400 to go to Arkansas to  shoot three ducks.  </P> <P> "Also, you don't have the pressure here we have in the States. Back home, every  creek I go in, there's somebody hunting. You don't have any privacy anymore."  </P> <P> In California, according to the Department of Fish and Game, the sale of duck  stamps decreased from 123,376 in 1979 to 79,381 in '88. Most of the duck  hunting is at private clubs, about one-fourth on state-controlled refuges  limited to three days a week and an insignificant amount on what few public  wetlands have been spared by drought and development. Some hunters don't like  to be regimented, so they go to Mexico.  </P> <P> In Michigan, Jansma said, "We figure duck hunting has gone down by almost 50%.  The dedicated guys are still coming out, but it's disappointing."  </P> <P> Missildine is a crusty, lifelong hunter who has gone after ducks and doves all  over North, South and Central America, sometimes a step ahead of or behind a  revolution. He is a nonstop talker whose corny jokes fill the brief gaps  between incoming flights of birds.  </P> <P> El Salvador, he said, is "where two guys got on the bus with machine guns --  teen-agers -- just before the trouble broke out. That's why I quit going  there."  </P> <P> Missildine hunted in northern Rhodesia -- now Zimbabwe -- while a civil war was  boiling in southern Rhodesia. In other parts of Africa, he said, "I shot  everything," from lions to cape buffalo.  </P> <P> "What I like to shoot most is what I'm hunting," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MORE THE MERRIER  </P> <P> Today, it is ducks, and there are more available than can be found on most  traditional wetlands north of the border these days. That is why Missildine and  Jansma have been organizing groups of hunters from their areas to come to  Mexico for the last several years.  </P> <P> "Most of my people are middle class, who work all year and save their money to  come down here once a year," Missildine said. "It's worth it to them."  </P> <P> Ruiz is in his second year as an outfitter with his Gabino's Yaqui Valley  Hunting operation. He books duck-hunting packages through Jeri Booth's The  Detail Company in Houston. They range from $880 to $1,365, including room and  board but not air fare, and the more expensive trips include dove hunting as  well.  </P> <P> One misconception about duck hunting in Mexico is that the Mexicans are  slaughtering so many ducks, there are few left to migrate north to breed in the  spring -- hence the severe decline in duck hunting in the United States.  </P> <P> Ed Collins, a regional field biologist for the Western Regional office of Ducks  Unlimited in Sacramento, said: "That's not true. I've heard that for years and  years. You won't even find any Mexicans hunting.  </P> <P> "If there's any violation of the law, it's Americans that are going down there  and maybe over-bagging. But the Mexican take is really insignificant for North  America. About 75% of the harvested birds are U.S. birds. Canada gets like 12%,  and the remainder is Mexico.  </P> <P> "I've never heard from anyone that they thought over-bagging -- taking too many  birds in Mexico -- was (a factor) . . . although there are some poor sportsmen  that go down there and give a poor name to it."  </P> <P> Jansma said: "Some people may have the idea to come down here and shoot the  hell out of the resource . . . do everything you can't do up north. But no  sportsman that I know is that way."  </P> <P> The U.S. decline, according to Collins, is the result of a loss of nesting  water and good nesting cover in Canada.  </P> <P> "The Pacific Flyway always has a comfortable, healthy number of birds, although  we are affected by the continuing drought in Canada," Collins said. "It's been  going on for nine years.  </P> <P> "Where Mexico does need assistance . . . it's such a poor nation that they've  got wetlands areas they could do so much with but they don't have the money to  do it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> FINALLY, COOPERATION  </P> <P> A cooperative program among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ducks Unlimited  Mexico (DUMAC) and SEDUE -- Mexico's government wildlife service -- might help.  </P> <P> The North American Waterfowl Management Plan is a 15-year, $1.5-billion  agreement designed to restore the continent's waterfowl populations through  conservation of 6 million acres of key breeding, migration and wintering  habitat, which now is being destroyed at the rate of 450,000 acres a year. The  money may be spent in the United States, Canada or Mexico -- a major  breakthrough since previous law prohibited spending federal money on habitat  projects in other nations.  </P> <P> Gary Kramer of the USFWS, manager of the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge,  is the technical adviser to the plan for his organization.  </P> <P> Kramer said: "The fallacy is that the Mexicans are killing all our ducks. The  reality is that it's very difficult to own a firearm in Mexico because of very  stringent gun-control laws. It's much easier for us to get a hunting permit in  Mexico than it is for a citizen.  </P> <P> "You have to belong to a hunting club (and) it's very expensive."  </P> <P> Thus, nearly all of the ducks shot in Mexico are shot by Americans, who hunt in  the marshes of the northern states of Baja California, Sonora -- where Ciudad  Obregon is located -- and Sinaloa, along the Gulf of California. Kramer, who  has been studying Mexican waterfowl for 15 years, estimates that 40% of the  ducks are taken in Sinaloa.  </P> <P> "In all cases, we found that 93% to 99% of the hunters were from the U.S., with  the majority from California, Texas and Arizona," he said.  </P> <P> Americans are permitted to bring back up to 45 ducks each, but there is no  telling how many more are given to residents.  </P> <P> Kramer has persuaded 14 club operators in Sinaloa to provide accurate  information for the study.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to do is find out how many ducks are killed and how many  hunters there are," he said. "Nobody knows.  </P> <P> "As soon as duck populations started to decline, as they have in the last five  years -- primarily due to drought conditions in Canada -- the easiest thing for  anybody to do was to point the finger somewhere else. I've heard it a thousand  times: 'The reason our ducks are in such bad shape is they're going to Mexico  and getting slaughtered.'  </P> <P> "My gut reaction -- prior to data but after years of experience -- from a  biological perspective (is that) the total number harvested is relatively low.  I'll bet in the whole country of Mexico in a four-month season there are fewer  ducks killed than in the U.S. in the first few days of the season. But I don't  want to prejudge the study."  </P> <P> Also, Ruiz and others indicate that although the limit is high, with  enforcement low, only a minority of hunters abuse it. Most are willing to stop  at 15 -- or aren't good enough shots to get there.  </P> <P> Ducks do well in Mexico, Kramer said, because "the habitat loss along the West  Coast of Mexico has been very minimal."  </P> <P> "There have been some areas created and enhanced by the development of  agricultural areas. When things become irrigated, there is always runoff to the  coast, and along the way they overflow a ditch and create a marsh.  </P> <P> "Plus, with the advent of rice, which they started planting after World War II,  there are some additional food sources down there for the birds."  </P> <P> Ruiz, a longtime guide, is one of only three outfitters in Ciudad Obregon. The  three share dove-hunting areas but have exclusive rights to their duck-hunting  sites.  </P> <P> Ruiz, who spent three years at the St. Catherine's Military Academy in Anaheim,  is working hard to develop American trade.  </P> <P> He recently bought a 15-passenger, air-conditioned van, uses two-way radios  with a 50-mile range to keep in touch with his guides and the office from the  field, and not only serves as outfitter and guide but also as chauffeur and  breakfast, lunch and dinner host.  </P> <P> If there's a knock on your door at 3 a.m., it's probably Ruiz, raring to go.  </P> <P> "I get up at 3 a.m. every day during hunting season," he said. "That's 145 days  a year. If I'm not hunting, I'm scouting."  </P> <P> Last February, Ruiz hired a plane to scout areas near here and found thousands  of ducks in Lobos Bay to the west. The area had never been seriously hunted.  </P> <P> "I had to deal with eight different villages for exclusive rights," Ruiz said.  "We met every Sunday for six months with a different village."  </P> <P> His agreements include getting a villager's truck fixed and providing a  generator to supply electricity for 10 houses. This year, for the first time,  the houses had small displays of Christmas lights.  </P> <P> Ruiz and his hunters also may be helping the local economy by cutting down bird  depredation of the grain fields -- especially by doves.  </P> <P> "We grow 80% of the grain in Mexico right here in the Yaqui Valley," Ruiz said.  </P> <P> Whatever sesame seeds the birds don't get wind up on hamburger buns in the  United States.  </P> <P> "The farmers who plant sesame or sorghum, the doves are becoming predators to  them," Ruiz said.  </P> <P> So, in a departure from ducks one day, Ruiz positions Missildine and Jansma  between a large, brushy nesting area for mourning doves and a sesame field,  where the stalks are stacked in three-foot-high, cone-shaped piles -- an  irresistible free lunch for the birds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SAVING THE GRAIN  </P> <P> Then, shortly after dawn, here come the doves. The hunters are about to do the  farmers a favor.  </P> <P> Blam!  </P> <P> "These birds are eating the people's grain," Jansma said. "They have no  redeeming qualities as far as the agriculture people are concerned."  </P> <P> Blam!  </P> <P> "Two or three thousand birds eating two or three ounces apiece twice a day is a  lot of grain," Missildine said. "I've seen signs up in Argentina with a picture  of a paloma, saying, 'This is your enemy . . . kill him.' People don't realize  how much grain these birds carry off. They were on the point of poisoning them  in Argentina."  </P> <P> Blam!  </P> <P> Ruiz's bird boys are running nonstop to retrieve the kills. Ruiz opens the crop  of one bird to show a handful of sesame seeds.  </P> <P> "This is a mission," Jansma said jokingly. "I'm trying to get the church to  sponsor me."  </P> <P> Blam!  </P> <P> Ruiz, a crack shot, kills 49 doves in about two hours, Missildine and Jansma  "50 or 60" between them, but there are so many that they probably shoot only  one out of every few hundred that flew over, to and from the field.  </P> <P> "I shot 2,000 in two days in Argentina once," Missildine said.  </P> <P> Blam!  </P> <P> When they have finished, the ground is littered with hundreds of green plastic  shell casings. Ruiz has gone through "six or eight" 25-shot boxes of ammunition  and Jansma five. They keep a few birds for dinner and give the rest to local  residents -- thus, Missildine notes, nothing is wasted, and they contribute  protein to the Mexican diet.  </P> <P> Jansma prefers doves to ducks because there's more action.  </P> <P> With ducks, Ruiz said, "It's rare for a hunter to take 45 (back to the U.S.)  because there aren't that many good hunters. It's not as easy as this."  </P> <P> And whereas the doves fly without prompting -- even through the streets of  Obregon -- there are so few hunters that sometimes the ducks have to be stirred  up by buzzing them with an air boat to get them flying.  </P> <P> That's illegal in the United States, but a duck on the pond is not fair game.  The Mexicans don't like to discuss the practice but, as one said, "You have to  do it or the ducks won't move."  </P> <P> And if the ducks don't move, Missildine and the other Americans might as well  go home.  </P> <P> "When I go duck hunting, I like to shoot ducks," he said.  </P> <P> He has come to the right place.  </P></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Motor World advances Motor World Group, the car parts and accessories retailer floated last February, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.65m, against Pounds 2.29m, for the year to October 31. On a pro forma basis profits rose by 17 per cent, from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 3.9m. Motor World's shares, which rose sharply after being floated at 210p, yesterday closed 8p higher at 373p. Group sales grew by 15 per cent to Pounds 39.4m although the packaging and distribution division's turnover was flat at Pounds 9.8m. The retail division's sales at Pounds 29.6m were ahead 21 per cent, and operating profits rose by 32 per cent to Pounds 2.9m. This reflected increased customer spend per visit through intensive sales training, a full contribution from 34 branches acquired during the previous financial year, and sales from 28 branches bought during the period. Mr Darrell Kershaw, managing director, said the group was operating 201 stores by the end of October, and was on target to have 224 by the end of the current year, not including possible acquisitions. He looked forward to the coming year with 'quiet confidence'. Mr Kershaw saw good opportunities for growth of the group's core business by expanding into the south of England and Scotland, as well as further infilling its network in the north of England, the Midlands and Wales. Operating profits in the packaging and division slipped from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 1.2m as a result of poor demand from fast-fit retailers, the division's largest customers, but there was an increase in orders at the end of 1993. The group said marketing improvements and cost-savings should bear fruit in future years. Gearing at the year-end stood at 13 per cent, and is not expected to rise above 20 per cent. Pro forma earnings per share were 19.7p compared with 16p. A final dividend of 4.7p gives a total for the year of 7p.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE DELAYS DECISION ON CITY HALL LAYOFFS  </P> <P> The jobs of six Lawndale city employees are on the line this week as the City  Council attempts to cut $418,592 from the 1989-90 budget to hire additional law  enforcement workers to fight crime.  </P> <P> Councilmen Larry Rudolph and Harold E. Hofmann pressed for a council vote on  the layoffs Thursday night, but Mayor Sarann Kruse was able to muster three  votes to postpone a decision until the council meets in budget workshops this  week. Sessions are scheduled at 7 p.m. Monday and Thursday at City Hall.  </P> <P> Kruse said Friday that layoffs should be considered only as a last resort. "You  just don't cut jobs until you have tried everything else," she said.  </P> <P> Voting with Kruse were Councilwoman Carol Norman, who works for the city of  Hawthorne and is generally supportive of Lawndale's city staff, and Councilman  Dan McKenzie, a retired pipe fitter and union negotiator who sometimes is  critical of the staff. He said jobs should be the last thing to go in budget  cuts.  </P> <P> Many residents and city employees attended the emotional 5 1/2-hour meeting.  </P> <P> In a rare appearance before the council, elected City Clerk Neil K. Roth  challenged the proposed staff cuts, asking whether spending an additional  $400,000 more a year would make the city a safer place.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plea Against Layoffs  </P> <P> "If I didn't think the city of Lawndale was safe today, I'd be looking for  another place to live," he said.  </P> <P> James Belmore of the Lawndale Professional Mid-Management Employees Assn.  pleaded with the council not to impose the layoffs. "If you go to the grocery  store and you don't have enough money for all the things you want to buy, you  don't go home and kill the kids," he said, adding that city workers with as  much as 17 years' experience should be treated with "respect and  consideration."  </P> <P> Rudolph said Friday he was disappointed that the decision was put off. "If we  want to stick to what we said about hiring more deputies, we are going to have  to make some hard-core cuts," he said. "Nobody really wants to have to do it,  but the longer you wait the harder it gets."  </P> <P> The council on May 4 voted 4-1, with Norman dissenting, to ask for a staff  analysis of what cuts could be made in the $7.8 million 1989-90 budget to  contract for additional services from the Sheriff's Department, which patrols  Lawndale under contract with the city. It would cost $418,592 in the fiscal  year starting July to add two one-man patrol cars and two civilian workers, who  would take crime reports and perform other tasks to free uniformed officers for  crime control. The proposed budget includes $1.9 million to maintain the  current level of sheriff's services.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Kruse had presented a less costly plan that would provide six or  eight more civilian workers, instead of the two additional deputies and two  civilian workers. The Sheriff's Department is evaluating that plan, including  the amount of savings.  </P> <P> But Kruse's plan faces opposition from Rudolph, who said Friday he believes  gun-carrying, uniformed officers are needed to deal with Lawndale's crime and  gang problems.  </P> <P> Lawndale residents and businessmen have been complaining to the council about a  recent increase in graffiti, which indicates gang activity is on the upswing in  Lawndale, according to Sheriff's Capt. Walt Lanier.  </P> <P> He said in a recent interview that Lawndale's problem is not as serious as in  East Los Angeles or South-Central Los Angeles, but said action now could  prevent gangs from becoming entrenched in Lawndale.  </P> <P> A contingent of city employees, including most of those whose jobs are in  jeopardy, were in the audience Thursday as the council debated the layoffs. The  heated discussion went on for about an hour, with residents speaking on both  sides. Then, the council voted 3-2 to delay the decision until this week. Later  in the night, the council members returned to discuss Kruse's less costly  proposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Layoff Targets  </P> <P> The targeted employees are administrative analysts Marsha Schutte and  Grace-Marie Johnston, both 12-year employees; community safety officer Paul  Jordan, 17 years; community information officer Ken Huthmaker, eight years;  assistant planner Lola Unger, about two years, and one of the two  administrative assistants in the community development department, Valerie  Armstrong or Vivian Smith. Armstrong reportedly has quit already. The city,  with a population of about 26,000, has just under 60 employees.  </P> <P> Some residents and businessmen urged the council to make whatever staff cuts  are necessary to beef up the city's police protection. Jonathan Stein, a local  developer, said that a number of employees at City Hall perform "peripheral"  functions that could be eliminated.  </P> <P> "Do we owe a livelihood to these people at the expense of the whole town? I  think not," Stein said. "If we don't have safety in Lawndale, you don't have  anything."  </P> <P> Several Lawndale residents, including activists Nancy Marthens and Steve Mino,  said they do not want more deputies to be hired at the expense of city workers.  </P> <P> Pam Sturgeon, saying she was one of those who appealed for more deputies at a  meeting a few weeks ago, asked the council not to impose layoffs but cut  programs, as recommended by Assistant City Manager Paula J. Cone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reserve Fund  </P> <P> Cone reported that, by making program cuts and using its expected $200,000  reserve, the city could without any layoffs, come up with all but about $32,000  of the $418,592.  </P> <P> But Acting City Manager Jim Arnold, in a subsequent report recommending the six  layoffs, said it would be "completely unsound fiscally" to leave the city  without a reserve fund. "I have no choice other than to recommend to the City  Council specific program and personnel cuts to accomplish the council mandate  of increased law enforcement services."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ordeal of Public Debate  </P> <P> In an interview Friday, Kruse was critical of Arnold for making public his  layoff recommendation. He should have given the council a confidential memo  rather than put the six staff members through the ordeal of a public debate on  their jobs Thursday night, she said.  </P> <P> In an interview last week, Arnold said he is only following the direction the  council has given. "I'm cast as the big villain, but I'm not the one that voted  $419,000 for more cops," he said.  </P> <P> Kruse said the proposed cuts have been devastating to an already short-staffed  and overworked city staff.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 1/2-Hour Closed Session  </P> <P> "I'm surprised more people haven't walked out the door," she said. "You're  going to see a very big turnover at City Hall. Those people are going to leave,  and I think we are going to be hard-pressed to replace them. People are going  to be very leery about coming to work for Lawndale."  </P> <P> After midnight, the council went into a 2 1/2-hour closed session, where it  discussed problems in the Planning Department that had been the subject of an  emergency meeting Tuesday. Hofmann, Rudolph and McKenzie have charged that  planning staff is doing a poor job and has issued building permits for projects  that do not meet city codes.  </P> <P> After Tuesday's meeting, Rudolph said: "We should fire the whole Planning  Department."  </P></p>

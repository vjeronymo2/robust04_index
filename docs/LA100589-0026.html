			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> $90,000 GRANT ADDED FOR LANDSLIDE STUDY  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes will receive an additional $90,000 in federal funds to  expand a study intended to find ways to stabilize the coastline at the toe of  the Portuguese Bend landslide. City officials said the money is being included  in the 1989-90 federal budget.  </P> <P> Charles Abbott, a city public works consultant who is in charge of the  landslide project, said the $90,000 will be used by the Army Corps of Engineers  specifically to study of the effect of the landslide on marine life.  </P> <P> The corps is in the midst of a $250,000 study of four landslides that have hit  Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills. Begun a year ago, it focuses on what  causes the slides and how stopping shoreline erosion might affect them. Later  phases of the study may include devising a plan to protect the coastline.  </P></p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's output of crude to surpass UK NORWAY will overtake Britain as Europe's biggest crude oil producer this year, according to a report issued by Edinburgh-based County NatWest WoodMac (CNWM), writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Norway's average crude oil and natural gas liquids (Ngl) production will increase by 13 per cent over last year's level to 1.94m barrels a day. By comparison, this year Britain will produce an average of 1.85m barrels a day from offshore fields, a slight increase over the 1990 average level of 1.84m barrels. Britain's production is hindered by annual maintenance shutdowns in May and June and a loss of 200,000 barrels a day from the Brent field, where installation of subsea emergency shutdown valves is taking place. In the fourth quarter of this year Norwegian crude oil/Ngl production will surge to around 2.1m barrels a day, its highest level ever, forecast CNWM. This increase will stem from the coming on stream of the Oseberg North field, which will produce 100,000 barrels a day of crude oil.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Observer: Roger and out John Prescott, Labour's shadow employment secretary, has always been a bit special. When Observer was a ship's steward on the cross-Channel ferries in the 1960s, Prescott and his colleagues, criss-crossing the Atlantic serving gin and tonics on Cunard liners, were regarded with awe. Those were the days before seamen's strikes, when Cunard's catering staff were reputed to chuck the washing-up overboard if it was piling up too quickly in the galley. No doubt Prescott never took such short cuts, but he admits, in an interview in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, that he was twice charged with mutiny. Indeed, he claims that his mutinous activities led to a change in the regulations. 'If you are caught with a woman passenger, you are no longer charged with broaching ship's cargo,' boasts Prescott. Unfortunately, Cunard does not agree with its ex-employee's version of events. 'Not only do we not treat passengers as cargo, but only officers are allowed to mingle with passengers,' says Cunard. Back in your bunk, Prescott.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov, and KAZTAG </F> correspondent Marat Kaliyev]    [Text] Almaty March 9 TASS -- Observers from the delegation  of the parliamentary assembly of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the international electoral  systems foundation and a number of foreign countries, who  monitored the republic's election campaign and polling, drew a  categorical conclusion that, according to Western standards,  Monday's elections in Kazakhstan were accompanied with an array  of most flagrant violations in the procedure for a free  expression of people's will and, it means, the election results  should be recognised as invalid.    A list of election monitors' complaints, made available to  the KAZTAG news agency on Wednesday, includes ten main points.  Observers complained about the complexity of the republic's  candidates registration system, the existence of a state list of  contenders for parliament seats, the vagueness of the programmes  of many candidates, and their poor coverage in local news media.    A group of observers monitoring the work of the Central  Electoral Commission recognised it as unsatisfactory, listing as  inadmissible for pluralistic democratic elections such  irregularities as the casting of votes by one and the same  person for himself and his relatives, the delivery of  ballot-boxes to the homes of a number of voters, the lack of  guards at some polling stations.    Foreign monitors were particularly angered by the fact that  they were not given an opportunity to visit a number of military  facilities where polling took place. They believe could harbour  possibilities for various kinds of irregularities.    ITAR-TASS and KAZTAG correspondents requested commission  chairman Karatai Turysov to comment on foreign observers'  complaints. He said all the complaints are now being thoroughly  scrutinised and appropriate explanations will be given either  later on Wednesday or early on Thursday.    "Personally, I am not inclined to overdramatise the  situation  ," Turysov said. "when evaluating polling arrangements, one  should proceed from Kazakhstan's current realities. To ignore  them is to take a prejudiced position beforehand."    "Take, for example, voting on the state list. This procedure  was laid down by the previous self-dissolved parliament and to  ignore it would be a direct breach of the current legislation.    "The same can be applied to polling taking place in some  military units. Appropriate regulations for the guarding of  state secrets make particularly secret defence facilities off  limits to foreign observers. Polling there was personally  monitored by members of district electoral commissionsm,"  Turysov said.    Incidentally, many other foreign observers, who hold more  realistic positions -- those from France, Russia, Turkmenistan,  and a number of other countries -- are well aware of that.    French Ambassador Bertrand Fessard de Foucault told the  correspondents that he viewed arrangements for and the first  results of the elections as an obvious success of young  Kazakhstan democracy.</p>

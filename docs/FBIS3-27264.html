At present,  the situation of wheat production in our province is grim. In  more than 12 million mu of wheat fields across the province, the  condition of wheat seedlings is generally poorer than that last  year. The area of category-one seedlings has declined by 12.6  percent over the same period last year, 10 million mu of wheat  lack fertilizer, and the area of wheat hit by drought throughout  the province has reached 40 million mu. If appropriate measures  are not taken, a sharp decline in grain output will emerge in  summer this year.    The meeting pointed out: Now is the crucial season for wheat  field management, so various localities must seize this  opportune moment, mobilize the masses, and rapidly set off an  upsurge of wheat field management to bring about a change in the  condition of wheat seedlings. The meeting also called for all  localities to pay serious attention to major contradictions in  light of the prominent problems that exist in various kinds of  wheat fields. The fields that still need plowing, irrigating,  and top-dressing should be done properly, the practice of rigid  uniformity should be avoided, and efforts should concentrated on  enhancing the efficiency of field management.</p>

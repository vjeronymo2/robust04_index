			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures move wildly TRADING in both the sterling cash and futures markets gyrated wildly yesterday as the market tried to interpret what Germany's cut in interest rates implied for UK base rates. By the end of the day, the market had taken no firm view of whether UK base rates would rise or fall, and assumed that 10 per cent base rate would be unchanged. Sterling futures soared at the start of London trading yesterday as dealers waited for the promised cut in the Bundesbank's official interest rates. However, the announcement of a 0.25 percentage point reduction in the Lombard rate and a 0.5 percentage point lowering of the discount rate immediately depressed sterling contracts. 'The market had been expecting 75 basis points off the discount rate and was disappointed,' said one commercial bank dealer in London. After rising 82 basis points from its previous close in the early morning, the December contract continued to fall from a high of 89.95 throughout the day. It closed at 89.69. There was a similar trajectory to cash rates. Three-month money dipped as low as 10 1/16 per cent in the early morning, but crept right back to close at 10 5/16 per cent on the offered side as sterling dithered. The closing rate was  1/4 per cent lower than Friday's finish. The market will remain jittery before Sunday's French vote on the Maastricht referendum. A clearing bank dealer said that by this time next week the market could still be dealing with 12 per cent base rates if the French vote No. Against this background, he believed that the shorter-dated sterling futures would gradually sink below the 89.50 level as the week continues. The Bank of England acted decisively to calm the market, dashing all hope of a base rate cut by offering a repurchase agreement in the early round at the established rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The market purchased Pounds 900m of the 'repo', instantly removing the shortage forecast by the Bank. Sentiment was improved by the Bundesbank's decision to set a floor for repurchase agreements at a fixed 9.20 per cent. Dealers said this effectively implied that money market rates had been cut by 0.5 of a percentage point.</p>

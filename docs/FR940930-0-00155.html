			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also believes it has authority to consider harmonization of federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy-duty ULEV and ZEV standards and California incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ULEV and ZEV standards in setting the federal standards. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  As explained above, EPA interprets ``comparable standards'' to mean that heavy-duty CFV ULEV and ZEV standards must be comparable to light-duty CFV ULEV and ZEV standards. Since the Act requires EPA to establish federal light-duty ULEV and ZEV standards that conform as closely as possible to California's light-duty ULEV and ZEV standards, harmonization of the federal heavy-duty ULEV and ZEV standards and California incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ULEV and ZEV standards could be part of the comparability determination. In addition, the direction of section 246(h) to set ``comparable standards'' gives EPA some discretion in establishing standards. EPA believes it is appropriate to consider California's standards in exercising this discretion. EPA believes that, since the federal HD ULEV and ZEV standards are voluntary credit-generating standards, their intended purpose is primarily to provide compliance flexibility for manufacturers and fleet operators. The Agency's goal then, in selecting these standards, is to provide the maximum flexibility allowable under section  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> 246(f)(4) of the Act, while ensuring that there will be no negative impacts on the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning with the 1995 model year, CARB's medium-duty vehicles include vehicles with a GVWR of 14,000 pounds or less. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> i.

These standards are the same as those that were proposed, except the formaldehyde standard, which is lower than originally proposed. In the opening statement at the public hearing for the proposal and in a memorandum that was placed in the docket and distributed at the public hearing, <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  EPA informed the public that the proposed standard for formaldehyde was a typographical error and requested comment on the change of the heavy-duty ULEV standard to the level specified in Table 5. EPA did not receive any comments objecting to this level for the formaldehyde ULEV standard. The final heavy-duty ULEV standards require reductions in emissions that are comparable to the respective emission reductions required of light-duty ULEVs, and are consistent with the respective requirements of the California LEV program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources, ``Request for Comment on Revised Formaldehyde Standard for Heavy-Duty ULEVs for the Clean Fuel Fleet NPRM,'' July 12, 1993, Memorandum from Bryan J. Manning through Tad Wysor to docket A&hyph;92&hyph;30 (Document Number III&hyph;A&hyph;03). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, EPA is setting a combined NMHC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HD CFV ULEV standard that is approximately a 30 percent reduction from the HD CFV LEV standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comparable light-duty CFV ULEV standards require reductions from light-duty CFV LEV standards of 38 to 50 percent of NMOG emissions and 45 to 50 percent for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions. Even though EPA has separate NMOG and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards for light-duty CFV ULEVs, the Agency does not believe it is required to establish such separate standards for heavy-duty CFV ULEVs. Rather, EPA believes it is appropriate to have a combined NMHC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  heavy-duty CFV ULEV standard because heavy-duty CFV LEV standards have a combined NMHC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard rather than separate NMOG and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards (as do light-duty CFV LEVs and ULEVs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, a combined NMHC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard is consistent with the California incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ULEV standard. EPA proposed this interpretation and did not receive any comments objecting to a combined NMHC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard for HDEs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also is setting specific emission standards for CO and particulates that require a reduction in emissions from the heavy-duty CFV LEV standards of 50 to 54 percent and 50 percent, respectively, as proposed. (For both CO and particulates, heavy-duty CFV LEVs must meet the same standards as do conventional heavy-duty vehicles. Thus, for these standards, the reductions in emissions for heavy-duty CFV ULEV standards are the same whether they are compared to conventional or CFV LEV heavy-duty standards.) The comparable light-duty CFV ULEV standards require reductions in CO and particulate emissions of 50 percent each from light-duty CFV LEV standards. These federal heavy-duty ULEV standards are identical to California's incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ULEV standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, EPA is also setting a specific heavy-duty ULEV standard for formaldehyde. The comparable light-duty CFV ULEV standard requires a reduction in emissions ranging from 39 to 52 percent from light-duty CFV LEV standards. Though formaldehyde is not regulated for heavy-duty CFV LEVs, formaldehyde is regulated in the light-duty CFV ULEV standards. EPA believes that heavy-duty vehicles that emit formaldehyde are likely to participate in the CFV ULEV program. Because emissions of formaldehyde are of significant concern to EPA and to Congress, as evidenced by the inclusion of formaldehyde standards for light-duty CFV LEVs and the inclusion of formaldehyde as a hazardous air pollutant, EPA believes it is appropriate to include standards for formaldehyde emissions in the heavy-duty CFV ULEV program. EPA has the authority to regulate formaldehyde emissions not only under section 246(f)(4), but also under CAA sections 202(a) and 301(a). Also, the CARB LEV program includes a formaldehyde ULEV standard for diesel engines and incomplete medium-duty vehicles. Therefore, it is consistent with the CARB LEV program to set a formaldehyde standard for federal HD ULEVs. The standard promulgated today is identical to CARB's incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ULEV formaldehyde standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

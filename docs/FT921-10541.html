			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit at Heritage Reduced costs of sales, distribution and administration, together with lower interest charges, helped Heritage, the USM-quoted housewares importer and distributor, to report reduced interim losses. The deficit of Pounds 96,000 pre-tax for the six months to October 31 compared with a loss of Pounds 198,000 last time, a figure struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 205,000. Interest charges amounted to Pounds 246,000, down from Pounds 326,000. Turnover dipped from Pounds 5.82m to Pounds 5.36m, but Mr Jeffrey Lampert, chairman and chief executive, said the shortfall would be made up in the second half. Turnover in the last full year totalled Pounds 10.5m. Losses per share were cut from 3.7p to 1.78p, but directors considered it 'inappropriate' to declare an interim distribution.</p>

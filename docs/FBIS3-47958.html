			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry said Thursday [20 January] it may be  forced to seek another raise in postal rates in the coming years  despite an average 24 percent rate hike scheduled to take effect  Monday.    The postcard rate will be raised to 50 yen from the present  41 yen and the letter rate will to 80 yen from 62 yen.    The postal service is likely to record a single-year surplus  of 50 billion yen in fiscal 1994, starting April 1, due to the  hike, but is expected to register a deficit in fiscal 1997 due  to rising labor costs and sluggish business demand for mail  services, the ministry said.    The service is expected to have an accumulated deficit of  177.7 billion yen at the end of fiscal 1993 next March 31.    At the end of fiscal 1996, the service will still have an  accumulated deficit of around 45 billion yen, the ministry said.    The ministry attributed its pessimistic outlook to slumping  corporate demand for mail for advertising.    The volume of mail increased by between 4.6 and 6.1 percent  from fiscal 1988 to 1991, but the rate dropped to 1.9 percent in  fiscal 1992. The rate for fiscal 1993 is estimated at somewhere  between 1 and 2 percent.    The growth rate is likely to drop to the minus column in  fiscal 1994, due to the rate increase, and remain at about 2  percent in the following years, the ministry said.</p>

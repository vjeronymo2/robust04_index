			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister of the Republic of Croatia, today sent a letter to the  UN secretary-general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, sharply  protesting against incidents that occurred on 5 February at the  airports in Split and Sarajevo.    On that occasion some UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]  low-ranking officials and officers refused to allow Zdravko  Sancevic, Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and several  other Croats to enter Sarajevo, thus preventing Ambassador  Sancevic from carrying out his duties. It is inconceivable that  an ambassador should not be allowed to enter the capital of the  country to which he is accredited, regardless of whether he is  stopped by the government of the host country or officials  representing an international organization such as the United  Nations, Granic said. He also expressed understanding for the  problems faced by UNPROFOR in the implementation of their task  and the hope that incidents like the ones of 5 February would  not happen again.    In his letter to Akashi, Granic also expresses deep concern  and personal regret over the tragedy at Sarajevo market,  stressing that the Croatian Government sharply condemns such  barbarian acts directed against innocent civilians. To prevent  further escalation of chaos, violence, and suffering, the  Croatian Government has called on all sides immediately to cease  hostilities and return to the peace negotiations. The Croatian  Government also calls on the international community to use all  available means, including force, to stop tragic clashes in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is said among other things in Granic's  letter to Yasushi Akashi.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Japan steps up presence in Europe JAPANESE manufacturers feel comfortable about their presence in Europe and indicate that, to avoid conflict, localisation of operations and management is essential, Emiko Terazono reports from Tokyo. A recent survey of manufacturers, carried out by the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), showed the number of companies with at least 10 per cent Japanese ownership operating in Europe increased to 676 at the end of last January, a 27.8 per cent year-on-year rise. Of these 676, 187 chose the UK as their base, 122 France, 109 Germany, and 64 Spain, 39 Italy, and 36 the Netherlands. The survey suggests the reasons were ease of distribution, availability of English-speaking managers, a pool of highly-skilled workers, and a well-developed infrastructure. Almost half the companies responding expressed optimism about relationships with their local communities. But some 20 per cent expressed concerns about employee friction triggered by lack of localisation of management or by implementation of Japanese-style management. The main reasons cited for setting up operations in Europe were to avoid problems with anti-dumping actions, to reinforce research and development in Europe. Some 30 per cent said their operations followed acquiring an US company with European links. About 40 per cent said local content of purchased parts had increased, while 6.9 per cent claiming a decrease. In explaining the background to the local-content increase, 32.7 per cent cited the improvement in the quality of locally manufactured goods, 29.7 per cent increased in-house parts manufacturing, with 24.8 per cent saying they had turned to buying parts from Japanese suppliers in Europe. Local personnel were assigned to a chief executive post in a third of the companies, while director or managing director were the highest posts in a quarter of the companies. When asked about cultural and social community activities, 53.7 per cent said they had no specific policy. Only 9.8 per cent said they were actively sharing in community events under company direction.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amnesty for more than 50 right-wingers accused of  several bomb blasts before the elections came under the  spotlight again this evening at a meeting between Justice  Minister Dullah Omar and Conservative Party [CP] leader, Ferdi  Hartzenberg. In a statement issued a short while ago, the  Conservative Party said Mr. Omar had agreed to consider a number  of proposals. These include an extension of the amnesty for  so-called political prisoners from the present cut-off date of  December the 5th last year, to the date when final agreement is  reached on the amnesty. Gary Alfonso reports:    [Begin recording] [Alfonso] More than 50 right-wing  supporters were arrested and subsequently released on bail after  a spate of bombings shortly before the country's historic  all-race elections just over a month ago. Few doubt that the  explosions were aimed at destabilizing the election process.  Justice Minister Dullah Omar said on SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] television last night that the people  who carried out these acts, as well as the Chris Hani killers,  Janusz Walus and Clive Derby-Lewis, were not eligible for  amnesty. But according to CP leader, Ferdi Hartzenberg, who met  with Mr. Omar this evening, agreement on what he called equal  treatment for all had been reached earlier with President  Mandela.    [Hartzenberg] There was this agreement between us and the  president that all the people will get the same treatment and  the same principles will be applied, so I think we must first  have a discussion with the minister.    [Alfonso] Talks about amnesty for the right-wingers in  question is not just an issue of an agreement between the  Conservative Party and the minister of justice. The 1993  constitution would have to be revisited, and that can only be  changed by Parliament and the government of national unity.  [end recording]</p>

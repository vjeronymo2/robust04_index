			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Budget 'provokes confidence drop' Confidence among consumers fell sharply this month in the wake of the November Budget, says a survey from Gallup, the market research group. It found a sharp deterioration in how people viewed the financial position of their households next year and in their perception of general economic developments. The poll, conducted in the first two weeks of December for the European Commission, found 38 per cent thought the financial position of their household would worsen in the next 12 months against 27 per cent in November. Those expecting an improvement fell to 16 per cent from 19 per cent. The resulting balance, the main indicator of opinion, widened to minus 22 per cent from minus 8 per cent in November and was the worst since May. Gallup reported a similar worsening of the public's view of the likely development of the UK economy. It found that people were gloomier about inflation, employment prospects and their ability to save any money next year.</p>

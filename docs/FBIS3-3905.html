Also  attending the meeting were: Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman of the  National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee; Ismail  Amat, State Councillor and minister in charge of the State  Nationalities Affairs Commission; and comrades in charge of the  Ministry of Finance, the State Planning Commission, and the  State General Administration of Taxation.    Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: Since reform and opening to the  outside world, the autonomous region has made greater progress  in its economic construction; however, when compared with its  fraternal provinces and regions, the gap between Xinjiang and  these provinces and regions is widening. To narrow the gap in a  short time and achieve more rapid economic development in  Xinjiang, we must turn our attention to both the international  and domestic markets; seize such opportunities as the state's  adoption of policies in favor of industry, the inauguration of  the second Eurasian Continental Bridge, and the grand oil  exploration; take advantage of resources and geographical  features; and carry out the development strategy to convert  advantageous resources. He said: In the meantime, we should  seize five tasks firmly and achieve breakthroughs in four areas.  The five tasks are: the development of agriculture and the  rural economy; the construction of infrastructural facilities  and basic industries; the exploitation of mineral resources such  as oil, natural gas, and nonferrous metals; the restructuring of  enterprises; and reinvigorating economic development on the  county level. To achieve breakthroughs in four areas is to make  the development of state-owned large- and medium-sized  enterprises a major task and to transform enterprises' operating  mechanisms so as to achieve new breakthroughs in restructuring  traditional industries; to make the development of large-scale  agriculture a major task and to put great efforts into the  development of secondary and tertiary industries in rural areas,  centering on village and town enterprises, so as to achieve new  breakthroughs in economic development on the county level; to  open up in an all-round manner and to diversify markets, so as  to achieve new breakthroughs in foreign trade; and to move  forward with the exploitation of oil and nonferrous metals, so  as to achieve new breakthroughs in promoting local economic  development.</p>

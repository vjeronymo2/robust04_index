			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO VIEWS OF SECTION  </P> <P> I have been a longtime reader of The Times and especially enjoy the Real estate  Section on Sundays. I just wanted to take the time to let you know how valuable  this section has been to me. As a novice in real estate investments, I have  learned so much from this section. I rerally feel it has evolved into a  first-class source of up-to-date information.  </P> <P> RICHARD A. RETTAMMEL  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

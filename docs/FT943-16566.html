			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): City of London Festival Music round the clock will lure city workers out of the office as the lunchtime concerts and early evening organ recitals of the City of London Festival get underway. Many events are taking place in the city's historic churches and ancient livery halls. Al fresco entertainment is also on offer at the Broadgate Arena, which has free theatre, jazz or cabaret most weekday lunchtimes. The festival ends on July 20 with a traditional visit to St. Paul's Cathedral, this year for Walton's 'Belshazzar's Feast'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Israeli Ambassador to Paraguay Shmu'el Merom said  this morning that the Israeli Government has decided to close  its embassy in Paraguay and three other Latin American countries  as part of a world reorganization of its foreign service. The  diplomat made the announcement at Government Palace after  meeting with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy.    At the end of the meeting, Merom said the closure of the  Israeli Embassy is purely a matter of internal reorganization,  adding that Israel has 17 embassies in Latin America, which is  considered excessive. Merom said Israel will place more  emphasis on the Muslim countries in their region, adding that  his country needs increased relations and understanding with  these nations in view of the requirements of the new world  order. The ambassador said a commission had studied the  coverage of embassies in order to relocate them.    Finally, Merom said his country cannot maintain so many  embassies in Latin America, adding that this is the single  reason why his country decided to "close" this embassy in  Paraguay.</p>

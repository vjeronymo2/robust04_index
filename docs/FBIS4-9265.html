			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- "The Government of  Romania, in whose programme the integration in the Euro-Atlantic  political, strategic and economic structures is a basic  component of its foreign policy, has expressed with clarity,  ever since the signing of the European association agreement,  through the authorised voice of its prime minister, Romania's  option for progressive development and consolidation of its  relations with the European Union, a course apt to eventually  lead to its joining the union as a full member of this," runs a  declaration by the Romanian Government, presented at the 20  April press conference of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs.    "The recommendations and decisions of the European councils  in Edinburgh and Copenhagen, and the measures recently approved  by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the `12', which, by their  contents exceed the framework settled through the association  agreements, mark a new stage in the development of growingly  closer political and economic ties between the European Union  and its associated partners from Central and Eastern Europe,  reflecting, at the same time, a greater interest on the part of  our community partners in supporting the latter's efforts of  nearing and integrating in this European body.    "The Romanian Government has welcomed with outmost  satisfaction these decisions which sanction, among other things,  the principle of undifferential treatment of all associated  partners, and which are capable to assure them that the process  of their integration in the European Union -- a common target of  both parties -- will follow its normal course, a rising course,  free from influence from circumstantial situations.    "As far as Romania is concerned, we are fully aware that  integration in the European Union is a complex process that  requires time, especially in respect of alignment to European  legislation and standards, of reaching the necessary level of  economic performance. on the other hand, we must not forget that  the European Union itself is still evolving and even  reconsidering its institutional mechanisms, as required by the  implementation of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and by  the widening of Union membership with four new West European  states.    "The Romanian Government's view is that a document of such  importance, as the application for admission to the European  Union is, must take in consideration all these realities and  occur when the conditions are met for starting effective  negotiations, with the due consideration of interests and  implications concerning both sides.    "While reasserting its firm option for the adherence to the  European Union, the Government of Romania is sure that, by  converging efforts of all political forces and segments of the  Romanian society, the required performance levels can be  reached, including those of economic nature, apt to make it  possible for this country to fully accede to the status of union  member in an as close as possible perspective.    "In the present stage, the Romanian Government pursues in  its  relations with the European Union the following objectives: the  completion as soon as possible of the procedures for the  ratification of the European agreement; the fulfilment by both  sides of the commitments made under the association agreement;  the obtainment of greater support from the European Union for  the process of reform and for the reaching of standards as  required for by integration purposes; amplifying the efforts for  bringing domestic legislation in harmony with community  legislation; the participation in all the great continental  infrastructure projects; the active participation in the  bilateral and multilateral political dialogue by capitalising  all the opportunities offered by the association agreement and  the decisions made subsequently at community level."</p>

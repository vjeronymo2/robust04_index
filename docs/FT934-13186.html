			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company: Shake-up drives WMX to Dollars 127m loss WMX Technologies, the waste management and environmental group, posted a loss of Dollars 127m, or 26 cents a share, in the third quarter, largely because of costs related to restructuring at its hazardous waste subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management, writes Laurie Morse. The loss compares with a Dollars 216m, or 44 cents, profit in the third quarter of 1992. Chemical Waste, 80 per cent owned by WMX, reported a Dollars 359.9m net loss for the quarter after a Dollars 363m after-tax charge for writing down assets and restructuring. Chemical Waste's operations have been plagued by declining off-site hazardous waste volumes and overcapacity in the US hazardous waste incineration business. For the nine months, WMX had income of Dollars 289m, or 60 cents, 7bn, down from Dollars 667m, or Dollars 1.35, in the first nine months of 1992.</p>

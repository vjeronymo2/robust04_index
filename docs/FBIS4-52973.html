			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 13 May commentary: "Dangerous Game of Fire </F> Aimed at Launching Attacks for Northward Invasion"]    [Text] Under the code name of joint tactical exercise for  the first half of this year, the South Korean puppets started a  joint military exercise of the puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force  on 9 May. This game of fire, which reportedly will continue  until 14 May, is being played more frantically as time goes by.    This war exercise includes an exercise for combat  preparations, an exercise for chemical, biological, and  radiological warfare, an exercise for transportation of troops  and equipment, and an emergency take-off and landing exercise,  all of which are aimed at launching attacks against us. This  exercise is being conducted more frantically in the northern  part of Kyonggi Province, close to the Military Demarcation Line.    On 9 May the puppets mobilized a large-scale (?flotilla)  composed of various warships and conducted provocative war  exercises, such as a maritime mobile exercise, while babbling  about a need to get ready to take a countermeasure at the  initial stage of war. The warmongers also conducted a joint  airborne jump exercise and a joint field exercise with the U.S.  Forces on the East Sea of Korea [as heard].    All these facts show that the war exercise which the United  States and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique started this time  is a dangerous game of fire aimed at attacking us in  three-dimensional operations in the air and on land and sea.    As usual, the puppets propagandized that they started this  war exercise to get ready for someone else's surprise attacks  and infiltrations. This is a mere sophism aimed at concealing  their bellicose colors as those who deliberately aggravate the  situation on the Korean peninsula and rush to confrontation and  war.    As is well known, we hope that the problem of peace in the  country and its peaceful reunification will be solved through  dialogue and negotiations and are constantly making efforts  toward that end. To hasten the country's reunification, we made  public the 10-point program of the great unity of the entire  nation and, recently, advanced a proposal for convening a  national meeting. Moreover, under a tense situation in which the  danger of new war is ever growing on the Korean peninsula, we  advanced a momentous proposal on turning the Armistice into a  stable peace and is making efforts to implement this proposal.  It is clear even to a very small child that our efforts for  peace and reunification are not intended for surprise attacks or  infiltrations. It is the U.S. imperialists and South Korean  warmongers who pursue surprise attacks and infiltrations on the  Korean peninsula.    As disclosed, the South Korean puppets have already mapped  out new Operation Plan 5027, a plan to provoke a war of  northward invasion with the United States. The United States is  concentrating massive aggression forces on South Korea and its  vicinity to inflict a nuclear catastrophe on our nation. It  also has deployed Patriot missiles and attack helicopters in  South Korea. The U.S. warmongers unhesitatingly make  powder-reeking remarks that they would not hesitate to wage a  war or refrain from launching preemptive strikes. U.S. Defense  Secretary Perry, a ringleader of war [chonjaeng tumok], sneaked  into South Korea and had a war confab.    In the tactical exercise, the puppets moved massive troops  and equipment close to the Military Demarcation Line and played  a game of fire in the air and on land and sea. Needless to say,  in so doing, they aim to complete their readiness to launch  attacks for northward aggression according to the U.S.  imperialists' policy of war.    The United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must  know that their dangerous game of fire, which leads the  situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, will  never bring good results to them. The South Korean people will  never forgive the warmongers who pursue fratricidal conflicts  [tongjok sangjan].</p>

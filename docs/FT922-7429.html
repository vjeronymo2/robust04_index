			<p>920519 FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gas unions reject 4% offer UNION leaders of 37,000 white-collar workers at British Gas yesterday rejected an offer to increase pay by 4 per cent. The company had previously offered 3.9 per cent, Michael Smith writes. Mr Dave Stirzaker, national gas officer of Nalgo, with 37,000 members at British Gas, said it was a skinflint offer that would damage staff morale. The offer coincided with a report by Incomes Data Services, the pay research organisation, showing most pay settlements in the second quarter of 1992 as worth between 4 per cent and 5.9 per cent.</p>

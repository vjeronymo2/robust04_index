			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> AIDS FOUNDATION REDUCES SERVICES  </P> <P> The Sacramento AIDS Foundation is reducing direct services to patients in  neighboring counties, saying other communities must provide more AIDS care. Sam  Schuchat, deputy director of the foundation, said the organization will  continue to provide training and technical expertise in AIDS prevention and  treatment to health and mental health workers in Yolo, Placer, Ed Dorado and  Nevada counties. But the foundation's new strategic plan calls for it to save  its care-management services, counseling, home-health care and one-on-one  support services for Sacramento County's AIDS patients. The number of  Sacramento-area people with symptoms of the fatal disease has risen from two in  1982 to the more than 800 cases the foundation expects to handle this fiscal  year.  </P></p>

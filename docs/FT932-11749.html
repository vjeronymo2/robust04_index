			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / More teachers vote to boycott testing PRESSURE on the government to suspend school testing mounted yesterday with the announcement that members of a second teachers' union have voted overwhelmingly to boycott the tests. The normally moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers announced that its members in schools voted by an 82.7 per cent majority to boycott testing in connection with the national curriculum. The turnout was 57 per cent. The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers is already boycotting the tests, after members voted 88 per cent in favour of action. The largest union, the National Union of Teachers, is also consulting members on a boycott in a ballot which ends on May 10. Mr Peter Smith, the ATL's general secretary, urged the government not to ignore the result. He said: 'The ATL is not known as a trigger-happy union when it comes to industrial action. The concern shown by our members is probably a litmus paper test for the feelings on this issue among teachers.' The ATL vote led to renewed calls on the government to suspend the testing for this year, until the completion of the review of the national curriculum tests under Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the new School Curriculum and Assessment Authority. Mr David Hart of the National Association of Head Teachers said the ATL vote 'virtually guarantees' that every school in the country would be affected by boycotts. Mr John Patten, education secretary, refused to comment on the ballot result. An Education Department spokesman said the vote was not in the interests of pupils, parents or teachers. Sir Ron Dearing yesterday set out his programme for reviewing the national curriculum and testing procedures in schools, including a survey of 1,400 schools and 200 bodies representing teachers, parents, governors and employers.</p>

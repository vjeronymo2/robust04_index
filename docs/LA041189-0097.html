			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERRILL LYNCH EX-TRADER FACES SEC HEARING  </P> <P> A former Merrill Lynch mortgage trader whose allegedly unauthorized  transactions resulted in heavy trading losses for the firm will face a hearing  on fraud charges, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday.  </P> <P> The SEC charged that Howard A. Rubin, the former head mortgage-backed  securities trader at Merrill Lynch Government Securities, willfully violated  federal anti-fraud laws in connection with trades in April, 1987.  </P> <P> "A hearing will be scheduled to determine whether the allegations against Rubin  are true, and if so, to decide what remedial action, if any, is appropriate,"  Edwin H. Nordlinger, deputy regional administrator of the SEC's New York  office, said in a statement.  </P> <P> If Rubin is found guilty, he could face sanctions ranging from the following:  </P> <P> * Temporary suspension from securities trading.  </P> <P> * Limited trading activities.  </P> <P> * Lifetime ban from the business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Outstanding Reputation'  </P> <P> Rubin, who was fired from Merrill Lynch, works as a mortgage securities trader  at Bear Stearns &amp; Co., a spokeswoman for the latter firm said.  </P> <P> An attorney representing Rubin, Ira Lee Sorkin, said Rubin denies he committed  any fraud.  </P> <P> "He has had an outstanding reputation in the industry and an unblemished  record," Sorkin said. "And we intend to litigate this matter to the hilt."  </P> <P> Sorkin said the SEC's action appears based entirely on an allegation that Rubin  did not follow his supervisors' instructions.  </P> <P> "How the SEC regards this as a violation of the federal securities laws is  beyond our imagination," he said.  </P> <P> Allegedly unauthorized transactions by Rubin while he was at Merrill Lynch were  blamed by the company as a major reason for huge trading losses that cut the  investment firm's pretax earnings by about $275 million in the second quarter  of 1987.  </P> <P> The transactions involved hundreds of millions of dollars of certain types of  mortgage-backed securities, which represent mortgages that are pooled and then  packaged as marketable securities for sale to investors.  </P></p>

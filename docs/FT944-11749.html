			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Observer: Radiating Nuclear Electric's go-ahead to start up Sizewell B after 10 years of planning and construction is mixed news for John Collier, company chairman. Some time ago he wagered that Sizewell would be selling electricity before Eurotunnel was transporting fare-paying passengers. He can throw the switch on Sizewell in 28 days, though it will not generate commercial power until February. But Eurotunnel, despite all its woes, should be earning its first hard cash from November 14. Though who wants to bet on that?</p>

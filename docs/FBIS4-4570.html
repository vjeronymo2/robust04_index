			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's private advisory  organ called the "Consultative Committee on Defense Problems"  (headed by Asahi Breweries Ltd. Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi)  designed to discuss and study new defense policies held its  fourth meeting at the prime minister's official residence on the  morning of 30 March. In the meeting, positive views toward  participating in a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) plan were  expressed.    In the meeting, the members received a briefing by Maritime  Self-Defense Force Chief of Staff Chiaki Hayashizaki and Air  Self-Defense Force Chief of Staff Isao Ishizuka about the  current situation.    In response, with the tense situation on the Korean  peninsula  in mind, an opinion was expressed by committee members that "we  wonder if there are ways to deal with a missile attack. The TMD  is an effective system for strengthening Japan's exclusively  defensive defense."    Meanwhile, the view was also expressed that "comprehensive  study has to be given to the TMD plan because it relates to the  issue concerning use of space for peace purpose, and the  collective self-defense right."</p>

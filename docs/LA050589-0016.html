			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: PRESS DIDN'T GRASP GEHRIG'S IRON STREAK  </P> <P> Fifty years ago this week, Lou Gehrig ended a remarkable string of playing in  2,130 consecutive games, from June 1, 1925 to May 2, 1939.  </P> <P> Soon thereafter, Gehrig was discovered to have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,  the incurable ailment now known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  </P> <P> But before the world knew what ailed the New York Yankees' Iron Horse, he was  an inviting target for sportswriters.  </P> <P> Newspaper accounts of Gehrig's dramatic demise were at first attributed to old  age.  </P> <P> "Old Iron Horse Not What He Used to Be," said a headline in the Sporting News  in June 1938.  </P> <P> A reporter covering the Yankees for the now-defunct New York World Telegram  wrote that the first baseman "cannot get the old swing, he cannot put the old  driving power on the ball."  </P> <P> And from the New York Times: "After all, the Iron Horse is getting old, he is  always doing his best and it isn't exactly sporty to ride a fellow merely  because the years have caught up with him."  </P> <P> Gehrig was 35 in 1938. He died in 1941.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who was the first commissioner of the American Basketball Assn.?  </P> <P> Food for thought: Ever wonder who came up with the idea of dragging the infield  after the fifth inning?  </P> <P> Well, it began in the Pacific Coast League in 1949, when Manager Fred Haney of  the Hollywood Stars decided fans would buy more concessions if there was a  10-minute break in the middle of a game. Haney came up with the brainstorm  while pondering a suggestion from concessions chief Danny Goodman on how to  boost business.  </P> <P> Re-lighting the flame: When Seattle acquired pitcher Mike Dunne from Pittsburgh  last week, the Mariners became the first team in the majors with three members  of the 1984 U.S. Olympic baseball team. Dunne rejoined pitchers Scott Bankhead  and Bill Swift.  </P> <P> Now you really know Dept.: April 30's Morning Briefing said the diameter of a  golf hole is 4 1/2 inches.  </P> <P> Wrong, writes Gerald E. Hall, rules chairman of the Southern California PGA.  From Robert Clark's book, "Golf -- A Royal and Ancient Game," comes this 1899  rule: "The hole shall be 4 1/4 inches in diameter, and at least 4 inches deep."  </P> <P> Missed by just this much.  </P> <P> Now you really know Dept. II: April 29's trivia said Dwight D. Eisenhower  suffered a broken leg trying to tackle Jim Thorpe.  </P> <P> According to Kenneth S. Davis' biography, "Eisenhower, Soldier of Democracy,"  the Army football player suffered a twisted knee in the game won by Thorpe and  Carlisle, 27-6, during the 1912 season.  </P> <P> The next week, writes reader Al Ginepra, Eisenhower suffered a broken knee in a  game against Tufts.  </P> <P> "He was seriously hurt," Davis' book said. "He knew that as soon as it  happened. The knee that he twisted in the Carlisle game was now broken, and he  lay flat on the ground, gritting his teeth and clawing the turf in agony."  </P> <P> But even in that moment of great pain Eisenhower was concerned whether he would  be able to get back in shape for the Navy game.  </P> <P> He couldn't, though, since he was out for the season.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: George Mikan.  </P> <P> Action Jackson: Bo Jackson receives so many accolades about his versatility  that sometimes you've got to wonder.  </P> <P> The impressive Kansas City Royal-Los Angeles Raider might have even done a  double-take over this one:  </P> <P> "You want to know how good he is?" a scout asked the Washington Post's Richard  Justice, who then told this apocryphal anecdote: "I saw him hit a ball to deep  center field. He ran out and caught it, then turned around and beat his own  throw back to the plate."  </P> <P> Uh, right.  </P> <P> Quotebook: "If Easy Goer could look me in the eye and say, 'I'm gonna win (the  Kentucky Derby),' I wouldn't run (Awe Inspiring)," trainer Shug McGaughey said.  "But he can't do that. He's doing fantastic, but who knows?"  </P></p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Celsius improves 20% in first six months Celsius, the Swedish defence group privatised last year, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of SKr379m (Dollars 48.6m) for the first six months, up 20 per cent from SKr315m a year ago. The group attributed the improvement to structural change and greater efficiency and to a SKr600m increase in sales to SKr6.7bn. However, its performance had been dragged down by turbulence in the bond markets, which sharply lowered returns from last year's very high levels and cut financial income to SKr33m from SKr205m, the group said. The fall meant the group did not feel the full benefits of a strong advance in operating income to SKr346m from SKr110m. Orders rose SKr800m to SKr5.8bn, including a SKr270m order to build four minehunters for the Swedish navy. The group forecasts a full-year profit of SKr800m, compared with SKr721m last year. It anticipates continued growth in operating income as well as higher return on its financial investments.</p>

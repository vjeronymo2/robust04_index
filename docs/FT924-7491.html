			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Monday Interview: Monarch in a race with time - King Hussein of Jordan speaks to Hugh Carnegy and Mark Nicholson Seldom in the 40 turbulent years of his rule has King Hussein of Jordan, who turned 57 on Saturday, been more popular with his people, more confident in his political touch or more dominant in his small kingdom's affairs. Yet, for precisely these reasons, seldom in recent times have the Hashemite kingdom's 4m Jordanian and Palestinian people looked with more trepidation towards their country's future. Since it became known in August that their monarch was suffering from cancer, Jordanians have faced with concern the prospect of losing the man who has ruled them since ascending the throne, a boy-king of 17, in 1953. A measure of King Hussein's popularity, and of the fears raised by intimations of his mortality, was his homecoming in September after cancer surgery in the US. Hundreds of thousands swamped Amman's streets to greet him, turning the 10-minute drive from Marqa airbase to the palace into a crawling 3 1/2 -hour tour. Cheering crowds prompted the king to abandon the passenger seat of the silver Mercedes chauffeured by Crown Prince Hassan, his brother and heir, and perch on the car's bonnet, without a security guard in sight. Few, if any, Middle Eastern leaders would dare appear so vulnerable in public - nor indeed would King Hussein have done so until perhaps this year. Few, certainly, could draw such crowds unbidden. But since the Gulf war in early 1991 when he ignored international opprobrium to voice his subjects' condemnation of the west's action against their Arab neighbours in Iraq, King Hussein has enjoyed enormous popularity. 'I'd always prayed to God that future generations would cast a judgment in favour of us and not against us,' he said, in his first interview since returning from the US. 'But to live through an experience like that and see that kind of warmth and feeling and concern in my lifetime, I never expected, and never believed that I merited it.' Sipping Pepsi, against medical advice - but these days not smoking - King Hussein appeared fit and confident in his palace office. He is, nonetheless, as he stressed with unexpected frankness in a sombre televised address earlier this month, intent on preparing both Jordan and himself for his eventual death. His 45-minute speech at moments sounded like a self-penned obituary. During the interview he expanded on a central theme of the speech - his desire that Jordan should evolve into a model democratic state in the Middle East, a development he clearly believes he is now sufficiently secure and popular to encourage successfully. 'This area has suffered time and again because of individuals, because people came to power in this region and decided to destroy everything that anyone had done before and tried to create something in their own lifetime,' he said. 'Whatever remains of my life has to be dedicated towards consolidating more of the foundations, the grounds for democracy, for human rights, for sharing responsibility and for pluralism,' he said. 'I think there is a greater need in this society and in the region for an example to be made, and I believe that Jordan can be an example.' This stance is viewed cynically by Jordan's neighbouring leaders: men such as Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Hafez al-Assad of Syria and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. They distrust the king's trumpeted commitment to democracy - seeing it as little more than a ploy in a greater preoccupation of entrenching Hashemite authority over a country whose legitimacy they are loath to acknowledge. Jordan has never fully convinced its neighbours - Arab or Israeli - of its viability as a coherent society. It was carved more or less at random out of desert by the British and King Abdullah, King Hussein's grandfather. Today, 60 per cent of its people are Palestinians who, at some stage since 1948, came across from what is now Israel and the West Bank. It is certainly true that King Hussein's vision of democracy in Jordan rests on the continued rule of his house, as he refers to his family. In his television speech, he gloried in the exploits of Abdullah, a leader of the Arab revolt against the crumbling Ottoman Empire. He recalled standing at Abdullah's side when Jordan's founding monarch was assassinated at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque in 1951. He, Hussein, had inherited the Hashemite mantle, and would hand it on to future generations, he told the nation. During his reign, the king has fended off coup attempts, survived defeat by Israel in 1967 when Jordan lost control of east Jerusalem and the West Bank, defeated near-insurrection by the Palestine Liberation Organisation in 1970, repulsed a simultaneous invasion by Syria and, recently, emerged from the Gulf crisis more popular at home than ever. Certainly, the king's efforts to mend relations with the US, Egypt and the Gulf states, broken by his pro-Iraqi tilt during the Gulf war, have so far met with limited success. But he believes it is only a matter of time and patient diplomacy before normal ties can resume. Perhaps more important, peace with Israel is under negotiation and some joint constitutional arrangement with a prospective self-governing Palestinian entity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip may be attainable. The post-Gulf war efforts of the US, and a new Labour government in Israel, may have brought real peace closer than ever in King Hussein's lifetime. 'I believe it is inevitable that something must happen, and must happen soon,' he said. But a host of forces, encompassing right-wing Israeli politicians, Islamic revolutionaries and radical Palestinians, see opportunities to upset the peace process, and indeed, the status quo in Jordan, for their own ends. And Jordanians have looked up to the king once more for leadership. The king is aware of the dangers. 'My concern all along, I have warned time and again, is of Jordan becoming a battleground for forces outside its immediate area. This is where we went haywire in the 1950s and I hope this will never be repeated,' he said, referring to the unrest during the early years of his rule which was aided by the Arab nationalist states of Iraq, Syria and Egypt. King Hussein says he is leading Jordan towards a constitutional monarchy, with greater emphasis than before on the constitution. In the past three years he has done much to oversee this, holding elections to the lower house, forging a new National Charter, and allowing the formation of political parties for the first time in nearly 40 years. But the king admits that it may take several elections before popular and broadly based political parties emerge. Many Jordanians, indeed, are sceptical that the monarch really envisages full democracy. The trial of two Islamic MPs last week, charged with two accomplices of plotting to overthrow the state, was read by many as a signal that democratisation will be tightly controlled, especially where any threat of Islamic revolution is perceived. Both were found guilty and sentenced to 20 years' hard labour. However, King Hussein last week granted the two men amnesty, a gesture which at once forestalled any Islamic backlash against the harsh sentences, while firmly underlining his position as Jordan's final arbiter. 'I am in a position now, especially after the 40 years that have passed of growing up together, to ensure that the legislature, the executive and the legal system work in this country,' he said. But it is precisely the dominance of the king's authority which raises so acutely the issue of his succession. Jordan's people want to extend democracy. They, and increasingly the Palestinians who have made their home in Jordan, recognise the Hashemite monarchy's role in binding the country. They almost certainly accept the eventual succession of Crown Prince Hassan. But many ask - in private - the question which also preoccupies Jordan's friends and enemies abroad. Will he be up to the task? Prince Hassan has proved himself a tireless regent who is intimately involved in the affairs of state and is clearly in the confidence of his elder brother. One senior diplomat in Amman said the issue was not whether he could cope with the cares of office, but whether he may be tempted to engage too deeply in the minutiae of government. Yet, such is King Hussein's record of steering himself and his country through crises, that many in Jordan doubt anybody could step into his shoes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1935     Born in Amman. 1952-53  Educated in the UK, at Harrow and Sandhurst. 1953     Ascended to Jordan's throne after the abdication of his father. 1978     Married Elizabeth Halaby, now Queen Noor, his fourth and          present wife, and mother of two sons.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

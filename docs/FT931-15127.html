			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: A formula full of eastern promise - Oresa builds on early success in Europe WHEN Mr Jonas af Jochnick set up his door-to-door cosmetics company in eastern Europe two years ago there was no shortage of pessimists - including, to some extent, himself. So far, however, the doomsters appear to have been proved wrong. Oresa, formed with Pounds 10m capital in 1990, is likely to have achieved sales of more than Pounds 25m in the year to the end of December 1992. Profits are expected to be 'substantially better' than the Pounds 500,000 achieved on sales of Pounds 4m in the first year. 'People were warning us it would be difficult,' he says. Trying to get people to work as effectively as in the west is given as one example. 'They said the people had been destroyed under communism. In fact, we have found it has been exactly the opposite. They are enormously hard-working.' In just two years Oresa has built up a network of 50,000 sales people. Mr af Jochnick and his brother, Robert, were the brains behind the UK-quoted Oriflame International, the door-to-door retailer and manufacturer which supplies cosmetics and toiletries to Oresa. Originally from Sweden, the brothers set up Oriflame in 1967 following their discovery of the Tupperware party phenomenon in the US. After a brief flirtation with the jewellery market in the UK and Sweden during the 1980s, the two brothers decided to return to their cosmetic roots. However, the depressed UK economy and the almost impregnable stranglehold on the sector by the likes of Avon, one of the world's biggest door-to-door cosmetics retailers, made expansion difficult. Then, in 1989, the Berlin wall came down and everything changed. While Avon was busy ferrying its representatives out to the wall with free welcome samples for migrating east Germans, Oriflame got to grips with legislation in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Within six months it decided to set up a separate entity, chaired by Jonas, to pursue joint ventures and acquisitions in eastern Europe. The UK company, headed by Robert, was only prepared to put in Pounds 2.5m for a 25 per cent stake. Shareholders were offered the opportunity to invest a further Pounds 7.3m through an unusually structured issue of seven Oresa shares for every one Oriflame. Investors were warned by Robert that not only was Oresa 'highly speculative', but that 'there is a risk the entire investment could be lost'. Furthermore, there would be no hope of a dividend in the foreseeable future. In spite of such grim warnings, Oresa has 'gone like a rocket', says Robert, whose own company was Pounds 1m richer at the interim trading level, the result of both sales and royalties from supplying Oresa. The two most important factors for door-to-door selling - people eager to work and people eager to buy - were there for the taking. Both Jonas and Robert say Oresa benefited from the lack of a retail structure and high unemployment in the former communist bloc. The brothers are also convinced that their decision to commit an entire company at the very early stages has given them the head start over bigger rivals such as Avon, which so far has concentrated mainly on the former eastern Germany and Hungary. It has not been an easy road, however, as Jonas is quick to point out. 'Going into eastern Europe in 1990 was a little bit like being in the Wild West,' he says. 'You have to be very flexible and adapt.' The difficulties seemed endless - from recruiting suitable local management to coping with inflation of 70 per cent in Poland. Learning to cope with the ever-changing legislation of the former eastern bloc has also been a traumatic experience. In Russia, for example, 'we had no idea whether the import regulations which applied when the product was sent would actually be those applied when it arrived two weeks later,' Jonas says. The especially volatile conditions of the former Soviet Union have meant a more cautious approach to setting up there. Currency problems are also a potential nightmare. However, in the countries where Oresa operates regulations allow the purchase of hard currency to pay for its imports. Oresa trades in local currency and also uses it to invest in its own manufacturing facilities. The company has recently purchased a Polish factory which will require investment of at least Pounds 7m. Jonas says the money will be internally generated. The biggest difficulty, however, has been margins. According to Jonas it is impossible to sell at prices similar to those in the west. 'We had to give people the opportunity to purchase what they were not used to . . . cosmetics and toiletries of European standards.' Therefore, the lipstick a British customer buys for Pounds 3.25 will be sold for roughly Pounds 2.30 by Oresa. Eventually the Polish factory should allow Oresa to manufacture more cheaply. In the meantime, however, 'we will simply have to be more economical'. Jonas also argues that his company operates on far lower costs than its western counterparts, using local employees and management. The critics, however, are dubious. 'It is an expensive process selling door-to-door,' says Mr Simon Knott, of stockbrokers Greig Middleton. 'You have got to have the right margins.' Furthermore, the sheer scale of risk remains with much still uncertain in eastern Europe.</p>

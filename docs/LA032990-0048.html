			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR ACCUSED OF TURNING AWAY ILL, POOR PATIENT  </P> <P> A former emergency room surgeon at Panorama Community Hospital is facing  charges that he turned away a critically ill patient because the patient could  not afford treatment, The Times has learned. It is the second time in recent  months that medical personnel at the hospital have been accused of such illegal  patient "dumping."  </P> <P> Felix Talag, who was 67 at the time, went to the Panorama City hospital on  April 11, 1987, because he had been vomiting blood for more than seven hours  and felt dizzy, an accusation filed by the Medical Board of California states.  Dr. Stephen C. Acosta briefly examined Talag at the hospital and then told his  relatives to drive him in their own car to Olive View Medical Center, a Los  Angeles County facility 10 miles away that treats indigent patients for reduced  fees.  </P> <P> There, doctors found that Talag had no palpable pulse or blood pressure, the  complaint says. Doctors managed to resuscitate him and he was placed in Olive  View's intensive care unit, the accusation states. Talag has since recovered,  said Gloria Barrios, the deputy state attorney general who is handling the case  on behalf of the Medical Board.  </P> <P> The complaint, which was obtained by The Times, states that Acosta allowed  Talag to be transferred because he "was concerned" that the patient "could not  pay for the required hospitalization."  </P> <P> Acosta, of Redondo Beach, could lose his medical license if the charges are  upheld at a hearing before a Medical Board panel in Los Angeles next Wednesday.  He is accused of negligence, incompetence and general unprofessional conduct.  </P> <P> Acosta, as well as the hospital, could each be fined $50,000 by the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services, which found out about the Acosta  incident while conducting its own investigation into the hospital's procedures,  said Elliott Kramer, the department's regional inspector general for  investigations. The state Medical Board heard about the incident from an Olive  View doctor who complained.  </P> <P> Acosta, who no longer works at Panorama hospital, is not listed as a member of  the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., and it could not be determined whether he  is still practicing. The state medical board issued him a physician's and  surgeon's certificate in October, 1977.  </P> <P> Panorama hospital spokeswoman Candyce Columbus declined to comment on the  charges. Acosta could not be reached for comment. His attorneys, David Kalifon  and John Harwell, said they could not comment on the charges until next week's  hearing.  </P> <P> After diagnosing the symptoms as an "acute episode of gastrointestinal  bleeding," Acosta allegedly failed to stabilize Talag and sent him to Olive  View, in Sylmar.  </P> <P> "Panorama Community Hospital had all the requisite staff and facilities  necessary to determine the extent and acuity" of Felix Talag's bleeding and to  stabilize his condition, according to the complaint, which was issued last May.  "This was not done," it says.  </P> <P> The incident came to light less than six months after a registered nurse at  Panorama Community Hospital was charged with denying care to a seriously ill  girl, whom she allegedly sent to Olive View after the girl's parents failed to  prove that they had insurance.  </P> <P> Kramer would not say if the department's investigation has uncovered other  so-called "dumping" incidents at the hospital.  </P> <P> Deborah Carol Nachman, 37, of Sherman Oaks is scheduled to stand trial April 30  on a misdemeanor charge of failing to treat Veronica Ayala, now 2, when the  girl was rushed to the hospital on Dec. 8, 1988.  </P> <P> Ayala lost one foot and the toes of the other to gangrene, which resulted from  a contagious blood infection, said Deputy City Atty. Ellen Pais.  </P> <P> Pais said that although it could not be proven that the girl lost her foot  because she was not treated at Panorama, the girl should have received  immediate care because her condition was critical.  </P></p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Warning of Caracas revolt One of Venezuela's two leading candidates for the presidency warned at the weekend that the country was moving close to another military uprising, Joseph Mann reports from Caracas. The statement, made by Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, candidate for the Christian Democrat Copei party, came after two weeks of rising tensions in Venezuela caused by a rash of bombings in the capital, press reports of a stillborn military rebellion and new rumours of military discontent. The most recent bombing took place on Saturday when an explosion damaged the headquarters of Fedecamaras, Venezuela's largest association of industry, commerce and finance. Incidents up to now have involved relatively small explosive devices. The authorities have not identified the terrorists, but government officials say that unidentified 'extremists' are attempting to create political instability and block national elections scheduled for next December. Venezuela, which has endured more than two years of political and social turmoil, including two coups attempts in 1992, has enjoyed a period of relative calm since Mr Ramon Jose Velasquez took over as president on June 5.</p>

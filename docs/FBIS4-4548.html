			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: `The Ball Is in Myanmar's Court'] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's recent three-day  visit to Myanmar [Burma] must rank as one of the more  significant development for that country in its efforts to  rejoin the world community. For 26 years to 1988, Myanmar had  shut out the world and attempted to pursue a self-sufficient  "Burmese Way to Socialism. But it realised eventually that  ideological purity does not translate readily into the material  progress a country and its people need, and Myanmar has in the  last few years been crawling out of its hermit shell. But the  world, particularly the West, has not rolled out a welcome-back  mat. Instead, regular efforts are made at the United Nations to  get the world body to condemn Myanmar and decree sanctions  against it for its repressive political regime and human rights  abuses. Singapore and its ASEAN neighbours believe, however,  that "constructive engagement" rather than the cold shoulder  will yield better results. The way to get Myanmar onto the path  of democracy is to encourage it as it takes tentative steps into  the free world. And the carrot is foreign investment, for this  is what Myanmar's leaders know they need -- and need very badly  -- to rebuild the country's crumbling infrastructure and economy.    Myanmar is trying very hard to lure investors and visitors.  Where previously foreigners would be lucky to get a 24-hour  visa, Myanmar has now thrown open its doors. Visitors are  coming in increasing numbers, but the passenger traffic at  Yangon's [Rangoon] airport is nothing like that at airports in  Vietnam and China, the other socialist states now embracing the  capitalist way of life. One reason is the intense competition  for foreign funds from not only these emerging economies of  China and Vietnam, but also countries like Indonesia and India.  These places offer more attractive investment incentives than  Myanmar. And many a businessman exploring Myanmar's potential  has been put off by the red-tape, the lack of infrastructure,  and its most unrealistic foreign exchange rate. Many investors,  especially from the West, are staying away because of the human  rights issue. Some who did venture in are leaving. American  oil giant Amoco recently closed its operations after sinking  more than US$100 million [Singapore dollar] (S$151 million)  looking for oil. Officially, the reason is failure to find oil.  Unofficially, Amoco shareholders want out because of Myanmar's  human rights record.    Which brings us to a critical part of the development  equation: Myanmar will have to show more progress on the  political front if it hopes to attract the foreign investments  it needs. In his talks with Myanmar's leaders, Mr Goh urged  them to take steps to be more open and "return to normalcy", by  which he meant Myanmar should become more like the countries of  ASEAN with their democratic elections. He added that his  impression is that while the leaders recognise this need, they  will take the necessary steps at their own pace. Those steps  have to be cautious because Myanmar's leaders have, for  instance, to find ways to bridge the problematical ethnic  divisions in the country. But take the steps Myanmar must, and  sooner rather than later. The arguments put forth by ASEAN for  constructive engagement will ring hollow if Myanmar is not seen  to be responding appropriately to the growing foreign investor  interest. It is up to Myanmar to show a sceptical world that  constructive engagement works.</p>

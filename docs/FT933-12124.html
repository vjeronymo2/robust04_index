			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Russian reformers fight to reverse decision on rouble SENIOR reformers in the Russian government yesterday struggled to reverse the surprise decision by the central bank to invalidate all cash roubles printed before 1993, a move which has shocked ordinary Russians as well as officials in neighbouring rouble zone countries. President Boris Yeltsin cut short a two-week break yesterday and returned to Moscow. Government sources said Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of the presidential staff, and Mr Andrei Vavilov, deputy finance minister, met Mr Yeltsin several times to demand that he cancel the central bank's instructions. According to one account, they had secured his agreement to issue such an order, which would include sacking Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman. The bank's decision on Saturday, if effected, would call in all Soviet and Russian roubles printed between 1961 and 1992. These would cease to be recognised from today. Russian citizens would have until August 7 to change the old notes, but only under certain conditions. First, they would have to prove they had 'earned' the notes, an apparent attempt by the bank to curb criminals dealing in large quantities of roubles. And second they could only change Rbs35,000 (Pounds 23) for cash. The rest would be placed on account with the state savings bank at interest rates far below annual inflation and could not be withdrawn for at least six months. Long queues developed outside shops as people tried to change old notes for goods before today's deadline. The rate offered by hard-currency traders for pre-1993 roubles plunged to around 2,000-2,500 to the US dollar from its level on Friday of 1,006. A series of objections came from countries within the rouble zone, including two autonomous republics within Russia. Officials claimed they had been given no warning and in some cases could not or would not observe the bank's regulations. Bank officials and foreign financial observers say the main reasons for the exercise are: To flush out large holdings of cash which could not be explained by legal dealings. To reduce inflation. To make counterfeiting more difficult. To end the ambiguity between 'Soviet' and Russian money, and to make clear that all republics which stay in the rouble zone would be subject to Bank of Russia monetary discipline.

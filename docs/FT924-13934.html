			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Leading Article: A bluff too far IF THE dire warnings currently emanating from Paris are any guide, the future of the world trading system now hangs on the whims of a million Frenchmen. That is only a mild exaggeration of the absurd backdrop to this week's farm trade negotiations between the European Community and the US in Brussels. Although the talks stalled last night, grounds exist for a deal on agriculture which would unlock the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. If the talks eventually fail, it will be due to a failure of nerve by the EC or to the French government's fear of its farmers. For the sake of a world economy in which the prospect of a Gatt deal is a rare glimmer of light, they must succeed. Both the European Commission (anxious to demonstrate that the EC is not completely paralysed by its Maastricht problems) and President George Bush (desperate for a boost to his sagging political fortunes) perceive a narrow opportunity for a deal before the US presidential election on November 3. An agreement now on agriculture would in theory clear the decks for rapid progress on other outstanding Gatt issues early next year. Without one, the Uruguay round will - de facto if not de jure - be dead, and a rash of tit-for-tat trade wars will probably ensue. Hence the shrill noises from France in recent days. President Francois Mitterrand knows that his European partners want these talks to succeed, if only because a weakened Mr Bush will be more accommodating than a President Clinton. He is also in no doubt that a Gatt deal which includes a mandatory reduction in subsidised farm exports will enrage his farming community and make his Socialist government all the more certain of defeat in elections next March. His answer is to threaten to block whatever compromise is hammered out in Brussels. Mr Mitterrand may be bluffing. Under the EC treaties, Community commercial policy is decided by a qualified majority vote. France can temporise in the hope that Germany will shy away from an intra-EC confrontation, but without German support, the only way France can stop this deal is by exercising a rarely used and legally questionable veto on grounds of vital national interest. It is hard to see how a group whose output accounts for such a tiny proportion of French GDP can plausibly be placed in that category. For the EC to retain any credibility as a body capable of concerted action on trade, the Commission and its other 11 member states must call Mr Mitterrand's bluff - if necessary by presenting him with a fait accompli. If in so doing they trigger a French veto, at least it will be clear where the responsibility for failure lies.</p>

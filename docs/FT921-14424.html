			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: ScottishPower joint venture SCOTTISHPOWER yesterday set up a joint venture company with Utilicorp United, the US gas and electricity utility, to compete with British Gas in supplying commercial and industrial customers in Scotland. ScottishPower thus becomes the third British electricity company to form a joint venture with Utilicorp in gas supplies. Midlands Electricity and Eastern Electricity joined up with Utilicorp in the second half of last year. ScottishPower will be responsible for the marketing and administration of the new venture while United Gas, the UK wholesaling subsidiary of Utilicorp, will be responsible for supplying the gas, which will be transmitted through existing British Gas pipelines. The new venture, which is named Caledonian Gas but will trade as ScottishPower, is owned 75 per cent by the Scottish company and 25 per cent by Utilicorp. It will compete with British Gas on price and also on service, according to Mr Martin Fleming of ScottishPower. British Gas is open to competition for customers taking 25,000 therms or more of gas a year. ScottishPower expects that in due course the threshold will be lowered to 2,500 therms and that by 1996 the government will throw the domestic gas market for large households consuming at least 600 therms a year open to competition.</p>

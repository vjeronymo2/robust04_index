			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F> Arrigo Levi at the Foreign Office in London; date not given:  "Europe's Future in the East"]    [Excerpts] The British are not worried about the future of  democracy in Italy. "We have no such fears," Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd told me when he received me at the Foreign Office.  "We had a meeting here last week, attended by a number of  experts, to discuss what could happen in Italy after the  elections. The conclusion was optimistic. We are all suffering  from some degree of political malaise. Freed from the fear of  the Cold War, people are more critical of the political system.  This applies to Britain and America (consider Ross Perot),  France and Germany, Spain, Japan, and Italy: There is the same  feeling that the system must change. But this is no cause for  alarm. I know Italy, and I know how adaptable and imaginative  you are. A different system will emerge, and new people, too;  but I see nobody ready to leap into the saddle of a white  charger to impose an authoritarian system."    Douglas Hurd does know Italy well. He is a former diplomat.  In fact, the final phase of that career was in Rome, from 1963  to 1966, before he left the diplomatic service for politics. I  asked him what advice he would give whatever government is  formed in Italy after the elections. "I believe," he told me,  "that the most important task for all of us in this decade is to  achieve the maximum integration with Central and East Europe.  And Italy is in a very favorable position in this regard, with  its formidable experience. This is why, with Foreign Minister  Andreatta, we proposed initiating a political dialogue with the  new democracies of the East, even before they join the European  Union [EU]; and this proposal has been accepted. Italy meets  all the conditions for performing an important role in all  fields -- economic, political, strategic. Then there is the  matter of maintaining good relations with America; both you and  we are well placed. We must also conduct a good philosophical  discussion on the future of the EU with a view to the conference  to revise the Maastricht Treaty in 1996. These are the three  things on which to concentrate."    What about domestic policy? "In domestic policy, the problem  that worries all of us is the budget. You are in difficulties,  and so are we. This is why Italy is also eager to reduce the EU  expenditure (now that it has become a net contributor) -- maybe  not using the same tone as Mrs. Thatcher, but using similar  arguments, though Italy is an enthusiastic member of the Union."  [passage omitted]    Most of my conversation with Mr. Hurd was devoted to the  subject of Europe, once again "in crisis" following the demand  by London and Madrid that the Council of Minister's voting  system not be changed -- as all the rest propose --after the  accession of the four new members: Sweden, Austria, Finland,  and Norway. London and Madrid are demanding that within the  Council (in which each of the four major states commands 10  votes, the rest proportionately fewer, down to Luxembourg's two)  the "qualified minority" remain 23 votes -- as it is now, out of  a total of 76 -- instead of increasing to 27, out of the new  total of 90. That is, they are demanding that two major  countries plus one minor one (instead of two major and two  minor) continue to be enough to veto majority decisions on such  issues as environmental and health policies. This problem,  though relatively unimportant (in practice no decisions have  ever been imposed on two major countries), has nevertheless  created an overheated political atmosphere in Britain, with a  view to the June European elections. The anti-Europeanist wing  of the Conservatives are threatening to rebel if Major and Hurd  yield on the 23-vote qualified majority. For the Major  government, which is not in good health, a defeat in the  European elections could prove fatal. So, week after week, a  decision has been deferred, and there is a danger that the  enlargement will be deferred, too.    I told Hurd that the last time I had been in the room was  exactly 14 years ago, to interview then Foreign Secretary Lord  Carrington, in the midst of the crisis sparked by Mrs. Thatcher,  who "wanted her money back." He was interested to read the  clipping from THE TIMES which headlined the interview: "Dangers  of a Family Feud." At that time I asked Lord Carrington whether  Britain's membership in the Community was in jeopardy; can the  same question be asked today? "Definitely not," Hurd replied.  "Nobody now is asking it; our membership is irreversible. We  have worked on enlargement for so many years, and we certainly  do not intend to abandon it. But serious matters are at stake,  such as the ratio between population and the number of votes in  the Council, and it is better that we do not venture into such  deep waters and that we leave these matters to the revision  conference in 1996."    Hurd said that the "centralist" vision of such founding  fathers as De Gasperi and Monnet -- which was valid for making a  conflict between European countries inconceivable -- is now  rather dated. "We are witnessing," he said, "a conflict not  between Europeanists and anti-Europeanists, but between two  equally Europeanist visions: One is more centralist, while the  other envisages a central core and a number of different  structures and sectoral policies that need not involve everyone.  This variable geometry is possible, as long as there is this  core, even though we do not all see it the same way and I do not  know now what we will decide in 1996. We are just at the start  of a great debate. But it is not only the centralist vision  that is Europeanist; so too is the other one, that of those who  do not want national states and parliaments to surrender more  and more powers to the center and have in mind something more  difficult but equally European -- a decentralized system based  on subsidiarity, better suited to the Europe of today."    With regard to voting in the Council of Ministers, Hurd  said:  "We already have a compromise between different principles, and  the future system will be a compromise, too. We want to  conclude the problem over the majority vote quickly. But we  cannot race ahead while we are still digesting Maastricht: The  EU has been in existence for only three months. We cannot  immediately start talking about the next change whenever  anything changes; and this is not the time for a major  philosophical debate or to entrust the matter to a committee of  wise men. This is a problem for the governments to resolve."    I reminded Hurd that in a famous speech in the fifties  Anthony Eden said: "We feel in our bones that we do not belong  to Europe." Have the bones of the British changed, or are they  still the same? He replied: "Of course they have changed. Even  Mrs. Thatcher knew that she was European: Even her bones were  different from Eden's, because she belonged to a different  generation. When I attend a Council of Ministers session --  which happens rather too often -- I know that this is the right  place for a British foreign secretary. But we must create a  Europe in which we all feel comfortable."    In our conversation we also discussed Yugoslavia (like  everyone else, Hurd too feels "anxious and frustrated," but he  denied that everything has failed: Most of the aid and the blue  helmets have come from Europe; but it is necessary to improve  the mechanisms of European foreign and security policy, in which  he said he is "fully in favor") and Russia. Hurd agrees that  space must be made for Russia within G-7, by turning it into G-8  for political matters: "We must be vigilant but open, ready to  involve the Russians that want to work with us, such as Kozyrev:  If the Russians are left out, they might not cooperate."

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S PICKS  </P> <P> 'MURPHY'S ROMANCE'  </P> <P> James Garner (pictured with Sally Field) won a much-deserved Academy Award  nomination as an independent-minded, widowed pharmacist in a small Southwestern  town who conducts a roundabout pursuit of a struggling, much-younger divorcee  (Field). A genuinely adult romantic comedy, written by Irving Ravetch and  Harriet Frank Jr. and directed by Martin Ritt. A true delight.  </P> <P> (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.) Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

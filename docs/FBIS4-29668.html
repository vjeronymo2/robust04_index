			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Government Regulation No:20/1994 Needs In-Depth </F> Debates on Implications and Objectives"]    [Text] Article 5 of Government Regulation No:20/1994 on the  ownership of shares by foreign investors states as follows:    "Industries, which are set up in accordance with Article 2  of  Sentence 1A, are allowed to conduct businesses in important  national and public industries such as ports, production and  transmission of electricity supply to the public,  telecommunications, maritime services, rail services, atomic  energy generating plants, and the mass media."    The focus of attention that caused public concern was the  issue on foreign investors being given permission to invest in  the mass media. The press, parliamentarians and even certain  members of the government, were observed to have reacted  strongly to the issue without making any prior effort to  understand the actual situation.    The situation became indisputable only after the president  clarified the issue to Information Minister Harmoko. The  implementation of Government Regulation No:20/1994 still needs  the president's final approval. The president will refer to and  apply the relevant existing laws and regulations before giving  his final approval.    Regarding the press, there is Regulation No:21 of 1982. The  regulations forbid foreign investors to own press media.  Therefore, in implementing Government Regulation No:20/1994,  particularly for the mass media, the president will definitely  invoke Regulation No:21. In other words, foreign investors  cannot own the mass media.    As such, it was a relief to acknowledge that the anxiety on  the issue related to the mass media had somewhat subsided.    What about the implications of Government Regulation  No:20/1994 regarding laws governing the electronic mass media  such as television -- the regulations that have yet to be set  up? For the moment, there was no reaction to this issue. It may  emerge sooner or later. This is because the electronic mass  media's implications are parallel to those of the print media.  It should be reminded that the television sector is more open  and susceptible to control by foreign investors compared with  the print media.    Meanwhile, it was observed that the decisions, which were  included in Government Regulation No:20/1994 on the mass media,  were not strongly directed toward the electronic mass media.    Such things happen everywhere. The electronic mass media,  such as the television, needs huge funds and the most modern  technology. The acquisition of programs is more of a  transnational nature. As acknowledged, the United States  dominates the entertainment and news programs.    If it were true that the foreign investors' presence in the  mass media would enhance their footing in the electronic mass  media, then they could similarly do so in the print media. This  should be food for thought.    Furthermore, we are currently facing changes to  globalization  and the information era. Strong influences are not within our  reach nor under our control.    It was also acknowledged that competition also exists in  other countries between the electronic mass media and the print  media, particularly the television sector.    In this regard, the public sector was seen to reflect a  positive attitude toward Government Regulation No:20/1994.    Government Regulation No:20/1994 should be accepted by the  public with an open and positive attitude. The public needs to  be involved in discussions, particularly in issues pertaining to  the implementation and supervision of mutual interests. If a  serious concern prevails on the part of the public regarding  such matters, then important and pertinent issues should not be  brushed aside.    The public's principal concern was that there was no  coordination during the preparation of Government Regulation  No:20/1994, which was later presented to the public. This was  observed when more than one minister stated that they were not  invited to participate in the consultations. Therefore, the  coordinating minister should provide explainations should there  be queries.    It was possible that such an issue was overlooked. Such a  move was not beneficial. Thus, the president's aides were  considered responsible for the weakness or lack of coordination.    There were numerous public opinions in this regard. There  were those of the opinion that the lack of coordination was not  a new issue while others created a humorous acronym, KISS, which  when expanded means that each official is living in his own  castle. Then there are persons who considered that coordination  had never been smooth, and the current situation remains  unchanged. It was considered that coordination is deteroriating.    The various opinions and evaluations were considered to be  constructive. One thing is clear. We need to have a smoother  and more effective coordination no matter how we may view the  current situation of coordination. The government, and  particularly the presidential aides, needs to coordinate this  issue more effectively.    Coordination is much needed because the challenges and  issues  we are facing are becoming more complex and difficult, and they  exist within a dynamic and intensifying condition -- in the  socioeconomic, sociopolitical and other sectors that lie within  the flow of dynamic reforms. Therefore, the present need for  coordination is much greater than before.    The objective, purpose, and implication of Government  Regulation No:20/1994 are ethical, far-reaching, and strategic  in ensuring the continuation of development. Its aim and  background is clear, that is, to turn Indonesia into a more  competitive nation that can attract more foreign investors.    Let there be an open public discussion on the issue of the  far-reaching implications and the possibility of finding some  alternative ways to attract foreign investments. A truly  wholesome discussion is hoped for in the effort toward procuring  optimum benefit from Government Regulation No:20/1994 and in  sharing the prosperity with the public. At the least losses  within the public interests could be reduced.</p>

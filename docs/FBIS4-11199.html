			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (DPA) -- Salvadoran President  Alfredo Cristiani said today that the peace agreements will be  virtually fulfilled in their entirety before 1 June -- the day  the winner of today's run-off presidential elections will take  office.    Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the  official  Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA], or Ruben Zamora,  candidate for the leftist coalition Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front, Democratic Convergence, and National  Revolutionary Movement [FMLN-CD-MNR], will assume the Presidency  of the Republic in 37 days.    President Cristiani noted that by the end of his term, only  a  portion of the total list of commitments regarding the National  Police demobilization and land transfers for the demobilized  military and former guerrillas will be pending.    President Cristiani made this statement following a visit  this afternoon to the El Salvador's International Fair Grounds,  his assigned voting site.    President Cristiani reiterated his government's willingness  to comply fully with the peace agreements since the signing of  the Chapultepec Agreements in Mexico on 16 January 1992.    He also stated that despite the difficulties the main  objective remains full compliance with the commitments that  ended the 12-year war.    The government is confident that the new president will  continue to comply with those parts of the peace agreements that  are pending as well as with the efforts to consolidate peace,  reconciliation, and democratization in El Salvador.    The low voter turnout became obvious today during the  mid-afternoon. These run-off elections have been characterized  by low turnout alone because, according to the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal magistrates, 85 percent of the deficiencies observed  during the 20 March general elections were overcome.    A heavy rain exacerbated the low voter turnout because  although most voting tables are sheltered, voters were dispersed  even more than in the previous elections.    There were reports of several clashes between ARENA and  FMLN-CD-MNR coalition supporters at the polls but no mention of  any serious incidents.    Political analysts and the wives of the leftist coalition  candidates emphasized that the issue is not who wins the  elections but that "everyone accepts the results maturely."    Magdalena Granadino de Lima, wife of Francisco Lima -- vice  presidential candidate for the leftist coalition -- emphasized  that unity and national consensus must prevail among the  political forces to guarantee the consolidation of peace,  national reconciliation, and democratization.</p>

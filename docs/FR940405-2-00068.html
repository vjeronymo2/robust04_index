It is expected that the average award will be $170,000, ranging from $150,000 to $200,000. It is expected that the awards will begin on or about June 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuation awards within the project period are made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funding preference will be given to applications from State health departments who are in the initial planning phase for statewide breast and cervical cancer screening.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the request of the applicant, Federal personnel may be assigned to a project in lieu of a portion of the financial assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of these cooperative agreements is to support State health departments in their efforts to develop their capacity to carry out a program for early detection and control of breast and cervical cancer. The intent is to initially enable States to build the necessary infrastructure towards providing a comprehensive breast and cervical cancer early detection program. Resources available under this program announcement may not be used to support screening and follow up services for breast and cervical cancer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities under A., below, and CDC shall be responsible for conducting activities under B., below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

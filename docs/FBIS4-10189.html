			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The government has stated that Carabineros  Director General Rodolfo Stange is morally incapable of  exercising his duties because of Judge Juica's ruling on the  slain communist leaders. The following is a live relay by  Reporter Jose Miguel Alfaro from Government House:    [Alfaro] President Frei's decision to summon General Rodolfo  Stange to suggest his retirement from the Carabineros was the  main issue discussed by Frei during today's cabinet meeting. We  have the following report on this issue:    During the two-hour cabinet meeting the president informed  his immediate advisers about the arguments he raised before the  Carabineros director general.    Victor Manuel Rebolledo, minister general secretary of the  government, explained that President Frei is not arguing about  petty issues, but defending basic moral issues.    [Begin Rebolledo recording] What the government and the  president have specified is that although General Stange has not  been indicted and no sentence has been issued, the fact that he  is being questioned virtually morally incapacitates him from  adequately fulfilling his duties as Carabineros director  general. Consequently, the Carabineros are impeded from properly  fulfilling those duties established by the Constitution and the  laws, and which all Chilean citizens expect to be fulfilled.  [end recording]    Rebolledo said there is tension between the government and  Gen. Stange, but not an institutional crisis. [passage omitted]</p>

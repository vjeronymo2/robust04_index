There is  no plan to this end, and still less to (violate) the specific  rights of Bolivian people living in democracy. An authorization  issued by a prosecutor or a judge is necessary to do this.    Speaking about the militarization of the Chapare zone, the  president said:    There is no intention of militarizing the struggle against  drug trafficking. I was never in favor of that when I was a  member of the opposition, and still less so now that I am in  government.</p>

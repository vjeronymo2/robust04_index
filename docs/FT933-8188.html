			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: GE buys Wasa unit for SKr1bn WASA, the Swedish insurance group, is selling its consumer finance operation, Finax, to GE Capital for more than SKr1bn (Dollars 122.4m). The US company, which is part of the General Electric group, has also agreed to refinance existing Finax borrowings totalling SKr3bn. The deal will strengthen Wasa's balance sheet and increase its focus on its core insurance activities. The company will make a capital gain of at least SKr330m on the disposal, as Finax has a book value of SKr669m. It represents GE Capital's first major acquisition in Sweden and is line with the company's desire to expand its consumer financial services operations in Europe. The group already has a credit card operation, Storecard, in the UK and is in the process of setting up a joint venture consumer lending business in Spain. Mr Raymond Nied, manager of GE Capital's International Business Development, said: 'We think the timing of the purchase is right as we hope the worst of the Swedish recession is now behind us.' Finax services around 400, 000 personal customers in Sweden and Norway through five companies offering consumer credit through unsecured loans and credit cards. Last year it made a pre-tax profit of SKr190m on total lending, net of provisions for credit losses, of SKr3.7bn. Profits this year are expected to at least equal last year's level. Proceeds from the sale will be fed back into the two mutual insurance groups at the heart of the Wasa group, Wasa Life and Wasa Non-Life, though the repayment of inter-company debt. The deal is expected to be completed on August 31.</p>

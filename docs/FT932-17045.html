			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / The Lex Column: The rights medicine The pharmaceutical sector is not well used to rights issues, but Medeva is not made in a conventional mould. Yesterday's Pounds 94m cash call enables it to buy another handful of ready-made products in a market too small to interest the industry giants. That is at odds with the tradition of drugs companies founded squarely on medical research. With regulation and competition squeezing organic growth across the sector, though, one might reasonably wonder whether others will be forced to adapt. The thought that Glaxo might fund a move into over-the-counter medicines with a rights issue was credible enough to give the market the shakes. Medeva's unusual approach has not made it immune from the malaise afflicting the rest of the sector. Since the company is funding its ambitions with paper, that is more than an inconvenience. On a price/earnings ratio not far above the market average, it is hardly buying from a position of strength. The price of the latest buy suggests bargains can still be found among smaller, privately-owned drugs companies. Whether Medeva can find enough opportunities to maintain its growth rate - without buying a dud or getting into unwise areas - remains an open question. Sensitivity about its rating might explain Medeva's strenuous efforts to make itself transparent. Its early adoption of FRS3 helps interpret the previously opaque record of earnings growth. The organic growth evident from recent full-year figures is encouraging. Others might end up following Medeva's path, but acquisitions will never be a universal cure.</p>

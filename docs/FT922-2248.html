			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Shareholders' agreement is valid RUSSELL v NORTHERN BANK DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LTD AND OTHERS House of Lords (Lord Griffiths, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, Lord Lowry, Lord Mustill, Lord Slynn of Hadley): June 11 1992 PART OF an agreement by which shareholders, without binding future shareholders, agree personally between themselves as to the manner in which they will exercise their voting powers on the creation of share capital, is enforceable and severable from that part of the same agreement which is unenforceable in that the company agrees to fetter its own statutory power to create capital. The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Mr Samuel Russell from a decision of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland that an agreement between him and the defendant shareholders of Tyrone Brick Ltd (TBL), a company set up by the first defendant, Northern Bank Development Corporation Ltd, was invalid. LORD JAUNCEY said that during the 1970s Northern Bank and its wholly owned subsidiary, Corporation, lent or invested substantial sums in two brickmaking companies in Killough, County Down, and Dungannon, County Tyrone. The former was unsuccessful whereas the latter prospered. In 1979 Corporation devised a scheme whereby control of both companies came to be vested in a new holding company, TBL, with an authorised share capital of Pounds 1,000 divided into 1,000 shares of Pounds 1 each. An essential part of the scheme was that the four executives who ran the Dungannon works should manage TBL. To that end 20 shares in TBL were allotted to each of them. A further 120 were allotted to Corporation, but no allotment was made of the remaining 800. On November 14 1979 a shareholders' agreement was executed by the four executives including Mr Russell, and by TBL. Although TBL bore to be a party to the agreement, it never executed it. The agreement provided inter alia that whereas Corporation and the executives were the holders of the entire issued share capital, and the shareholders had agreed to regulate their relationship with regard to management and control of the company, the terms of agreement should have precedence over the articles of association. Clause 3 provided that 'no further share capital shall be created or issued . . . without the written consent of each of the parties hereto'. On March 10 1988 the TBL board gave notice to shareholders of an extraordinary general meeting on March 30 to consider two ordinary resolutions: (1) that the capital be increased to Pounds 4m by the creation of Pounds 3.999m ordinary shares of Pounds 1 each ranking pari passu with the existing issued ordinary shares; and (2) that it was desirable to capitalise the Pounds 3.999m and, accordingly, that the directors be authorised and directed to appropriate the sum for distribution to the holders of the ordinary shares in proportion to the amounts paid up. Before the meeting Mr Russell issued a writ against the other original shareholders, claiming an injunction to restrain them from voting on the resolutions. The parties went to trial on the issue whether the arrangement was binding on all the shareholders, including Corporation which had not executed it. On that issue Mr Russell was successful and no further question thereanent arose. However, during the trial Mr Justice Murray of his own motion ordered that TBL be joined as defendant, and dismissed the action on the ground that article 3 of the agreement constituted an attempt to fetter TBL's statutory power to increase its capital and was accordingly invalid. The Court of Appeal by majority (Lord Justice MacDermott dissenting) upheld the conclusion on invalidity, and dismissed the appeal. At the date of the proposed extraordinary general meeting TBL had statutory power to increase its share capital. The issue was whether article 3 of the agreement constituted an unlawful and invalid fetter on that statutory power, or whether it was no more than an agreement between shareholders as to their manner of voting in a given situation. Both parties accepted the long-established principle that a company could not forgo its right to alter its articles (Southern Founderies v Shirlaw (1940) AC 701). The principle must apply also to the right of a company to alter its memorandum. Mr McCartney for Mr Russell argued that the agreement did not contravene the principle, in that it was merely an agreement between shareholders outside the scope of company legislation, which in no way fettered TBL's power to alter its memorandum and articles. Mr Girvan for the defendants submitted that the agreement was not only a voting arrangement between shareholders inter se, but was tantamount to an article of association which constituted a restriction of TBL's power to alter its share capital. While a provision in a company's articles which restricted its statutory power to alter those articles was invalid, an agreement dehors the articles between shareholders as to how they should exercise their voting rights on a resolution to alter the articles, was not necessarily so. In Walton v Saffery (1897) AC 299,331 Lord Davey accepted that shareholders might lawfully agree inter se to exercise their voting rights in a manner which, if it were dictated by the articles and binding on the company, would be unlawful. The agreement was intended to regulate the relationship between the shareholders with regard to management and control of TBL. However, it was executed not only by the shareholders, but also by TBL. In Bushell v Faith (1929) 2 Ch 438,447 Lord Justice Russell said a company could not 'by its articles or otherwise' deprive itself of its power to alter its articles. He said such an article was ineffective, 'but a provision as to voting rights which has the effect of making a special resolution incapable of being passed if a particular shareholder . . . exercises his voting rights against a proposed alteration, is not such a provision'. If clause 3 had been embodied in the articles of association so as to be binding on all persons who were or might become shareholders in TBL, it would have been invalid. But it was not so embodied. The significant part of Lord Justice Russell's dictum was 'articles or otherwise'. Those words appeared to recognise that it was not only fetters on the power to alter articles of association imposed by the statutory framework of a company which were obnoxious. The purpose of clause 3 appeared to be twofold. The shareholders agreed only to exercise their voting powers in relation to the creation or issue of shares in TBL if they and TBL agreed in writing. That agreement was purely personal to the shareholders who executed it, and did not purport to bind future shareholders. It was just such a private agreement as was envisaged by Lord Davey in Walton v Saffery. TBL on the other hand agreed that its capital would not be increased without each shareholder's consent. That was a clear undertaking by TBL in a formal agreement not to exercise its statutory powers for a period which could last for as long as any one of the parties to the agreement remained a shareholder, and long after the control of TBL had passed to shareholders who were not party to the agreement. As such an undertaking it was as obnoxious as if it had been contained in the articles of association, and was therefore unenforceable, being contrary to article 131 of the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986. TBL's undertaking was, however, independent of and severable from that of the shareholders, and there was no reason why the latter should not be enforceable by the shareholders inter se as a personal agreement which in no way fettered TBL in the exercise of its statutory powers. The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For Mr Russell: Robert McCartney QC and John Thompson (Sharpe Pritchard). For the defendants: Paul Girvan QC and Ben Stephens (Herbert Smith).</p>

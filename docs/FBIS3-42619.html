This document does not affect the interests of Russians who  are residing permanently on the territory of the Russian  Federation and who have the passport of a citizen of the USSR  that indicates Russian Federation citizenship. No kinds of  additional documents will have to be drawn up for them. It  concerns only those who desire to become Russians or to acquire  the citizenship of another state.    Those who have Russian relatives will have to submit an  application to the organs of Internal Affairs for acquiring  citizenship, a copy of their birth certificate, and also  confirmation of the relationship with the Russian citizens. To  become Russians, foreigners and persons without citizenship must  submit an appropriate petition addressed to the president of  Russia. Parents who are citizens of different states, in  selecting the citizenship of their child submit to the organs of  Internal Affairs a copy of the birth certificate and written  agreement on one or another citizenship of the child.    Those who desire to drop their Russian citizenship can  submit  an appropriate petition addressed to the president and, in  addition, a declaration that there are no property claims  against them on the part of physical and juridical persons of  Russia. Draft-age youths must also have a certificate from the  military commissariat, which corroborates that a notice on  callup into the Army was not sent to them.    Verification of documents concerning a change of citizenship  will be conducted by organs of Internal Affairs, and also by the  Federal Counterintelligence Service of the Russian Federation.  They will arrive at a reasoned conclusion and report their  decision to the persons concerned.</p>

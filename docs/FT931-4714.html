			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Rolls-Royce set to shed 3,000 jobs ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and industrial power group, is likely to shed between 3,000 and 5,000 jobs this year in the face of continuing recession in the industry. The company is expected to announce the cuts tomorrow when it reports its financial results for last year. The expected job cuts follow sweeping restructuring during the last two years which has seen the loss of about 12,000 jobs throughout the group. Rolls-Royce employed 64,200 people at the end of 1990 - 36,500 in aerospace  -and about 52,000 at the end of last year, with aerospace accounting for just under 30,000. Most of the latest cuts are likely to be concentrated in aerospace, which accounts for about 60 per cent of the group's Pounds 3.5bn annual turnover. The company, like its two principal US competitors, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, has suffered from the combined effects of the decline in defence spending and the sharp recession in the civil aviation industry. Rolls-Royce has faced heavy research and development costs for the Trent, the engine which will power the new generation of widebodied aircraft. The job cuts are also part of the company's continuing efforts to improve efficiency and competitiveness. Rolls-Royce is also continuing to rationalise its manufacturing, and has announced plans to shut its helicopter-engine plant at Leavesden, Hertfordshire, and a components factory at Parkside, Coventry. Analysts expect Rolls-Royce to report 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 50m to Pounds 90m tomorrow, compared with Pounds 51m in 1991, and to cut its dividend. Management, Page 17</p>

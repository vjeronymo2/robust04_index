			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The government and the Bank of Japan [BOJ] are  deeply concerned the rapid appreciation of the yen may obstruct  economic recovery. It wants to somehow change the yen  appreciation trend. Since the present round of yen appreciation  is considered to be of a mainly speculative nature, the BOJ will  first continue its singlehanded intervention in the market, and  call on the United States and other advanced nations to engage  in a coordinated intervention. If the yen's appreciation  continues, Japan plans to propose the issuance of an emergency  statement saying: "The advanced nations' governments are  concerned about the fluctuation in exchange rates." The  government also believes that steady implementation of the  economic measures previously decided upon, and further  deregulation will also be necessary.    At a news conference on the evening of 22 June, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii said: "Japan has taken firm measures in  the market, and will continue to do so." He admitted the  government had decided to intervene in the Tokyo foreign  exchange market on that day.    Regarding Japan's trade and current accounts surplus, which  is behind the yen's appreciation, the Finance Ministry said:  "There has been a clear declining trend in export volume, and  imports will further increase with the economy's recovery."    However, the government and BOJ really have a limited number  of options. The Finance Ministry and BOJ started to contact  U.S. monetary authorities in the early hours of 22 June, but  were apparently unable to convince the United States to agree to  a coordinated intervention. The BOJ intends to continue lone  efforts to sell yen and buy dollars. It will also continue to  call on the U.S. authorities to engage in a coordinated  intervention similar to that undertaken in early May.</p>

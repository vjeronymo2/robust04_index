			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / People: More power to Galvin's elbow Board moves at Waterford Crystal, the loss-making arm of Waterford Wedgwood, appear to be aimed at strengthening the position of Paddy Galvin, the chief executive, in implementing forthcoming rationalisations at the crystal glass plant in southern Ireland. Galvin will now also assume the chairmanship of the division, replacing Gerry Dempsey, who will, however, continue in his role as special adviser on group strategic affairs to the group chairman, Donald Brennan. Brian Patterson has been appointed to a new position of chief operating officer at Waterford Crystal. He was previously deputy chief executive, responsible for personnel. The two, who had formerly worked in Guinness Ireland together, are credited by analysts as having won back the initiative for management at Waterford Crystal against tough union opposition. They will be pushing through the new rationalisation measures this autumn which are expected to involve 500 more redundancies. Patterson, who sits on the Waterford board, will be nominated to the group board of directors at its September meeting.</p>

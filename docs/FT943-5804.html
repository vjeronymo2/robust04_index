			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Argentina prepares more sales The Argentine government is planning a second round of privatisations, to complete its transfer of federal enterprises to the private sector, writes Stephen Fidler. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said the remaining privatisations, to take place by the end of 1995, would include the sale of all airports, three nuclear power plants, the post office, the federal mint and the country's largest petrochemicals plant. He gave no estimate of how much the new privatisations would raise. The next round is to include enterprises which, for various reasons, it has been difficult to privatise in the past. Mr Cavallo, who was speaking to Argentine bankers, was also underlining the government's determination to keep public finances in order through 1994 and 1995. He announced a hiring freeze in the public sector, including the military, and indicated vacancies would be left unfilled. Public spending on non-salary, non-investment areas would also be cut by 10 per cent, he said. The measures would save the equivalent of an estimated Dollars 2bn this year and next. In measures aimed at bringing more control of government spending to his ministry, Mr Cavallo said all public contracts would be handled through the economy ministry, as would regional development spending.</p>

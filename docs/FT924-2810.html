			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Top Clinton officials face tough ethics code: President-elect may pick woman as attorney-general SENIOR officials in the incoming Clinton administration will be obliged to sign an ethical code preventing them from ever lobbying a future US government on behalf of foreign governments. Members of the Cabinet and top deputies will be barred from lobbying their former departments on behalf of domestic or foreign private-sector clients for five years after leaving office. Senior White House officials will also be subject to a five-year proscription from approaching departments for which they had substantial responsibility. Mr Warren Christopher, director of President-elect Bill Clinton's transition team, said yesterday these were 'the strongest standards any president has asked of his employees'. Current practice places a one-year lobbying ban on former government employees, regardless of whether it is for domestic or overseas interests. The new code will apply to about 1,100 of the approximately 3,000 political appointments Mr Clinton will be making in the months ahead. The first of these may come today, as the economic policy team, headed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as treasury secretary, is due to be unveiled. The New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Clinton was likely to choose a woman as his attorney-general. This may reflect criticism that the likely economic line-up is comprised exclusively of white males. The four short-listed candidates for the Justice Department are Ms Patricia Wald, a federal appeals court judge in Washington, Ms Amalya Kearse, who holds a similar position in New York and who is seen as a potential Supreme Court Justice when the next vacancy occurs, Ms Judith Kaye, a New York state appeals court judge, and Ms Brooksley Born, a partner in Arnold and Porter, a prominent Washington law firm. In the course of the presidential campaign Mr Clinton said he was disturbed by 'the revolving door between public service and private enrichment'. Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, was even more damning. He claimed foreign lobbyists, often former government officials, controlled the Washington agenda. However, in drawing up a code for his transition team Mr Clinton was obliged to exempt from it such senior advisers as Mr Warren Christopher and Mr Vernon Jordan, lawyers with extensive foreign and domestic public and private-sector clients. Both had to agree, however, to suspend such activities during the transition. The permanent standards, to be embodied in an executive order signed by Mr Clinton soon after he assumes office next month, will not exclude current or former lobbyists from receiving posts in the administration. Medical and scientific appointees, many of whom rely on government grants in their professions, will be exempt from it, as will be career civil servants and other former government officials hired for a different agency. These exemptions are necessary so as not to deter well-qualified personnel from joining the important middle ranks of the new administration.</p>

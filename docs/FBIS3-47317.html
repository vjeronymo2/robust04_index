			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 January Morning </F> Edition]    [Text] On 11 January, a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter  interviewed U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan Spero who is now  on a visit to Japan to attend the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks. Referring to cuts in income tax, the senior U.S. official  said: "I have heard the size of the cuts will be 6-7 trillion  yen and I expect the cuts to lead to an expansion of Japan's  domestic demand." She also said: "The effect of income tax cuts  hinges on whether income tax and consumption tax are cut and  raised simultaneously." The U.S. official suggested in a  roundabout way that, the United States hopes Japan will defer  raising consumption tax.    During the interview, Under Secretary of State Spero said:  "Both Japan and the United Sates have committed to work on the  macroeconomic area in their economic framework talks, and the  U.S. Government has already made a noteworthy advance in cutting  the budget deficit." Asked to comment on the stimulus measures  under consideration by the Japanese Government, she declined,  only saying: "All stimulus measures are matters to be decided by  the Hosokawa government." But she added: "I expect the stimulus  measures to lead to a further expansion of Japan's domestic  demand and a cut in Japan's trade surplus. That is one of the  goals of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks."    Referring to the income tax reduction, which is a pillar of  the stimulus measures, Spero said: "It has been reported that  the scale of the reduction will be 6-7 trillion yen and I have  heard the reports." But she pointed out the effect of the tax  cuts hinges on the size of the raise in consumption tax and its  timing, which is now fueling a debate in Japan.    In the interview, she also stressed the need for the  Japanese  Government to work for not only stimulus measures, but full  deregulations and industrial restructuring. She said: "I hope  the Hosokawa government will come to grips with the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks and work on a comprehensive economic  plan after carrying out political reform."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia continues to set new additional conditions on  Estonia for a troop withdrawal. This is stated in an Estonian  Foreign Ministry statement disseminated in Moscow today.    During the 18th round of Estonian-Russian interstate talks,  which began yesterday in Moscow, the Russian side set a  condition that Estonia should amend its legislation to enable  all retired servicemen to qualify for residence permits,  regardless of [words indistinct] they have lived in Estonia.  [Words indistinct] to pay the $23 million as compensation  toward the building of housing for the withdrawing servicemen on  active service.    The Estonian Foreign Ministry is puzzled by the Russian  statement (?that it is unaware of international support given to  Estonia).    The Estonian side hopes that the negotiations today will be  more constructive than they were yesterday and that Russia is  prepared to hold talks over issues which are not in conflict  with the existing Estonian legislation.</p>

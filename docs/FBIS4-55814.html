			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 21 (TANJUG) -- Tension between Croats  and Moslems in northern Herzegovina is rising again, with the  two sides exchanging accusations for a series of armed  incidents. Two Bosnian Croat soldiers were shot dead on a local  road northeast of Prozor on Friday, Croatian Radio on Saturday  quotes U.N. sources as saying. The Moslems, on the other side,  say the Croats are to blame for renewed tension between the two  sides. Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo says that Bosnian Croat  forces on Saturday sprayed Moslem positions in the Neretvica  River valley with small arms fire.    The same source reports heavy Croat troop concentrations in  the area of Doljani near Jablanica, which serves as a buffer  zone between the Moslem and Croat troops in northern Herzegovina.    Bosnian Croats and Moslems, erstwhile allies in the war  against the local Serbs, first started fighting each other in  northern Herzegovina in October 1992. The conflicts escalated  in full-size war in the spring of 1993.    After a year of fierce fighting for territories with mixed  populations in southern and central Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  Moslems and Croats yielded to U.S. pressure and on March 18  signed an agreement to form a binational federation. In  practice, however, the two sides have renewed hostilities and  their federation agreement seems to be nothing but a dead letter.</p>

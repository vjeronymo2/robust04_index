			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (12): Renowned for private clinics - Health / Barcelona's highly developed private sector distinguishes its medical care from that of other Spanish cities THE DRUG Clembuterol first hit the headlines when it was discovered in Barcelona's anti-doping centre during the Olympics - a fact which its organisers now claim as evidence of the centre's effectiveness. As part of its unsuccessful bid to win the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicines for the city, Barcelona offered the building in which these tests were conducted as the site for the agency. Barcelona has a long medical tradition, which has been strengthened by its universities. It has 11,425 hospital beds and 66 hospitals, of which the largest are the Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, founded in the 14th century. But what distinguishes Barcelona from Madrid and other Spanish cities is not so much the public health sector as the number of high-profile private clinics. Probably the most famous of these is El Clinic Barraquer, founded in 1942, which has built up a world-wide reputation in ophthalmology. Others include the Fundacio Puigvert, specialising in urology and also founded by one of Barcelona's most famous doctors, and the Institut Dexeus, known for obstetrics and gynaecology. As a result of the concentration of private centres and the number of patients coming to Barcelona from abroad, in 1987, 20 of these clinics decided to form the Barcelona Medical Centre Association, to co-ordinate the services they could offer, incorporating also the services of hotels, the Catalan savings bank, La Caixa, and Iberia, the Spanish state airline. A spokesman for the centre estimated that 60,000 patients had come to Barcelona from outside Catalonia, to make use of its private health sector, in the past two years. Xavier Casas, the councillor responsible for health at the city council, points to the improvement of the public health sector in the past seven years, which has slightly increased its share of Spanish patients. But the city council is also working with the private sector and the regional government, which has direct control over health in Catalonia, to build on the city's highly-specialised medical expertise.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Popov article: "A `Blue Sword' for Harakiri?"] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The NATO air strikes on the  Serbian positions near Gorazde created an entirely new situation  in the Bosnian war. The United States and the other Western  countries, using the mandate of the UN peacemaking forces, have  effectively entered the civil war on the Muslim side. The  events of the past few days show that the danger of the  internationalization and creeping proliferation of the military  conflict in the Balkans is increasing constantly. [passage  omitted]    The only way out of the Bosnian confrontation is peace  talks,  to which the Bosnian Serb leaders have long been urging the  Muslims and their U.S. and NATO protectors.    The NATO order to bomb the Serbian positions was given  immediately after a telephone conversation between U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister  Kozyrev, who then immediately flew to Belgrade where he held  talks that night with Serbian President Milosevic.    It does not seem, however, that even after that any  fundamentally new emphasis appeared in Russian diplomacy's  bipartite and ambiguous stance, which effectively encouraged the  air attacks. Russia is continuing to refrain from using its  right of veto to halt the aggression against the Serbs and  achieve the lifting of what are essentially genocidal economic  sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia. The appeal to urgently convene  an extraordinary session of the Security Council has been left  in midair. [passage omitted]    After the "slap in the face for Russia's prestige" (to use  Sergey Shakhray's well-known emotional verdict), Moscow is  apparently still ready to turn the other cheek for further  encouragement for the United States and NATO in the same vein!..</p>

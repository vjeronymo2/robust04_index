			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures again undermine share prices THE CITY'S increasing nerv-ousness over the UK government's electoral prospects continued to bear down on share prices in London yesterday. With any lingering hopes for a base rate cut dealt a further blow by weakness in sterling and renewed firmness in money market rates, equities suffered increased selling pressure across the full range of the market. Marketmakers again paid dearly for the bull positions built up ahead of the Budget speech. Two new bouts of selling of the March index future, as securities firms tried to regain their balance, undermined the stock market, driving the FT-SE Index below the 2,500 mark. Traders warned that the very large positions built up in futures ahead of Mr Lamont's Budget have still not yet been cleared. Futures-led selling remains a threat. The futures sector took the whip hand from the opening of trading. The March Footsie contract quickly dipped below 2,500, and the underlying stock market was forced to follow. Then, as the March contract regained the 2,500 territory, so did the stock market, trimming its loss on the Footsie from 31.3 to 20.9 at midsession. The final downturn came when sterling extended its early fall after news of higher inflation in Spain removed hopes that a cut in Spanish rates might yet open the way to a base rate cut in London. Selling of the stock index futures increased as market traders struggled to get clear of their mistaken bull stance. The March contract again closed at a discount of about four points to the stock market, where the FT-SE Index ended 29.1 down at 2,493.3, its lowest for two months. London's weakness was not helped by an early loss of 17 Dow points as Wall Street started the new session. Seaq volume contracted to 483.4m shares from Wednesday's total of 557.4m. Retail, or customer, business on Thursday increased to Pounds 1.1bn, indicating that, in addition to the futures-led activity by marketmakers, some institutions were also selling stock in the wake of the Budget and the general election date news. The setback continued to feature those stocks which had benefited from the widespread assumption that base rates would be reduced at the Budget or, at least, during the election campaign. Building material shares came back sharply. There were further losses in the retail sectors, where the collapse of base rate optimism more than offset the relatively optimistic monthly sales survey from the Confederation of British Industry. With domestic factors so firmly dominating investment sentiment, there was little activity taking place in the international blue chip stocks. Reviews of the UK Budget continued to flow from securities houses to their clients. Panmure Gordon, the UK brokerage house, taking a somewhat more optimistic view than many, suggested that a more considered response to the prospects of 'sound non-inflationary economic recovery' would send the stock market higher over the next 12 months. Robert Fleming Securities, however, warned that attention will now switch to the forthcoming election campaign. Publication is expected tomorrow of the first of a flood of post-Budget polls of public opinion which are likely to strongly influence the performance of the stock market until April 9, Election Day.</p>

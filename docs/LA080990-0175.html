			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN TARGETS GUN SAFETY FOR YOUTH  </P> <P> Citing an alarming increase in the number of children and teen-agers across the  country being killed or wounded, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and a  national crime prevention group on Wednesday encouraged handgun safety and  announced a series of nationwide television public service messages in an  effort to curb the growing violence.  </P> <P> The police chief also said that some parents should be criminally prosecuted if  they do not keep their guns out of the reach of children.  </P> <P> He chastised the National Rifle Assn. for opposing restrictions on the purchase  of semiautomatic assault rifles. "That's just b.s. they tried to present to the  American public," the chief said, adding that the assault rifle is another  weapon designed to kill people.  </P> <P> Gates said that the number of children killed by guns has increased 97%  nationwide since 1984.  </P> <P> The chief, however, stopped short of calling for stricter gun controls. Noting  that he has been a lifetime gun owner and has raised children of his own, he  urged more gun safety and training programs to educate adults on how to protect  their children from harming themselves with firearms.  </P> <P> He also suggested that new gun purchasers be required to attend firearm safety  and training classes, much as teen-agers do to obtain driving licenses. "I am  for any kind of education in buying a gun," he said.  </P> <P> Guns are the fifth-leading cause of accidental death for children 14 and  younger, according to figures released Wednesday by the Los Angeles Police  Department and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a nonprofit research  organization in Washington formed to educate the public about the risks and  responsibilities of handgun ownership.  </P> <P> The National School Safety Center estimated that 400,000 boys carried guns to  school in 1987, and the National Center for Justice Statistics said tens of  thousands of youngsters are assaulted every year by youths with guns.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, police said, 471 of the 874 homicide victims last year were  killed by handguns. Ninety-nine of the victims were under 17 years old; 20 were  under 10.  </P> <P> The Police Department said it seized about 10,500 firearms last year, 75% of  them handguns.  </P> <P> To dramatize the statistics, Gates described the "very tragic" incident on  Tuesday when a 4-year-old boy shot and killed himself while playing with a  loaded pistol in his Los Angeles home, despite his mother's efforts to coax the  weapon away from the child.  </P> <P> "That kind of accident happens over and over and over again, not only in this  city but across the country," the chief said.  </P> <P> In the 30-second television spots, which will begin airing here and across the  nation in the coming weeks, Gates is seen in his uniform, warning about the  danger of guns, particularly when they fall into the hands of teen-agers and  children.  </P> <P> In one segment, the chief waves a police report describing a child shot  accidentally by a playmate. In another, he tells the story of two school  friends who play basketball together and carry handguns in their gym bags; one  ends up dead, the other in a wheelchair.  </P> <P> Mike Horan, an LAPD firearms instructor, said gun safety is one of the first  lessons taught to police recruits, and some recruits learn to use cables and  padlocks to secure their weapons from misfiring at home. He said many officers  and gun owners store their weapons in lockboxes that fit underneath their beds,  where they are secure but handy if needed.  </P> <P> "That way you can simply reach under the bed," he said, "pull out the drawer,  unlock the box, and you have your weapon."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Leroy Pyle, an NRA national board member and San Jose  police officer, defended the gun owners' lobby in its efforts against bans on  assault rifles. He also said that the NRA works harder than any other  organization in the country on gun safety, and that the association has  enlisted 25,000 instructors who teach safety to 800,000 people each year.  </P></p>

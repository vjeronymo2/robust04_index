			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Decision announced by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and </F> Economic Cooperation on 5 October 1993: "The Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and the State  Administration of Commodity Prices: Expense Collection Methods  Concerning Warehousing and Storage Activities of Economic and  Trade Departments"]    [Text] Chapter I. General Principles    Article 1. Warehouses of economic and trade departments  (including cold storage, the same below) are the warehousing and  transportation bases for the circulation of foreign trade  commodities and part and parcel of China's capacity to earn  foreign exchange through exports. The present methods are  specially worked out with a view to urging enterprises engaged  in storage under economic and trade departments to strengthen  economic accounting, improve warehousing and storage management,  continuously offer better services, accelerate commodity  circulation, prevent stockpiling and waste, and safeguard the  rights and interests of the depositor and the depositary so that  warehousing and storage work will better serve the development  of foreign trade.    Article 2. Enterprises engaged in storage under economic and  trade departments shall earnestly implement the principles of  "working hard" and "building the country with industry and  frugality," practice strict economy, combat waste, perfect the  financial system, and strictly observe financial and economic  discipline. When conditions exist, all warehouses shall  establish an expense collection system to calculate profits and  losses and assess business results. They must have budgets and  final accounting of revenue and expenditure, do an earnest job  of financial planning management and financial analysis, and  strive to improve management.    Article 3. Warehouses of economic and trade departments with  independent accounting, be they managed by warehousing and  transportation departments in a unified way or managed by  specialized companies independently, shall collect charges in  accordance with the provisions of the present methods. (For  details of expenses standards, see Annexes I, II, III)    Article 4. The expenses collection standards for warehousing  and storage activities of economic and trade departments are  worked out by adhering to the principle of helping promote  commodity circulation and improve enterprise operation and  management. Charges shall be collected on inventories. Losses  caused by warehouses shall be compensated. All warehouses  engaged in storage under economic and trade departments shall  establish and improve various rules and regulations with the job  responsibility system as the center, strive to improve  warehousing and storage management, do a good job of the  maintenance of commodities and the safety of warehouses,  increase the utilization rate of warehouse capacity and the  soundness rate of equipment, and on the basis of the already set  cost rates, strive to cut down expenses, reduce storage costs,  and increase profitability.    Article 5. As the guides for the state, localities are  encouraged to flexibly use the warehouse rent standards of  economic and trade departments in light of their own actual  conditions and make appropriate adjustments with no ceilings set  on the downward adjustment and with the upward adjustment not  exceeding the expenses collection standards set by local pricing  departments for the same items on the same conditions.  <H5>  Chapter II. Expense Computing Units </H5>   Article 6. Charges are collected on inventories in  warehouses by the tonne. Charges for the commodities listed in  every warehouse entry or withdrawing form which weigh less than  a tonne shall be computed to three decimal places. When charges  for such commodities are computed accumulatively at the end of a  month, decimals following the tonne shall be rounded to two  decimals.    Article 7. Computing expenses by the tonne will take the  three following forms:    1. The weight metric ton: Charges for a commodity or a lot  of commodities whose volume is two cubic meters and whose gross  weight is over 1,000 kgs are computed by the weight metric ton  (gross weight).    2. The volume tonne: Charges for a commodity or a lot of  commodities whose volume is two cubic meters and gross weight is  under 1,000 kg by the volume tonne, that is, every two cubic  meters amounts to an expenses computing tonne.    3. The area tonne: For commodities which are shipped into  warehouses and cannot be piled up because of peculiarities or  because they are small and complex in size, or if the owners of  the commodities, upon the approval of the warehousing  authorities, process, select, repackage, and sort out their  commodities, the charges are collected according to the area the  commodities actually occupy and the designed load capacity of  per square meter of ground (or floor), which are converted into  expenses computing metric tons. Charges for hiring a whole  warehouse are computed according to the amount of the expenses  computing metric tons into which 80 percent of the actual area  of the warehouse and the designed load capacity of per square  meter of ground (or floor) are converted and also according to  the quota storage tonnage of the warehouse.    Article 8. As far as the commodities warehouses regularly  store are concerned, to collect charges rationally, warehouses  shall seriously calculate the gross weight and volume of each  commodity and make a package list as the grounds with which to  compute and collect charges. When commodities are repackaged,  they shall be recalculated.  <H5>  Chapter III. Commodities Classification </H5>   Article 9. Valuable commodities include computers,  refrigerators, television sets, cameras, video cassette  recorders, precise instruments and meters, special handicrafts,  historical relics, priceless scrolls of calligraphy and  painting, rare and expensive crude drugs and ready-made  medicines, high-quality tonics, and other valuables.    Article 10. Commodities needing careful maintenance include  silk cocoons, filature silk, wool pieces, knitting wool, velvet,  woolen textiles, silks, and satins and their products (including  silk, wool, chemical fibers, rayon, blend yarns, and thread and  its products), leather and leather products, fur and fur  products, drawnworks, carpets, cigarettes, wines, food, canned  food, luxurious perfumes and cosmetics, musical instruments, and  other commodities needing careful maintenance.    Article 11. With the exception of live fish and fresh meat,  cold stored commodities include commodities which need to be  stored in freezers and cold wind or air-conditioned storehouses.  <H5>  Chapter IV. Warehouse Charges and Addition </H5>   Article 12. Warehouses shall collect rents from owners for  the use of their storerooms, sheds, and goods yards. Warehouse  charges are collected according to the number of tonnes per day.  If commodities listed in a warehouse entry form are shipped  into warehouses in batches, charges shall be collected from the  entry date of the first batch of commodities, and if commodities  listed in a warehouse withdrawing form are shipped out in  batches, charges shall be settled on the withdrawing date of the  last batch of commodities.    Article 13. Warehouses of economic and trade departments  fall into four categories. They are port-yard revolving  warehouse, port warehouse, hinterland transshipment warehouse,  and other warehouses. To avoid the hinterland regions from  blindly shipping their export commodities to ports or harbors,  warehouses of the four categories mentioned above shall have  their own expenses collection standards, with the standards of  port areas higher than those of hinterland regions (for  warehouse charges, see the Table of Warehouse Charges).    Article 14. Charges for the commodities that can be stored  in the open air, with straw mats above and pads below, are  collected at the charge rate of ordinary commodities. Charges  for commodities kept in the open air, with pads but no straw  mats provided or with straw mats but no pads provided, are  collected according to 80 percent of the charge rate of ordinary  commodities and those for commodities kept in the open air  without any straw mats or pads provided are collected according  to 50 percent of the charge rate of ordinary commodities.    Article 15. Charges for hiring a warehouse as a whole are  computed according to 80 percent of the actual area of the  warehouse.    Article 16. To accelerate the circulation of commodities  kept in the port-yard warehouses and the port warehouses, a  rational storage circulating period is stipulated and additional  charges shall be collected for commodities kept in excess of the  rational storage circulating period. The rational circulating  period of the port- yard warehouses is three months. Charges  for the commodities kept in such warehouses longer than three  months but shorter than six months are collected according to  200 percent of the related expenses standards and those longer  than six months are collected according to 300 percent of the  related expenses standards. The rational circulating period of  the port warehouses is one year. Charges for the commodities  kept in such warehouses longer than one year but shorter than  two years are collected according to 200 percent of the related  expenses standards and those longer than two years are collected  according to 300 percent of the related expenses standards.  <H5>  Chapter V. Charges for Use of Manpower and Mechanical Power </H5>   Article 17. Charges for shipping commodities into warehouses  or shipping out, regardless of operational links and the use of  manpower or mechanical power, are collected by the tonne (gross  weight metric ton or volume metric ton) without exception on a  quota basis. Charges for shipping commodities into warehouses or  shipping out are collected each time (attached the Table of  Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges).    Article 18. Warehouses shall collect charges for loading and  unloading, at the request of the owner, the commodities which  are shipped into the warehouses or shipped out according to the  standards listed in the loading and unloading operation section  of the Table of Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges. Loading  and unloading charges for the operations done by social loading  and unloading teams hired by a warehouse shall be paid by the  warehouse for owners first, and then it shall square accounts  for the actual expenses with the latter.    Article 19. Charges for the commodities kept under normal  storage conditions, which owners request to be re-piled or which  have exceeded the rational circulating storage period or have to  be re-piled to ensure their quality, shall be borne by owners,  and they shall be computed according to 100 percent of the  related prescribed charges listed in the Table of Manpower and  Mechanical Power Charges. If owners request their commodities  to be stored in the other warehouse, warehouse entry and  withdrawing charges shall be collected. During the circulating  storage period of commodities, if the warehouses re-pile or  remove the commodities to other places and storerooms so as to  better upkeep the commodities or expand warehouse capacity,  whether they use manpower or mechanical power, they shall not  collect charges owners.    Article 20. Charges for weighing commodities when they are  shipped into warehouses or shipped out shall be collected  according to the relevant prescribed expenses standards listed  the Table of Manpower and Mechanical Power Charges. If owners  request their commodities kept in warehouses to be checked and  sorted out and singly weighed, re-piling charges shall be  collected from them in addition to standard charges.  <H5>  Chapter VI. Container Charges </H5>   Article 21. The container operation expenses standards are  worked out in line with the principle of helping develop  container transportation. For details, see the Table of  Container Operation Charges. The various expenses standards  prescribed in the table are applicable exclusively to collection  of charges from domestic owners by warehousing and  transportation departments. As for expenses standards for  foreign owners, they shall be set by the China National Foreign  Trade Transportation Corporation through a bilateral agreement  with foreign shipowners.  <H5>  Chapter VII. Other Charges </H5>   Article 22. Charges for warehouse labor and procedural  services in such areas as processing, selection, sorting out,  packaging, repackaging, patching up of packages in damaged  condition, pallet-assemblage, mark chopping, mark brushing,  steaming, drying, laboratory testing, and acting on owners'  behalf to receive, deliver, transport, submit goods for  commercial inspection and testing, and make customs  declarations, and for the use of special railway lines and  wharfs shall be determined by various warehouses according to  the standards set by local pricing departments or relevant  departments. If there are no local standards, the charges shall  be determined by warehouses and owners through consultations.  <H5>  Chapter VIII. Settlement of Expenses Accounts </H5>   Article 23. Warehouses shall settle expenses accounts with  owners once a month, with the settlement period ranging from the  26th of the previous month to the 25th of a specific month.    Article 24. After receiving warehouses' expenses account  settlement notices, owners shall promptly check them and  complete payment procedures, and pay in full within three days.  Warehouses are entitled to collect interests on those who fail  to do so within the dateline. Owners have three months to raise  objections to excessive or short payments, if any, and undergo  additional payment or refunding procedures without interests  paid within three months after payments, and objections raised  after the dateline shall not be accepted for handling.  <H5>  Chapter IX. Supplementary Provisions </H5>   Article 25. Charges for the warehousing and storage  activities, which are outside the jurisdiction of, but carried  out by economic and trade departments and the outside operations  they undertake using their mechanical power facilities are  computed in according to the expenses methods worked out by  local pricing departments or relevant departments.    Article 26. The expenses standards for warehouses under  supervision and management of the customhouses and bonded  warehouses are set in the light of local actual conditions and  after consultations with owners.    Article 27. The present methods shall be substantiated by  the economic and trade departments and commissions, foreign  trade bureaus, and commodity prices bureaus (commissions) of  various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, if  there are other matters not touched upon.    Article 28. Owners' burdens of warehouse charges, their  settlement methods, and responsibility for breaking contracts  shall be clearly defined in the warehousing and storage  maintenance contracts signed by owners and warehouses. When the  contracts are signed, the present methods shall be regarded as  an important basis for the related sections of the contracts.    Article 29. The power of interpretation of the present  methods shall be vested in the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations and Trade and the State Administration of Commodity  Prices.    Article 30. The present methods come into force on the date  of promulgation.

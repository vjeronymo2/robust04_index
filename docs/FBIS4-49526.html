			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yang Guojun (2254 0948 6874)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 7 May (XINHUA) -- Premier of the State  Council Li Peng met with Kenyan President T. arap Moi today at  the Diaoyutai State Guest House and held warm and friendly talks  with him.    At the beginning of the meeting, Li Peng welcomed President  Moi's third visit to China on behalf of the Chinese Government,  saying the Chinese Government and people attach great importance  to the Sino-Kenyan relationship and to the friendship between  the two peoples. He thanked their joint efforts and was pleased  to see the smooth development of their bilateral relationship.  China will continue to work together with Kenya to consolidate  and develop bilateral ties.    Li Peng said Kenya is an important country of influence in  Africa. The Kenyan Government and people, under the leadership  of President Moi, have experienced gratifying achievements in  safeguarding state sovereignty, maintaining national unity, and  developing the national economy. China appreciates Kenya's  foreign policy of peace and non-alignment, and of maintaining  friendly relations with its neighboring countries. China also  appreciates Kenya's positive contribution to safeguarding  stability and development in East Africa.    Turning to China's reform and construction, Li Peng said  China, a developing country with a large population, needs  decades of more effort to become strong and prosperous.  Therefore, the tasks ahead are arduous, and there is still a  long way to go. China has undergone great changes following 15  years of reform in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. One important  experience China has gained over the past 15 years which needs  to be emphasized is China has always paid attention to the  correct handling of relations between reform, development, and  maintaining stability. Li Peng continued, saying reform can be  deepened and economic and social development promoted only under  stable conditions. In the course of reform, China encourages  the spirit of making bold exploration and constantly summing up  experience. All reform measures should be tested in practice.  A measure will be persisted in and perfected so long as it is  beneficial to developing productivity, to strengthening the  comprehensive national power, and to raising the people's living  standards.    Moi said he would leave China for home with a full memory of  goodwill from the Chinese Government and people. The president  added that he witnessed the great development of the Chinese  economy during his visit. Moi said he wanted to congratulate  the Chinese people for their achievements, and added he has  achieved his goal of further enhancing and developing the  friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries,  particularly economic and trade relations. Moi also said he  completely agreed with Li Peng's view on "the need for each  country to choose its own path of development in line with its  circumstances."    Present at the meeting were Chen Changben, chairman of the  Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice minister of  culture; Wang Changyi, assistant to the foreign minister; and  Chen Pingchu, Chinese ambassador to Kenya. On the Kenyan side  were S.K. Musyoka, minister of foreign affairs and international  cooperation; J.J. Kamotho, minister of education; K. Kones,  minister of state in the president's office; P.L. Lotodo,  minister of home affairs and national heritage; and James  Simani, Kenyan ambassador to China.    This morning, President Moi toured the new technology and  industry development and experimental zone as well as village  and township enterprises in Beijing's Haidian District. The  President and his party left here this evening for India after  concluding their five-day state visit to China.</p>

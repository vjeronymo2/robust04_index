			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (7): Systems for the digital age - Into the future Two pioneering companies in the DTP world  - Aldus and Adobe  - announced their merger in March this year with the aim of providing systems to meet the new demands for distributing information in the digital age. Both companies have for long set world DTP standards. Adobe, founded in 1982, developed its high-level PostScript page description which allows users to output text to printers such as the Apple LaserWriter. Last year, Adobe launched the Acrobat family of software products to capture type, images, colour and lay-outs and make them transmissible between computers that have nothing in common  - except Adobe Acrobat. Aldus, founded in 1984, developed Aldus PageMaker, which allows people to design, edit and produce printed communications electronically. More than 2.5m copies of PageMaker have been sold. For Macintosh and Windows users, PageMaker is the pioneering program for turning the computer screen into an integrated paste-up board, complete with professional design aids. Both companies are innovators in creating what they call 'the desktop broadcasting revolution' with non-linear digital video editing and digital post-production production. Furthermore, a number of repro houses are moving towards the Power Macintosh  - 'by having this extra speed, it gives me another week's work in year,' argues one publisher. Speed and compatibility between desktop computers are important to users  - 'there is also a clear move toward cross-compatibility, enabling, for example, Macs to 'talk' to Compaq machines,' says Martin Hollis, an analyst with the Ashdown research group. Among the innovative pre-press products coming to the market is Kodak's CD portfolio software. This is the latest addition to the company's range of software that allows desktop computer users to create their own Photo CD discs for developing interactive sound and picture presentations. Meanwhile, basic DTP system prices have fallen dramatically, particularly at the lower end. 'At Pounds 50 to Pounds 100, almost anyone can afford a DTP software package for home or small business use,' comments Peter Foster, a consultant for International Data Corporation. Training was once a bottleneck for new DTP entrants, but basic packages are now far more 'intuitive' and user-friendly. Thus, for the novice, learning the basics of DTP has never been easier. Microsoft's 'Publisher' has proved to be one of the most popular programs for beginners. New software allows non-professional users to easily drop graphics and images into business documents, creating stunning forms, flow-charts and reports. As prices of equipment fall, especially at the lower end of DTP, users are spoiled for choice. A typical system includes a personal computer, a high resolution monitor, a 'mouse' or hand-controlled digitiser for positioning text and graphics, plus software for word-processing, graphics and page composition, and a laser printer. Colour is increasingly significant at all levels of DTP. QMS have recently launched the Magicolour desktop laser printer, priced at about Pounds 10,000, offering colour output significantly higher than colour thermal transfer and high-end colour laser copiers or printers. The financial sector leads the way in business applications for DTP with the production of rapid and attractive overnight reports for investors. For example, Smith Newcourt, the international stock brokers, have used DTP for years; the firm is now developing its DTP system as an integral part of an internal communications system. At the heart is the software package Adobe PageMaker 5.0 which the company runs worldwide on both PC and Macintosh platforms. Mike Frost, publishing systems analyst at Smith Newcourt in London, says the aim is to make the system even faster to include up-to-the-minute information-sharing on a worldwide basis. Linked to the company's electronic mail system, its reports can be published simultaneously in London, New York, Tokyo and Hong Kong.</p>

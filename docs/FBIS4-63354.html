			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's security </F> adviser General Valeriy Manilov by Andrzey Rybak; place and date  not given: "Cudgels Out!"]    [Text] [Rybak] President Yeltsin returned contentedly  from his trip to Germany. Are the Russian people sharing the  joy about the withdrawal of his troops from Germany?    [Manilov] The soldiers' withdrawal from Germany is certainly  causing mixed feelings in the people. There are people who do  not want to put up with it. But on the serious political level  there are no doubts: The withdrawal is an important and  positive step -- an expression and part of the new Russian  geopolitics. When Russia gave German unification its blessing,  all of us were aware that it had to be followed by the armed  forces' withdrawal.    [Rybak] At the same time, however, U.S. troops remain in  Germany. Is Russia thus abandoning the principle of parity in  geopolitics?    [Manilov] In former times, we insisted on parity in every  respect -- and at any price. We counted every gun, every tank,  and every nuclear warhead -- and compared our figures with those  of the Americans and NATO. When we lagged behind, the arms  production had to be increased. But the world cannot be pressed  any longer into such primitive schemes. We understood that and  agreed to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, without insisting  on a similar step for NATO.    [Rybak] Will Russia, with the troop withdrawal, not lose a  joker in the game about the Americans' withdrawal?    [Manilov] I think that it is time to put an end to the  policy of cudgels. We no longer want to threaten with our arms  potential. But the other side also has to make concessions. We  say: "One cannot untie a knot with one hand." Least of all one  that is so firmly tied as European security policy.    [Rybak] Before Germany's political unification, it was  stated that NATO will not spread to the East. However, the GDR  area was immediately integrated. Was Russia cheated?    [Manilov] Indeed, NATO did not keep its promise. This was a  bitter experience. And not the last one. There are, for  example, the bombing attacks in Bosnia. Would it have been so  hard to reach for the telephone and to brief us? Formally, NATO  was perhaps not forced to do it, but the point is the principle  of partnership, which requires certain dealings with each other.    [Rybak] In view of such experiences, has the Russian  leadership considered slowing down the troop withdrawal from  Germany?    [Manilov] The punctual withdrawal from Germany was never  questioned officially -- even though it resulted in great  technical and social problems for us. This step was important  to us in principle. In this way, we wanted to give a signal and  to provide the new German-Russian relations with a solid  foundation. Europe's stability depends on these relations.    [Rybak] Was the German debate on the troop farewell  humiliating for Russia?    [Manilov] Many Russians felt this. Unfortunately, the  German leadership lacked any sure instinct in this question. It  has not understood the symbolic significance of this ceremony:  We hope for joy and also a little bit of gratefulness. After  all, the war against fascism cost millions of Russians their  lives. Those who forget this and slam the door shut offend our  national pride. Perhaps, however, someone also deliberately  wanted to put bitterness into the cup of joy.    [Rybak] What do you mean by that?    [Manilov] There are extremists who would like to torpedo a  German-Russian partnership. I could envisage that they are not  at home at the Rhine.    [Rybak] You mean pressure from the United States?    [Manilov] I cannot rule out this scenario because the Weimar  plans did not exactly show a European hand. We in Europe have  lived together for centuries and have learned to act somewhat  more sensitively.    [Rybak] Unfortunately, there are still a few things that are  poisoning German-Russian relations. For example: Will Russia  return the German art treasures?    [Manilov] Yes, this is another delicate problem. I do not  doubt that the art treasures will finally be returned. However,  we still have to clarify some points and Germany also has to  return its booty.    [Rybak] Many Russians regard the German art treasures as a  compensation for war damage. Rightly?    [Manilov] This attitude is wrong. We certainly have to talk  about compensation. But the national cultural heritage must not  be abused for it. In this way, we would hurt the Germans'  pride. I will have the question of the return of cultural goods  dealt with in the Security Council.    [Rybak] With its rejection of NATO's "Partnership for Peace"  [PFP] program, Russia is causing confusion. Only one month ago,  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced Russia's accession.  What is going on?    [Manilov] Russia is supporting the partnership idea and is  prepared for accession in principle. However, we do not want  this partnership to remain only an empty declaration. Before we  sign it, we want to know first of all what all that means and  what rights and duties we have. There are a lot of questions  that have to be clarified.    [Rybak] Does Russia insist on a special status in the  partnership?    [Manilov] What does a special status mean? Russia is a  permanent member of the UN Security Council, a major nuclear  power. Nobody should forget these realities. It has to be  ensured that no decision of global importance may be made  without us. However, there is also another problem: Some  states regard the partnership as a protective shield against the  Russian "danger" and want to establish a "cordon sanitaire" at  the Russian border. What kind of partners are they? Russia  must not be isolated! The whole partnership would be useless  without us.</p>

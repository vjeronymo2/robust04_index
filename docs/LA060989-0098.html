			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HENLEY TO BUY OUT FISHER STOCK; DEAL WORTH UP TO $125 MILLION  </P> <P> In a transaction with a potential value of $125 million, Henley Group said  Thursday that it plans to buy back the 20% of Fisher Scientific Group stock  that it does not own.  </P> <P> Most of that 20% was distributed as a stock dividend to Henley shareholders in  April, 1987.  </P> <P> Henley also said Fisher Chairman Richard Cramer is resigning from his other job  as chief executive but will stay on as chairman. In an interview, Cramer said  he plans to devote more time to community activities and to starting up  biomedical companies in the San Diego area. Henley Group President Paul  Montrone will become Fisher's new chief executive.  </P> <P> Cramer, who has made a fortune starting biomedical companies -- including IVAC,  IMED and Versaflex Delivery Systems -- will do well on his Fisher holdings as  well. His 1 million shares are worth more than $20 million. Cramer and other  Fisher executives bought Fisher stock through an equity purchase plan, putting  10% down and borrowing the rest of the purchase price from the company at  favorable terms.  </P> <P> Henley's buyout, which would be equal to $20.50 a share, must be approved by a  special committee of five Fisher directors who are not members of management at  either Henley or Fisher. Approval is expected within 30 to 60 days, Cramer said  Thursday. Fisher stock closed unchanged at $19.25 a share in Thursday trading  on the over-the-counter market.  </P> <P> Cramer said Fisher "didn't work out" as an independent public company, in part  because Henley lost its bid to take over Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. in  1988. Henley had planned to sell the remainder of its interest in Fisher to  finance such a takeover. With a takeover no longer in the offing, Henley lost  its motivation to spin off Fisher, Cramer said.  </P> <P> Based in La Jolla, Fisher Scientific, which makes medical and research supplies  and instrumentation, reported net income of $38 million on sales of $957  million for fiscal 1988. The previous year it earned $30 million on sales of  $908 million.  </P></p>

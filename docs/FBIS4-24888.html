			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Li Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): </F> "Deng Xiaoping's Health Condition and the CPC's Political  Situation"]    [Text] In early April, the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau adopted a decision on setting up a leading  group under the CPC Central Committee to attend to Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's health. This decision was classified as top secret.  Deng Xiaoping himself prefers his health condition to be  promptly announced, lest his death one day should turn out to be  an event causing "turbulence" in the community.  <H5>  Never Have CHENG MING or TUNG HSIANG Filed Any Report </H5> Stating Deng Is Dead    Reports on Deng Xiaoping's death have been filed from time  to  time, but never have CHENG MING and TUNG HSIANG filed any report  of this kind.    This year's March issue of TUNG HSIANG carried a report  saying that Deng Xiaoping intended to change the past practice  whereby information about central leaders' health and serious  illness should be kept absolutely secret. During a meeting on  24 February, Wan Li told more than 80 veteran party, government,  and Army leading cadres who had retired or retreated to the  second line: The central authorities have accepted a suggestion  made by Comrade Xiaoping, that is, information about Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's health condition should be accurately and  promptly passed on to leaders of the party Central Committee,  the State Council, the National People's Congress [NPC], the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], the  Army, and localities, and this information can also be  faithfully passed on to friendly countries and friends who are  concerned about his health. Once there is any change in Comrade  Xiaoping's health condition, the central authorities and the  department concerned will promptly inform the public of it.    But, when should information about CPC leaders' health be  publicized?  <H5>  A Leading Group and Medical Care Group Attend To Deng </H5> Xiaoping's Health    In early April, during its seventh work meeting, the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau adopted a decision on setting  up a "leading group under the CPC Central Committee to attend to  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health." The group comprises Jiang  Zemin as its head, Qiao Shi and Liu Huaqing as deputy heads, Wan  Li and Qin Jiwei as advisers, and others as members, including  Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Chi Haotian, Wang Ruilin, and Chen  Minzhang. In addition, the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau also suggested that the central health care bureau be  assigned to set up a group to attend to Deng Xiaoping's health  care and medical service, comprising Ding Guangen as its head,  Wang Ruilin and Chen Minzhang as deputy heads, and 24 medical  personnel as group members who are to work in four shifts. Of  the 24 medical personnel, 12 are experts in surgery, urology,  and anaesthesiology, all with the title of department head or  professor. They are from seven famous hospitals in Beijing and  Shanghai, namely Concord Hospital, No. 301 Hospital, and Beijing  Hospital in Beijing; and Guangci Hospital, Ruijin Hospital,  Huadong Hospital, and the Second Military Medical University  Hospital in Shanghai.    Apparently the CPC does not want to make public the decision  on setting up that leading group under the CPC Central Committee  to attend to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health. This decision was  classified top secret, bearing the document number "Zheng 015."  The document has been circulated only down to secretaries,  deputy secretaries, and political commissars (for the military)  of the party committees of all ministries, commissions, and  offices; all provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities  directly under the central government; and all arms and services  and all major military regions.    If the information about Deng Xiaoping's health is to be  released promptly as he suggested, then should this practice be  introduced as soon as the above-mentioned two groups are  established? If the above decision is not to be announced, then  will any developments and changes in Deng's health in the future  be kept top secret and not made public?  <H5>  Jiang Zemin on Deng's Illness </H5>   When attending a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal CPC  Committee Standing Committee in early May, Jiang Zemin was asked  by some standing committee members about Deng Xiaoping's health.  Jiang Zemin said: Comrade Xiaoping's health condition is good.  The doctor has advised him to undergo seasonal medical  treatment with a view to regulating and promoting the  metabolism, and not to move around too much. He is suffering  from senile rheumatic arthritis of the arms and legs, and his  blood pressure is a bit high sometimes. He needs to limit the  time he spends on reading documents, newspapers, and watching  television.    Deng Xiaoping's ailments as described by Jiang Zemin in  early  May are almost the same as those Wan Li spoke of on 24 February.  Now that more than two months have passed, an informed source  in Beijing doubts whether Deng's health condition could have  remained unchanged throughout the period. If that were true,  then why was it that a leading group and a medical service group  were set up in early April to attend to Deng's health?    Deng Xiaoping Fears Great Chaos Will Occur in the  Wake of His Death    The reason Deng Xiaoping wants his health condition to be  promptly made known to the public, of course, is that he fears  his death will throw China into "chaos." He knows some people  in the outside world predict this. He wants to prevent his  death from being a sudden event by enhancing the transparency of  his own health condition so as not to cause social "chaos."    The news of Zhou Enlai's death was published suddenly. His  death caused the 5 April turbulence of 1976. The news of Hu  Yaobang's death was also published suddenly. It caused  "turbulence" in the late spring and early summer of 1989. But  the reason the deaths of these two leaders caused social  "turbulence" was not that the news came so suddenly, but because  of the great explosion of crises among the masses. On the  former occasion, people took advantage of the activities  mourning Zhou Enlai to vent their enmity and opposition to the  "gang of five." Similarly, through activities mourning Hu  Yaobang, people vented their dissatisfaction and anger at the  conservative forces that had controlled Hu Yaobang and had  ousted him from power.  <H5>  A Power Struggle in the Imperial Court </H5>   The deaths of dictators in totalitarian countries will  surely  lead to "imperial court coups" in struggles for power. Now  Stalin had a stroke and fell from his bed, and his maidservant  called Politburo members in, at which time Beria gave a curse,  turned around, left him, and planned the next step of his plot.  This plot was found in Khrushchev's memoirs and in Stalin's  daughter's memoirs. Similarly, following Mao Zedong's death,  the power struggle between Hua Guofeng, the legitimate  successor, and the "gang of four," which had been left over from  the "gang of five," also tended to be white-hot. If not, Hua  Guofeng would not have agreed to dispose of the "gang of four!"  At that time, Deng Xiaoping, who had then been removed from  power, was also busy. He wrote two letters to Hua Guofeng,  which was also what preceded the usurpation of power!    It is Deng Xiaoping's turn now. Obviously, the "Jiang-Li  structure," which he has chosen and arranged, is the result of  balancing the struggle among factions. Jiang Zemin is a  character of the "middle elements." After Deng's death, he will  be a partner in the "Jiang-Li structure" and Li's rival.  Moreover, in addition to the "Jiang-Li structure," other  contestants for supreme power are Deng Liqun of the conservative  forces, Chen Yuan of the elders' children, Hua Guofeng, who  stepped down, and Zhao Ziyang of the reform faction. Will they  be able to cope with them?  <H5>  Jiang Zemin Is Concerned About Danger From Outside </H5>   Regarding China's post-Deng political situation, Jiang Zemin  is now too much concerned about foreign influence.    On 4 May, Jiang Zemin called a meeting of the secretaries,  governors, and people's congress chairmen of five provinces  (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian) and one  municipality (Shanghai) in the auditorium of the Shanghai  Municipal CPC Committee. At the meeting, Jiang Zemin said:    Hegemonism, overseas anti-Chinese and anticommunist  political  parties and political forces, and Taiwan's Li Teng-hui and the  forces advocating Taiwan's independence all hope that turbulence  and civil war will break out in China after Deng's death so that  they can achieve their strategic goals. This is a dream of  hegemonist and hostile forces. They lack a basic understanding  of China's national conditions and political situation.    Jiang Zemin maintains that the danger in post-Deng China  will  mainly comes from abroad. His mistake is very grave.    He grew up under a communist culture and should know that it  is not mainly external factors that contribute to something  changing, but internal factors. He has the world in view, but  does not see things around him. It was not imperialism or  hegemonism that ousted Malenkov and Hua Guofeng from power. It  will not be long before Deng Xiaoping falls critically ill and  suddenly dies. The chain effect of this sudden incident will be  a power struggle within the imperial court. This is almost  inevitable and the destiny of communist countries.  <H5>  Tian Jiyun: The Central Authorities Do Not Agree That Deng </H5> Should Make Another Tour of Southern China    When speaking on Deng Xiaoping's health not long ago, Tian  Jiyun said: Comrade Xiaoping appeared to be tired when he sent  greetings to the people in Shanghai during the Spring Festival.  There were many reasons. Prior to that, he had vacationed in  Jiangsu. He caught a cold in Shanghai after standing on a  bridge for nearly 20 minutes in a cold wind. Moreover, he is an  old man about to turn 90. Comrade Xiaoping himself also said  after reading foreign reports: "When a man is 70 years old, he  gets weaker and weaker each year. This is a natural law.  However, the foreign reports are exaggerated."    Tian Jiyun said: Comrade Xiaoping had planned to visit  Guangdong and Hainan after this last Spring Festival. For  health reasons, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee persuaded him not to do that. Moreover, his doctors  do not agree that he should make a long trip. The general  secretary, Comrade Wan Li, General Liu Huaqing, and Comrade Bo  Yibo also joined in the persuasion. The elder Peng [Peng Zhen]  also telephoned Comrade Xiaoping, asking him to take care of  himself.    Tian Jiyun also said: Comrade Xiaoping has rested in other  provinces recently. He has another plan for a trip to southern  China. But the central authorities hope Comrade Xiaoping will  listen to the doctors' advice. I think Comrade Xiaoping will  listen.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Wholesale prices edge up in US US wholesale prices edged up 0.2 per cent in January, an annual rate of 2 per cent, maintaining the modest pace of 1992, AP reports from Washington. Increased energy costs and car prices contributed to the rise. The advance was in line with economists' predictions. Meanwhile, business sales jumped 1.9 per cent in December, the largest gain in more than two years and outpacing a 0.4 per cent increase in inventories.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As the chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee in  1994, Thailand will organize a forum dealing with security in  Asia, or the ASEAN Regional Forum -- ARF, on 25 July. Deputy  Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan talked to a VOFA [Voice of Free  Asia] correspondent about the ARF.    [Begin recording] [Surin] July the 25th will be a historic  day for the region, or even the world. Eighteen foreign  ministers or their representatives will participate in a forum  on security, stability, and mutual confidence in Southeast Asia.  The forum is called the ASEAN Regional Forum, which will stress  security cooperation and confidence building in order to jointly  develop the region into an area which is peaceful and permeated  with an atmosphere conducive to cooperation. This will lead to  economic prosperity. The theme is: whoever has an interest in  this region is invited. Whatever issues regarding the concerns,  anxiety, or lack of confidence that anyone has can be aired at  the meeting in order to create a frankness in the process to  transform the region into the most peaceful and stable zone.    The aforementioned is the philosophy set by the government  from the beginning. It is the use of preventive diplomacy [two  previous words rendered in English]. Regarding this philosophy,  problems are prevented from worsening to disputes through  dialogue and opportunities for dialogue available in the ASEAN  arena in order to eliminate misunderstandings.    The 25th of July will be a historic day for the region and  new-style diplomacy in Asia and the Pacific.    [Unidentified correspondent] What will be the issues  discussed in the upcoming ARF?    [Surin] The first currently hot issue is the situation in  Northeast Asia -- the Korean Peninsula. The meeting will  discuss how it can contribute to defusing the situation. Our  belief is that a dispute anywhere in Asia and the Pacific will  have repercussions upon the whole region. Therefore, we do not  want to see an occurrence of disputes in Northeast Asia because  it could create a lack of confidence and security in other  regions, especially Southeast Asia. We want the ARF to be a  forum for dialogue between countries, such as Korea, China,  Japan, the United States, and Russia which may have a direct  part in the stability and security in Northeast Asia. That is  the first point.    The second point concerns the problems in Southeast Asia  that  worry countries outside the region. These problems include  investment and stability in Indochina, problems in Burma,  cooperation between ASEAN and countries outside in security,  arms buildup, and making the region nuclear free and politically  and militarily neutral. These issues will be discussed in the  ARF. The smaller issues such as human rights, arms buildup, and  territorial disputes will probably be brought up as well but  they will not be points dominating the discussions. The meeting  will likely talk about cooperation to prevent future disputes,  or the use of preventive diplomacy, to gain prompt involvement  of the United Nations or its organizations in solving the  problems instead of solving them as were the case in Cambodia,  Somalia, and Bosnia.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Alicia Talavera and Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] The Nicaraguan Government said yesterday that it is  unaware of a 1993 U.S. State Department report on human rights  that includes Nicaragua. The report claims -- among other  things -- that this country "is still failing to persecute and  punish those responsible for human rights violations."    Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo emphasized comments made  last week by Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for  inter-American Affairs, at a private meeting. Watson said it  was "fascinating" that Nicaraguans had been on their way to  solving their own problems in the past few months."    "I am unaware of such criticism," Lacayo said regarding  press  reports on the U.S. State Department report, which states that  "the Nicaraguan judicial system is jammed and often follows the  guidelines of political parties." The report added that this  system has helped maintain impunity, statements that are not in  keeping with Watson's praise of the new membership of the  Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ].    Lacayo had lunch yesterday with all members of the CSJ,  which  held a plenary meeting to incorporate new lawyers. For that  reason, none of the magistrates was available for comment to  BARRICADA on the U.S. State Department report.    Claudia Paniagua, spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Foreign  Ministry, said that one must take into account that the report  is for 1993. Paniagua focused on the statements made by the  U.S. assistant secretary of state, who praised the fact that  nearly all deputies have rejoined the National Assembly.  <H5>  America's Watch, Too </H5>   U.S. Ambassador John Maisto described the report as  "concrete, objective, and balanced." He added that it deals  with human rights in more than 150 countries.    "It is an annual report. I suggest you read it carefully.  It is objective," the diplomat added, after meeting yesterday  with Assembly President Luis H. Guzman.    A report by the Americas Watch human rights group also  states  that the human rights situation in Nicaragua in 1993 continued  to be characterized by a highly polarized political environment  and a weak central government. That report makes a similar  comment about the Nicaraguan judicial system.    The Americas Watch report criticizes the "disproportionate  and excessive" use of force on various occasions, especially  against armed groups, labor strikes, and peaceful protests.    Incidentally, Mrs. Cinthia Arnson of Americas Watch is  currently visiting Managua. In the past two days she has met  with government officials, military judge advocates, the  government minister, and leaders of the main human rights groups.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / China tightens credit to prevent economy overheating CHINA'S central bank has acted to tighten credit in an attempt to prevent the economy from overheating as a result of rapid growth, its governor said yesterday. Li Guixian, governor of the People's Bank of China, said during a visit to London that the economy had been growing at an annual rate of 11 per cent during the first quarter of 1992. Industrial production was up by 18 per cent, and imports by 23.5 per cent, while exports were up only 12.5 per cent. The People's Bank has imposed special reserve requirements on banks - increasing the proportion of their deposits which they must lodge with the central bank - and tightened credit ceilings. Li said it was considering increasing interest rates, but would not take a final decision for two or three months. China's economy has gone though a series of boom-bust cycles in the past decade. The most recent retrenchment was relaxed last year, and economic growth was boosted in January when Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount leader, exhorted the nation to undertake more radical reform. Asked whether the latest measures would cause another sharp drop in economic growth, Li said: 'I do not think that we will have another similar slump as in earlier years, because we have learned from experience. Now we are mainly relying on monetary policy to maintain GNP growth at 8 to 9 per cent.' His actions to restrict credit may indicate official fears that inflation is running at a higher level than figures suggest. First quarter statistics show inflation of 5 per cent, compared with last year's 3 per cent. However, economists believe that in some areas inflation is significantly above the official figure. Li said he would take measures to tighten credit if inflation was above 10 per cent, and to loosen if inflation fell below 5 per cent. 'I am very confident that inflation this year will be under control at 6 to 7 per cent because our monetary policy is effective.' The government was continuing with reforms of banks and state-owned industries, Li said, such that loans would be made only to profitable enterprises making marketable, high quality products. However, he admitted that the bankruptcy law had not been applied because there was no social security system to cope with unemployment. 'No effort is being spared to improve the social security system. Once it has been fully established, the bankruptcy law will be fully and strictly implemented.' On the development of China's stock markets, Li said it was unlikely that a third exchange - after Shanghai and Shenzhen - would be opened in the next three to five years. It was necessary to strengthen regulations and increase public awareness. China should take note of previous stock market collapses in other countries: 'It is more important to learn from the experiences of failure than success.'

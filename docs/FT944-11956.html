			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Poor returns from US purchases, study says Foreign companies have suffered poor and declining returns on their US acquisitions in recent years, but could see a rebound in overall profitability in the near future, according to a study by two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The two, Mr David Laster and Mr Robert McCauley, note that foreigners have paid Dollars 316bn to buy US companies over the past decade, but lost money overall on their holdings in 1992 - a year of record profits for US-owned companies. The performance, the authors say, 'strikes many as unbelievable'. They attribute the results to the tendency of foreign companies to buy poorly-performing US businesses, and to attempt to rebuild them through fresh investment. 'These companies paid top dollar for underperforming US firms, borrowed heavily, and then spent freely on investment and marketing,' the authors say. The overall poor performance of foreign-owned firms in 1992 also reflects the heavy level of purchases in recent years, with many of the businesses still in the early phases of planned turnrounds. With fewer purchases now, and with some foreigners shedding their loss-making US companies, overall profitability will rise in the coming years, according to the Fed study. UK companies were the biggest foreign investors in the US last year, and this year should see their total US investments overhaul those of Japanese companies, according to a study of foreign direct investment by Arthur Andersen. The accounting firm puts investment by UK firms either in acquisitions or creation and expansion of businesses at Dollars 9.03bn last year, four times the level of 1992. Japanese companies invested Dollars 1.8bn, down from Dollars 2.9bn the year before.</p>

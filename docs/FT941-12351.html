			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Careers review for forces ordered Career structures, pay and conditions for Britain's 270,000 armed forces personnel are to be subject to a top-to-bottom independent review, it emerged yesterday. The review will examine all aspects of service employment including pay and allowances such as private school fees, local overseas and lodging allowances, length of service, promotion, manpower numbers and ranks. The review threatens to exacerbate the damage caused to forces' morale by personnel cuts and continuing pressure on funding and new equipment. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has ordered the review as part of a drive to cut defence costs. Public expenditure cuts agreed between the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury last November have forced the MoD to lower its medium-term spending plans by about Pounds 750m a year. The career and pay review is, however, independent from the MoD's 'defence costs study' into efficiency improvements, which was launched in the aftermath of the November Budget. A review team is due to begin work in the spring, headed by an independent chairman. It is expected to have between three and five other independent members. The exercise, the first of its kind for many years, is comparable to the Sheehey review into police career structures. But defence officials said the armed forces study would be more complex in view of the services' worldwide role. 'This is to take account of changes in military commitments and deployment patterns and to ensure that the career management and remuneration of the armed forces are appropriate to the early part of the 21st century,' the MoD said. No deadline has been set for completion of the review, and the members of the team have still to be named.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and Anna </F> Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- The civic accord signed at  the Kremlin today is reviving the ancient Russian tradition to  resolve arising problems together.    Now Russia is facing a new task: to broaden the framework of  this memorandum, make it a pact not only between authorities and  political forces but also an agreement among all citizens of the  country. This was said today by participants of the ceremony of  signing the accord at St. George's hall at the Kremlin.    Those chapters of the document in which the parties pledge  to  strengthen the federal system and national relations, are giving  the hope for the soonest and peaceful settlement of inter-ethnic  conflicts.    "The accord is opening the way to peace in Caucasus,"  President of Ingushetia Ruslan Aushev told ITAR-TASS in an  interview. He expressed the wish that the conciliatory  commission which would control the implementation of the terms  of the accord, should pay close attention to the "working out of  a mechanism for its enforcement so that this document would not  repeat the sad fate of many earlier concluded agreements".  President of North Ossetia Aksarbek Galazov shares Ruslan  Aushev's standpoint.    President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaimiyev expressed a  specific attitude to the signed accord: He will insist on  additions to the document concerning Tatarstan.    President of Ingushetia is counting on concluding a  bilateral  treaty with Russia.    It is noteworthy that even those several political leaders  who did not sign the accord -- leader of the communist Party of  the Russian Federation Gennadiy Zyuganov, and chairmen of  representative bodies of power in the Kemerovo and Vladimir  Regions, Tuleyev and Vinogradov, were present at the ceremony  not wishing to be considered opponents of the accord.    "Our party has made a decision to continue a dialogue no  matter what the situation is because civil war is not our  choice. We are participating in all processes which lead to  reconciliation, and are prepared to cover our part of the road  for reaching this all- national purpose," Gennadiy Zyuganov told  ITAR-TASS.    Participants in the ceremony of signing the document were  unanimous to think that the signed accord is not a tribute to  the momentary political situation but a prologue to the revival  of a strong great power.</p>

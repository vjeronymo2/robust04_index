			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / People: Gardner goes back to GEC-Marconi Roy Gardner has been made managing director of GEC-Marconi, the General Electric Company's Pounds 3bn-a-year defence arm. He replaces David Fletcher, who held the job for only 18 months. The change was made discreetly last month, in accordance with the publicity-shy traditions of the GEC group. Gardner, who is 47, was brought back into GEC-Marconi as Fletcher's deputy in September.

His first move in his new job, announced yesterday, has been to merge four subsidiary companies into a new grouping, GEC-Marconi Avionics, encompassing activities from airborne radar to flight controls and power systems. The new company, with annual sales of about Pounds 850m and 13,000 employees, can lay claim to being the biggest in Europe in the avionics sector. Gardner's background in finance contrasts with that of Fletcher, an engineer who has spent his whole career at GEC-Marconi. In the managing director's post, Fletcher made his mark with a confident and innovative approach to new business and new inter-company links. Although losing his executive responsibilities, Fletcher has been appointed a deputy chairman of GEC-Marconi, increasing the number of chairmen and deputy chairmen to five. His remit is to help develop new business and joint venture opportunities, including collaboration with foreign companies. GEC chose to restrict its public announcement of the management change to the trade press.

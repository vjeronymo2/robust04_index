Andres  Garcia de la Cruz, executive secretary of the Atomic Energy  Commission of Cuba, said that the agency should demand that the  known nuclear powers honor their commitment to end the nuclear  arms race and to disarm, a commitment set 25 years ago. Garcia  de la Cruz made these comments during a meeting of the agency's  Board of Governors, and he insisted on the adoption of a new  policy to strengthen the efficiency of the safeguard  [salvaguardia] system.    Garcia de la Cruz also pointed out that, before proceeding  with the implementation of these programs, it is necessary to  establish an adequate legal framework and to proceed with the  programs without waiting for the results of the technical and  economic evaluation to determine their implications from the  legal standpoint.</p>

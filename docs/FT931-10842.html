			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: US eye drug link-up for Fisons THE NEW management at Fisons, the drugs and scientific instruments group, yesterday broke with the company's tradition of complete independence by announcing a strategic alliance in the US. The link-up is with Allergan, one of the leading US medical ophthalmic companies. It allows the two companies to co-promote Acular, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which Allergan has licensed from Syntex, the California-based group. Fisons and Allergan have also agreed to co-operate on the relaunch of Opticrom, a Fisons eye product which was withdrawn in the US following concerns by the Food and Drug Administration about its quality. Fisons said yesterday the agreement did not indicate that the product, which had US sales of about Dollars 11m (Pounds 7.2m) before its withdrawal, was likely to be relaunched in the near future. Allergan will also help Fisons develop and market Fisons' nedocromil sodium ophthalmic solution, another eye product. The British group said it had a sales force of about 300 in the US, while Allergan had about 160 devoted to Acular. The product has just been licensed by the FDA and is due to be launched soon.</p>

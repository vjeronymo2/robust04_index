			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> 3 MEN SENTENCED FOR SELLING CRACK  </P> <P> A Ventura County Superior Court judge sentenced three men to prison Tuesday for  selling crack cocaine from a dilapidated house in west Ventura.  </P> <P> Alonzo Haynes, 38, was sentenced to five years for maintaining a house for  illicit narcotics sales and selling crack cocaine; Duchon Fields, 23, was  sentenced to five years and four months for two counts of selling crack  cocaine; and Dexter Williams, 23, received a five-year sentence for one count  of selling crack cocaine.  </P> <P> But Judge Charles R. McGrath suspended sentencing until all three men undergo  psychological testing. If the tests find that they are drug addicts, the men  could serve their time undergoing drug treatment at the California  Rehabilitation Center, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jimmie Grunert said.  </P> <P> Haynes will also be examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist to determine  whether his combat duty in Vietnam from 1970 to 1971 caused post-traumatic  stress disorder, Grunert said. If Haynes is found to be suffering from the  combat-related illness, he could be sentenced to federal prison instead of  state prison, Grunert said.  </P> <P> The men were arrested in a Feb. 26 raid on the house at 948 Olive St. by SWAT  teams from the Ventura Police Department and the county Sheriff's Department.

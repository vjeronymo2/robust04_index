			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT LAND-USE LAW GETS TEETH;  </P> <P> COMPLIANCE: LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICIALS CONTEND LAW TO CONTROL BUILDING TOO  VAGUE, MAY SEEK LEGAL OPINION FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL.  </P> <P> For years, many local governments in California have ignored a 1970 law that  requires detailed land-use plans around large airports.  </P> <P> Even after the law was broadened in 1984 to include most of the state's  airports, many local governments failed to comply.  </P> <P> But now, legislative staffers and airport officials say, a new law that puts  teeth into the earlier statutes could curb development of hotels, homes and  industrial parks around such airports as Los Angeles International and San  Diego's Lindbergh Field, where no plans have been completed.  </P> <P> State transportation officials estimate that plans have been completed for only  57% of the state's 269 airports.  </P> <P> Citing the poor compliance record, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach)  last summer easily won passage of a bill -- which becomes law Jan. 1 -- to add  a significant new step to ensure that developments are compatible with  airports.  </P> <P> Under the law, if an airport does not have a plan, most construction projects  -- possibly as far away as 2 miles from airports -- will need approval from  county airport land-use commissions as well as local governments.  </P> <P> The developments still could get the green light but "only under very limited  conditions" until comprehensive land-use plans are finished, according to a  fact sheet on the law prepared by Bergeson's Senate Local Government Committee.  </P> <P> The law sets a June 30, 1991 deadline for completion of the master plans. But  Los Angeles County officials are questioning whether the law applies to them  because of vague wording -- an assertion disputed by Bergeson.  </P> <P> Legislative aides said the 1970 law directed the Regional Planning Commission  to conduct the airport land-use study for Los Angeles County. But county  officials say the section of the law that applies just to Los Angeles may be so  vague that it exempts the county.  </P> <P> A clarifying opinion may be sought from Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, said  John Huttinger, a planner with the Los Angeles County Regional Planning  Commission. But in the meantime, Huttinger said, he making plans to enforce the  law.  </P> <P> "I can't believe the Legislature decided that the largest county in the state  should be exempt from this law," said Fred Stewart, who oversees planning for  Caltrans' aeronautics division.  </P> <P> Bergeson said she was surprised by the county's reaction, maintaining that such  questions were not raised during legislative hearings. It's "rather bewildering  that would occur now," she said.  </P> <P> Not complying with the law has resulted in the "erection of skyscrapers, radio  towers and other tall structures in dangerously close proximity to our  airports," according to Mark Pisano, executive director of the Southern  California Assn. of Governments.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), a pilot who supported the Bergeson  law, said it was long overdue because cities "continue to let this rapid  development go unchecked around these airports."  </P> <P> The law has airport managers and planners scrambling to determine its impact on  commercial growth.  </P> <P> No plans have been completed for any of the 16 airports in Los Angeles County,  according to state transportation officials. As a result, airport managers in  the county predict some construction delays, but say it is too early to tell  whether the law will affect any major projects -- such as a 400-acre  development on the north side of LAX.  </P> <P> "I'm not prepared to tell you now whether we have a problem or not," said Bill  Schoenfeld, deputy executive director of the Los Angeles Department of  Airports.  </P> <P> At John Wayne Airport in Orange County, a plan has been completed, so officials  say that the county's airport land-use commission will not get final authority  to make planning decisions there.  </P> <P> In San Diego, a study of Lindbergh Field has not been completed, according to  Jack Koerper, special projects director for the San Diego Assn. of Governments,  which has responsibility for the plan.  </P> <P> Koerper could not say what projects around Lindbergh Field might be affected.  Earlier this year, the San Diego City Council approved construction of a  10-story office building 80 feet north of the approach corridor -- a proposal  that aroused concerns.  </P> <P> Planners in Los Angeles County suggested that most airports in the county are  in heavily urbanized areas and won't be affected. However, they said that among  the developments that could be affected are a controversial proposal to build  52 homes and an office building under the departure pattern at Torrance  Municipal Airport and the possible addition of high-rises in Century City under  the Santa Monica Airport flight path.  </P> <P> At a minimum, the new law is expected to delay projects around airports. "The  potential is certainly there for an overwhelming change" in the way airport  hotels, industrial parks and other commercial structures are approved,  Huttinger said.  </P> <P> While the law is vague on the area for which a plan must be completed,  Bergeson's committee says it would be within a 2-mile radius of airports.  </P> <P> In the 1960s, the Legislature began wrestling with the issue of growth around  airports as land was gobbled up for homes, hotels and other buildings.  </P> <P> By 1970, it required land-use studies around large airports with commercial  service. That requirement was extended to most of the state's general aviation  airports in 1984. But many counties ignored it, citing a lack of funds and a  failure of the Legislature to provide a deadline for compliance.  </P> <P> Last year, Van de Kamp's office said the only way to force the adoption of  land-use plans would be a lawsuit to stop all development near an airport until  local officials complied with the law.  </P> <P> Under Bergeson's law such lawsuits could not be filed until land-use plans are  adopted or until June 30, 1991, when the law mandates that such plans be  completed.  </P></p>

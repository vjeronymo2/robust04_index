			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yakov Plyays, doctor of historical sciences: </F> "Russia and Central Asia: Evolution of the Foreign Ministry's  Ideas on the Country's Interests in the Region"]    [Text] With the disintegration of the USSR and the  formation of the CIS, an important new phenomenon has emerged in  the world: the foreign policy and other relations between  Commonwealth countries and also these countries' relations with  the rest of the outside world. As experience shows, these  relations are shaping up in complex and frequently dramatic  fashion even. The priority relations within the CIS are those  between Russia and its Commonwealth partners. It is Russia that  is having to seek solutions and approaches that were never  practiced formerly.    Of the overall directions of Russia's foreign policy which  have been identified in the just over two years of the CIS'  existence, and this means the Baltic, Belarus, Ukraine, the  Transcaucasus, Central Asia, and, finally, interior regions, the  most complex is the Central Asia direction. The further things  progress, the more it is this region that is creating for Russia  as a whole and for its Foreign Ministry in particular most  complex problems.  <H5>  Reasons for Russia's Interest in Central Asia </H5>   Although this way of framing the issue does not at first  sight seem all that warranted (the dramatic Russian-Ukrainian  relations, the problems of the Transcaucasus republics,  relations with the Baltic, and so forth immediately come to  mind), it is, in my view, perfectly legitimate. For the  following reasons, at least:    on account of the strategic importance of the Central Asia  region for Russia. It has since ancient times been indisputable  both from the military and economic and any other viewpoints;    on account of the growing penetration of Russia via Central  Asia by Islamic extremism, which is fraught with the danger of  the proliferation of weapons, social tension, and civil war  throughout this space;    on account of the active development of the international  and, particularly, religious ties of the states of Central Asia,  which are reported regularly by the news media and which are  already bearing certain fruit, and this is for Russia not only  of positive significance (inasmuch as it is reducing its  economic burden to a certain extent) but also negative  significance: markets for the sale of its industrial products  and raw material sources are narrowing, the most complex problem  of hundreds of thousands of refugees is having to be resolved,  and so forth.    There are more than sufficient examples showing that these  ties are developing dynamically. And nothing bad should be seen  in this (the Soviet republics should have had this opportunity  since the time they emerged). It is important merely that the  international ties not develop to the detriment of the CIS  partners. Were, on the other hand, the strengthening of the  independence of the countries of Central Asia, as also the  development of their international relations, to be accompanied  by a weakening of economic and other ties to Russia, this would  for the latter be fraught with the emergence in the  not-too-distant future of problems of the movement and  demarcation of its borders, the division of contiguous  territories, with Kazakhstan specifically, and so forth, the  resolution of which would not only be incredibly complex but  also fabulously costly and manifestly beyond the capacity of the  thoroughly undermined Russian economy. Such a version of the  development of events cannot, unfortunately, be ruled out,  particularly if we bear in mind the trend toward the regional  exclusiveness of the Central Asian states, which was manifested  shortly after the signing of the Belovezha Agreement and which  has clearly intensified in recent months, particularly in the  course of Russia's maladroit maneuvers around the creation of a  common ruble zone.    Speaking of the reasons for Russia's attraction to and  interest in the Central Asia region, the reverse interest has to  be seen also. But the reasons for this interest are now far from  what they were not so long ago. Thanks primarily to Russia,  these countries have not only risen to a new level of  development but, and this is the main point, have acquired a new  national self-awareness and become, it may be considered, quite  modern nations with a highly developed sense of national pride.  It follows from this that they are considerably more capable of  defending their own interests than before. But militarily their  dependence on Russia and the common defense system is, as  before, great, if not absolute. But is this the main dependence?  Has not the economic aspect become more important than the  military aspect for the modern state?    The said reasons are today, generally, recognized by the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. This is clearly indicated  by, specifically, the interviews of former deputy foreign  ministers Georgiy Kunadze, who was until recently in charge of  this area, and Anatoliy Adamishin, who also dealt with problems  of Central Asia (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 29 and 30 July 1993).    If there really is understanding (and this is not to be  doubted), to what extent is the present practical policy of the  Foreign Ministry in the Central Asia direction adequate to the  country's interests? In addition, how has Foreign Ministry  policy in respect to Central Asia in the years of Russia's  independence evolved?  <H3>  Evolution of the Foreign Ministry's Views on Relations With  the Countries of Central Asia </H3>   The evolution of the views of the Foreign Ministry has been  expressed primarily in the actions of this institution and also  in the change of opinions of its leaders.    Let us see how it has occurred.    A month after the August (1991) putsch, when there was still  a Union Foreign Ministry, Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Russian  foreign policy department, said that the foreign policy  interests of the Russian state should be subordinated to the  historical mission of the conversion of Russia "from a dangerous  sick giant of Eurasia into a participant in the Western  coprosperity zone." As the sovereignty of the republics  strengthened and centrifugal sentiments grew, particularly in  October-November 1991, the position of the Russian head of the  foreign policy department underwent pronounced changes. While  continuing to maintain that "the pointer still moves toward the  United States, West Europe, and Japan," that is, toward the most  developed Western countries, Kozyrev at the same time defined  the first circle of Russia's interests horizontally--the  sovereign states situated on the territories of the former Union  republics.    Despite the fact that by the start of 1992 the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of Russia, as, most likely, the Russian  leadership as a whole, had a general idea of how to build  relations with the former Union republics, this cannot be said  in respect to Central Asia.    The misunderstanding of Russia's new policy in this region  was directly reflected in the work of our embassies in the  Central Asian states. Immediately after they had been opened, in  the fall of 1992, they encountered a multitude of problems--a  lack of both official and residential premises and a clear  understanding of the specific missions and directions of work.  It was for this reason also, I believe, that Filipp Sidorskiy,  ambassador of the Russian Federation in Uzbekistan, termed the  near abroad "a zone of risk-fraught diplomacy."    The situation was complicated by the fact that the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not up to a certain point (when  things became hot on the Tajik-Afghan border and when the threat  of the penetration of Russia by Islamic extremism had become  real) paid sufficient attention to the Central Asia problem.  Prior to the events on the border, the attitude of the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs of Russia toward this region had been  manifestly different. The business of Minister Kozyrev's tour of  Central Asia, which was interrupted on 8 April of last year, is  highly indicative in this respect.    Up to a certain point (until the spring-summer of 1992) the  Central Asia direction had been discerned in only very nebulous  fashion in the Foreign Ministry's activity as an independent  direction and could be viewed merely in the context of Russia's  general policy in relation to the CIS members. This policy  proceeded, in my view, mainly from the fact that, following the  acquisition of independence, each Commonwealth country was  required to arrange its destiny independently and least of all  from the fact that the monolithic nature of the former Soviet  Union excluded immediate and, in addition, uncoordinated steps  of its individual members, albeit former, inasmuch as they would  certainly be detrimental to the rest.    In this period the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  pursued, in my view, two main missions: the first: furthering  Russia's entry into the circle of the world's most developed  states; the second: contributing to the formation of a viable  commonwealth of former Soviet republics.    Having very soon convinced itself that accomplishing these  two missions was extraordinarily difficult (to put it no more  strongly), the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs switched,  under the pressure of circumstances, to a resolution of specific  problems in defined areas. It was at this time that both the  Russian-Central Asia direction and the particular Tajik  direction took shape. This stage, like the preceding one, did  not, in my view, last long: just several months--from  spring-start of summer 1993 through September of the same year.    Having convinced itself that it was difficult to achieve any  positive results in these directions also, the Russian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs adopted a policy of the formation of a closer  alliance of the former Soviet republics. An important moment in  the realization of this policy were the negotiations of the  heads of state of the CIS in Ashgabat on 23-24 December 1993  devoted to the creation of an economic union, in the main. It  may be assumed that subsequent efforts also will develop in this  direction.    What kind of new relations should Russia have with the  countries of Central Asia in this case?  <H3>  Possible Versions of the Development of Russian-Central  Asian Relations </H3>   In deciding the question of relations with the countries of  Central Asia, Russia should on the one hand not lose sight of  that to which these countries aspire and the kind of development  model that will, most likely, take with them and, on the other,  that to which Russia itself aspires and its development model.  Nor can the external orientation of this model or the other be  forgotten either.    Even now the differences are very appreciable and will, of  course, be even greater. A great deal follows from this both for  Russia and for the Central Asian states.    What are the possible versions of the development of the  situation? They are, in my view, three.    1. The situation develops in accordance with the scenario  that is predominant at this time. Russia endeavors to  restructure its social and political and economic system in a  Western, monetarist key, whereas the Central Asian states will  try to realize something akin to the Chinese development model  with all its attributes. The parties will move further and  further away from one another here. Sooner or later this will  inevitably signify the need for a solution of the problems of  borders, including new borders for Russia, and the problem of  disputed territories both between Russia and these states and  between the Central Asian states themselves. Unless it is  forgotten that there have never been precisely drawn borders  here, it may be confidently maintained that it will hardly be  possible to avoid most serious conflicts and a big war. If we  add to this the expansion of Islamic extremism and the tension  that accompanies this process, we could arrive at the perfectly  definite and clear conclusion that this tragic version suits  neither Russia itself, nor the countries of Central Asia, nor  the entire world community as a whole. And inasmuch as it is  this version that is currently predominant, Russia should do as  much as it can to interrupt this development of events.    2. Russia "adapts" its development to the development of the  countries of Central Asia, that is, takes as the basis a  likeness of the Chinese model. In my view, this was possible up  to August 1991, more precisely, before the middle of 1990. But  this is now no longer possible. And not only because there is no  unified force regulating the processes of social development but  also because the parties have already gone quite far in their  separate ways.    3. Russia does not copy the Western countries but develops  in  accordance with its own salient features as a Eurasian state, in  a close alliance with the countries of Central Asia, creating  which is as yet still possible. At a price of considerable  mutual concessions, it is true. There is no other way. Russia is  condemned to this path, if it wishes to avoid a great tragedy.  The sooner and more assuredly this version is implemented, the  better it will be for all. But we are already late, and this is  leading to growing losses.    A voluntary alliance of Eurasian states created on the  territory of the former USSR would not only halt the present  destructive processes in this space but also avert a catastrophe  of immense proportions.    But events are as yet, unfortunately, developing mainly  according to the first scenario, from which it follows that it  is the Central Asia direction that is potentially the most  dangerous for Russia.</p>

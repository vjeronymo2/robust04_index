			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Romania vote fails Romania's left-wing minority government has survived its fifth no confidence motion since taking office in November 1992, writes Virginia Marsh from Bucharest. The opposition brought the motion on grounds that the government's economic policies had failed, it had violated the constitution and many of its members were corrupt. Opinion polls show that 74 per cent of the public do not think it is doing a good job. The opposition has also begun moves to impeach President Ion Iliescu. Parliament is due to debate the issue next week.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Romania granted MFN status THE decision by the US Congress to grant Most Favoured Nation status to Romania has normalised relations between the two countries and will help Bucharest continue with market-led reform, the Romanian government said yesterday. Tuesday's vote in the House of Representatives overturns a decision by Congress last year. Other countries denied MFN status include Cuba, Vietnam and North Korea. A few ex-Soviet republics are applying. Since 1988, when dictator Nicolae Ceausescu unilaterally cancelled MFN, Romanian exports such as furniture, glass and textiles have faced 35-90 per cent US tariffs.</p>

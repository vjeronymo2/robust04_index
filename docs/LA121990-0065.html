			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DESIGNATES WATTS TOWERS A LANDMARK  </P> <P> Los Angeles' Watts Towers, the soaring spires Sabato (Sam) Rodia spent more  than 30 years building, have been declared a national landmark, officials said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rodia, an unschooled Italian immigrant, used pliers, a hammer and wire clippers  to build what critics regard as an act of visionary architecture.  </P> <P> Once threatened with demolition, the structures at 1765 E. 107th St. are now  undergoing extensive restoration. Watts Towers' designation as a national  landmark will qualify it for various federal funds and private grants it may  not have been able to attract before, said John Outterbridge , director of the  Watts Towers Arts Center.  </P> <P> "We here on site are very happy," Outterbridge said. "We always felt that the  Watts Towers, like the Watts community, has been nationally prominent for many,  many years. Residents of this community who have been caretakers (of the  towers) for years are due just this kind of prominence."  </P> <P> The designation of the Watts Towers as a national landmark by Secretary of the  Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. increases the focus on the structures "as a national  treasure," Outterbridge said.  </P> <P> Rodia's hand-made masterpiece is an amalgam of broken bottles, pottery shards,  seashells and bits of iron held together by chicken wire smeared with ordinary  builder's cement.  </P></p>

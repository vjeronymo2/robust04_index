			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Furniture union votes for merger THE furniture union FTAT has voted to merge with the GMB general union. Delegates at the union's Blackpool conference at the weekend voted overwhelmingly for merger in principle and, by a narrow margin, to link up with the GMB rather than the TGWU transport and general union. The GMB had argued that merging with it, rather than the TGWU, carried greater industrial logic in terms of relations with employers in the furniture, construction and building materials sectors. The FTAT had held talks with other unions, including the MSF technical union. The FTAT, with about 32,000 members, lost 10 per cent of its membership last year. The union was once thought likely to merge with the Ucatt construction union, but talks were called off. The FTAT and GMB are now expected to begin detailed merger talks. The FTAT is likely to seek the status of a section in the union rather than lose its identity.</p>

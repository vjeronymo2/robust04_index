			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Ford Motor double as sales improve FORD MOTOR, the US automobile manufacturer, yesterday reported more than doubled first-quarter earnings of Dollars 572m, due to improving results from its North American vehicle operations and a strong performance by its financial services business. The company sounded a cautiously optimistic note for the year as whole, saying that its new products and cost-reduction efforts should lead to better operating results than in 1992, despite the slow US recovery from recession and global economic weakness. Ford's earnings of Dollars 572m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, compared with a profit of Dollars 223m, or 36 cents a share, in the same period of last year, excluding special accounting adjustments. Sales rose from Dollars 24.6bn to Dollars 26.8bn. The company's automotive operations made Dollars 176m, compared with a Dollars 26m loss a year ago. In the US, it earned Dollars 113m, compared with a loss of Dollars 59m, which the company attributed to increased unit volume. Outside the US, its vehicle operations earned Dollars 63m, up from Dollars 33m a year ago, despite lower sales volume in Europe, which Ford said had been more than offset by cost-cutting initiatives and improvements in other foreign markets. In the US, the company has been helped by a 1.6 percentage point gain in car and light truck market share over the past year, to 25.7 per cent, at a time when Japanese rivals have been losing share. Profits have also been boosted by the fact that lower rebates are needed to sell vehicles in the recovering US market. Ford spent an average of Dollars 875 on sales incentives in the first quarter, down from Dollars 1,000 a year earlier. The results received a strong boost from the financial services side, which earned record profits of Dollars 396m, compared with Dollars 249m a year ago, due mainly to reduced credit losses, increased volume and a gain on a sale of receivables. Mr Harold Poling, chairman, warned that for the US economic recovery to be sustained, job creation and consumer confidence needed to improve. Around the world, the company was still grappling with 'weak economies, intense competition and excess industrial capacity, all of which make improvement of financial results more difficult'.</p>

Three of the five passengers on the Spanish air force plane  were injured. The three-member crew escaped injury, NATO said.    NATO officials here and the Spanish defense ministry in  Madrid said they did not know where the gunfire came from. NATO  officials in Naples said it was hit by ground-based  anti-aircraft fire.    In Zagreb, the Croatian defense ministry said the plane was  attacked by separatist Serbs who control the Krajina region of  the former Yugoslav republic. The plane was damaged by the  mid-air explosion of one of two missiles fired from the ground,  the ministry said in a statement.    NATO said the plane was hit in the right motor and the tail  while transporting passengers from the capital Zagreb to the  port city of Split in the south.    The NATO supreme command in Brussels said the three wounded  were from France, Britain and the United States.    The plane made an emergency landing on the island of Krk,  which serves the Croatian coastal city of Rijeka, NATO officials  said.    A Croatian government official in Zagreb, asking not to be  named, suggested that the plane may have been fired on after it  strayed off course. "The plane probably mistook its air corridor  and deviated from its route," he said.    The twin-engined CASA 212 aircraft is designed to transport  either 16 or 19 passengers, depending on the model. It can also  be used for transporting wounded, aerial photography and  training missions.</p>

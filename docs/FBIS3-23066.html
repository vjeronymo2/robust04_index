The sources added  that all Israeli Embassy diplomats have received similar  recurrent threats over the past few days in protest against the  Israeli massacre, which killed and wounded a large number of  worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.    The AL-RA'Y correspondent has learned that the Egyptian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected a request by Israeli  ambassador to Egypt David Sultan to bring in 40 Israeli security  experts to enhance security measures around the Israeli Embassy.</p>

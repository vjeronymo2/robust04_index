Dhar] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 1 -- China has reportedly given  Pakistan a firm assurance about continuity of arms supplies in  future, even though Premier Benazir Bhutto failed to persuade  its leadership to finalise a Sino-Pak military pact aimed  primarily against India.    As a follow-up of the credit agreement signed between the  two  countries recently to finance arms purchases, Chinese and  Pakistani defence officials will conduct negotiations on the  items Islamabad is looking for and the delivery schedules, from  Beijing. The two countries have a longstanding defence  relationship, including in the nuclear field, and China has  emerged as Pakistan's major arms supplier.    After having launched a low intensity war against India  through sponsorship of terrorism, Pakistan has been trying its  utmost to involve China in a formal security relationship which  could deter India from attacking Pakistan, even if the level of  interference in its internal affairs became extremely grave and  unbearable.    The subject was broached by former Prime Minister Nawaz  Sharif also with Chinese Premier Li Peng several times during  his Beijing visits, as also Mr. Peng's Islamabad journey in  1989. But China, which has accorded top priority to  establishing good neighbourly relations with the countries  bordering on it, has refused to get involved in any security  arrangement.    When Ms. Benazir Bhutto raised the issue with Mr. Peng in  Beijing early this week, she was reportedly told that, at a time  when the international situation was marked by turbulence,  Asia-Pacific was the only region achieving rapid economic growth  and perceptible political stability. China's moves to establish  closer political, economic and cultural ties with these  countries and, principally its neighbours, had helped promote  regional stability and development.    At the same time, with the world witnessing turmoil in  several spots -- Europe, Middle East, Africa -- and the growing  trend towards defusion of tensions, any military pacts were  becoming irrelevant. Even NATO had lost its focus. The Chinese  leadership, according to diplomatic sources, laid stress on  resolving the present, as well as, future crises among countries  through peaceful negotiations without involving third parties,  which would only complicate matters further.    Under an agreement on military cooperation signed during the  Premiership of Mr. Z.A. Bhutto, Pakistan had assumed that the  same would operate as a defence pact and China would  automatically intervene on Pakistan's side whenever it chose to  commit hostilities against India. But the Chinese have put no  such interpretation on, nor acknowledged any defence  obligations, under the agreement as per which considerable  quantities of military equipment were supplied to Pakistan on  "friendship prices". Ms. Benazir Bhutto did not succeed in  persuading the Chinese to commit themselves to a military pact  where Mr. Nawaz Sharif had failed many times.    Though China accords top priority to its relations with  Pakistan, it is in no mood to do anything which would create  apprehensions amongst its neighbours about its "expansionist" or  peace-keeping role in the Asian region. Ms. Bhutto was also  assured that China's friendship with Pakistan would not be  affected by normalisation of relations with India with which it  had signed an agreement recently on maintaining peace and  tranquillity along the border.    The Chinese treat the relations with Islamabad as abiding,  developed as these were in the military field first and, later,  extended to the economic and technological (including nuclear)  spheres. China's unwillingness to play the U.S. game of trying  to destabilise the situation in the Asian sub-continent by  backing one of the parties to the Kashmir dispute has been  clearly expressed. The Chinese leaders were also lukewarm in  responding to Ms. Bhutto's allegations of repression and  violation of human rights in Kashmir because Beijing is accused  precisely of the same in Tibet and also parts of China.    The Chinese leadership has thus adopted a correct attitude  keeping in view Indian sensibilities, though the credits for  arms supplies it has offered to Islamabad is causing some  anxiety in New Delhi because Pakistan has already acquired huge  quantities of weapons and has an on-going programme of  cooperation in defence industries with Beijing. Sino-Pakistani  missile cooperation started as far back as 1987-88 initially  focusing on the sale of Chinese built M-9 ballistic missiles.  Chinese assistance in developing Pakistan's 400 km range HATF-2  surface-to-surface missile was confirmed in 1989, although  information on the extent of assistance was not fully available.    The Chinese transfer of about 40 M-11 missiles capable of  carrying 1100 kg warhead up to a distance of 300 miles has now  been confirmed, though it is said that it has a shorter range of  290 km with 800 kg payload. The M-11 is a fully mobile,  single-stage solid propellant missile, and can be loaded and  readied for firing in about 45 minutes. According to  unconfirmed reports, China has on-hand contracts to sell missile  and other related technology to the tune of nearly one billion  U.S. dollars to Pakistan, Iran, Syria and other countries in  West Asia.    The U.S. Administration has alleged that China is shipping  components, technology and materials that directly contribute to  a covert indigenous missile-production programme in Pakistan to  justify its decision to impose sanctions on China and Pakistan  under MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime].    Ms. Benazir Bhutto's visit to North Korea also assumes  significance from the military angle, because Pyongyang had also  been a major recipient of Chinese missiles and components as  well as technical assistance. North Korea has been assisted by  China in designing rocket engines and provided metallurgy and  air-frame expertise. North Korea is now trying to develop new  Nodong-I ballistic missile with range of 1000 km. Obviously,  Pakistan may be trying to import missile components and related  technology besides other equipment from North Korea which in  turn is getting them from China.    China insists that it has been prudent in exporting arms and  military technology, and says that export of weapons must help  countries improve their defence capabilities. These should not  harm regional peace, security and stability and the arms sales  must not be used to interfere in the internal affairs of others.  However, going by Pakistan's conduct since 1988 when it began  sponsoring cross-border terrorism against India, none of the  conditions stipulated by China on arms transfer have been  observed.</p>

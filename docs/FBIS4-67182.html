			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Lieutenant General </F> Daniel Garcia, Army commander in chief, by unidentified LA  MANANA reporter; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Fight Against Drugs and  Terrorism    We think police forces should be responsible for fighting  drugs and terrorism. This is in accordance with our countries'  internal order. We believe that to commit the Armed Forces as  institutions to fighting these kinds of activities, before the  bodies specifically created by the states for these functions  are overwhelmed, is hasty and inappropriate for the development  of the specific responsibilities that have been assigned to the  armies. We maintain, however, a careful watch on those types of  activities, in the sense that we continue to study the  information available on those areas, and continue to plan for  possible Army participation in the task, in the given case that  the national government decides that we should intervene.

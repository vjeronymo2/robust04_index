			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Sir Siegmund's rich legacy - SG Warburg One banker likely to have been sceptical about the merits of a merger between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley would have been the late Sir Siegmund Warburg, who founded the London-based firm after the second world war. In a rare interview given to Euromoney in 1980, he suggests that the sheer size of the combined businesses would have troubled him: 'What worries me, very much quite frankly, is that we are already getting too big on both sides of the Atlantic,' he said. He would also have been concerned about whether the cultural differences between the two organisations might cause problems: 'One general reservation which I feel about some . . . of the US investment banking houses is that they put too much emphasis on measuring, almost from month to month, what a specific partner produces. I don't even like the way they pronounce the word  -not produce, but 'prodooce'. All this emphasis on producing - that is all right for a cow, but not for a human being.' SG Warburg has come a very long way since that interview. Then it employed around 650 people. At the end of its last financial year, staff numbers were 4,472. Under Sir Siegmund's stewardship, it was in the tradition of a European Banque d'Affaires, concentrating on giving advice to companies on a variety of deals. It occasionally thought up new securities (Warburg is often credited with creating the Euro markets) and it initiated the UK's first hostile takeover attempt. Periodically, it made slightly wacky investments (for example, in an advertising company). A variety of picaresque stories about Warburg entered into City of London folklore, most of them true. These included the use of a Swiss graphologist, or handwriting analyst, to assess potential employees (still used today), the practice of eavesdropping on colleagues' business phone calls to eliminate the notion of secrecy within the firm (no longer widespread because of City regulations) and holding two lunch sittings, to double the number of clients who could be entertained (though frugally, without wine). The strategy which has brought Warburg to consider a merger with Morgan Stanley was adopted in 1984 by Sir David Scholey, soon to retire as the bank's chairman, and who was regarded by Sir Siegmund as his 'adopted son'. That was when Warburg decided to become an 'integrated' investment bank, or financial supermarket for big companies, combining the traditional advisory functions of a merchant bank with securities trading. It bought two London stockbrokers, Rowe &amp; Pitman and Mullens, and a stockjobber, Akroyd &amp; Smithers. Offices opened all over the world - at last count, the firm operated out of 24 countries. Warburg had one outstanding success in its fund management arm, Mercury Asset Management, the UK's biggest money manager. But the core investment banking business has produced a lower return on capital than some of its bigger US rivals, such as Goldman Sachs, or its more specialist domestic rivals, such as Schroders, Smith New Court or Cazenove &amp; Company. In the six months to September 30 , its profits, excluding MAM, were negligible. By considering a merger with Morgan Stanley, it is adopting the argument that 'critical mass' is vital to its success. So perhaps Sir Siegmund should have the last word: 'The danger is that the bigger a company becomes, the more difficult it is to deal with it on a personal basis, and the more you become slaves of a big bureaucratic machinery.'</p>

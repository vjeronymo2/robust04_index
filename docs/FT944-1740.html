			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: Television Channel Four's business series High Interest has been given a new title and a later slot (Tuesday, December 20, 9.00-9.45pm) for its programme on Anne Summers. The sex shop company only agreed to participate in the programme because of the business angle. It presents a fascinating look at the company's marketing success. Body fluids will be spilled in Rumble In The Jungle (Friday, Dec 23, 9.00-9.45pm, BBC2), which looks at the bloody, sweaty world heavyweight boxing match between George Foreman and an out-of-condition Muhammad Ali. Two decades on, this documentary assesses how extraordinary a feat it was. An equally weighty Victoria Wood does a sketch about a fat aerobics instructor in her Christmas Special (Sunday, Dec 25, 9.40-10.30pm, BBC1), although nowadays she needs padding to play the part. On the other side, real fat ladies will be singing in Elijah Moshinsky's production of Aida (Dec 25, 7.00-9.35pm, BBC2). It features Cheryl Studer and Dennis O'Neill. Channel Four's operatic offering is Turandot (Dec 25, 3.15-5.20pm) with sets and costumes by David Hockney. Tune in for the last act if you only want to listen to Nessun Dorma. There is more opera the following day with a two-part profile of Verdi (Tuesday, Dec 27, 5.00-6.00pm, BBC2). Singers of a different strain take over with Flanders and Swann (Tuesday, Dec 27, 6.50-7.30pm, BBC2) - a tribute to mark the death of Donald Swann this year. A new generation will learn the joys of being a gnu. An Equinox Special (Wednesday, Dec 28, 8.30-10.00pm, C4) takes a magnifying glass to forensic science. DNA profiling and finger-printing were thought to be unassailable methods of identification, but a growing number of experts are wondering if these aids to crime detection are quite as infallible as they initially seemed to be.</p>

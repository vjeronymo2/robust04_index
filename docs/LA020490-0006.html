			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> INDIA;  </P> <P> CURFEW LIFTED FOR 12 HOURS IN SRINAGAR  </P> <P> The government lifted curfew restrictions for 12 hours in Srinagar, summer  capital of Jammu and Kashmir state, but shops remained closed and few people  ventured out because of a strike called by Muslim separatists.  </P> <P> A bomb exploded in the city during the relaxation, but a senior police official  said there were no casualties. The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front spread a  strike call by word of mouth, shopkeepers said. The front is spearheading a  campaign for secession of the state's predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley from  India, which has a Hindu majority. At least 76 people have been killed since  the government first cracked down on the secessionist movement two weeks ago.  </P></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / US urges Japan to fulfil pledge to open markets JAPAN should normalise its economic relations with the rest of the world by redeeming unkept promises to cut its trade surplus and open its markets, Mr Lawrence Summers, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, said yesterday. Mr Summers, in a speech to Japanese business leaders, defended the Clinton administration's insistence on results-oriented trade agreements. The speech was a comprehensive statement of US economic policy towards Japan ahead of two days of talks, starting tomorrow, aimed at setting up a framework for substantive discussions on trade disputes in areas such as supercomputers and motor parts. Mr Summers made plain that the US would not soften its call for targets to measure progress in opening the Japanese market. The US proposals have been widely criticised as managed trade policy requiring the Japanese government to intervene to ensure foreign producers a guaranteed share of a specific market. Mr Summers said Japan's selective engagement with the world economy created two problems  - the large trade surplus and low foreign penetration of the Japanese market. Foreign producers faced obstacles in Japan which they did not face elsewhere, he argued. The clearest sign of that was Japan's low level of manufactured imports, as well as low levels of foreign investment. Mr Summers denied he was seeking managed trade agreements to help uncompetitive US companies. He said Washington was focusing on sectors in which US producers found it difficult to establish themselves in Japan even though they outsold Japanese rivals in third country markets such as Europe. The US was interested in Japanese markets which were not open to competition because they were influenced by government procurement, ruled by a regulated monopoly, such as telecommunications, or where there were close relations between manufacturers and suppliers which excluded new entrants. Mr Summers said: 'We are seeking to un-manage trade in areas where it is already heavily managed.' He said the US agreements with Japan would help to foster the multilateral trading system by making Japan's trading practices conform more to international norms. To measure the openness of Japan's markets, the US would employ benchmarks commonly used in anti-trust rulings and trade agreements. He added: 'We are not proposing hair trigger retaliation against Japan based upon a single market share indicator in support of uncompetitive US industries.' The US wants Japan's current account surplus cut within three years to 1.5 per cent of gross national product, the 20-year average, from about 3.5 per cent at the moment, largely through a higher public spending and lower taxes. Mr Summers said the extra Japanese demand for imports would create between 1m and 2m jobs elsewhere in the world.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Own answer Sir, The answers to the questions posed by Mr Jonathan Ruffer in the first paragraph of his article (Personal View, October 25) are surely given in the last. International bond markets which were drunk on excess liquidity in 1992-93 have now awoken to the cold dawn of rising interest rates, and set yields at level which discount likely future inflation rates. Only a dwindling bank of ageing teenage scribblers believes that current low levels of inflation can safely be extrapolated into the indefinite future.

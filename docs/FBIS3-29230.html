			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Wednesday [16 February] his failed trade talks  with U.S. President Bill Clinton represented the outset of new  Japan-U.S. relations reflecting a stronger sense of trust.    Hosokawa, reporting on the negotiations at a session of the  House of Representatives, said he and Clinton held "good" talks  in Washington on February 11 as they exchanged opinions on  various issues, including the international situation.    Hosokawa and Clinton agreed not to damage bilateral  relations  though they failed to strike a deal on a new "framework" to  slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the share of imports in  its markets, the premier said.    He called the talks the beginning of new bilateral relations  with greater mutual confidence, in which both countries will  make clear what they cannot do.    Hosokawa's remarks came after the United States on Tuesday  unveiled steps to impose hundreds of million dollars in trade  sanctions in a dispute over access to the Japanese cellular  phone market.    The prime minister pledged further deregulation to make  foreign access to Japanese markets easier, in spite of the  failed trade talks.    He hailed the talks saying that he and Clinton agreed to  promote bilateral cooperation on global issues such as the  environment, population and AIDS.    Hosokawa told Clinton that Japan would do what it could if  the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on north korea over  its suspected nuclear arms development program, he said.    After Hosokawa reported on the trade talks, the lower house  session commenced interpellation.    In response to a question from Ryutaro Hashimoto of the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Hosokawa said he  would search for a breakthrough on Japan-U.S. trade issues.    He said Japan would improve access to its markets and  government procurement procedures.    Hosokawa also reiterated his pledge to enact laws by the end  of the year for financing a planned tax reduction.    The ruling coalition on February 8 agreed to implement from  April a one-time 6 trillion yen income tax cut for fiscal 1994  as a means of economic pump-priming. At the same time Hosokawa  was forced to abandon his plan to replace the 3 percent  consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax" to  offset the loss of revenue from the tax cut.</p>

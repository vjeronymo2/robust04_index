			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Nasa streamlines US space station THE National Aeronautics and Space Administration yesterday concluded a three-month effort to redesign the US space station at half the cost of the original Freedom project. A Nasa team was yesterday due to present three options with costs ranging from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 9bn (Pounds 3.2bn to Pounds 5.8bn) to a White House review panel. The panel will report to President Bill Clinton, who is expected to make his final decision next week on which of the options to select or whether to cancel the project. The design team has looked for ways to incorporate into the space station ready-made equipment from US companies or from the Russian space programme, while at the same time placating the European and Canadian space agencies who are supposed to be partners in the venture. One option would be a type of floating power station, with living and working quarters largely accommodated in the space shuttle which would hook up to the station for periodic missions. The most complete reworking of the design, and the cheapest, would involve a 92-foot cylinder which could be set in orbit in a single launch. It would, however, shadow its own solar panels much of the time, so reducing the power available for scientific work. While a radically new design might offer the best prospects for cutting the station's costs, it might also alienate traditional supporters in Congress, who must vote the money for the project and who in many cases are committed to the original design. At the same time the space station could become a victim of the impasse over Mr Clinton's budget plan. Conservative critics of the budget want to increase spending cuts and raise taxes less, but more liberal congressmen are fiercely opposed to deeper cuts in social programmes. Sacrificing the space station could yield some compromise savings, though not enough to offset the substantial reductions now being sought in Mr Clinton's proposed energy tax, or in a Senate plan to postpone higher income tax rates by six months to July 1. Democratic leaders were to meet Mr Clinton yesterday afternoon on the budget package, but predicted it would pass the Senate.</p>

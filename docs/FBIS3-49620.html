The letter, signed by four HZDS deputies and leaders of east  Slovak HZDS branches and published today in the pro-government  regional daily LUC, opposes President Michal Kovac's proposal to  form a broad coalition government.    The letter questions the right of those who in the past had  refused to vote for the current Constitution (the Christian  Democratic Movement and ethnic Hungarian parties), created new  groups of deputies (former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko who  formed 8-deputy strong Alliance of Slovak Democrats), and who  called for early elections (Democratic Left Party).    Salczerova said that it was common for regional leaders to  send an open letter to a state official or to issue a  declaration after their meeting. The open letter has not been  consulted with the nationwide HZDS leadership, she added.</p>

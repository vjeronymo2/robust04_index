			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries trade quietly ahead of economic figures IN THE absence of important economic figures, trading on US Treasury markets was subdued yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/8 at 101 3/8 , yielding 7.873 per cent, while the two-year note was down 1/32 at 100 1/16 , yielding 5.074 per cent. Trading activity was reported to be light. The only feature of the day was a technical squeeze in the overnight two-year repurchase agreement market. Amid reports that one bank had control of a big lump of two-years, prices rose in early trading as some players struggled to cover short positions. Analysts said bond market business was likely to remain light ahead of tomorrow's May producer prices and retail sales data, which should provide the latest indication of the strength of the economic recovery. THE UK government bond market bounced back after its initial decline, helped by the combination of better-than-expected producer output prices, buying on weakness and a stronger German bond market. The gilt market, which lost up to half a percentage point initially, ended almost unchanged across the yield curve. Prices picked up on news that UK producer output prices rose by 0.1 per cent in May, whereas an increase of between 0.2 and 0.3 per cent had been expected. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 115 7/8 and fell as low as 115 13/32 before recovering to trade at 115 31/32 by late afternoon. In the futures market, volumes were heavy with about 55,000 contracts traded. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.16, fell to a low of 97.07 and traded at around 97.27 by late afternoon. THE European government bond markets continued to see a shift into the Deutschemark bloc following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty. There was further strong buying of German and Dutch government bonds and the Liffe bund futures contract rose from 88.21 to end at around 88.37. Among the high-yielding bond markets, Italy saw a pick-up in futures prices although the cash market remained depressed. Dealers reported some interest in buying the futures following Monday's sharp fall in the Italian market. The futures contract opened at 95.27 and climbed to 95.99 while the 10-year cash bond traded at around 95.28 against Monday's close of 95.70. French government bonds (OATs) dropped sharply as foreign investors sold their holdings, but the market later picked up on domestic buying. The Matif futures contract opened at 107.38 and fell to a low of 107.14, but traded up to 107.40 later in the day. JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly weaker after trading in a narrow range. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue, which opened at 5.505 per cent, ranged between 5.50-5.53 per cent and closed at 5.52 per cent.</p>

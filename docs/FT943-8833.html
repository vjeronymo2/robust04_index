			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): N America and cable TV send optimistic signals - BICC BICC, which along with Trafalgar House was one of the big losers of the Malaysian government ban on awarding contracts to British companies, should have some better news to report when it announces its interim results on Wednesday. BICC and Trafalgar were part of an Anglo-Japanese consortium expected to win the main contract for a new Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.25bn) international airport at Sepang near Kuala Lumpur when the ban was imposed in February. The interim results, however, should show a further improvement in the group's main UK and US cable markets, with pre-tax profits expected to nudge above Pounds 60m for the six months to the end of June compared with a restated Pounds 50m for the first half of 1993. North America is thought to have moved back into the black for the first time in three years, helped by the general improvement in the US economy and a rationalisation of the company's North American business. The cable television revolution in the UK should mean increased domestic profits. Cable television is providing good business for BICC, the country's biggest producer of optic fibre cable which is increasing substantially its share of the market. The company is also the biggest producer, outside of the US, of optical fibre used in the manufacture of the cable. Markets in continental Europe have been less good although overall European profits should be higher. Balfour Beatty, the company's construction subsidiary, has continued to increase profits throughout the recession. It is thought to have made another useful contribution in the first half. Earnings should be sufficient to cover a maintained dividend but increased payments to shareholders are still some way off.</p>

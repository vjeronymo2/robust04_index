It was not immediately clear whether the  escalator malfunctioned or if the immigrants' unfamiliarity with the machinery  prompted the fall, police said.  </P> <P> The immigrants had arrived on a weekly charter flight bringing Cuban immigrants  to the United States from Havana and exiles home from visits to the island.  </P></p>

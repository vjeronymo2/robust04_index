Nicolas Gonzalez Oddone, chiarman of the Paraguayan Business  Chamber of Commerce and Stock Exchange, said: "This is the  first time such a high-ranking delegation of PRC businessmen has  visited Paraguay. We are very happy because the Business  Chamber of Commerce and Stock Exchange seeks to establish ties  between Paraguayan and foreign businessmen to promote trade. We  have welcomed the Chinese delegation and organized a round of  very encouraging negotiations. Many Paraguayan businessmen  attended these negotiations, and contacts were made."    The Chinese businessmen showed interest in increasing  commercial ties with Paraguay. In 1992, Paraguayan cotton  exports to China totaled 25 million guaranies.    Gonzalez Oddeone said that China is a huge market with over  1  billion consumers, and that Paraguay can learn a lot from it.  He explained that China is the country experiencing the  greatest economic development among Pacific Rim countries, which  have deregulated and opened their economies resulting in a  massive inflow of capital.    He added: "This meeting is of fundamental importance because  these are the first negotiations being held with the Chinese,  who are from a country with which Paraguay has no diplomatic  ties."    Moreover, Gonzalez said that Paraguay cannot ignore a market  of over 1 billion inhabitants with a more advanced economic  development. He added that Parguay will obtain great benefits  from establishing economic ties with China.    The Chinese delegation was headed by the chairman of the  Chinese Business Chamber of Commerce, seated in Beijing; and Xie  Jianqun, current vice chairman of the China Council for the  Promotion of International Trade. Xie Jianqun said said China  is interested in both exporting and importing several products  with the objective of improving the well-being of Paraguayan and  Chinese consumers. He also noted the importance of the  negotiations in stating that this is the first time all members  of the council have visited Paraguay.    He added: "In the past we engaged in indirect bilateral  trade transactions, and even some direct transactions on a small  scale. We hope that by expanding our contacts with Paraguayan  businessmen and through a better knowledge of each other  bilateral trade will develop in the future."</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Treuhand rebuffs steel producers - East German privatisation agency declines to sell Ekostahl mill THE Treuhand agency charged with restructuring and privatising east German industry is not prepared to sell one of its steel mills to Thyssen and Preussag, powerful west German steel producers, officials said yesterday. Earlier this week the two west German producers presented a proposal to the Treuhand for Ekostahl, situated on the Polish border. The plan would cut Ekostahl's workforce to 1,000, scrap plans to build a mini-mill, and use the plant for back-up steel services, rather than steel production. The Treuhand and local state officials have rejected the offer on the grounds that it would not save jobs, commit investment or modernise Ekostahl. Instead, officials remain determined to modernise Ekostahl through subsidies designed to prepare the plant for privatisation. The modernisation programme would transform the cold rolling plant into a mini-mill based on hot-rolled steel and would make Ekostahl one of the most modern and competitive in the region. Agency officials believe Thyssen and Preussag want to take over Ekostahl to stifle competition. The offer by the west German companies coincides with interest by Riva, the Italian steel group, in acquiring a 51 per cent stake in Ekostahl. An investment by the Italian group would partly finance construction of the mini-mill, and make the mill commercially viable and eventually competitive. Riva's interest follows failed attempts by Ekostahl's management to win EC-backed subsidies totalling DM1bn (Pounds 400m) for its modernisation programme. The EC ruled the mill might add to overcapacity in the steel sector. However, the Treuhand has consistently rejected such arguments. Before unification, Ekostahl produced more than 2.5m tons, which has since been reduced to 900,000 tons, and employed in excess of 12,000 people. It now has 3,500 full-time employees.</p>

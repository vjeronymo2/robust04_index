			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jelena Dabarcic report] </F>   [Text] After a brief lull on the Gorazde front yesterday,  the Muslim forces early this morning renewed their attacks on  the positions of the Serbian fighters in the direction of Foca  and Cajnice. Fierce artillery-infantry attacks are being waged  in the regions of Podkozare, Paljike, and Oglecevo, where  Islamic fanatics are trying to breach the defense lines of the  Serbian territory at any cost.    The Serbian military sources claim that the Muslims have  regrouped their forces at the part of the front between Gorazde,  Cajnice, and Foca, and that they have abandoned the idea of  making an advance toward Cajnice via Gradina and Trebecevo,  where they suffered major losses in the past few days.    According to Colonel Jezdimir Lakicevic, on the seventh day  of their offensive, the Muslim forces from Gorazde are not  giving up their plan of linking up with their forces in Sarajevo  and reaching the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,  and in this way realize their dream of establishing a green line  linking Sarajevo, Gorazde, and Sandzak.    In the fighting that took place this morning, the Serbian  side did not have any fatalities. Several fighters were wounded.</p>

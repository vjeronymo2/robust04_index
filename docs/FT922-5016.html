			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Warner fails to commit to Sony Mini Disc WARNER Music Group, a division of US entertainment giant Time Warner, has declined to commit its roster of artists to the new Mini Disc audio technology format being developed by Sony of Japan. Mini Disc is a portable recording and playback system which Sony is due to launch in Japan in November and which it hopes will eventually become the main successor to the analog cassette tape. In a statement, Warner said it was still addressing the relative merits of Mini Disc and its main rival, the digital compact cassette being developed by Dutch group Philips. Sony was putting on a brave face yesterday. A spokesman in New York said: 'We are happy that Warner is reviewing the two technologies equally.' Warner is reluctant to commit itself to the new digital technology because of concern that new formats may crimp the growth of compact discs (CDs)and to a lesser extent, cassette tapes. Mr Robert Morgado, in his role as chairman of Warner Music Group, said: 'Compact Disc is the premier carrier for the music industry and we are asking manufacturers to assure us that their new technologies do not adversely impact CDs continued growth.' The decision by Warner not to back the Mini Disc is a blow to Sony's hopes for the product. In order for Mini Disc to succeed, Sony must offer a wide range of music titles to potential buyers of Mini Disc players when the product enters the market later this year. Yet so far only two big labels, EMI Music and Sony's own music division, have signed up with Mini Disc. Sony had hoped Warner with its powerful roster of stars including Madonna and Rod Stewart, would prove an important recruit. To date, Philip's digital compact cassette format appears to have a head start on Sony's Mini Disc. It has already won artist commitments from the six biggest labels in the music industry for the product's September launch.</p>

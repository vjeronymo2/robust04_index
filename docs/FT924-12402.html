			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Banks welcome decision to repay Efim creditors FOREIGN bankers reacted positively to the announcement by the Italian government that it will repay in full creditors to Efim, the state holding company put into liquidation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The offer to pay all the debts should satisfy foreign banks, whose exposure is concentrated on Efim and its wholly-owned Nuova Safim financing subsidiary. However, one banker said 'I've learned to be careful and I'd prefer to wait and see the full details.' Foreign institutions are believed to have lent around L4,000bn (Dollars 3.07bn) of the group's L9,500bn bank borrowings, with the remainder coming from domestic banks. The new proposal is expected to cost the Italian government L9,000bn, more than double the previous L4,000bn offer. Precise terms of the repayment, expected to take place in the form of either bonds or cash, remain uncertain. 'I want to know when we're going to be repaid, and in what form,' said the banker. Yesterday's announcement marks the Italian government's third, and, bankers hope, final attempt to resolve the affairs of Efim, which was put into liquidation by a government decree on July 18, when its finances were also frozen. A second decree was issued in mid-August in response to bankers' criticism about the uncertainty surrounding their credits. However, the amended version, which proposed issuing up to L4,000bn in bonds to cover Efim's debts, provoked a wave of attacks that interest payments on the bonds would be at well below market rates. At a press conference in Rome last night, Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister, revealed that Agusta and Oto Melara, Efim's helicopter and missiles subsidiaries, would be transferred to the IRI state holding company, whose Finmeccanica subsidiary already controls a clutch of aerospace and defence interests. The transfer would be a first step towards a definitive takeover by IRI, probably by its Finmeccanica aerospace and defence equipment arm, at a price still to be decided. Debts of the companies changing hands would be assumed by the government, which gave no indication of payback terms for creditors.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reckitt edges ahead to Pounds 134m - Tough second half expected with full-year profits little changed RECKITT &amp; COLMAN, the household goods, toiletries, food and pharmaceutical group with products ranging from mustard to indigestion remedies, managed to edge interim profits ahead despite the effect of the worldwide recession. In the half year to end-June pre-tax profits rose by 5.2 per cent to Pounds 134.2m. The shares initially rose sharply on the news but fell back to close with a net gain of 5p at 533p. Despite the figures being in line with expectations, analysts cut their full-year profit forecasts, expecting the second half to be flat. Although currency movements had not had a significant effect in the first half, cutting about Pounds 1m from trading profits of Pounds 151.2m (Pounds 147.5m), Mr Iain Dobbie, finance director, warned that currency movements 'will be significantly more adverse in the second half than in the first half'. Also the group indicated that trading conditions were getting worse in continental Europe, especially in Germany and the Benelux countries, while there were no signs of economic recovery in the UK and North America. Sir Michael Colman, chairman, said a 7.2 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 5.95p took into account the drop in inflation but also the group's view of the trend of profits in the 1990s despite unfavourable worldwide conditions. The dividend increase was slightly greater than the 5 per cent rise in fully diluted earnings to 21.24p. He said the results were not directly comparable with the previous year's because a number of businesses had been sold, notably the US spice and seasoning subsidiary. Group sales fell 5.9 per cent to Pounds 935.7m, but were up 5 per cent on a comparable basis. The trading profit rise of 2.5 per cent to Pounds 151.2m, masked an underlying improvement of over 5 per cent. The group increased trading profit margins from 14.8 per cent to 16.2 per cent. Of the rise, nearly two thirds was due to the disposals which had been of lower margin operations. The other one third came from greater efficiencies in the business, Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive, said. He said there had been a number of new product launches and relaunches around the world and marketing spending had increased as a percentage of sales. In the US the company launched Air Waves, an electrical air freshener, and a range of woodland fragrance air fresheners. Trading profits from household goods and toiletries were slightly ahead at Pounds 104.6m (Pounds 103.4m) as disposals took profits out and the cost of product launches dampened growth. Food profits rose from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 21.2m. The pharmaceutical division made Pounds 20m (Pounds 19.4m) and other activities added Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 3.9m). Interest payable fell from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 17m, as the group had raised over Pounds 150m from disposals. There was an extraordinary debit of Pounds 52m (Pounds 7.3m) relating to the sale of the spice and seasoning business, which the group had already announced. The figure includes trading losses of Pounds 9.1m. COMMENT Although Reckitt's range of products is hardly the most exposed to recession, the group has nevertheless done well to improve profits in such a hostile environment. The second half will be even tougher going and the group will do well to get profits up much this year from last time's Pounds 252.3m, implying a prospective p/e of about 13. Reckitt's longer-term strategy appears wise. Having gained the market positions in the products and countries it desired through acquisition, it will now concentrate on building its brands through new product launches and marketing investment. Even so, when - or perhaps if - the world economy recovers Reckitt's prized resilience will lose its attractions.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SINGER HELPS DREW BARRYMORE  </P> <P> Ex-drug addict David Crosby is helping alcoholic teen-age actress Drew  Barrymore stay straight.  </P> <P> Barrymore, 14, lived with Crosby and his wife, Jan Dance, for three months as  part of her program of recovery from alcohol and drug abuse, according to this  week's People magazine.  </P> <P> "I'm an old Hollywood kid, and I knew her story. I felt she had been dealt a  short deck, you know, a fifth-generation alcoholic, and I didn't want to see  her go down the tubes," Crosby told People.  </P> <P> Crosby, 48, of the rock group Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, has a  well-documented history of cocaine addiction, hitting bottom in 1983 with an  11-month prison term on drug and weapons convictions. But now he's straight.  </P> <P> Barrymore, the lovable moppet of the movie "E.T.," announced last year that she  had struggled with drugs and alcohol since she was 9. When she left a clinic in  October, the Crosbys took her in.  </P></p>

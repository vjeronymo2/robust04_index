			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOTEL ORDINANCE AIMS AT PROSTITUTION  </P> <P> The Gardena City Council has passed a zoning ordinance requiring that new  hotels in the city be built on lots of at least one acre, with a minimum of 100  feet of frontage and 150 feet of depth. The ordinance is intended to prevent  the construction of small motels that cater to prostitution.  </P> <P> A moratorium on motel construction that dates back to September, 1988, will  automatically end when the new ordinance takes effect 30 days after passage.  </P> <P> Gardena has 21 hotels and motels but lacks a large hotel with a banquet room,  City Planner Roy Kato said. The city hopes to attract a developer wanting to  build a substantial hotel that will include a restaurant, a banquet room and  shops, he said.  </P></p>

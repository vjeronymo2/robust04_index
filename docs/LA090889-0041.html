			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ROMERO' LEAVES TRAGEDY UNTOUCHED  </P> <P> "Romero" (at the AMC Century 14) has the good fortune to have Raul Julia in the  title role as the martyred Salvadoran archbishop, but his solid portrayal, a  work of simplicity and concentration, cannot redeem a film that in too many  crucial ways goes wrong.  </P> <P> "Romero" is an especially poignant example of noble intention done in by  misguided means, for Julia invests the archbishop with a spirituality that few  heroes of conventional films with religious themes possess.  </P> <P> Much to his surprise, mild-mannered Monsignor Oscar Romero in 1977 is named  Archbishop of San Salvador. Some of his colleagues, who identify with the  country's ultra-conservative ruling class, predict that he will not make waves  despite the rapidly escalating oppression and brutality of the new Humberto  regime. The mindless savagery unleashed by the military on the helpless and the  innocent is too much for Romero to ignore. Drawing upon his faith as a devout  man of God, he gradually emerges as an implacable leader of the opposition,  having decided that God's law must transcend that of man.  </P> <P> Writer John Sacret Young and Australian director John Duigan, in his American  film debut, sketch the outlines of Romero's fate and its implications for the  relationship between church and state clearly enough, but with breadth rather  than depth. Although the film does unfold with the requisite sense of tragic  inevitability, thanks to Julia, nothing else about it rings true, even though  what is depicted is depressingly credible, drawn as it is from recent, terrible  (and ongoing) events.  </P> <P> The sad truth is that the film is trite in its dialogue as well as in its  direction and is seriously marred by the disastrous miscasting of a key role.  Underlying all these flaws is the pervading sense that the film, cursed with  the synthetic quality that typically characterizes productions with  international casts and crews, really has no business being in English in the  first place.  </P> <P> This feeling is reinforced by the fact that the film doesn't deal with the role  of the American government in El Salvador's plight, beyond a plea from Romero  for us to stop sending arms that will be only used against his country's  people. The role of the Vatican in El Salvador is soft-pedaled even more.  Cultural imperialism, in the form of materialistic U.S. values and life styles,  is noted only in passing, and there's no addressing at all of why Latin  American political struggles always seem to involve such extreme acts of  cruelty.  </P> <P> One has to wonder why its producer, Paulist priest Father Ellwood E. Kieser,  didn't let us experience a Salvadoran film maker's vision of the country's  seemingly unending tragedy. Surely the audience that is concerned enough with  Central America to be attracted to Romero's story is sufficiently sophisticated  to sit still for subtitles. Surely, too, the film would be more appealing to  Latino audiences were it in Spanish.  </P> <P> Again excepting Julia, the actors are pedestrian or worse. As a fiery activist  priest called Father Rutilio Grande, Richard Jordan looks about as Latino as  Robert Redford; it's no help that his Spanish accent is so erratic. The dozens  of native extras -- the film was shot in Mexico -- are terribly self-conscious  and often seemingly perplexed. Clearly, Duigan, one of the least-known and most  gifted of Australian directors, is way out of his element. Such wonderful films  as "Mouth to Mouth," "The Winter of Our Dreams" and "The Year My Voice Broke"  show him to be a master of the intimate rather than the epic, and his usual  rapport with actors fails him here, except with Julia.  </P> <P> Julia, who brings more to Romero than the script does, seems to draw strength  and inspiration from the very solitary man he is portraying. "Romero" (rated  PG-13 for violence and bloodshed) is of greatest interest as a study of a  skilled professional actor going about his business no matter what. When you  should be experiencing a sense of universality in the plight of Archbishop  Romero, you may instead find yourself being impressed with Julia's ability to  bring passion and meaning to cliches.  </P> <P> 'ROMERO'  </P> <P> A Four Seasons Entertainment release of a Paulist Pictures production.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 13 May--Jan Widacki, the Polish ambassador  to Vilnius, said today during a visit to Warsaw that it is  untrue to say that the Poles in Lithuania have been deprived of  their electoral rights.    "Limiting participation in the fall local government  elections to political organizations violates the spirit of  self-government as understood in Europe and is unfavorable for  the Poles in Lithuania, particularly for the Union of Poles in  Lithuania [ZPL], but it is not deprivation of electoral rights,"  Widacki stated.    He stressed that the Lithuanian Seimas had not yet passed  the  local government election regulations. On 9 May, during partial  voting, an article permitting only political organizations to  put forward candidates in the elections was adopted, which means  the exclusion of social and sociopolitical organizations, which  include the ZPL, from participation.    Widacki stressed that, even if the electoral regulations  were  passed in their present form, it would not exclude ZPL members  from participating in the elections, but they would be forced  quickly to set up a political organization (election committee)  [PAP parentheses] based on the ZPL.</p>

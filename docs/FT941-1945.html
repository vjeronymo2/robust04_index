			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Turn of the screw At one level there must be some relief that the Federal Reserve has made up its mind. Another increase in short-term interest rates had certainly been priced into the US markets. Equities were unperturbed, the dollar scarcely moved while US Treasury bonds rallied once the uncertainty was over. Since they are used to taking a lead from the US, there is a chance that this initially sanguine view may spill over into international markets too. Paradoxically, though, both equities and bond markets outside the US have been harder hit since the Fed first started to tighten. Any positive response could be short-lived. True, there is unlikely to be a repeat of the selling by highly-geared speculative investors that greeted the Fed's first move. Some equity markets, notably in Asia, have fallen to levels which reflect underlying value as the froth has blown off. European bonds now offer high real yields, but problems remain. The Fed's latest action may make the pace of German rate cuts even more painfully slow. The fact that the US appears intent on sticking to quarter-point rises means financial markets may soon have to start discounting its next move. The trouble with such a gradualist approach is that it prolongs the agony, and can mean interest rates end up higher than would have been the case with a short, sharp shock. Had the Fed been bolder, the markets might have been inclined to calm down sooner.</p>

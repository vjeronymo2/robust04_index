			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Steel Burrill shares fall after loss of client Following a 20 per cent fall in its share price between December 2 and December 16 Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance and reinsurance broker, announced it was losing a client account, writes James Unwin. In what it admitted was an unusual comment on its day to day business affairs, SBJ said Pet-Plan would be transferring its business at next renewal. Mr Christopher Birrell, SBJ finance director, said the lost account represented less than 2 per cent of the group's brokerage of between Pounds 44m to Pounds 45m a year and its loss was balanced by the recent gain of a large marine reinsurance account. Although the new account was smaller, it was still significant and 'at this stage in the renewal season it would be incorrect to take this loss in isolation', he said.</p>

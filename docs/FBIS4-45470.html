			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Commission </F> Presents its Action Plan Which Seeks To Combat Drugs"]    [Text] Drug addiction and drug traffic represent a major  threat to European citizens and a challenge that cannot be dealt  with by the Twelve separately. On the basis of this dual  observation, on Wednesday [8 June] the Commission presented its  Communication on establishment of an EU action plan to combat  drugs. The plan was presented by Commissioner Padraig Flynn.  The Commission intends for the plan to provide a new basis for  cooperation making it possible to profit fully from the new  possibilities offered in this field by the Treaty on European  Union. The treaty makes specific mention of drugs and drug  addiction in the new provisions on public health and under  cooperation in judicial and home affairs (third pillar). The  proposed action plan covers the three key elements proper to the  global approach needed with drugs, namely, action:    (i) for the prevention of drug addiction;    (ii) to combat drug traffic;    (iii) for international cooperation.    The communication also examines how to best ensure the  coordination and coherence of actions at each level. The  Commission's ideas in each of these areas are summarized below.    1. Reducing demand. Under Article 129 of the Treaty of  Maastricht, the Commission will adopt (probably next week) a  specific communication and a draft directive on the First  Community Programme of Actions to Prevent Drug Addiction,  falling in the domain of public health. This programme will be  designed to:    (i) encourage and facilitate activities for high-risk groups  in particular situations;    (ii) promote the identification, development, testing, and  use of best practices to ensure the dissemination of information  and to provide counseling for the target groups;    (iii) promote education and training initiatives in order to  develop prevention strategies;    (iv) support work on early detection and counseling for drug  users;    (v) promote social rehabilitation and reintegration.    2. Controlling drug traffic. This question requires action  conducted in the Community context and in the form of  cooperation as prescribed by the third pillar. At Community  level, actions for the deflection of precursors and psychotropic  substances and under the money-laundering directive have already  led to considerable results. The Commission recommends boosting  this action through:    (a) implementation of existing instruments (development of  electronic mail networks to speed information-sharing, training,  etc.);    (b) the promotion of cooperation with third countries, using  the model of Community legislative instruments and other  international agreements (negotiation of specific accords,  participation in international initiatives, technical assistance  for the development of legislation and administrative  structures, information exchange, etc.);    (c) the evaluation of the practical implementation of these  measures.    Title VI of the Treaty of Maastricht offers new  possibilities  for action at EU level in areas traditionally falling under  intergovernmental cooperation, particularly containing an  institutional obligation for police, customs and judicial  cooperation in these areas of common interest. On this basis,  the Commission invites the Member States to implement the Action  Plan on Drugs and Money Laundering and the Priority Working Plan  1994 adopted by the Justice/Home Affairs Council in November.  These measures include:    (i) implementation of the ministerial agreement on the  Europol Drug Unit and conclusion of the drafting of the  convention establishing Europol in its totality;    (ii) the development of a strategy which includes reinforced  controls at the EC's external frontiers;    (iii) implementation of measures to promote police  cooperation. Under Article K1.4 which provides for measures to  fight drug addiction which straddle Community competences and  the third pillar, the Commission makes suggestions for  supplementing actions under way at present, namely:    (a) interdisciplinary exchanges between officials and  professional organisations involved in reducing the demand and  supply of drugs;    (b) creation of a European forum for exchange and multi-city  cooperation;    (c) cooperation in the field of drugs and their relation to  crime.    3. International actions. In the Commission's view, the EU  should supplement the action plan with an external aspect,  making use of Community instruments and the new possibilities  offered by the CFSP (common foreign and security policy). At  Community level, action should focus on the following areas:    (i) continuation of EU participation in international  efforts  (UN programme for international drug control, the Council of  Europe's Pompidou Group, etc.);    (ii) at bilateral level, reinforcement of national and  regional strategies, in cooperation with certain countries or  regions presenting a particular risk due to their proximity with  the Union;    4. Coordination. The Communication underscores the  importance of maintaining and improving coordination at the  level of Member States and the EU, namely in the following  contexts:    (i) coordination in and between Member States (national  coordinators and Coreper should have an important role to play);    (ii) the European Observatory of drugs and drug addicts set  up in Lisbon (it can contribute to the political decision-making  procedure through the important role that it will have to fulfil  in matters of information and analysis, in connection with its  related network of national centres);    (iii) multidisciplinary aspects (information, research and  training are considered priority themes, with the possibilities  of improving the coherence of their implementation being  examined).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado Ventura has  visited several agroindustrial complexes and Agriculture  Ministry organizations in Ciego de Avila. During these visits,  he learned about the measures adopted in that province to make  up for the delays in sugar production.    [Begin Machado Ventura recording] A great effort is being  made here concerning sugar cane production, because we have to  fulfill, the country has to meet a goal; this province,  specifically, is behind schedule, and this plan, which is behind  schedule, must be recovered. It does have the possibility of  overcoming the delay. [end recording]    On a different occasion of his visit, Machado Ventura  praised  the working spirit of the people of Ciego de Avila, not only  during the harvest period but also in all other agricultural  activities despite the severe limitations imposed by the special  period.    [Begin Machado Ventura recording] There is optimism despite  the current conditions, and in general I can tell you that the  effort being made by the people is admirable. [end recording]    According to Machado Ventura, this effort is the best  greeting they can convery on international workers' day.    [Begin Machado Ventura recording] This year, as has been  explained, workers' day will be observed in each workplace by  carrying out the main tasks, those which are essential. This has  begun, because the workers are not waiting for 1 May to do so.  This does not mean that the commemoration will take place on  that day alone. I think that 1 May must be celebrated every day  in the area of production and under the current circumstances.  [end recording]    Machado Ventura concluded by stressing the significance for  the country of sugar production in this province. For this  reason the fulfillment of the harvest objectives is the major  challenge for the people of Ciego de Avila, and is the response  the nation expects of this province.</p>

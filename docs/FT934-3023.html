			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Salvesen's Pounds 41m disappoints City Shares in Christian Salvesen fell 17p to 331p yesterday after the international distribution, specialist hire and food services group reported flat underlying profits for the six months to September 30. Under FRS 3, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 53m to Pounds 41.1m but the comparative figure was flattered by a Pounds 12.6m gain on the disposal of Salvesen's oilfield technology business, which now goes above the line. Excluding exceptionals, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds 41.1m. Sir Alick Rankin, chairman, said: 'Under all the circumstances of a most difficult international marketplace . . . this to be a creditable achievement and we feel able to raise the interim dividend by 3.1 per cent.' Operating profits from the specialist hire division fell from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 15m. The group said Aggreko, which hires out generators and temperature control equipment, had seen strong performances in the US and south-east Asia offset by difficult trading conditions in Europe. Light and Sound Design, which the group bought in 1991, made nothing in the first half. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said the company had been too slow to reduce its reliance on depressed pop concert markets, and it was being restructured, with a number of senior management changes. In distribution, operating profits grew 7.1 per cent to Pounds 18m. The UK business was down 5 per cent at Pounds 9.6m, but this was partly offset by growth in continental Europe and particularly strong growth in the US. Mr Masters said he accepted that grocery distribution in the UK was a fairly mature market, but said there were considerable opportunities for multi-user depots in the US. In the food services division, profits fell from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 7.5m. Salvesen Brick maintained profits at Pounds 1.5m. Earnings under FRS 3 fell to 10.29p (14.03p). The interim dividend is increased to 3.3p (3.2p). COMMENT The drop in the share price reflected disappointment over the profits figure, which was slightly below expectations, and that currency translation had contributed no less than Pounds 3.1m. However, the main concern of analysts is that growth of Salvesen's marvellous Aggreko business might be running out of steam. Mr Masters accepts that the days of annual 20 per cent growth are in the past, but says there is no reason why Aggreko should not maintain annual growth of 10 to 15 per cent, as it supplies bigger and more complex contracts. Forecast full-year profits of about Pounds 80m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 17.5. At that level they are still on a deserved 10 per cent premium to the market, but they are unlikely to advance much until the City is convinced that the specialist hire problems are only of a transitional nature.</p>

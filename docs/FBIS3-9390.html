			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Branka Mitrovic: "Softened, Calculating, or </F> Maladjusted"]    [Text] "The Srpska republic will endeavor to adjust  its interests to the general situation."    This short sentence, stated by Radovan Karadzic after his  latest meeting with Vitaliy Churkin, with whom he exchanged  opinions about the further course of the peace process, means  that the latest initiative made by Washington and Moscow for  finding a settlement of the Bosnian conflict without Serb  participation will soon fail. Still, the initiative inevitably  raises the question of whether the Serbs will know how to make  good use of that general situation, without losing much. That  question is bothering Karadzic, who has been put under pressure,  on one hand by flexible, ready-to-discuss-everything Milosevic,  as Churkin describes him, and, on the other hand, by his own  army, and for the greatest part by Ratko Mladic and the citizens  of the Srpska republic themselves, who are unanimous in the  attitude that the aforementioned flexibility is leading directly  toward a defeat!    As the majority of Serbs believe, since the beginning of the  war the Bosnian Serbs have not been asked for their opinion on  any issue, particularly when the idea was born in Washington  that Croats and Muslims should be forced to agree to a joint  state. In the first moment, precisely for that reason, the  Serbs refused any talks about possibly joining with the  Croatian-Muslim federation, while the same attitude was held by  the leadership of the Srpska republic.    Having decided that the whole story is about the  establishment of a military alliance that will look forward to  aiming its artillery at the other bank of Drina River, of  course, supported by the foreign assistance, the leadership in  Pale quickly started to contemplate how to protect itself,  without once more provoking the superior force in the sky.  Aleksa Buha [Srpska foreign minister] was happy to substantiate  why their apprehensions are not merely a kind of phobia. He has  noticed that, in Split, Generals Ante Roso and Rasim Kadic  hurried to sign the agreement on the federal army, even though  the Constitution of the new Muslim-Croatian state was far from  having a definite shape. At the same time, Buha reminds us that  the agreement on the military alliance signed by Franjo Tudjman  and Alija Izetbegovic still exists. Therefore he told Churkin,  just as Karadzic and Nikola Koljevic had done, that he could  feel free to inform Washington that the Srpska republic would  not start solving any issue without having previously signed a  peace agreement with the new federation, because, at the latest  talks in Vienna it had been said that the federation of Croats  and Muslims should take in as much as 60 percent of the  territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.  <H5>  What Is the Next Step? </H5>   Nevertheless, the Bosnian Serbs still started to adjust  themselves to the situation, thinking: What is the next step?    So that the first thing that Karadzic actually faced was the  demand that the Serbs should make certain concessions. To the  surprise of many people, Karadzic immediately said he was ready  to cede around 16 percent of the territory under the control of  the Bosnian Serbs. However, both Washington and Moscow made it  clear to him that he is supposed to soften up his attitude even  more, and in that respect, nothing is more successful than  applying pressure.    After having resolutely refused to even discuss the  possibility of the Srpska republic merging with the new  Muslim-Croat federation, that is, with its enemies, the  leadership from Pale quickly changed its mind. They decided  that Serbs should get down to talks and negotiations, because  the final legalization of the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina  still has its good side: It opens the way for the Serbs toward  the final union with Yugoslavia. However, this story will as  well be paved with huge stumbling blocks. The U.S. officials  quickly invented a new trick. They sent the message to Serbs  that, if they were to keep the entire 70 percent of the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Washington might easily enforce  the lifting of the arms embargo against the Croats and Muslims.  As an additional means of pressure, Washington sent Churkin to  the Srpska republic a couple of times, to make the Serbs even  more pliable. On the other hand, although the Russian UN  soldiers were given a euphoric welcome in Pale, Karadzic is more  than aware that Churkin will not be pursuing exclusively  pro-Serbian politics, although Moscow has been somewhat better  disposed to their Orthodox brothers in recent times. With  obvious interest, and perhaps even surprise, Karadzic listened  to Momcilo Krajisnik telling him about Churkin's proposal,  according to which all the peoples in former Yugoslavia should  join in an association, whereas the association should involve  various forms of association.    Encouraged by what they heard, as Buha puts it, the Bosnian  Serbs have immediately made clear to Churkin that they cannot  give up their rights, which have been allowed for the Croats and  Muslims -- the right to form their state from ethnic cantons,  and also to enter confederation with Croatia. Because, if the  Bosnian Croats want a connection with their mother-country, the  same desires and rights must be observed and allowed to the  other party, so nobody should oppose these arguments and this  logic. According to the Pale officials, Churkin has expressed  his support for this proposal, and if Washington were to do the  same, then the negotiators would find themselves on the same  wavelength.  <H5>  World Against the Unification </H5>   Still, the international community is more inclined to add  the Srpska republic to the new federation than to allow its  union with Yugoslavia. It has been openly stated that Pale will  be much better off if it sticks to the federal Bosnia. The  Serbs will cede a percentage of territories under their control,  otherwise, if they go for a union with Yugoslavia, all of  Posavina [the Sava River basin] will be taken away from them  (the Serbs would lose the corridor, while the connection with  other Serbian countries would be cut), as well as the enclaves  in eastern Bosnia. However, if the Serbs are flexible enough,  that is to say, if they join the federation, a corridor  connecting them with other Serb lands 10 kilometers wide  (Karadzic demands 50 kilometers) would be given to them, and  they would also be allowed to keep some predominantly Muslim  enclaves in eastern Bosnia that are now under their control.    It is clear to Karadzic that it is impossible to return all  the territories in northern and eastern Bosnia to the Croats and  Muslims, for a simple reason: The land has been devastated and  the people displaced. It is clear to him that he will have to  agree to a corridor connecting the Muslim enclaves with the new,  Vienna-made federation. It is also clear to him that Washington  and Moscow will first require the Croats and Muslims to  determine which territories they would accept as final, because  they cannot have the desired 60 percent, and also that very  soon, given the mixture of concessions and threats, he will be  forced into negotiations and further compromises. As for the  aforementioned adjustment to the general situation, which was  made possible for Karadzic by a sort of timeout, which also  included the consultations with Belgrade, a part of that process  is also the announcement of the forthcoming meeting of the  assembly of the Srpska republic. As we have discovered, at the  meeting the possible territorial concessions will be discussed  again, as well as certain staff changes. Well-informed sources  claim that those changes apply even to the military top brass  itself!    Whether that will mean that Karadzic has been softened  enough  remains to be seen. Besides, it will also become clearer how  large a piece of Bosnia-Herzegovina the Serbs intend to keep for  themselves. The only certain thing right now is that they would  not mind joining the Muslim-Croatian federation (such comments  were heard after the talks with Churkin), if they could also  form a kind of confederation with Yugoslavia at the same time.</p>

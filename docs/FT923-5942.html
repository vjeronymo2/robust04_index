			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bisichi plans to sell retail property Bisichi Mining yesterday announced a planned retail property disposal, together with unchanged profits for the first half to June 30. It is selling its interest in a investment property in Leeds for Pounds 250,000 to London Associated Investment Trust, which holds a 40.7 per cent stake in Bisichi. The disposal reflects a change in the two companies joint ownership policy. The proceeds will go some way to satisfying the costs of the acquisition, completed earlier this week, of 11 retail units and a public house on a half acre site in Burnley, Lancashire, for Pounds 790,000 cash. A further contribution is the Pounds 194,000 proceeds from the sale in May of Bisichi's holding in an Australian gold mining company. The company announced unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 78,000 and static earnings of 0.55p per share. Gross income was Pounds 189,000 (Pounds 214,000).</p>

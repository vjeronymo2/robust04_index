			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Staff seek to capture Strangeways: Public-sector bid to run the recently modernised Manchester prison IN the three years since the near destruction of Strangeways prison in Manchester during the most serious prison riots of recent times, it has been completely rebuilt and modernised within its Victorian red-brick shell. Today the physical reconstruction will be followed by an equally remarkable transformation of the management of Strangeways, when the public and private sectors submit rival bids to run the prison. Two private-sector companies have already been awarded contracts to manage British prisons. But Strangeways - with accommodation for 1,150 men - is on a bigger scale and, for the first time, the state prison service and the private sector are bidding against each other as part of the government's market testing of public services. About six private-sector bids are expected. One from the Strangeways management and staff led by Mr Robin Halward, the governor, will be pitched against them. Mr Halward, former governor of Armley prison, Leeds, moved to Strangeways last year to prepare the public-sector bid. When Mr Halward's bid reaches the Home Office today it will emphasise that it has the strong support of the Strangeways unions and staff. The Prison Officers' Association and other prison-service unions are opposed to market testing and private management. They decided, however, that rather than boycott the process their strongest position was to demonstrate that the public sector could compete and win. Two members of the Strangeways POA committee have worked full-time on the bid for the past six months as representatives of the unions and junior staff. The 400 Strangeways staff - almost all of whom experienced the 1990 riots - are backing the bid even though they know that success would cost some of them their jobs. Mr Halward admitted: 'Staffing levels under our bid would be substantially leaner than if the prison ser-vice had reopened Strange-ways in the traditional way.' Other concessions have been made. The POA has a reputation for traditional, old-fashioned militancy. While Mr Halward believes the view of the prison service as a 'dispute-ridden, industrial-relations dominated organisation' is distorted, he has secured local POA agreement to maintain the prison's contract with the government in the event of industrial action. 'No workforce can guarantee that there will never be a dispute of one sort or another,' he said. 'But the bid will include a procedural agreement with the local POA which guarantees the maintenance of standards required in the service level agreement (the government contract) during any collective dispute that there might be.' The Strangeways staff bid also proposes a more devolved management structure than in other state prisons. Mr Halward said that historically the prison service had been 'full of the Civil Service tradition' of concentrating on processes rather than outcomes. 'Until a few years ago work on suicide prevention in prison focused more on being able to defend the prison service if a prisoner took his own life than on looking at why it happened. 'We have to put judgment more to the fore by deciding what we want to achieve and allowing managers at every level, within guidelines, to make their own professional judgments about how to achieve it. Our bid proposes more managerial devolution than is normal in a public prison, with managers working out with their staff how to achieve objectives.' Serious overcrowding, leading to prisoners being required to share cells for most of the day, helped provoke the Strangeways riots. In the new Strangeways men will be out of their cells for up 12 to 15 hours. 'But it is no use unlocking prisoners and then leaving them milling around all day,' Mr Halward said. 'We have to try to get prisoners to indulge in positive activities, and create a positive, active community in the hope that people might carry over some of these values when they are released. Compared with other local prisons, our bid proposes a much better programme of work, training, education and ways of addressing offending behaviour,' he added. The 350 prisoners who remained in Strangeways during rebuilding were consulted when the bid was being prepared. Mr Halward believes in the need to involve prisoners, but stressed: 'This is not going to be a democracy. We would not be discharging our responsibility to the public if we just allowed prisoners to do what they wanted.' Bids to manage Strangeways will be reduced to a shortlist next month, with the contract awarded in the summer. Staff at Strangeways would be disappointed - and surprised - if their bid did not make the shortlist and believe they have a real hope of winning. Mr Halward said: 'We are convinced that the public sector bid is commercially competitive. And one of our particular strong points is that we have the workforce - the prison's highly experienced staff have agreed to accept change, know what is expected of them, and are ready to deliver it.'</p>

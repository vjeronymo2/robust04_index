			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Non-managerial staff reject 5% Midland offer MIDLAND BANK, the last of the big four clearing banks to enter pay negotiations this year, has offered its 35,000 non-managerial staff a rise of 5 per cent from June 1. The offer was rejected by union negotiators and both sides will meet again at the end of the week. Only a small improvement is expected on the offer, and it is likely that the final settlement will fall at the lower end of this year's likely 5-7 1/2 per cent range of pay increases for the clearers. Midland's poor financial performance led it to halve its dividend earlier this year. Pressure on Midland's management to increase the offer will be reduced to some extent by the June settlement date and what is expected to be a continuing drop in inflation before then. The other main clearing banks' pay increases take effect from February and April. Mr Ed Sweeney, deputy general secretary elect of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, said that Midland's negotiators had also drawn attention to an offer of 5 per cent by Lloyds Bank to its 46,000 non-managerial staff. Lloyds has said there is no further room for improvement on the offer, although more talks are due to take place today. Barclays' staff have already settled for a rise of more than 7 per cent and NatWest has implemented a 7.5 per cent rise as part of a deal that will allow the bank to require more flexible starting times from its employees. Unions and management at TSB are also due to meet again at the end of the week following an increase in the pay offer to staff from 6.75 per cent to 7 per cent. Bifu members are being balloted on industrial action at Lombard North Central. The National Union of Mineworkers has offered to back a recognition claim by the banking union Bifu at the North of England Building Society by urging NUM members to withdraw their savings from the society. Bifu has not taken up the offer 'for the moment', it said, because the move could threaten the livelihood of its members.</p>

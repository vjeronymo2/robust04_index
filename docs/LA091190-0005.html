			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO WATCH;  </P> <P> SIGNATURE, PLEASE  </P> <P> There are a pile of bills passed by the state Legislature sitting on Gov.  George Deukmejian's desk that would be law but for the flourish of his pen.  Some are worthy ones indeed; here are three:  </P> <P> CLEAN BILL: More than 1 million automobiles in the state manage to escape  California's widely applauded Smog Check program because of a loophole.  </P> <P> Legislation worked up by Assembyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento) and Sen.  Robert Presley (D-Riverside) would close it and improve air quality -- with no  cost to the general fund and only a one dollar hike in the inspection fee.  </P> <P> SAFE BILL: Minivans may be great fun and an effective means of family  transportation, but not all minivans are alike. Some models do not comply with  minimum safety standards. A bill (AB 3998) before Deukmejian would require  manufacturers, dealers and rental agents to disclose information on whether a  given make and model make the safety grade. Mom and Dad should be able to know  what they're buying or renting.  </P> <P> ENERGY BILL: An industry still very much in an infant stage of development  needs every possible boost from its governmental parents. Two bills (AB 4090,  SB 86) would provide tax-credit incentives to the kind of solar-power  development so vital to this state. California has offered solar-tax credits  since 1977, and it is no surprise that we lead the world in solar power. But  the credits were allowed to lapse. Let's keep the lead and show the way to a  future that's less dependent on foreign oil suppliers that sometimes want to  turn us off.  </P></p>

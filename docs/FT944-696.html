			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Shareholder power lost Sir, Mr Edward Leigh MP (Letters, December 16) makes a strong point about the need to empower shareholders to control executive salaries. He also makes a point of great significance concerning the powerlessness of investors to have any influence upon fund managers whatsoever. But he misses a point when he suggests that purely fiscal measures to encourage direct share ownership are involved. Rolling settlement has been used by stockbrokers as an excuse for forcing small shareholders' investment into nominee accounts. Once in these accounts, the small shareholder's rights to receive annual reports and to vote are extinguished. Nominee accounts also allow the brokers to charge fees where none was necessary before, thereby further raising the barriers to private share ownership. Fiscal incentives to compensate for these fees would have to be substantial. There is no longer a route for the active small investor to have a direct influence on the public company in which they have invested. This does matter; small investors have performed a valuable role in highlighting issues of corporate strategy in the past, as when Alan Sugar proposed to return Amstrad to private ownership.

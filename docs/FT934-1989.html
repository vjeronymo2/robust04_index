			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement: Dublin invites debate The Irish government says it will not spell out in advance which issues it considers might represent a threat to the unionist community's ethos and way of life, or which 'can be represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and pluralistic society', as noted in paragraph six of the joint declaration. Dublin says it is prepared to discuss and consider 'ways of removing such obstacles' but that it is for the unionists to present a list of concerns. Apart from the clauses in Ireland's constitution that lay claim to the province, the clause means that issues in areas such as divorce and abortion are likely to be raised. Legalisation of the former and easing of restrictions on the latter are due to go through the Dail next year. The continuing strong influence of the Catholic church over school curriculums in the Irish republic is also likely to prove a highly contentious issue with Ulster's Protestants. Education reforms are under way in the south, but the Catholic church hierarchy is fiercely challenging any erosion of its power. Unionist parties are also to be invited to join the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, together with other parties in both parts of the island. This is designed 'to be a consultative body but without any legislative powers', according to a government spokesman. However Mr Reynolds indicated yesterday that the real objective of such a forum was to provide a further incentive for Sinn Fein to renounce violence by offering it an early role in the negotiating process. He said in his address to the Irish parliament yesterday that the forum would be established 'after a real cessation of violence'.</p>

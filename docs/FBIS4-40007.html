			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevhen Talipov, chairman of the Lvov City </F> Committee of the Ukrainian Socialist Party, Ivan Lutsuk,  chairman of the Ukrainian Socialist Party Oblast Committee, and  Oleksandr Pokrovskyy, member of the Ukrainian Socialist Party  Political Council, by Oleh Statsyshyn; place and date not given]    [Text] Our meeting with the leadership of the Lvov branch  of the Ukrainian Socialist Party [SPU] was held in one of the  downtown bars. Six leaders of the Lvov branch, including SPU  Oblast Committee Chairman Ivan Lutsuk, SPU City Committee  Chairman Yevhen Talipov, and Oleksandr Pokrovskyy, member of the  SPU Political Council, were present. These names are not  well-known to the general public, however, to a great extent,  their viewpoints reflect the position of the party. It is  natural that the interview began with a question as to how the  SPU views the current political situation in our state.    [Talipov] The fact that Chairman of the Political Council O.  Moroz became Supreme Council chairman is positive. He is not a  political novice. I do not think that Ukraine will lose while  he is in office. He has profound experience and a desire to  work. I believe that he will become a consolidating factor and  will not be affected by political affinities.    [Statsyshyn] Do you believe that Moroz will manage to unite  the leftist and right forces?    [Talipov] If he is unable to do this, we were wrong and  should not have placed our stakes on him. He has every  opportunity and all the strength to unite the legislature. The  key issue is the independence of Ukraine, the welfare of the  population, and adhering to promises which we gave to our people.    [Statsyshyn] Some SPU deputies see their primary mission as  "restoring what has been ruined by the democratic  administration." What do you mean by this?    [Talipov] Our position is clear and evident. Each Supreme  Council deputy -- before he was elected a deputy -- provided a  program which promised welfare and more active battles for the  independence of Ukraine, democracy, and social progress. The  previous legislature did not fulfill any of their promises --  virtually nothing was implemented, only streets were renamed,  symbols changed, "wild" capitalism was imposed on us and, in  addition, they resigned early. Therefore, people said "no" to  them. Currently, new people -- able to rebuild Ukraine -- will  come to power. However, reconstruction does not mean the  destruction of everything which existed before. The previous  legislature adopted some 300 legislative acts. Should we repeal  them? The key task is to continue reviving Ukraine.    [Statsyshyn] What priorities were discusses at the SPU  plenum?    [Pokrovskyy] I participated in the work of the plenum. The  democratic administration ruined some things and we should  restore them. They completely ruined the economy over the past  four years. Dozens of enterprises do not work, employment and  prices have grown considerably. Therefore, I believe, that the  key task is to restore the economy. The principle aim is to  stabilize prices, restore a stable national currency, liquidate  profiteering, and restore the volume of production. We  discussed this at the plenum. The point is that it is necessary  to stabilize the political system in Ukraine, to unite the  efforts of all political parties, trade union movements, and  working collectives to resolve economic issues. To consolidate  society, the Political Council adopted a decision to suspend the  activities of O. Moroz as chairman of the SPU. His obligations  were transferred to People's Deputy Serhiy Kyyashka.    [Statsyshyn] Are the fears of Ukraine losing its  independence  under socialist rule founded?    [Talipov] The one who says these words has not read any of  the SPU documents. You will not find anything you are speaking  about in our program. The West does not welcome us, we wish to  restore the relations which have been ruined. Those people --  the ones who did this -- are now wealthy. However, working  collectives and working people suffer. Therefore, we will never  tell people such nonsense. Why was Oleksandr Oleksandrovych  supported in the legislature? Because he did everything to  revive Ukraine. In the true sense of the word.    [Statsyshyn] You said that Moroz's task was to unite all of  the political forces. How will you explain that neither  Kostenka nor Durdynets -- who were proposed by other legislative  factions -- were elected deputy chairmen? How will Moroz find  common language with, let us say, Chornovol or Khmara? Do you  think that they want to unite with you?    [Lutsuk] What is the basis for consolidating political  forces? The concept of independence. This is one of the  postulates of the SPU program. Do Chornovol or Khmara oppose  independence? Ukraine has huge economic potential. Therefore,  we support a wealthy Ukraine. Do Chornovol or Khmara oppose  this? Therefore, I believe that we will be able to find common  language with both Chornovol and Khmara.    [Talipov] By the way, according to Ivan Makar, O. Moroz is  the smartest Supreme Council deputy. The Supreme Council  chairman is a person around whom all parties and movements  should unite. He should not adopt someone's platform, such as  our esteemed President Kravchuk did. Either he consolidates  with Rukh or he goes to the people, or he goes somewhere else;  in a word, he has no established position. The Ukraine of today  is neither communist, nor socialist, nor belonging to Rukh, nor  to anyone else. We have a multiparty system and the people will  decide for themselves who they will follow. The fact that the  bloc of leftist forces won in the election demonstrates that the  people's eyes have been opened and esteemed deputies should  respect their opinion. There are still such people who believe  that the "Rukh is our navigator."</p>

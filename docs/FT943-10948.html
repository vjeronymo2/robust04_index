			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Seacon drops to Pounds 437,000 Seacon Holdings, the USM-quoted shipping and distribution group, reported a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 818,000 to Pounds 437,000 on turnover ahead from Pounds 9.09m to Pounds 9.54m for the six months to end-March. Mr Chris Roth, chairman, said that the outcome had been affected by the development of the new terminal at Tower Wharf in Northfleet, Kent. Net interest receivable had been halved to Pounds 155,000, reflecting capital expenditure on the project and lower interest rates. Because of disruption caused by the construction work, Seacon had incurred additional costs relating to the short-term hire of warehousing and plant as well as the employment of temporary additional staff in order to discharge ships and move cargo by inefficient methods, Mr Roth said. Although the new terminal was completed just before the period end, it would take a while to get it operating at maximum efficiency, he added. Earnings per share emerged at 1.18p (2.25p) and the interim dividend is increased to 0.97p, against 0.92p adjusted for the 5-for-2 share split in March. A recommended final of not less than 1.36p is forecast.</p>

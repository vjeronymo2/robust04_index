Ministry officials said Wednesday that  Korea and Russia have decided to open three to four pilot  research complexes in Moscow this year to accelerate transfers  of advanced Russian technology. The project is expected to  enhance current Korean-Russian research cooperation, exchanges  of researchers and training of engineers, the officials said.    Through the program, Korea will be able to utilize Russia's  vast and sophisticated research facilities and brainpower to  acquire intensive scientific and technological information from  the ex-superpower, they said. The complexes will be locally  incorporated through joint investments, with Korea paying cash  for maintenance and research in the beginning stage and Russia  providing the facilities and manpower. Research will be focused  on technologies concerning machinery, materials, and  electric/electronics that are lacking among Korean manufacturers  as well as physics, chemistry and other basic sciences. For its  part, the government will offer advice, help in choosing,  commissioning and registering Russian partners, and subsidies  for research projects and other expenses, the officials said.</p>

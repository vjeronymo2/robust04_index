			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar and pound firmer The dollar and sterling were yesterday both beneficiaries of rallies which came at the expense of the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith. Both moves were technically driven, rather than a reflection of fundamentals, and came against the backdrop of low turnover in markets devoid of any news to respond to. 'The market is looking for things to do, rather than what it really believes in,' was the comment of one trader. The only release of note was the July durable goods number in the US, a figure too volatile to offer much direction to the market. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5411, from DM1.5377. Against the yen if finished slightly down at Y98.415 from Y98.45. Sterling hung on to the coat-tails of the US currency, to close at DM2.3977, from DM2.3893, and at Dollars 1.5558 from Dollars 1.5539. The sterling index finished three basis points firmer at 78.9. The D-Mark was mixed in Europe, finishing slightly higher against the Swedish krona, but down against the Italian lira. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, said there appeared to be an 'anti D-Mark mood' in the market. Evidence of this was the firmer dollar, which spilled over into Europe. The Franc, for example, appreciated steadily throughout the day from FFr3.4320 down to the FFr3.4250 level. Sterling also threatened to rise above the DM2.40 level. Mr Parsons said these moves did not reflect new news, but 'a failure of previous chart targets.' In the case of the dollar, for example, the currency rallied before it touched the recent low of DM1.5165, reached on July 12. He attributed this to a diminished appetite for risk in the market. 'The pain threshold is a lot lower than it would have been a year ago,' said Mr Parsons. He said investors appeared to be running ever tighter stop levels, meaning that they were quicker to liquidate positions that turned against them. 'If you don't get instant gratification, you have a reversal of the position.' Traders said that failure of the dollar to re-test the old low suggested that the downside for the currency had been established. Yesterday it tried to capitalise on this and push higher, but without conspicuous success. The durable goods numbers were insufficiently reliable for any firm conclusions to be drawn about the economy. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said a pattern appeared to have been established whereby European crosses. pushed down by a stronger D-Mark, recovered quickly once the dollar stabilised. 'This pattern will stop people aggressively shorting those cross-rates,' said Mr Gunner. The recommencement of US-Japan insurance talks was accompanied by some brave talk out of Tokyo about the yen. A senior Bank of Japan official was quoted by news agencies saying: 'We believe that it is not difficult to change the current market sentiment through timely and appropriate action.' 'The BOJ will act tenaciously to stabilise recent speculative currency movements,' he said. His comments came against a background of market rumours in Tokyo that the BOJ had broadened the ambit of its market intervention beyond banks, to operating through brokers too. The official predicted that the dollar was unlikely to drop below its post-war low of Y96.60, reached on July 12. Yesterday evening US negotiators said they were making a 'bit of progress' in the insurance trade talks, but said they did not expect a quick resolution. Activity in the short sterling market was very quiet with the December contract trading only 12,300 lots to finish unchanged at 93.36. Mr Peter Osler, economist at brokers GNI, said the market was waiting for the price expectations component of the CBI's industrial trends survey, to be released tomorrow. The Bank of England recently signalled it out as an important policy indicator. Traders said there had been an upsurge in short sterling options volatility ahead of the CBI release. 'As people get nervous, so volatility goes up,' said Mr Osler. Options volatility is much higher than in Germany and France, reflecting the more stable rate outlook in those countries. Mr Parsons of CIBC said that following the recent good PPI and RPI numbers, it was possible that price expectations in the CBI survey would be revised downwards. This would help sterling interest rate markets. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said sterling futures appeared to be too pessimistic about interest rate prospects. Six month sterling LIBOR, for example, is project to rise from 6 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent over the next six months. Mr Norfield said these projections should be taken 'with a large pinch of salt'. The current inflation environment does not bear comparison with the past, he said.</p>

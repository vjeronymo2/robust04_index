			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanon today lodged a protest with the UN Security  Council against Israel for the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani,  the official in the faithful resistance, from his home in  al-Biqa' on Saturday 21 May.    Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz clarified that the complaint  does not yet request the Security Council to convene. He noted  that Lebanon reserves the right to ask the Security Council to  convene when necessary. Minister Buwayz described the  kidnapping as an act of piracy that violates human rights and  Lebanon's sovereignty, and attacks its security and stability.    REUTER cited a responsible official at the Foreign Ministry  as saying that the Lebanese complaint also demands that Israel  should quickly release al-Dirani and return him to Lebanon since  this act is considered a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and  contradicts the trends toward peace in the region.</p>

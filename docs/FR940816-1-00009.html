Customs has concluded that the retention of the notice of exportation is essential, especially in those circumstances where the drawback claimant is not the direct exporter, and the exporter refuses to provide its own documentary evidence to the claimant because of business confidentiality or the administrative cost of providing such supporting documents.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This withdrawal is effective on August 16, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bruce Friedman, Office of Trade Operations, (202&hyph;927&hyph;0916). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Drawback is a refund or remission, in whole or in part, of a Customs duty, internal revenue tax or fee. There are a number of different kinds of drawback authorized under law, including, for example, manufacturing drawback and unused merchandise drawback. In order to qualify for drawback, there must be an exportation or a destruction under Customs supervision. The statute providing for specific types of drawback is 19 U.S.C. 1313. Part 191, Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 191), contains the general regulations for drawback claims and specialized provisions for specific types of drawback claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements for establishing the exportation of merchandise as part of a drawback claim are set forth in subpart E of part 191. This subpart authorizes the use of several alternative procedures to establish exportation. Two such alternatives, contained in &sect;&sect;191.51(a) and 191.52 (19 CFR 191.51(a), 191.52), require a claimant, in order to receive drawback, to file a notice of exportation on Customs Form (CF) 7511, either uncertified, or certified by a Customs officer at the time of exportation, for each shipment of merchandise exported. The information required on a CF 7511 consists of the name of the exporting vessel or carrier, the number and kinds of packages and their marks and numbers, a description of the merchandise, the name of the exporter, and the country of ultimate destination. This information, however, is also available from other paperwork, particularly documents usually generated by the exporter internally in the process of trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, Customs published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46113), which would have eliminated the notice of exportation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CF 7511, and instead permitted the use of such other documents generated internally in the course of trade to prove exportation for purposes of obtaining drawback. It was believed that this would result in a saving of paperwork to the benefit of both Customs as well as the drawback claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thirty comments were received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. Of the thirty comments only four generally were in favor of eliminating or replacing the CF 7511. The remaining twenty-six comments strongly opposed the elimination of the CF 7511.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Almost all of the commenters opposing the elimination of the CF 7511 stated that they would be forced to relinquish their right to claim drawback whenever they were not the direct exporter. A separate exporter might not be willing to provide documentation that would reveal information such as the name and address of the foreign purchaser and prices charged by the exporter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, many of these commenters believed that the CF 7511  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was necessary for shipments to Mexico and Canada, citing the unavailability of other documents as a continuing problem for drawback claimants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another reason against the proposed change mentioned by several commenters was the fact that the reverse side of the CF 7511 is used for the endorsement of drawback rights from one party to another. This endorsement also satisfies the requirement of &sect;191.73(a), which requires satisfactory evidence that the reservation was made with the knowledge and consent of the exporter. If this form were to be abolished, Customs would probably have to develop another form to take its place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was further asserted that the CF 7511 in fact also provided information that might not be readily available on other documents, such as the name of the carrier, the date of exportation, the destination, and the shipper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Though the concerns about proof of exportation to Mexico and Canada have been resolved by &sect;181.47(c), Customs Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (19 CFR 181.47(c)), which also allows a copy of the Canadian or Mexican customs entry to be used as proof of exportation, Customs is, nevertheless, constrained to conclude that the comments submitted point out persuasive, and controlling, reasons militating against adoption of the proposal, and that, on balance, the retention of the notice of exportation satisfies the concerns of the trade, while occasioning relatively minimum and reasonably justified time and effort in its preparation and/or certification. In particular, the retention of the notice is essential, especially in those circumstances where the drawback claimant is not the direct exporter, and the exporter refuses to provide its own documentary evidence to the claimant because of business confidentiality or the administrative cost of providing such supporting documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Withdrawal of Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of the foregoing, and after consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, Customs has determined to withdraw the notice of proposed rulemaking published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46113).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of this document was Russell Berger, Regulations Branch, U.S. Customs Service.

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (20): Alternating currents - Electricity faces commercial war MR FRIEDHELM GIESKE, the tough-talking boss of mighty RWE, Germany's sixth largest industrial group, and its biggest electricity generator, does not mince his words. He does not like the sort of ideas being proposed in Brussels for more open competition in the European electricity market. He does not think they are fair. If it is going to happen, he is determined that all the operators in the EC market should face the same ground rules. 'The German electricity industry, in so far as it falls under European competition rules, must have the same operating framework, the same risks and opportunities, as the rest of the European industry,' he said recently. He does not think that is true today. The industrial price of electricity in Germany is around six pfennigs per kilowatt-hour more expensive than in France. 'Energy-intensive industry is already looking for other locations outside Germany, because of the high costs,' says Mr Thomas Klante, spokesman for RWE. The German utilities - there are more than 1,000, but the industry is dominated by the Big Three, Bayernwerk in Bavaria, PreussenElektra in Hanover, and RWE in the Ruhr - insist the reason is not their inefficiency or lack of genuine competition. They blame a series of 'special burdens' imposed on the German industry which have made it clearly uncompetitive. The first is the political uncertainty hanging over the future of nuclear power generation in Germany, where all construction of such power stations has come to a complete standstill. Nuclear power provides just 34 per cent of German electricity, compared with some 70 per cent in France. The second burden is the cost of supporting Germany's indigenous hard coal industry, whose output costs around DM275 per tonne, compared with a world market price of around DM85 per tonne. Most of the difference is made up by German consumers, who pay an ill-named 'coal penny', now amounting to a 7.5 per cent surcharge on their bills, to subsidise domestic coal. But the electricity utilities claim that, even with that cash, they still have to cross-subsidise coal-burning power stations with their cheaper nuclear power. The third burden is the very strict environmental legislation in Germany, which has imposed higher standards of pollution, health and safety than in most other EC countries. Now the German government is a prime mover for a carbon dioxide tax in the EC, which would ironically hit Germany hardest, because it burns more coal, above all soft brown coal, in its power stations. Finally there is the unique burden of rebuilding the east German power supply and distribution network, estimated to require an investment of at least DM46bn over the next 10 years. All of those issues are now on the table at an extraordinary round of negotiations between the relevant government ministers, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), the electricity utilities, and the trade unions, to thrash out an 'energy consensus'. It is peculiarly German, unstructured, and unpredictable in its consequences. The nuclear debate, for a start, looks hopeless. The Greens, who had earned their seat at the table because they are part of ruling coalitions in at least two key state governments - Lower Saxony and Hesse - where nuclear power is generated, have walked out because they have been unable to force through its total abandonment. The SPD is divided between outright opponents of nuclear energy and cautious adherents. In the ruling coalition, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) is strongly pro-nuclear, while the rest are sympathetic but pragmatic. The irony is that the pro-nuclear and pro-coal lobbies have a strong common interest. Both sides argue that, as German coal is so expensive, the country can only afford it if it compensates with cheap nuclear power. 'We are not in competition with nuclear energy,' says Baron Alfred von Spies, head of the German coal industry federation. 'We believe in an energy mix, because it is secure in terms of supply and in terms of risk. Preserving an energy mix is the reason we can afford high subsidies for hard coal.' It is the reason the SPD is divided. Leaders from the big coal mining areas, such as Mr Johannes Rau, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, 'know that the end of nuclear power in Germany means the end of indigenous coal-mining,' says Mr Thomas Roser, director of the nuclear lobby group in Bonn, the Deutsches Atomforum. On the other hand, the power industry is divided. Bayernwerk, in the south, is heavily dependent on nuclear energy, which already accounts for about 70 per cent of its power. RWE and Preussen-Elektra, in the north, could switch to other sources: they could go for coastal power stations fired by gas or imported coal. So they are less committed. The issues on the agenda of the consensus talks are daunting. They must decide on the acceptable operating life of the 20 nuclear power plants which are working. They must decide on an acceptable way of either reprocessing or disposing of their nuclear waste. Nobody really expects them to succeed yet in deciding whether to go ahead with a new generation of N-plants. On the coal front, they must decide on a subsidy system to replace the coal penny which is acceptable both to the European Commission, and the German power industry. For once they are arguing in the same direction. The former wants absolute transparency in coal subsidies, and a plan to phase them out. The latter wants a system which will make the price of German hard coal competitive with the world market price, so they pay no hidden subsidies. The answer would appear to be some form of direct coal tax, payable to the mines. As for the environment, they must decide on the future of the carbon dioxide tax. That is fiercely opposed by the industry, above all RWE, which gets the largest portion of its power supplies from brown coal. 'If the CO2 tax is introduced here, then brown coal will be uncompetitive (with imported coal) from that moment on,' says Mr Klante. 'It is currently the only primary energy source in Germany which has been and will be available in large quantities, and which is not subsidised.' Brown coal is also the source of virtually all power generation in east Germany: 95 per cent in 1992. For the preservation of jobs in east Germany, and for its economic future, brown coal is essential. The East may yet prove to be the soft underbelly of the mighty electricity utilities' total domination of the German industry. The Big Three thought they had the market sewn up with the Stromvertrag (electricity contract) they signed with the transitional East German government, even before unification. The contract was challenged by 164 local authorities in the German constitutional court, because it restricted their rights to generate their own power supplies. The two sides have limped towards a compromise, which allows the local authorities guaranteed access to the utilities' grid. At the same time, the Treuhand privatisation agency, backed by the finance ministry in Bonn, has decided to bring foreign investors into the brown coal mining industry, instead of leaving it all to RWE's Rheinbraun. A consortium of Britain's PowerGen and NRC of the US looks set to buy Mibrag, the middle-German opencast mining operation, and, with it, access to the east German grid. So the utilities are suddenly fighting on three fronts: in Brussels, Bonn and Berlin. Mr Gieske is angry. He insists that the east German brown coal industry will only be economic as a single entity. But if the political authorities are determined to bring in outsiders, so be it. They must live with the uneconomic consequences, he says. Few who know him believe he will give in without a bit more of a fight.</p>

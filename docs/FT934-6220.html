			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK airline may sue over EU subsidies British Midland Airways (BMA), the UK's second largest airline, is considering taking legal action against the European Commission for failing to enforce new rules against government subsidies for financially troubled European state-controlled airlines. Sir Michael Bishop, BMA's chairman, said yesterday his airline was already taking legal advice over possible action against the Commission. He claimed Brussels was distorting the new liberalised European aviation market by failing to uphold the new rules against state subsidies to ensure fair competition in its third airline liberalisation package which came into force at the beginning of this year. 'Smaller airlines were enticed to expand their services in the new deregulated market on the grounds that the EU would stop state aid for national flag carriers,' Sir Michael said. With Brussels failing to clamp down on these subsidies, smaller airlines have been badly hit while bigger, financially troubled, state-owned carriers have been able to continue operating under the protection of large government handouts, he argued. Troubled state carriers, including Air France, Air Portugal and Aer Lingus, are receiving substantial financial support from their governments provoking, in Sir Michael's view , 'a grotesque distortion' of the new EU open airline market. 'A number of smaller airlines are going bust, while the bigger companies which are really bust are being allowed to carry on through artificial supports,' he said. Sir Michael said he had already raised these issues with the EU competition and transport commissioners at a meeting of the European Airlines Association in Brussels last Friday. Although the UK government has also campaigned against state support for European national carriers, Sir Michael also accused the British government of distorting the UK airline market by failing to review last year's acquisition of Dan-Air, the Gatwick-based regional carrier, by British Airways for a nominal Pounds 1. 'The UK government has also let down smaller airlines by turning Nelson's eye to BA's takeover, first of British Caledonian and then of Dan-Air,' he said. As a result BMA had been squeezed on two fronts: in Europe and the UK. Unlike several other smaller European airlines, BMA had been able to compete against the larger flag carriers because of its strong position at London's Heathrow airport, where it holds the second largest number of landing slots after BA, and its partnership with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), which currently owns 34.9 per cent of the UK carrier.</p>

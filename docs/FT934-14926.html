			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Technology: Planning for a speedy recovery - Joia Shillingford on how NatWest got its computers back on their feet The night before the Bishopsgate bomb in the City of London, Mary Jackson, head of technology at the NatWest Tower, came back from holiday. Next day, Saturday April 24, her mobile telephone rang. The building was in darkness, she was told, and 10 of her staff were inside. 'We thought it was just a routine bomb scare and were irritated by the thought of our weekend maintenance work being delayed by two hours,' says systems manager Geoff Taylor. He looked into the computer room. The computers were exposed to the elements and some equipment, including a Wang minicomputer and a mid-range IBM AS/400, had been damaged. But most were still running. Since then, Jackson and her colleagues have been involved in both technology change and disaster recovery. She first contacted 20 of her staff and asked them to meet her on Sunday. From the building, they removed important files such as a printout with details of all computer equipment allocated to each person in the tower. Most equipment had survived. But dust and glass had rained on to the computers, getting between cracks and under keyboards. Loss adjustors said they would have to be removed, taken apart, cleaned and re-assembled. Personal computers and substitute Wang systems had to be borrowed from other parts of NatWest and suppliers. Voice and data lines were installed and re-routed through the bank's alternative City communications centre. By Monday, all critical staff were provided with a telephone and PC. At first, most only had access to standalone PCs. But Friday night's Wang back-up tapes (moved off-site early on Saturday morning as usual) were installed. Since then, Jackson's department has worked overtime to organise removal of computers, tapes, telephones and photocopiers from the tower to spare NatWest offices nearby in Drapers Gardens. Each batch of machines has been transferred to another floor and labelled for despatch to the site where its former users now work. A final assessment of computer damage has yet to be made. Some of the Wang equipment was damaged, but the bank was already moving to PC-based local area networks (Lans) running the Windows graphical user interface and a mixture of Microsoft and Lotus applications. The bomb accelerated this process. The tower's computer environment has now been duplicated at Drapers Gardens. But Jackson's team cannot relax. Taylor and other IT staff will work until Christmas to supervise the introduction of new Lans at Drapers Gardens as more users move in. The introduction of PC-based technology has involved a steep learning curve for Jackson's staff and users. 'Because of the bomb we've been forced to make a momentous leap from old systems to new.' Users who worked on Wang systems in the tower, and with PCs or standalone Wang terminals at their temporary accommodation, have transferred to Microsoft Windows applications at Drapers Gardens. No one receives any other training until they have been trained on the Windows interface. 'We make it very hard for them to say no to training because we offer it when it's convenient for them: day, night or even Sunday,' says Jackson. Despite the rushed timetable, users' acceptance of change has been remarkable, says Jackson. 'They know they have no choice but to adapt because the old system has gone. If we'd wanted to duplicate what they had before, we would have had to cable Drapers Gardens for Wang, then re-cable for LANs.' Meanwhile, a new computer disaster recovery plan is being developed, perhaps using different NatWest data centres as back-up. 'We had a disaster recovery plan before but recent experiences have focused our minds on becoming the best in the business,' says Jackson. 'We now have a hand-picked disaster recovery team made up of people with specialised knowledge who also do other jobs. And we have a detailed but highly confidential, plan which we are about to test.'</p>

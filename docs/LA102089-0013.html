			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLYING CONTINENTAL HOLDS OFF NO MARKER FOR OAK TREE VICTORY  </P> <P> Flying Continental, owned by Jack Kent Cooke, got a battle from No Marker  through the stretch but prevailed by a neck in Thursday's $60,000 feature race  of the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> The top two finishers ran in tandem throughout the 1 1/16-mile race, sitting  just off the early pace of Mi Preferido and Prove Splendid.  </P> <P> Flying Continental and No Marker moved together to take the lead at the top of  the stretch and raced head-to-head from there.  </P> <P> Flying Continental, ridden by Chris McCarron and trained by Jay Robbins, was  clocked in 1:41 4/5 and returned $5.80, $2.80 and $2.40. No Marker paid $4.40  and $3.20.  </P> <P> Gaucho Alerta, who trailed the field by 12 lengths on the backstretch, finished  strongly to take third as the pacesetters faded in the final quarter-mile.  Gaucho Alerta paid $3.60.  </P> <P> It was Flying Continental's first victory since the Santa Catalina Stakes at  Santa Anita in February.  </P></p>

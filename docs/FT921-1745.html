			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Failure grounds Chinese space hopes CHINA'S fledgling commercial space programme was grounded yesterday with the failure of its Long March 3 rocket to put an Australian communications satellite into orbit. As a result, the worldwide satellite industry and its customers in telecommunications and broadcasting face delays and higher fees for launches and insurance. Likely victims include Mr Ted Turner, owner of the CNN satellite television service, Hughes Aircraft of the US, the biggest satellite maker in the world, and Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications company which partly owned the Australian satellite. The countdown in Sichuan province, south-west China, progressed smoothly but the rocket did not take off when the motors ignited. 'In scientific pursuits, failure is unavoidable and frequent,' said China's Great Wall Industrial Corporation, which oversees the marketing of satellite services to foreign customers. Hughes Aircraft, which made the satellite, said: 'With the ignition there was an indication that there may have been a problem, which they detected on their instruments. It went into emergency shutdown.' The commercial launch vehicle is a modified intercontinental ballistic missile. The strap-on engine, which appeared on Chinese television to have caught fire, was one of two booster rockets on the original missile. But launch schedules, planned years in advance, will have to be rewritten. Australia faces a particularly pressing problem since yesterday's satellite was intended to replace one due to go out of service later this year. CNN hopes to broadcast to the Middle East and Africa on a satellite scheduled for launch on Long March 3 next year. The failure will disrupt plans by Sweden and Malaysia for launches in China. Insurance brokers and underwriters will re-examine their satellite premiums. The Long March 3 launches already command a higher premium - about 18 per cent of the typical Dollars 100m (Pounds 57.8m) cost of a satellite - than their rivals. There are only a handful of satellite launchers in the world. They include Ariane, in Europe, and General Dynamics in the US. In an effort to break into this lucrative market, China has been offering sharply lower prices than the Dollars 70m-Dollars 90m charged by western organisations. China has launched 31 satellites since sending its first rocket into space in 1964.</p>

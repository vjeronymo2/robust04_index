			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Mountain bikes that go beneath the sea TRANSMANCHE Link, the contractor building the Channel tunnel, has resorted to pedal power to transport workers through the underground construction site. In a move designed to minimise delays, the consortium has purchased 200 mountain bikes so that workers can cycle along the tunnel. The decision was prompted by concerns that productivity was being hit by delays and congestion on the motorised shuttles which currently ferry workers underground. The bicycles, with 21 gears and specially designed tyres, are available at six points along the service tunnel between the two main rail shafts. Before using them, workers must pass a cycling test and carry a 'riding licence' while underground. The consortium bought 125 bicycles from manufacturers in Britain and 80 from France. The bikes supplied to UK contractors have been hand-built by Saracen, the Warwick-based bicycle manufacturer, and coated in titanium to withstand conditions beneath the seabed.</p>

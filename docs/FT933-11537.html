			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / BBC sets 'robust' reform targets THE BBC's governors yesterday set targets for the corporation for next year, including sharper coverage of science and technology and ensuring interviewees are treated with courtesy. In their first annual review of the BBC's performance the governors also said they would require assurance that financial controls are robust. They want to see that 'managers are using the newly provided financial information to achieve further efficiency gains and that no new bureaucracy is emerging to replace the one so recently dismantled'. The governors said that the diversion of resources from bureaucracy and overheads to creative programme-making must continue because it was at the heart of the reforms now being introduced. Having defined their role for the first time as 'trustees for the public', in future the governors' job will include ensuring that the BBC's strategy reflects the public's needs and interests, ensuring compliance with regulations and guidelines and, for the first time, publishing a regular programme complaints bulletin. The review says that in the past three years the BBC has cut its overheads by a net 5.2 per cent a year and costs in the resource departments were cut by 2.5 per cent a year, releasing an extra Pounds 65m for programme-making.

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: More ups than downs - Philip Coggan looks at the leaders and laggards of 1993 It has been a good year to be invested in equities. Strong signs of a UK recovery, low interest rates and low inflation have combined to make investors switch out of cash and into shares and bonds. The London stock market is hovering around its all-time high. The FT-SE 100 Index has risen 14.9 per cent this year; the FT-A All-Share Index was up 17.8 per cent. Throw in 3-4 per cent for dividend yield and investors have enjoyed a gross return of more than 20 per cent. With deposits paying 6 per cent for most of the year, small wonder that private investors have been buying unit trusts in record numbers. As usual, the annual list of leaders and laggards shows that not all investors will have been lucky. The table of worst-performing Footsie stocks, for example, includes many companies which investors would normally consider 'safe'; food retailers such as Argyll, Sainsbury and Tesco, growth stocks such as Wellcome. In part, this is a cyclical shift. During the recession, investors concentrated on defensive stocks. They bought supermarket shares because consumers would always eat food; they bought drugs stocks because people would always get sick. Wellcome and Glaxo were the best performing shares of 1991. Now that the recession seems to be over, investors have moved into the so-called cyclical stocks, which stand to gain most from recovery. Hence the appearance of British Aerospace and British Steel, two 1991 laggards, at the top of this year's leaders list. But the reasons are not all cyclical. The food retailers are suffering because of fears that they over-expanded in the 1980s by opening too many superstores. Competition may force down their margins. The food retailing sector is the worst performing of all the FT-Actuaries sectors this year. Worst hit was Argyll which warned that its profits would be reduced by about Pounds 40m because of its decision to start depreciating its store values. In the Footsie leaders list, bank and property shares are dominant. Both sectors suffered in the recession. Banks now appear to be benefiting from the effect of lower interest rates on their bad debt problems, buoyant securities markets and improvements in management. Property shares have rebounded since Black Wednesday and apart from gold mines (unrepresented in the Footsie), property is the best performing sector this year. Lower interest rates have encouraged hopes of a recovery in the property market and increase the attractions of high-yielding property shares. The smaller company lists are their normal eccentric selves. The best performing share of all, Aminex, is an Irish oil exploration company which attracted the attention of the Russians, with the state-owned oil group Zarubezhneftj taking an interest. Dana Exploration, another Irish oil company in the leaders' list and one of last year's laggards, also has oil interests in the old Soviet Union. Property group Merivale Moore has also made the transformation from sinner to saint this year. Raglan Property, the worst share of all (apart from those companies which went bust) had a massive financial restructuring which diluted the share capital. Hartstone Group is a former 'go-go' stock; the hosiery and leather goods company is in refinancing talks after breaching banking covenants this summer. The biggest casualty is Tiphook, a trailer leasing company that had a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 600m in October 1991. Old stock market hands get the shivers when the word 'leasing' is mentioned - bearing in mind the fate of Sound Diffusion, Atlantic Computer et al. They will have had their prejudices confirmed by Tiphook, where the heavily indebted and loss-making company, was this year forced to issue a warning that it was in danger of breaching its banking covenants. Investors are awaiting details of the proposed Pounds 830m sale of Tiphook's container fleet.  ----------------------------------------------        Best performing FT-SE 100 stocks  ---------------------------------------------- Company                         % gain  ---------------------------------------------- British Aerospace                155.8 British Steel                    127.0 Royal Bank of Scotland           116.8 Standard Chartered               114.8 Schroders                         85.0 Bank of Scotland                  81.7 MEPC                              75.9 Land Securities                   74.8 Powergen                          74.7 Great Universal Stores            74.6  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream.

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Observer: Dug in It is, to say the least, unusual for a head of state to issue a videofilm of his private garden. But then gardens are rarely as controversial as those of beleaguered Brazilian President Fernando Collor whose press department yesterday distributed a three minute snippet to surprised journalists, government ministers and opposition leaders. Collor's gardens have been at the centre of his fight to withstand an impeachment process; his landscaper revealed that he had received Dollars 2.5m for his work on the president's garden which, he claimed, 'makes the hanging gardens of Babylon look shabby'. Veja, Brazil's leading news-magazine, published photos of the 'Maharajah's Gardens' last week showing a series of waterfalls, a rubber-lined lake full of ornamental Japanese carp, swimming pool, exotic imported trees and night-time illumination. It went on to claim that, while many Brazilians have no access to clean water, the water supplying the president's gardens passes through special filters and oxygenating equipment. However, the presidential video puts the case that the gardens are modest; they had been distorted in the Veja report by special lenses, it claims. The narration ends: 'The president has the right to live well.' However, the waterfalls had been switched off when the video was filmed. Surely a more convincing case for the modesty of the president's lifestyle could have been made had journalists been offered a little liquid refreshment to see for themselves.</p>

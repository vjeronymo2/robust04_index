			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLCHILDREN'S OBSESSION WITH EXPENSIVE BRAND-NAME CLOTHES  </P> <P> The Times' fascinating and distressing coverage of "Children Who Dress to  Excess" includes this quotation, "Advertising at its best is making people feel  that without their product, you're a loser. Kids are very sensitive to that."  </P> <P> Are you sure that wasn't a misquote? Shouldn't it have read "Advertising at its  worst. . . ."?  </P> <P> The same ad agency president goes on to explain that advertisers are aware that  kids are the most emotionally vulnerable and if you can convince them that  they'll be a "dork" if they don't splurge on your overpriced product, they'll  buy it.  </P> <P> How immoral can one get to spend millions of dollars undermining the  self-confidence and feeling of self-worth of all the millions of kids who can't  afford expensive "designer" junk, and convincing them that they are "dorks" and  "losers."  </P> <P> I think we have here a new and very vicious form of child abuse.  </P> <P> WALT HOPMANS  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the Latvian Bureau for Monitoring the  Withdrawal of the Russian Army presented a request to the  headquarters of the Northwestern Group of Russian Forces to  inform the bureau about the schedules for withdrawing from those  Russian military sites that are not mentioned on the schedule  for troop withdrawal presented by Russia. Ilgonis Upmalis, the  head of the bureau, says the schedule provided by Russia does  not include 13 Russian military sites in Latvia, nor 26 army  units located on warships and submarines in Riga and Liepaja.  Upmalis also requested the leaders of the Northwestern Group of  Forces to show the numbers and addresses of the military units  mentioned in the schedule, as well as providing lists of the  military personnel at the army units and their family members.    The schedule for troop withdrawal provided by Russia is an  appendix to the treaty signed in Moscow on the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Latvia.</p>

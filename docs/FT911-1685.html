			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Council Elections: Labour sets the stage to take elections' Oscar IF LOCAL elections have been a test of open government, Labour would be a shoe in. Or would they? After days of dispute as to what a variety of possible results might mean, the Tories chose to keep their teams of analysts strictly behind closed doors. Conservative Central Office in Smith Square was bathed in television floodlight but this illustrated only the party's public face - the building's elegant neo-Georgian facade and its equally well-turned-out landlord, Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman. As Mr Patten darted between camera crew or radio car, the actual number-crunching was kept close to the party's chest. Independent observers hungry for news had to content themselves with sandwiches and instant coffee served in a closely guarded back room far from the real action. Reports of champagne at Walworth Road - south London headquarters of the Labour Party - were premature, although the very beating heart of the electoral machine was freely on display to the cameras. The boardroom - in far-off times the scene of fearsome faction fighting - was now a hive of unified, comradely endeavour. Bleeping television monitors watched over some 20 analysts umbilically tied to the phone lines relaying results from regional headquarters. Elsewhere in the room, Miss Glenda Jackson (observers had been promised celebrities) chatted to Mr Jack Cunningham, the train and limo lagged national campaigns co-ordinator. In another corner, a dot-matrix announcer board winked out the latest triumphs. But only triumphs. There was a sneaking suspicion that resounding victories were slipping through the well-oiled machinery a little more smoothly than the less encouraging figures. It was only in whispers on the stairs that bad news from Calderdale in West Yorkshire was told. All understandable, perhaps, and certainly a more social occasion than tea and biscuits with the Tories. But at moments, under the lights, there was the inkling the room had something in common with a stage set. The camera may never lie but the feverish activity in front of the television crews was sometimes vaguely reminiscent of the days when newsreaders used to work against a 'newsroom' background of shadowy figures carrying files. For sheer drama, however, Labour's show was an Oscar winner, even though we never saw the champagne.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Battersea Power Station sale expected soon BATTERSEA Power Station, the derelict south London landmark, is expected to be sold soon to a Hong Kong property family in a deal negotiated with the banking syndicate that backed the failed scheme to turn the site into a leisure complex. Representatives of Mr George and Mr Victor Hwang, the brothers who are leading negotiations on behalf of their family, said that contracts had been exchanged between the brothers and the banks. This was confirmed by Mr John Broome, whose company, Battersea Leisure, owns the 31-acre site but details of how ownership would be transferred remained unclear. He said last night that the brothers were 'buying the bank debt' but said the brothers' statement yesterday that the deal was to acquire the power station and site 'means the same thing'. He said: 'The exact position is that they have bought into my syndicate bank position and I am involved with them on that level and many other levels.' As one of the brothers was due to fly in today to complete the deal, their spokeswoman said that they had made no guarantees that Mr Broome would continue to be involved in the development. She said: 'The deal has not been finally concluded although it's very, very close.' Mr Broome said he would be coming out of the deal clear of debts on the site. The bank debt, he said, was probably being sold at a discount. The listed art deco power station has been the focus of a long-running debate about its future amid the concerns of local residents that it was in danger of falling into an irreparable state of decay. The announcement appears to have surprised both Wandsworth Council and English Heritage, the government-funded conservation body, which together have the power to veto any proposed planning alterations to the listed building. The Hwangs are controlling shareholders in the Hong Kong Parkview Group, which developed and built the Hong Kong Parkview Complex in Tai Tam, one of the colony's prime residential developments, valued at more than Pounds 1bn. The group's interests cover property, hospitality and leisure, transport and energy. The spokeswoman stressed that the deal was being negotiated with the family and not with Hong Kong Parkview, but could not give details how the sale was being structured. Mr Broome said he had been personally involved in the negotiations, but it is understood that the main negotiations have been with the consortium of banks led by Bank of America, which originally backed Mr Broome's project to develop the power station into a leisure complex. Work on the site stopped after the banks refused further finance when projected development costs overshot by Pounds 60m to Pounds 230m.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / OECD sees sharp growth for Mexico MEXICO should enjoy single-digit annual inflation and growth of 5 to 6 per cent through the mid-1990s, although a widening current account deficit presents risks to the economy, according to a survey from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A survey published today, the first by the Paris-based organisation of industrialised nations for a non-member country outside eastern Europe, says that the deficit - expected to widen to Dollars 16.2bn this year - 'could once again become difficult to finance'. At 5 per cent of GDP, the deficit exceeds that recorded at the onset of the debt crisis in 1982, although, unlike then, it is not a result of government borrowing. However, financing a deficit of such magnitude would imply a growth in the country's foreign liabilities 'in excess of anything observed historically', the report says. So far, the deficit appears not to stem from a lack of competitiveness of Mexican exporters, but reflects rising domestic investment, faster growth in Mexico over that of its trading partners, and a drop in national savings. The OECD said its analysis underlines the importance of policies to encourage savings. Unless savings recover, investment might have to be scaled back, jeopardising the recovery programme. Mexican growth this year will be slower than expected - the 1992 projection has just been revised downward from 4 to 3-3.5 per cent. This, the survey says, is a result of the slow recovery in the US and caution by investors awaiting the conclusion of the treaty on the North American Free Trade Agreement with the US and Canada. This meant that trade and current account deficits were running higher than expected. Some weakening of confidence had also meant that interest rates have had to increase to generate the requisite capital inflows. However, growth should accelerate, to 4.9 per cent, next year. It should then climb towards 6 per cent in 1996, in excess of population expansion, which is expected to slow from the current 1.9 per cent a year. Meanwhile, inflation, which should average 14.5 per cent this year (ending the year at 9.7 per cent), should decline to an average 8 per cent next year and to 7 per cent in 1994. The survey suggested structural improvements were especially needed in agriculture and education, but said it was too early to say whether recent reforms by the government to these ends will be effectively implemented and have the desired effects. Environmental protection was another area where performance needed to improve: in particular, enforcement of environmental laws needed to be better. The risks to a generally optimistic assessment would come if private saving continued to decline, hitting investment, or if further appreciation of the real exchange rate started to hurt Mexican competitiveness. The current account deficit would be further hit if the Nafta were not ratified and the US economic recovery were further delayed or weak. On the other hand, the government's tight fiscal policy should give some cushion against such adverse shocks, the report concludes. The survey is a reflection of increased co-operation between Mexico and the OECD. The Mexican government hopes this will result in its membership of the organisation.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Budget sparks big rise in retail sales BRITAIN'S high streets saw their sharpest increase in business for almost 12 years last month as shoppers hurried to beat the April deadline for VAT and excise increases announced in the Budget. Retail sales figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that volumes rose by a provisional 3.7 per cent in March, after a fall of 0.1 per cent in February. This was the largest monthly rise since June 1979, when volumes surged by 6.9 per cent in the wake of a similarly unexpected decision to raise VAT. Few industry analysts, however, expect volume levels to be sustained into April. In the Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced his intention to raise VAT to 17.5 per cent to pay for big reductions in individual poll tax bills. This increase had a particularly marked effect on sales of large electrical goods, televisions, furniture and carpets in the last two weeks of March, according to the Retail Consortium, which says it represents 90 per cent of the industry. The Budget's indexation of excise duties on alcohol led to 'excellent' sales of wines and spirits ahead of the price increases on April 1, the consortium said. The other big factor boosting sales was that the whole Easter period - traditionally a time for heavy purchases of confectionery and gifts - fell in March, said the CSO. The month also benefited from the stimulus of balmy weather and interest rate cuts. The CSO said no adjustment had been made to account for the timing of Easter. The monthly value of sales in March was Pounds 12.2bn against Pounds 9.26bn the previous month. Trends in retail sales remain depressed. In February, a provisional 1 per cent rise was subsequently revised into a final 0.1 per cent fall. The underlying rate of growth in sales volumes during the three months to March was still only 0.9 per cent, and 0.6 per cent lower than the same period a year ago. The Treasury said it was 'difficult to draw any underlying conclusions' from the figures, which had been 'propelled upwards by the VAT measure and the Easter holiday.' Mr David Walton of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said record rises in unemployment and sharp contraction of credit growth suggested a consumer-led recovery was still a long way off. He expects sales volumes this month to fall by about 3 per cent. The surge had little impact on London's financial markets, which remained preoccupied by the internal troubles of Germany and the rise of the dollar. The provisional index of retail sales volumes was 122.9 (1985=100) in March, after 118.5 in February. Lex, Page 20</p>

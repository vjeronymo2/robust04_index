			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko, under the rubric "In the </F> Parties and Movements": "Where the Ukrainian Party Ark, in Which  Everyone from the Neo-Bolsheviks to the Neo-Nazis Has Gathered,  Will Float"]    [Text] Already on the eve of the parliamentary elections it  is possible to state that despite the talk about "party-phobia"  among the broad masses, there are no fewer political parties or  public organizations and associations which they form for  participation in elections. What is more, these formations can  be classified according to the methodology adopted throughout  the world with the traditional "leftist," "center," and  "rightist" segments and separated by pure party political  programs. In other words, Ukraine has seen the end of that  "distorted mirror" of party life from the days of the struggle  against the Communist Party monopoly when it, as the bearer of  public regression and totalitarianism, was not "leftist," as  everywhere else in the world, but "rightist." And the  traditional "rightists" on the planet--the nationalists,  national radicals, and so on--under our conditions were  "leftists," because they fought against political tyranny and  defended the right of peoples to state self-determination.    Today, according to the studies of the Institute of  Strategic  Research (ISI), we have "leftists"--the socialist-communist  orientation--and "rightists"--the nationalist and radical  national formations, plus the two-part "center," which unites  (and this is a unique feature of post-Soviet Ukraine) the  national democrats and pragmatic centrists (see the schematic  chart--author). In the opinion of the ISI, there are five  criteria on which this division is based, specifically attitudes  toward: (1) the idea of state independence; (2) the historical  period when Ukraine was a part of Russia and the USSR; (3)  present-day Russia and the CIS themselves; (4) the form of state  order, organization of power, and political regime in Ukraine;  (5) the purposes, forms, and methods of conducting market  reforms. To the last point I would add that the associations of  citizens are also divided into center, leftist and rightist  extremes by their methods of achieving their goals  (revolutionary or evolutionary).    So, apologizing for the lengthy enumeration, I will try to  present all those who, as in Noah's ark, exist in Ukraine today  and will be struggling for deputy seats. The socialist-communist  complex: the Socialist (SPU) and Communist (KPU) parties and the  public organizations Union of Communists of Ukraine (SKU) and  Front of Laborers of Ukraine (FTU). This also includes the many  regional and republic associations such as Laboring Ukraine, the  All-Ukrainian Communist Party of Bolsheviks, and others. These  parties call for effective social guarantees and closer,  all-encompassing integration into the CIS, oppose rapid market  reforms, and so on.    The centrist-pragmatists include the Party of Democratic  Rebirth (PDVU), the People's Party (NPU), the Liberal Party  (LPU), the Social Democratic Party (SPDU), the Peasant Party  (KresPU), the Ukrainian Party of Beer Lovers (UPLP), the Party  of Labor (PT), the Ukrainian Party of Justice (UPS), the Party  of Economic Rebirth of the Crimea (PEVK), the Constitutional  Democratic Party (KDPU), the Civil Consent Centrist Party  (PTsGS), the Party of National Salvation (PNSU), the Civil  Congress (GKU), the All-Ukrainian Gromada [Community]  Association [VOG], the Ukrainian Party of Solidarity and Social  Justice (UPSSS), the Labor Congress (TKU), the Party of Slavic  Unity (PSYeU), and the New Ukraine Association (NU). These  formations put liberal or socially adjusted market reforms,  private property, democracy, individual freedom and its priority  over the state, and the like above everything else. They often  arose as regional lobbies and associations based on the  interests of particular groups of politicians or social strata.    The national democrats, who defend the priority of democracy  (but with a national slant) and more rapid establishment of  Ukrainian statehood include: the Ukrainian Republican Party  (URP), the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party (UKDP), the  Democratic Party (DemPU), the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPU),  the Christian Democratic Party (KhDPU), the Greens Party (PZU),  the People's Movement [Narodnyy Rukh--NRU), the Party of Free  Peasants (PSKU), and these public organizations: the Congress of  National Democratic Forces (KTsDS) and the All-Ukrainian Public  Organization "All-People's Movement of Ukraine" ["Vsenarodnyy  Rukh Ukrainy"--VNRU).    The national radicals are represented by the Ukrainian  Conservative Party (UKRP), the Ukrainian National Conservative  Party (UNKP), the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN), the  All-Ukrainian Political Association "State Independence of  Ukraine" (GSU), the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in  Ukraine (OUNiU), and the public associations: Ukrainian National  Assembly (UNA) and Ukrainian National Self-Defense (UNS). They  fight for building a Ukrainian state at any price, including at  the price of democracy.    The ISI believes that the stability and balance of the  pragmatic centrists make them attractive in the eyes of the  ordinary citizen and rank-and-file voter which, for one, makes a  victory of the "center" entirely likely. For two, the  pragmatists will take over the "center", either pushing the  national democrats toward the "rightists" or making them more  pragmatic in their political aspirations. In this situation a  person cannot help but wonder if the pragmatists, who are likely  to win the election, will be able to move from an attractive  presentation of their moderate programs to an equally attractive  and effective implementation of them in reality. And would it be  for the general welfare, which we very much want.</p>

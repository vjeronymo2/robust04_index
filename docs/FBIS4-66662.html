			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Majid 'Atiyah] </F>   [Text] Export is a national goal and the priority of the  day in the national action program. Export means increasing  output capacity and employing all productive capacities in  society. This in turn means expanding activity areas and  absorbing a percentage of existing unemployment to "lift" the  Egyptian economy from "stagnation" to "recovery."    However, exporters face procedures that limit their  activity.  They must pay fees, which increases the cost of goods and makes  them unable to compete in foreign markets.    An exporter must pay eight different fees, the most recent  of  which is an explosives detection fee, even though security is  the responsibility of the state, not exporters. That fee alone  brings in 15 million Egyptian pounds per year.    An exporter must also pay the value of 18 stamps; submit  about 15 documents, including a certificate, a form, a license,  an invoice, a receipt, etc.; and go through about 45 steps to  complete export procedures. This, according to a report prepared  by a joint committee of the Finance and Foreign Trade Ministry  and the Federation of Industries. The report, submitted to the  prime minister, "defines" problems and "recommends" solutions.  Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi told me, following one of these  meetings, chaired by President Husni Mubarak over a two-day  period to discuss increasing exports with relevant ministers and  heads of industrial and trade organizations, that he considers  export "a key" to solving existing economic problems by  stimulating output, increasing investment, and creating new  jobs, which will drive the Egyptian economy into the "boom  state" for which we all are striving. Prime Minister Sidqi said  that we want to plan to push export capacity into the tens of  billions of dollars annually.    Economy Minister Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud told me that the  problem is the trade deficit. He said, "I am not so much  concerned with achieving a balance of `payments surplus' as I am  with limiting the `trade balance deficit.' This deficit is  behind the debts and stagnation. Hence, I am hoping for an  increase in the export capacity [text mistakenly says "import  capacity"]. All of us, the government and exporters, are placing  ourselves in the service of this national goal. Before us are  markets with which we can do business, such as the Arab and  European markets. We have done business with the expanding  American market to remedy the large deficit with the United  States."    The economy minister said that last year's trade deficit  totaled more than $7 billion or 2.4 Egyptian pounds. However, a  series of resolutions, to be announced following this week's  plenary meeting chaired by the prime minister, contain  comprehensive solutions for all of the problems impeding the  export process.    The chairman of the Federation of Industries, Muhammad Farid  Khamis, believes that the problem centers on the endless  procedures and fees, which increase export prices beyond what is  competitive in foreign markets. Nonetheless, Muhammad Farid  Khamis is optimistic about solving these problems after  attending meetings chaired by President Mubarak, the prime  minister, or other ministers, and attended by exporters and  producers.    Muhammad Farid Khamis emphasizes that export has become a  national goal, because of its effect on all domestic economic  activities and its national role in balancing the trade balance  and the balance of payments to move away from the indebtedness  caused by the trade deficit.    Muhammad Farid Khamis states that the political leadership  and the executive leadership are now taking up the cause of  export and removing the constraints and complications that have  limited export activity. They are also adopting a clearly  defined and targeted export strategy for the present and future,  which is based on the position of the national economy and the  situation in international markets.    Muhammad Farid Khamis optimistic talk is based on his  participation in plenary meetings or specialized committees in  the ministries, which have prepared recommendations and  submitted them to the political and executive leaders.    The chairman of the Federation of Banks, Mahmud  'Abd-al-'Aziz, emphasizes the banking system's role in  stimulating exports and providing essential services to  exporters, the most important being the implementation of export  credits, which totaled more than 6,000, valued at more than 10  billion pounds during the past fiscal year.    The chairman of the Exhibitions and International Markets  Authority, Hamid 'Atwah, calls for greater participation in  international markets. State help, and greater help from the  sector that produces for export, is needed to finance this  participation and to set up exhibitions to introduce Egyptian  products.    Dr. Madhat al-Juwayni, the head of the Trade Representation  Agency, believes that it is necessary to support the agency and  expand the trade representation in countries targeted by  Egyptian exports and in countries whose markets we hope to enter  to introduce them to Egyptian goods. Also commercial attaches  should prepare reports and studies on opportunities for Egyptian  exports in foreign markets. Such information is important to  both the government and exporters and should be used by them.    Regarding exporters' complaints about export supervision  agencies, Salah-al-Din 'Awad, the head of the General  Supervisory Board for Exports and Imports, states that export  supervision is to the exporters' advantage, because it ensures  "quality." The authority also benefits agricultural exports  through packing, sorting, and canning stations. In addition, it  has scientific agencies, unparalleled in the Middle East, for  monitoring incoming goods.    Salah 'Awad states: If there is a desire to eliminate  supervision, nothing stands in the way. Just consider what  happened in 1987, when we eliminated supervision of agricultural  exports. These exports dropped from 94,000 tons to 64,000 tons,  because a number of exporters did not maintain quality.  Shipments were lost, and the national economy lost.    He adds: We have 20,000 exporters. Among them are honorable  people. Also among them are people who are not up to par. They  harm Egyptian products in foreign markets by exporting products  that do not meet standards for quality.    Dr. Hazim al-Babilawi is the chairman of a bank which  specializes in developing exports. He states his view on this  vital issue as follows: Neglecting exports means greater  reliance on imports, which increases our foreign debts. What is  needed is an export strategy based on export industries, the  elimination of bureaucratic and procedural barriers, the  establishment of a database to determine trends in foreign  markets, and the pursuit of a flexible domestic policy that  takes into account continuous changes, with attention to  reducing the cost of goods and maintaining quality, so that  goods are competitive.    What are the problems facing the development of exports and  their proposed solutions?    By tracking the reports and discussions of plenary  committees  or technical subcommittees, we can identify, define, and  publicize these problems and their solutions. Such reports  include those prepared by the Federation of Industries, the  Federation of Chambers of Commerce, businessmen, the Trade  Representation Agency, and the General Supervisory Board for  Exports and Imports. All of these reports enable one to  inventory these problems and to gather all of the proposed  solutions as well as recommendations for now and the future.    The problems now affecting exporters concern the many  burdens  encumbering them. These burdens, which restrict our ability to  increase Egyptian exports because they limit the competitiveness  of those exports in foreign markets, include the following:     -  The lengthy documentation cycle required in the export  process. Export procedures include more than 45 steps, which are  implemented in more than one place. The integrated provision of  services at one location is needed.    -  An abundance of forms and papers to be processed, difficulty  in  obtaining some of these forms and papers at times, and the need  to process more than 15 documents between the certificate, form,  license, request, invoice, and receipt.    -  A multiplicity of fees, stamps, and the equivalent of stamps  collected under numerous names at airports, ports, and loading  stations. These growing costs, which have become a real burden  for exporters, ultimately affect the price of Egyptian goods.  Eight types of fees are imposed under numerous names and  headings. The state collects fees for services for which it, not  the exporter, should pay, e.g., the fee for explosives detection.    -  The multiplicity of control processes. Shipments are  inspected  by the export supervision agencies and permits are issued for  them. Agricultural shipments are then inspected by the  agricultural quarantine agencies, which require additional forms  and fees in order to issue an agricultural certificate. The  Export Supervisory Board then requires additional applications  to obtain a certificate of origin.       The committee formed by the economy and foreign trade  minister to examine export problems has called for: reducing the  number of steps required; seeking unconventional solutions to  export barriers; freeing exports from all constraints;  supporting and coordinating between export agencies and  organizations; expediting the formation of a national high  committee for exports; eliminating the monopoly in shipping  services and exposing companies in the public business sector  and private sector to competition, given the large disparity  between the prices fixed for services at Egyptian airports and  ports compared to the prices paid in other countries by  exporters for such services, despite the lack of improvement in  Egypt in these services and their prices, which have been rising  since 1987; expediting promulgation of the Currency Law, whose  draft is devoid of any requirement for the TS [expansion not  given] Form, considered one of the greatest obstacles in export  procedures.  <H5>  55 Recommendations </H5>   The technical committee formed to examine export problems  has  issued 55 recommendations, including 17 to the Economy Ministry,  19 to the Finance Ministry, seven to the Agriculture Ministry,  six to the Transport and Communications Ministry, two to the  Industry Ministry, two to the prime minister, one to the  Petroleum Ministry, one to the New Urban Communities Ministry,  and one to the Electricity Ministry.    The report by the ministerial technical committee  recommended  that the Economy Ministry take several measures to help boost  Egyptian exports, the most important being to: compensate  exporters for the strength of the US dollar; reduce export  service fees in governmental departments; provide low-interest  financing for export activity; remedy debt problems with the  banking system; lower the cost of banking services; exempt  imports of raw materials for factories from export and import  control measures; disburse incentives for exports amounting to 5  to 20 percent of the value of the commodity exported, depending  on its type; refrain from prohibiting the export of any good,  lest it lose its position in world markets; permit the import of  oil products for industrial use; establish an export support  fund financed by a fee on imports; be satisfied with a single  form, "Customs 13," to end all export procedures related to  customs, agricultural quarantine, and export control.    The most important recommendations made to the Finance  Ministry are to: exempt export activity from taxes for a defined  period; stop deducting 1 percent of the proceeds of exports as a  tax; eliminate the sales tax on machinery and spare parts, all  requirements for stamps on export documents, and the  proportional stamp tax on the capital of share companies; reduce  customs on production inputs not produced in Egypt; implement a  simple tax rebate system that returns to the exporter, after  exportation is effected, customs and sales tax on imported  components and services, fees, and different taxes; eliminate  administrative fees and expenses imposed on industry under  various headings; not permit the imposition of any burdens  without the cabinet's consent; and include the members of the  chambers of specialized industry in customs arbitration  committees.    The recommendations made to the Agriculture Ministry are to:  establish funds to balance agricultural produce prices to  prevent producers from being hurt in the event of an abundant  crop amid a slow world market; apply a strict agricultural cycle  regarding several crops, the most important being potatoes;  eliminate agricultural quarantine fees for exports; create a  national project to combat pests and diseases; focus on the  discovery of new breeds of high-yield, disease-resistant crop  seeds.    The recommendations that must be implemented by the  Transport  and Communications Ministry are to: reduce the fees of shipping  agencies, ports, and airports; reduce maritime and air freight  charges; and systematically provide refrigerated containers for  shipment of perishables to Arab, African, and European markets.  The Federation of Industries recommended that the Petroleum  Ministry lower fuel and energy prices with respect to exported  goods.    The recommendations called on the Industry Ministry to  review  the standard specifications of exports issued by the General  Standards Authority, and to limit compliance with standards to  security and safety goods and injurious goods.    The prime minister was called upon to; ensure that no  governmental agency would require fees of any type for export  procedures, except for those defined previously in the unified  fee; free all types of Egyptian commodities from any constraints  stemming from requirements to obtain prior approvals from any  agency regarding the type, quantity, or price of an export, as  long as export of the good is permitted.    In view of the ongoing increases in energy prices, the  Federation of Industries recommended that energy prices  applicable to industrial activity be fixed for at least three  years, and that a good pricing policy be formulated for energy  consumption by factories.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Bullying Tactics"] </F>   [Text] The unwarranted decision of the U.S. President, Mr.  Bill Clinton, to reactivate the Super 301 provision of the  American Omnibus Trade Act can at best be attributed to his  political problems at home, and at worst to the U.S.'s total  disregard for a multilateral trade regime. Facing declining  popularity at home and the whiff of scandal, Mr. Clinton might  have decided to demonstrate his machismo and secure an  improvement in his popularity ratings by talking tough with the  Japanese. It is equally possible that, with barely a month left  for the ministerial meeting of the Uruguay Round of trade  negotiations at Marrakesh in Morocco, the U.S. has deliberately  decided to cock a snook at the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade [GATT] by reactivating a provision Act that symbolises the  arrogant unilateralism of the world's richest nation. The  revival of Super 301, an instrument that the U.S. government  claims will be used to pry open inaccessible markets, makes a  mockery of all that has been painstakingly achieved by trade  negotiators at the Uruguay Round. The decision has ostensibly  been provoked by the Japanese refusal to play ball. It is true  that Tokyo has not demonstrated its full commitment to the  principles of free trade and multilateralism that it preaches to  others, particularly to developing countries like India. It is  also true that the U.S. political leadership has been unable to  keep pace with the deft diplomatic footwork of the Japanese.    Pique, however, cannot be the basis of policy. If Washington  is aggrieved that the Japanese have resorted to unfair trade  practices, then the matter should be referred to GATT's dispute  settlement mechanism. Developing countries, worried about their  own trade prospects, are bound to ask whether the Uruguay Round  was not a waste of time if the U.S. can continue to act  unilaterally with impunity. While the present U.S. move is aimed  against the Japanese, India, which has in the past faced the  threat of action based on both Super 301 and Special 301, may  have to worry about a similar response in its case. The U.S.  pressure on India to liberalise the import of consumer goods is  patently unjustified since the Indian government has clearly  stated that it has a medium-term agenda of trade liberalisation  which has to take into account the interests of domestic  industry in the transition period. The Indian government has  demonstrated its commitment to trade liberalisation once again  in the Union budget for 1994-95. However, the pace of  liberalisation cannot be increased under external pressure.  Indeed, such pressure can only be counter-productive in a  democracy where governments are sensitive to opposition  criticism, as Mr. Clinton should know. The U.S. government must  appreciate the fact that, despite its refusal to comply with the  multilateral rules of the game in areas such as textiles trade,  where the U.S. has bullied the world into a slower phasing out  of the Multifibre Agreement, it is the developing countries  which have shown a greater commitment to multilateralism despite  their unenviable economic conditions and prospects.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Cookery: Abstain and be merry at Lent FEW PEOPLE now observe the once-common custom of abstaining from meat on weekdays in Lent. But the idea of eating less meat and more vegetables during this period is far from penitential, particularly if you seek out two of the best vegetables now in season: sea kale and chard. Sea kale is native to the UK - arguably, the only vegetable that truly is British. The Victorians adored it and served it with great ceremony, for they regarded it as worthy of serving in its own right rather than an adjunct to meat. They steamed sea kale whole, wrapped it in a damask napkin and laid it in a silver dish. It was eaten in the fingers with a melted butter sauce for dipping. Although sea kale can be used for gratins, soups and other dishes, this simple vegetable treatment probably remains the best way to enjoy it. Because sea kale is grown in forcing pots, the blanched stalks are long and spindly, topped with embryonic, lilac-fringed leaves. It looks a little like celery but, happily, it lacks the tonsil-tangling strings that run through much celery on sale today. The texture is crisp and juicy and the flavour is delicately nutty, with only a faint background note of brassica that harks back to the plant's wild seashore cabbage origins. You will find sea kale on sale now at Waitrose and Sainsbury. About eight minutes' steaming is all it needs if young and tender. Chard has not made it into the supermarkets yet, so far as I know, but specialist greengrocers stock it (or should, at least, get it to order from wholesale markets). Most of it is imported from France and Italy. Chard is as big and bold as sea kale is pale and retiring. It is a handsome plant with dark green leaves and ivory ribs (although some varieties are ruby red). Basically, it is a sort of coarse-leafed spinach cultivated for the sake of its ribs. I have bought some splendid examples during the past few weeks. Often, the leaves weigh well over half a pound each and they may measure more than 12in from tip to base, with ribs at least 4in wide. Sometimes, chard is eaten in its entirety. It is, for example, the main ingredient of a traditional pie cooked at Easter in Genoa, although modern recipes tend to replace the chard with artichokes. And in Valtellina last year, I was introduced to a dish called pizzoccheri: buckwheat noodles with chard, cheese and potatoes - richly restorative food for cold-weather eating. More often, however, the greenery and ribs of chard are cooked and served separately. The resilient greenery is used frequently to eke out meat in pates and in southern France there are local recipes in which chard greenery, meat and batter are combined - to my mind, with varying degrees of success. I prefer the partnership of greenery and batter alone: chard makes excellent fritters. The ribs have a slightly smoky celery taste. They are succulent and juicy, verging on watery. Like sea kale, they are wolfed down more than willingly by everyone I have met when sauced with such things as hollandaise; melted butter seasoned with anchovy, lemon and parsley; Parmesan butter; or butter with toasted and finely-chopped hazels with cumin. Both chard and sea kale also make a fine feast when cut into short lengths and boiled or steamed briefly, then dressed with a tomato cream sauce, or covered with scalded and seasoned cream, scattered with slivers of St Paulin or Morbier cheese, and slipped into a hot oven for a few minutes until the cheese is molten. CHARD WITH SAUCE AURORE (serves 4) Sea kale cut into short lengths and blanched can also be served this way. Ingredients: 1 lb chard ribs;  1/2 lb tomatoes; 1 oz sun-dried tomatoes; 1/4 pt stock; celery salt; a small bay leaf; a slice of onion;  1/4 pt double cream; a little thyme and oregano; 1 tablespoon each softened butter and flour mashed together; 1 oz fresh bread crumbs fried in  1/4 oz butter (optional). Method: First make the sauce. Chop both fresh and dried tomatoes. Bring them to boiling point in the stock with a good pinch of celery salt, the bay and onion. Cover and simmer for five minutes then set aside for half an hour. Discard the bay and onion. Rub the remaining contents of the pan through a sieve. Return the mixture to the pan. Stir in the cream and bring to scalding point, then work in the beurre manie gradually. Season with thyme, oregano, salt and pepper to taste and simmer briefly to give good consistency and flavour. Strip the membrane and any stringy bits from the chard ribs, then cut the juicy flesh into chunks. Drop them in fast-boiling salted water and cook for about five minutes or until done to your liking. Drain very thoroughly, Dress with the sauce and scatter with hot fried crumbs for textural contrast. If serving this dish in tandem with the chard greenery made into fritters, the bread crumbs can be omitted. CHARD FRITTERS (serves 4-6) The coarse, resilient leaves of spinach beet also can be used for this recipe. If you use proper tender-leafed spinach, you will need  1/2 lb of it. Ingredients:  1/4 lb chard greenery, washed and shredded;  1/4 lb plain flour (all white or 50/50 wholemeal and white); 2 eggs beaten with a dribble of olive oil; 1 garlic clove, crushed with salt; nutmeg;  1/4 pt semi-skimmed milk (or full cream milk and water mixed); olive or peanut oil for frying; freshly-grated Parmesan cheese for serving. Method: Make a thick, creamy batter - by hand or using a food processor - with the flour, eggs and milk. Season with crushed garlic, plenty of nutmeg, pepper and sea salt. Stir in the greenery and set aside for at least an hour to marry the flavours. Stir again before use. Heat oil in a frying pan to a depth of  1/4 in. Add the batter in dollops, just a few at a time. Space them well apart and flatten them slightly with the back of a spoon. Cook over moderate heat until crisp and cooked through, flipping them over once. Drain the green and gold fritters on a bed of crumpled kitchen paper and keep hot in the oven - uncovered, or they may turn soggy - while you cook the rest. Serve with Parmesan for adding at table.</p>

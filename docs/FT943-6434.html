			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Tokyo Investors will be paying close attention to July industrial production figures, released on Wednesday, writes Emiko Terazono. Although the government's official forecast has been for a fall in industrial output, private economists expect the rise in demand due to the hot summer and an increase in car sales, to support the figure. Other events scheduled include the announcement of Japan Tobacco's public offering price on Wednesday and Friday's release of August employment figures. However, analysts do not expect the announcements to affect investor confidence unless the data is substantially different from projections, and the Nikkei index is likely to fluctuate in a narrow band around the 20,500 level.</p>

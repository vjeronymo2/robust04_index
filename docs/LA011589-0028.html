			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOST DANCERS APPLAUD AIDS BOOKLET  </P> <P> Dancers around the country are slowly learning about Update's AIDS guide. The  response is strong in New York and in the South but weaker farther West.  </P> <P> New York-based choreographer Kathryn Posin says that "this glut of AIDS info --  however basic as it may be -- has never been compiled in one booklet for  dancers before. It could prove amazingly handy and useful to companies in the  boonies."  </P> <P> Ivan Sygoda, director of Pentacle, a respected service organization for New  York artists, said the booklet "would be especially helpful to companies  outside the New York area who don't have easy access to AIDS information and  are still sticking their heads in the sand about this terrible epidemic that's  touched us all."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, two of the most respected modern-dance choreographers and  company leaders -- Rudy Perez and Bella Lewitzky -- seem in the process of  addressing the AIDS crisis.  </P> <P> "Bella (Lewitzky) has always been an activist regarding AIDS," explained  Darlene Neel, Lewitzky Dance Company manager, who recalls that in 1983 Lewitzky  invited a speaker from AIDS Project Los Angeles to talk about safe-sex  practices with dancers and staff.  </P> <P> "I feel that we do have an AIDS policy," adds Neel. "Bella's made it a policy  to protect dancers' confidentiality and health insurance when it comes to any  illness. Yet, I'm convinced that Update could assist all dance companies in  continuing the necessary dialogue in confronting a disease that strikes the  young and healthy."  </P> <P> Perez said he has never had to confront the problem of a dancer having AIDS but  is well aware of colleagues whose entire companies have been decimated. "I  don't know what I would do if a dancer had such bad news," he said. "I've  honestly never thought about it before. It's hard to know where to turn." Now  he feels there is a place.  </P> <P> L.A.-based choreographer Mary Jane Eisenberg said that long before she had  heard of Update's guide, she had thought about "AIDS touching our company --  how can you not these days?" and added that "because our company is like a  family, we would deal with that problem in very personal terms. The booklet  would provide a tool."  </P> <P> Celeste Miller, an Atlanta choreographer and prominent Southern activist, was  much more informed about the "devastation" of AIDS in the South and of the  beneficial effects of Update's AIDS booklet.  </P> <P> "All of us are still at various levels of education and denial," Miller said.  "I'm very tuned into the disease and how vulnerable artists are and the abyss  that's out there for all of us who maybe know someone battling AIDS. But I  think Update could help elevate the level of discussion throughout the dance  world."  </P> <P> Nancy Faucett, general manager of the New Orleans City Ballet, applauds Update.  "We've been hit hard by AIDS in our city," she says, "yet we need as much  direction and even confrontation as we can get."  </P> <P> Liz Lerman, artistic director of the Washington-based Dance Exchange, believes  that "we in the dance world have lived with this problem since day one," adding  that "now that the entire country is facing AIDS, it's high time that we speak  in clear terms about issues of policy and modes of behavior that point to a  raised consciousness. This is all that Update provides, but it is all that we  need: the equivalent of a moral reminder." DOUGLAS SADOWNICK  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SALES TAX SUPPORTERS WANT BALLOT STATEMENT REMOVED  </P> <P> Supporters of the half-cent countywide sales tax for transportation projects  will seek a court order today directing county election officials to remove  what they contend is a false statement from the ballot argument against the  measure, campaign officials said.  </P> <P> Targeted by supporters is a claim that approval of the sales tax will lead to  "massive indebtedness" of "$18 billion plus interest." Written arguments from  both sides of the sales tax debate will be included in the official ballot  pamphlet sent to all registered voters in Orange County before the Nov. 7  election.  </P> <P> "When I read the opposition's ballot statement I knew it was wrong and I didn't  want it to be allowed and have the voters confused by their inaccuracies," said  Costa Mesa attorney Dana W. Reed, treasurer of Citizens for Yes on M, the group  supporting the sales tax. Reed is also a member of the Orange County  Transportation Commission, which wrote Measure M.  </P> <P> "I know that Measure M itself refers to $900 million a year, for 20 years, and  that adds up to $18 billion," said Sandra L. Genis, a Costa Mesa councilwoman  and slow-growth activist who signed the ballot statement opposing the sales  tax. "It seems like this would come under free speech. There is no independent  ballot analysis yet, so whose interpretation are you basing anything on? It  seems ridiculous to go to the expense of a court hearing."  </P> <P> The half-cent sales tax would raise $3.1 billion for highway and transit  projects over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> Supporters contended Thursday that Measure M does not allow borrowing of up to  $900 million a year for 20 years, as claimed by opponents but does contain a  $900 million a year ceiling on total transportation agency expenditures because  of the so-called Gann spending limit.  </P> <P> Opponents of Measure M said they were upset because they may be assessed  attorney's fees if they lose in court today.  </P> <P> Genis was angry, however, when told that the proponents' lawyers had said it  was legally impossible to withdraw the $18-billion debt claim from the ballot  statement without a court order. So was San Clemente Mayor Brian J. Rice, who  also signed the ballot argument being challenged by Reed. "I was told that I  may be liable for $10,000 in attorney's fees," Rice said. "I'm not happy about  it."  </P></p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Appointments: Boyd's new generation The first new job offer for Alan Boyd, director of broadcasting at TVS, came at 10.01 am on October 16 last year, one minute after the announcement that the ITV company had lost its franchise. The call was from the BBC where Boyd had once produced light entertainment hits such as the Generation Game and initiated Blankety Blank. The second call, 11 minutes later, came from Grundy, the international production company which grew up in Australia and produces popular programmes such as Neighbours. In May, in the run-down to TVS going off the air at the end of this year, Boyd will join Grundy Worldwide as senior vice president for light entertainment. Boyd, 50, a former head of entertainment at LWT, who devised or produced a number of shows including Game For A Laugh, Blind Date and You Bet, will be based in London. He will be responsible for Grundy's light entertainment productions in the UK and the rest of Europe. Grundy is one of the largest independent producers and makes more than 50 hours of television a week. 'It is a bit like a chameleon,' says Boyd. The company takes a programme idea or format and makes it in different countries to suit individual cultures. Boyd decided to accept the job with Grundy because he relished the challenge of learning about international television after the somewhat insular world of Britain's ITV companies; Grundy Worldwide operates in 15 countries including the US and Australia.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Observer: Big stick Watch out, Baroness Brigstocke is on the prowl. The former High Mistress of St Paul's Girls' School, whose no-nonsense style has sometimes been compared with Lady Thatcher's, has been appointed an associate director of the powerful, but secretive, Great Universal Stores. Although she once did a stint as a shopgirl at Selfridges, Heather Brigstocke made her name as Britain's most formidable head mistress. Since she quit teaching in 1989, she has been doing some consulting work for GUS and has now been given a title and a job - advising Lord Wolfson's family retailing business on training and personnel. She says she is 'enormously impressed' with the young women she meets in GUS but feels that there is 'far more potential in the workforce than has been realised'. Sounds familiar. Must try harder, girls.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Tobacco companies face ban on adverts in China China plans to ban cigarette advertising in the media and in public places, threatening moves by foreign tobacco companies to expand into potentially the world's most lucrative market. A new law, published in local newspapers yesterday, appeared to contain provisions outlawing tobacco advertising that are more restrictive than those in many western countries. The law, due to come into effect in February, will ban tobacco advertising in films, television, newspapers and magazines. Advertising is also 'forbidden' in waiting rooms, theatres and cinemas, conference halls and sports venues. The Chinese smoke one-third of the world's cigarettes and the prospects of continued growth in the market have attracted foreign makers, facing flagging markets in the west. In Beijing, the representative of a leading tobacco company said the law appeared highly restrictive, but the company would seek clarification. Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco of the US, and Rothmans International of the UK have established manufacturing joint ventures in China, and other companies are exporting. All are operating in an industry dominated by China's state tobacco monopoly, which has 96 per cent of the market and is reputedly the world's biggest cigarette producer. One British manufacturer said that restrictions could make it harder for foreign companies to woo smokers away from Chinese brands. Companies have been spending heavily on advertising in China. Philip Morris, through its Marlboro brand, sponsors the national soccer league, and others are also active in the sporting arena. Cigarette advertising on hoardings is also widespread, although whether it will survive the new law is not clear. Tobacco industry representatives attribute the new law to China's desire to bring itself into line with international standards. Interest among foreign companies in China market is understandable, given the numbers involved. A survey last year by the State Statistical Bureau showed 298m people over the age of 15, nearly 35 per cent of the population, smoke. However, China has been reluctant to expose the lucrative state monopoly to foreign competition. and has made entry difficult for foreign companies. Heavy restrictions are placed on imports of cigarettes, through high tariffs and other barriers, but this has not stopped a flood of foreign imports. In 1990, a Chinese newspaper estimated that less than 1 per cent of foreign cigarettes on sale in China had passed through customs - the rest were smuggled.</p>

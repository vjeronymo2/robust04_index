			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (3): New drive in Asia - The continent's exporters The shape of global commercial vehicle manufacture is inexorably changing. The big truck market growth areas are the world's developing nations, rather than those already industrialised. High production costs in the old world have already ruled out many of those sources for much of the developing world's transport. In Asia a clear trend is developing. Nations that a few years ago ranked as third world have developed their own industries to the point where they have become net vehicle exporters. Countries which have partly or wholly achieved this status are India, South Korea and China. While China has developed its own industry dramatically, it has such a huge internal demand that it will be some time before it can become a major exporter. Malaysia and Vietnam have also embarked on ventures to become vehicle producers. After a 30-year gestation period during which engineering techniques required to produce durable trucks and buses were learned the hard way, with very little help or money, India has blossomed into a world class producer. This year it will build about 175,000 commercial vehicles and is expected to exceed 200,000 by 1995. While many of these are developed from European chassis of 20 years ago, an increasing proportion are modern designs, much in demand in Africa, the Middle East and Asian territories. Most of what India calls heavy trucks would be termed medium-weight in Europe. As two-axle 12-16 tonners, they are well suited to many developing markets. This heavy sector is shared by two makers: Tata, a member of the Telco manufacturing group based in Bombay, and Ashok Leyland, based in Madras, with Iveco holding a 51 per cent stake. Tata was a CKD operation set up with Mercedes' help in the 1950s, but the Germans reduced their direct interest as Tata developed its own designs and technologies. This year it signed a deal with Cummins to build B-series diesel engines in the 120-210 bhp class. In the light commercial sector Tata has an excellent new product range called the 207 based on a sturdy 4x2 chassis with a modern 2.0 litre diesel, bodied as a truck, a large estate car or a utility in the Range Rover class. Tata is into more than a dozen markets with this versatile vehicle, including Europe, where it is already approved in France. Once a Leyland-based CKD operation set up in the late 1950s, Ashok Leyland has in recent weeks begun manufacture of a version of the Ford Cargo which was built at Langley, near Heathrow Airport, until last December. Ashok is a key element in Iveco's strategy outside Europe. The company has invested around Pounds 140m to build the 6-10 tonne Cargo and a further Pounds 100m will go on larger versions in the next three years. Production of 25,000 units will be possible, more than doubling Ashok's capacity in the 6-16 tonne classes. Pressings for the Indian Cargo cab will be done for Ashok by Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, and assembled in a new shop near Bangalore. Mahindra itself has ambitious expansion plans. The group is best known for utility vehicles of less than three tonnes, including several Jeep variants, but also builds light trucks. In 1993 it began production of the Armada which can carry 11 people in its passenger variant. For its new low-emission two-litre diesel, to be built in India, Mahindra went to world-renowned engine R&amp;D specialists, AVL of Graz, Austria. Now the group reports a waiting list of 1 1/2 years, but is resisting the temptation to increase production until quality is absolutely assured. Then, the Armada, like the 207 Tata, is set to become a highly attractive export item. China is undoubtedly the largest potential market for commercial vehicles, but direct imports have always been difficult. Increasing oil production, both on land and in the Yellow Sea, has accelerated its industrial programmes, including numerous commercial vehicle joint ventures, mainly with western manufacturers. Among these are Eaton and Rockwell, producing gearboxes and axles respectively, ZF (gearboxes and steering gear), Steyr (heavy trucks and diesel engines for automotive and industrial uses), Cummins, building large generator and locomotive engines and small truck engines; and Iveco, producing vans and minibuses. The Cummins jv with China's Dong Feng group is particularly interesting. It embraces volume production up to 60,000 units annually, to power a new 8-12 tonne truck replacing the ancient Dong Feng. Production began early in 1993, with locally built chassis and axles, the Cummins B-series engine and a Nissan design steel cab. In each case these joint ventures begin with a small number of fully built-up units, followed by increasing local content increments to eventual 100 per cent. The Steyr operation is now producing about 5,000 heavy trucks a year in the 17-28 tonne class and the figure is expected to double by 1997. The Iveco jv will produce about 15,000 units this year, with about 30 per cent local content, against a 1998 target of 60,000 with virtually 100 per cent local content. Potentially, China is likely to become a world class commercial vehicle manufacturer by the end of the century, but such is the huge domestic demand estimated at more than 250,000 medium and heavy duty vehicles before 1997 that it is likely to be some time before significant exports occur. Malaysia's truck-building efforts are concentrated in Proton light commercials, but several heavy vehicle makers are looking at this territory. In Vietnam, Iveco this year established a joint venture to build Daily vans and minibuses, again beginning with CBU units, graduating to a majority of local content. Korea currently builds or assembles around 400,000 light commercials, with Hyundai accounting for nearly half. Heavy trucks are still imported, mainly from Europe. Although the choices for direct imports into Asia are diminishing steadily, the opportunities for joint manufacturing ventures more than compensate for that trend.</p>

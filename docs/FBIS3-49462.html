			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has made a statement on  the claim by Polish President Lech Walesa in today's LIDOVE  NOVINY to the effect that the Czech side superimposes its  interests above the joint aims of the countries of the Visegrad  Group. Klaus says that the Czech side is neither an organizer  nor an initiator of the Prague talks between President Clinton  and political representatives of the four countries of Central  Europe. The Czech side is merely happy to accept the U.S.  initiative and welcomes the fact that these important talks will  take place in Prague.    At the same time, Vaclav Klaus sees no reason for the  failure  of these talks. As he went on to say, the offer for him to  deliver the joint viewpoint of the four countries mentioned by  President Walesa was not made to Vaclav Klaus, and that is why  he could not reject it.    I would be a very bad Czech politician, the prime minister  continues, if I did not put Czech interests above the joint aims  of the countries of the Visegrad Group. President Walesa is  right about that. But I believe that he does not do that sort of  thing. [as heard] The joint interests of the Visegrad Group  countries are the highest common denominator of the interests of  the individual countries, nothing more and nothing less. We  would only make a mistake if we incorrectly interpreted our own  long-term interests, Vaclav Klaus stresses in his viewpoint on  Lech Walesa's LIDOVE NOVINY allegations.    President Vaclav Havel will not make any statement on the  interview granted by Polish President Lech Walesa to LIDOVE  NOVINY.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Presidential election campaign address by Ukrainian </F> President Leonid Kravchuk from the Kiev studio -- live]    [Text] Esteemed electors. The time allocated for our main  program theses is extremely short, and I think it is impossible  to go over all of them. I am sure that you have read the  programs; people have made up their minds and have a good idea  of the programs through the media. Yet, a few words about the  main theses.    I would divide my program and my work into three  conventional  parts. The first part, which I call "Development," is about the  development of the economy, the development of society, and the  development of relations between people. If we take the  economic part, it is about creating equal conditions for all  businesses and creating conditions to encourage production,  because everything depends on production. To that end, we have  already taken and will continue to take measures to give a boost  to production. At the state level, it means the introduction of  a new taxation system, a new system of prices and wages, customs  duties, that is, everything we refer to the macrolevel. If we  take sectors of production, we are talking about priorities. I  am giving the top priority to the production of food and to  energy provision. Without these, the national economy will not  be able to function, and human life will be doomed.    I call my next part "Establishment of law and legality in  society." Until we learn to respect the law, respect the  Constitution, it will be hard to gain respect for each other.  At the state level, for power structures, compliance with the  law is mandatory, and those who do not obey the law must face  the consequences, no matter in what branch of power they belong.  Every citizen must follow certain norms, must respect certain  principles, and work in a legal framework. If we take the most  important thing, it is protection of the individual's life from  the crime world, from infringement on its freedom and rights.  Here, we must act promptly, act by legal means, by means of  creating a rigid system of responsibility for those who make  attempts on human life and taking steps appropriate for the  situation. A war has been declared on us, and we must respond  appropriately.    My third part is called "Peace and Concord in Society." Life  is the most important and the dearest thing to everyone, and the  entire system of legal principles, all legislative processes,  all laws and the entire state policy must be aimed at securing  peace and concord. Concord among people within the country,  which is a must, unity and understanding.    As for outside factors, our policy must be aimed at  establishing friendly partnership relations with all countries  of the world, especially with our neighbors, above all, with  Russia. I am convinced that Ukraine's political stability, its  economic progress, its national security, and the development of  democracy are impossible without establishing the kind of  relations with our neighbors which would ensure these basic  [word indistinct] in Ukraine. But we must take steps to  persuade our neighbors, including such a major neighbor as  Russia, to make Ukraine one of their priority countries. This  is very important. As soon as we agree on this, as soon as  Ukraine's policy and the policy of our neighboring states become  more predictable, as soon as they become policies of concord and  respect for one another, we will definitely live in peace,  friendship and harmony.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

Sir Douglas said his priorities had been to look for a chairman with 'larger quoted plc experience' and to lift the number of non-executives to three, a process begun with the appointment of Ron Yearsley in September. Robinson is currently chairman of Sterry Communications, and was previously managing director of Electrocomponents for five years, during which period pre-tax profits grew from Pounds 22m to Pounds 52m. In addition, the management is to be strengthened further by the promotion of Barrie Clark, currently group finance director, to chief operating officer. He will make the move when a replacement to run the finance department can be found. ***** Given that the drugs industry has traditionally been dominated by men, Linda Kelly's career has been unusually impressive. Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US healthcare group and tenth largest in the UK, yesterday announced that Kelly had been given control of all British drugs operations. Previously sales and marketing director, she has been appointed general manager of UK pharmaceuticals after only 14 months with the company. Kelly, 38, will report directly to Michael Loberg, president north Europe, who has responsibility for UK operations since Gary Noon left the group in November 1991 to join Wellcome. She previously held senior marketing positions at Merck of the US and SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group. Her previous position is being split into two, but the replacements have not yet been announced.</p>

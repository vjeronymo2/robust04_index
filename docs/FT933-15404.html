			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Italian parties favour 1994 poll A CROSS party alliance in the Italian parliament has hardened in favour of holding national elections in 1994 instead of autumn this year. This would allow time for new electoral laws to be approved. It would also allow for matching legislation on new constituencies, broader constitutional changes as well as a proper debate on the 1994 budget plus a stable framework to speed privatisation. Deputies and senators would also be assured of generous pensions if the life of the present legislature lasts two years through to next spring. But the populist Lombard League and the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) have insisted on autumn elections. They have argued the present parliament with one in six deputies under investigation is discredited and no longer reflects the changing fortunes of the political parties. The two also believe they would boost their share of the vote in autumn elections since the other parties would not have sufficient time to reorganise or form new alliances. Over the past few days the PDS leadership appears to have changed its mind. In part this represents PDS concern over the rise of Mr Umberto Bossi's Lombard League, which has established itself as the main force in the north. The PDS sees the League as divisive and potentially destabilising for the unity of Italy and is accordingly reluctant to allow Mr Bossi any further electoral advantage. At the same time the PDS is anxious to try and put back on the agenda some of its ideas on electoral reform. Both the senate and chamber of deputies have agreed their individual reforms for the system of proportional representation; but these could still be changed as each house must approve the other's legislation. If a deal is struck on elections in 1994 with the Christian Democrats and their allies in parliament, who still represent the albeit discredited majority, there is less rush to complete electoral reform before the summer recess. Independent of the PDS change of heart, Mr Marco Panella, the Radical leader, has managed to gather more than 200 deputies of all parties behind his own pressure group to prevent elections in the autumn.</p>

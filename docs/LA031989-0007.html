			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABY BOOMERS GETTING THEIR MTV WITH VH-1  </P> <P> Baby boomers are used to having it their way.  </P> <P> They wanted their MTV. They got their MTV.  </P> <P> Now, says MTV Networks President and Chief Executive Officer Tom Freston,  they've got their VH-1.  </P> <P> Of course, when Video Hits One was launched in January 1985, nobody really  wanted it.  </P> <P> And, says Freston, with good reason.  </P> <P> Originally a video dumping ground for MTV rejects, VH-1 offered a confusing and  far from satisfying array of "all other" artists -- including Barry Manilow,  Willie Nelson, Melissa Manchester and Julio Iglesias.  </P> <P> "Somebody said, 'If we play Julio Iglesias, it will repel all teen-agers,' "  Freston recalls.  </P> <P> It did. And it repelled a lot of other potential viewers, as well.  </P> <P> "It was totally wrong," Freston said during an interview at the company's  headquarters here. In an effort to avoid competing with itself, he explained,  MTV Networks turned its successful formula on its head and found it to be a  profound failure.  </P> <P> "They didn't want to take one viewer away from MTV," Freston said. (The network  owns kiddie-cable channel Nickelodeon as well as MTV and VH-1).  </P> <P> Now they are singing a different tune at VH-1.  </P> <P> Viewer-listeners of the 24-hour music channel get a far more palatable musical  diet consisting of mainstream acts such as Anita Baker, Kenny G, Carly Simon,  Luther Vandross and MTV crossover acts such as Michael Jackson, Phil Collins  and George Michael.  </P> <P> In addition, the cable network has come up with some eye-catching programming:  VH-1 "A Go-Go," for example, is a weekend party-music block that has a  different super-model host each week (such as Elle Macpherson, Christie  Brinkley and Iman; "New Visions" plays to jazz and New Age music fans; "Watch  Bobby Rivers" is a talk show with an up-and-coming host; and "Flix," a weekly  half-hour magazine show, focuses on movies for adults.  </P> <P> "We've already been through trying to make VH-1 not hip, not fun, not  irreverent," said the 43-year-old Freston. "When you become 35 years old, you  don't become a drag. You don't all of a sudden say, 'Man, I'm 35. Let's run out  and buy some Julio Iglesias records.' "  </P> <P> In fact, as the big three networks have already discovered with shows such as  ABC's "thirtysomething" and "The Wonder Years," it is hip to be square.  </P> <P> Families are in, for instance, so VH-1 has a "million dollar baby" contest  sponsored by Downy Fabric Softener and Gerber Products Co., through which some  child 2 years old or younger will get a Treasury bill for $1 million through a  random drawing.  </P> <P> Coming off its most successful year and now reaching about 32 million homes --  up 21 percent since 1987 (compared with MTV's 45 million) -- VH-1 has redefined  itself from the ground up.  </P> <P> Freston said the new VH-1 has four major thrusts. The first order of business,  certainly, is music, which consists of 60 percent to 70 percent of the  channel's programming, including oldies from the '60s and '70s (as opposed to  MTV, which thinks of oldies more in terms of the early '80s).  </P> <P> Nostalgia is also big with boomers and, therefore, VH-1. As a result, there are  plenty of whatever-happened-to and then-and-now pieces called "Milestones,"  featuring a moment in video history relevant to baby boomers, ranging from  sports highlights to the assassination of President Kennedy. Freston said that  such features are appealing to boomers, a somewhat self-interested lot who  "have gone through a lot together, or at least think they have."  </P> <P> A third spoke in the VH-1 programming wheel is comedy. Dennis Miller of NBC's  "Saturday Night Live" is a favorite, as are Jay Leno and George Carlin, with  short routines dropped in between videos.  </P> <P> And finally, knowing that baby boomers' interests are greater than the time  they have to devote to them, VH-1 is broadening its focus from "Entertainment  Tonight" type of news updates to include life style news, with features on  home, travel and education.  </P> <P> Perhaps most significant to VH-1, however, is its impact on the music industry.  </P> <P> Like MTV before it, Freston said, VH-1 has effectively launched the careers --  not to mention the record sales -- of many new artists, such as Grammy winner  Tracy Chapman.  </P> <P> Steven Schnur, national director of video promotion at Elektra Records, is  certainly sold.  </P> <P> "I think VH-1 has proven itself as important as MTV," he said, confirming that  Elektra Records artists such as Chapman, Anita Baker, the Gipsy Kings and  10,000 Maniacs owe much, if not most, of their success to VH-1.  </P> <P> "They took 10,000 Maniacs from a band that had an under-50,000 album base to a  band that's now a platinum act," Schnur said.  </P> <P> "A couple of years ago," added Schnur, "it was, 'Let's get this on VH-1 because  MTV won't play it.' "  </P> <P> Now, he said, his company targets videos specifically for the channel. "They've  proven they can sell records. Lots of records."  </P> <P> Not that everything is running perfectly at VH-1.  </P> <P> There is a decided lack of personality among the on-air personalities at VH-1  -- especially in contrast to MTV.  </P> <P> And that, Freston admitted, is certainly not by design.  </P> <P> (The channel has only one personality to speak of in talk-show host Bobby  Rivers, for whom Freston says VH-1 has big plans, though he's hardly a  household name.)  </P> <P> Furthermore, many of the people the music network is so avidly pursuing have  never heard of VH-1, or, if they have, remember the Julio days.  </P> <P> "I think there's still an identity problem," said Jim Boyle, director of public  affairs for the National Cable Television Assn. in Washington. But, Boyle  added, VH-1's task will be made considerably easier in light of its MTV  association, which gives it "a reservoir of confidence" in the eyes of  advertisers and cable operators.  </P> <P> "It has to be perceived as the new, improved VH-1," Freston said.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, in dropping some MTV-ish elements, such as rap, heavy metal and  some cutting-edge rock, VH-1 has an almost wall-to-wall look of white bread.  </P> <P> That, however, is more a choice of format than of color, say the people at  VH-1.  </P> <P> In any case, "the other MTV" appears finally to be on the right marketing sound  track.  </P> <P> And Freston does not worry about the MTV crowd's crashing the party at VH-1.  </P> <P> "We win either way," he said.  </P></p>

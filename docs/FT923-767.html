			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Food and Drink: How to be a Schickimicki - Giles MacDonogh eats out in Munich IN 17 years a city can change a good deal. This has certainly been the case in Munich. When I first visited the Bavarian capital as a student in the mid-1970s, the scars inflicted by the massive Allied bombardment were still visible and the huge Wittelsbach Residenz was partly ruinous and roofless. The restoration of the city's exterior image is now complete and Munich has reverted to type: fiercely independent of the rest of Germany; Roman Catholic, chic and snobbish. I arrived from Baden where my hosts had warned me to be on the look out for some of the more glaring elements of modern Munich society: the so-called Schickimickis or Bussi-Bussi Gesellschaft. A Schickimicki they defined as a young man or woman squandering his or her parents money in a succession of fashionable bars and restaurants. 'Bussi Bussi is the noise a Schickimicki makes when greeting another member of the species: a call for a peck on both cheeks; a gesture common enough in Saint Germain des Pres but distinctly foreign to Germany. With only two nights at my disposal tracking down a clutch of Schickimickis proved an uphill struggle. There were none in my first port of call Schumann's Bar in the Maximilian-Strasse: this was a serious drinkers' bar much frequented by journalists who prefer a Scotch on the rocks to the Schickimicki standbys of Prosecco or champagne. Nor has any crept into Harry's Bar in the Falkenturmstrasse, where the clientele was largely made up of Americans. If any city made a claim to being the gastronomic capital of Germany it would have to be Munich. There are only three Michelin three-star restaurants in Germany and two of them are here: Heinz Winkler's Tantris and Eckart Witzigmann's Aubergine. In Germany Witzigmann enjoys a reputation similar to those of Paul Bocuse or Joel Robuchon in France. Munich's chic tends to shun the more overtly Germanic. Shops such as Dallmayr in the Dienerstrasse by the Rathaus are brimming with imported Italian and French food and wine. All the top restaurants work in an adapted French idiom. Italian restaurants are the most popular with the Schickimickis. Personally, I was looking for something more typically munichois After taking advice from friends I ended up at the Halali a restaurant in an old house in a quiet street not far from the Residenz. Halali is a German hunting cry, and in season game is the speciality. Not surprising then, that the walls should be covered in hunting trophies with stuffed pheasants and owls peering at you from every corner. It would be a mistake, however, to see Halali as the sort of taxidermist's wet dream found elsewhere in Germany or Austria (one has only to think of the Weisser Rauchfangkehrer in Vienna with its moth-eaten stuffed bears), the hunting theme is not overstated. My meal started with a little carpaccio of tuna as an amuse gueule while I studied the menu. I chose a salad of venison and some baby calf kidneys and sweetbreads to follow. The salad was made up of endive, lamb's lettuce and mesclun with shitake and oyster mushrooms, pink peppercorns, roast rosemary sprigs and very tender venison fillet with its juices. It was a nicely balanced dish. The sweetbreads and kidneys on the other hand, I felt had been rather too heavily flavoured with marjoram, a seasoning which seems to achieve a greater importance the further east you travel from the Rhine. This course was served with some fine sweetcorn drop cakes. The service was discreet. Being alone I was trying unobtrusively to read a novel on my lap. The waitress pretended not to notice. There was piped music of the classical sort but turned down fairly low. Classical music should come as no surprise in a city where two out of three taxis I took were tuned into the classical radio station. Viennese drivers please copy. I finished my meal with some rote Grutze with a dollop of walnut ice. Rote Grutze are sometimes billed as the German version of an English summer pudding, although the German dish blends its raspberry, red and blackcurrant mixture with semolina rather than bread, mixing the elements together to make a kind of deep red pond. There is nothing particularly munichois about it; in Mecklenburg there is even a dialect song about rote Grutze. Up to this point I had been quite happy with the extensive wine list which was more than equitably priced. Sadly, however, in a country so famed for its pudding wines, Halali had none by the glass. I asked myself what a Schickimicki would do in the circumstances, and ordered a glass of champagne. Information: Halali Schonfeldstrasse 22, 8000 Munich 2. Tel (89) 28 59 09. Open Mon to Fri 12 - 3pm and 6pm - midnight. Saturday 6pm - midnight. Closed Sunday. Menu at DM85. A la carte DM110.</p>

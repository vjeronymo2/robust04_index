			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian </F> National Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place and date not given;  from the "With the Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the  Palestinian National Authority [PNA], good evening.    [Sha'th] Good evening, you are welcome.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, when will the PNA members residing  outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip begin to arrive in the  self-rule area to pursue their work in order to confront the  great challenges?    [Sha'th] In the next two weeks, God willing. Brother  President Yasir 'Arafat will be there no later than 15 June.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, in fact, the current picture is not a  rosy one. The economic situation is serious, and there is a  great responsibility to be assumed by the PNA. Immediate  measures should be taken, and any delay will make things  difficult.    [Sha'th] No doubt, we will do our best to resolve these  problems. However, brother Sa'id, I should say frankly that one  sometimes forgets why the situation in the Gaza Strip is bad  following 27 years of occupation. The Israeli Government, as an  occupation government in this area, was in charge of the Gaza  Strip for 27 years.    The current talk about the difficult crisis is true.  However, the party that was in charge for 27 years is to be  held responsible. Moreover, we have been assuming our  responsibilities only for weeks. I believe this should be said  to know who is responsible for this situation and how it can be  resolved. In any case, I am not one of those who lament the  past, and I believe we should make every effort to build and  compensate for all these lengthy years of suffering experienced  by our people in the Gaza Strip.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what about the financial aid to the  Palestinians, knowing that the economic situation is the key to  the agreement's success?    [Sha'th] As you know, this aid has been delayed. We barely  obtained money for the Palestinian police entry [into the  self-rule area]. However, the greater portion of funds, which  will come through the coordination committee organized by the  World Bank, was delayed until the Gaza-Jericho agreement was  signed.    In any case, I believe these funds will come in succession,  so all salaries can be disbursed on time and the current  expenses can be managed at least for the first few months until  we can collect part of the taxes which the Civil Administration  used to collect before the agreement was signed. I am not  pessimistic about this issue. I believe that we will fulfill  all obligations, and sufficient funds will come to meet these  obligations. What is important is that this should open the way  for real economic development which will be the key to ending  the problem of unemployment and create a new situation in the  Palestinian territory.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the issues of the Palestinian  institutions in East Jerusalem and the attempt by the  Palestinian side to impose political realities were recently  raised. The prime minister stated that the Palestinians  committed themselves to establishing institutions in the  self-rule area. What do you say about this?    [Sha'th] I believe there is confusion between the  institutions which are confined to the self-rule areas in Gaza  and Jericho, namely, the PNA areas--by the way, the agreement  stipulates that these institutions will be established in Gaza  and Jericho and not only in Jericho--and the Palestinian  institutions existing in Jerusalem before the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    These Palestinian Arab institutions in East Jerusalem are  Palestinian institutions and there was an agreement to keep  them. During the Likud's rule, these institutions remained open.  Orient House is not an institution that was built after signing  the Gaza-Jericho agreement but it is one that was established  and recognized, along with many other similar institutions,  before the current Labor government took office. Thus, we find  it very strange that there is objection to the Palestinian  institutions in Jerusalem. We regard this objection as an open  violation of the agreement by all concepts. This is because  there was agreement that negotiations on Jerusalem's final  status will be held during the final status negotiations. This  does not at all allow the Israeli side to behave as if Jerusalem  was an annexed city at a time when this side denies the  Palestinian side, which is deeply entrenched in East Jerusalem,  the right to keep its institutions. This cannot be accepted; it  is inconceivable that the Likud government permitted something  that the [Israeli] Labor Ministry has canceled with a pen  stroke. This remark by Prime Minister Rabin is really strange  and not understood.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, last question: On the level of setting  up the PNA, are contacts still continuing with the Hamas  Movement to join the PNA? Was Shaykh Sa'id Bilal officially  appointed in the PNA?    [Sha'th] As far as I know, no new appointment has been made  since the meeting held in Tunis. However, I know that there is  real readiness to expand this authority. There are still six  open portfolios for anyone who is ready to be committed to the  agreement we signed and to work through this agreement to serve  the Palestinian people. In fact, this is the basis through  which contacts can be made with any of the Palestinian forces  that are ready to participate in assuming the responsibility of  next phase.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian  Authority, thank you very much.    [Sha'th] Thank you, brother.</p>

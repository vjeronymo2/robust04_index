			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, the deputy  chairman of the Presidential Council, has issued a statement to  the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY in Aden regarding reports by Sanaa media,  which warn ships and aircraft against using the ports of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], as they are exposed to  danger. He described the statement as being one of a string of  lies, and as being totally unsupported by the facts. He  stressed that harbors and airports in the DRY were safe.    He said: We take full responsibility for protecting ships  and aircraft using these ports. The deputy chairman also  stated: We are capable, with the help of almighty God, and by  virtue of the power of our Naval and Air Forces, of maintaining  total control of the Republic's waters and airspace.    Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri warned the Sanaa regime  against attempting to attack DRY ports, as a gamble of this sort  would result in a decisive response. He said: Were it not but  for our concern for the interests and resources of our people in  the north, we would be capable of imposing a total maritime  blockade on al-Hudaydah (?and al-Mukha). The brother deputy  chairman of the Presidential Council warned the regime in Sanaa  against exploiting our spirit of responsibility by issuing  inane statements during the weak and chaotic situation that that  regime is currently experiencing.</p>

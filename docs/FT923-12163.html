			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Foreign concern over Italy's health: Worldwide worry when a state holding company defaults The prospect of one of the G7 group of leading industrialised countries defaulting on its foreign debts is the sort of thing that makes bankers lie awake at night. It was not surprising, then, that a frisson of fear rippled through the international banking community over the weekend as it was confirmed that one of Italy's big state holding companies does not intend to repay its debts on time. Efim, which has debts of L8,500bn (Pounds 3.87bn), is the sick man among the country's state-run industrial combines. Many of its subsidiaries, which number more than 100, are tied up in defence, aluminium and other industries which are going through a tough period. Yesterday's publication of an official decree confirmed the group's fate. It is to be wound up by an administrator and its assets sold off. In the meantime, the group - regarded by foreign bankers as virtually an arm of the Italian treasury - will not service or repay any of its debts. That unilateral moratorium could last two years. If, as expected, the money raised from disposals does not cover Efim's big debts, then the administrator will issue the group's creditors with up to L4,000bn of government-backed bonds. The Italian authorities have tried to put a positive gloss on the demise of one of its top tier of industrial holding companies. Successive administrations had failed to deal with the gathering problems at Efim; at least now the problems are being tackled. Foreign bankers have not seen things the same way. There are believed to be 17 separate syndicates of banks involved, put together at different times to lend about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.03bn) to Efim and its subsidiaries. Manufacturers Hanover (now merged with Chemical Bank) and Mitsubishi Trust play a leading role in a number of these, though most international banks turn up in one or more. Part of what has set the bankers' nerves on edge was the manner in which they learnt of Efim's fate. Neither the company nor the treasury warned banks of their plans in advance, or made any effort to create the illusion that they were consulting with their creditors. If this is how the government handles the break-up of one of its largest industrial groups, what chance is there for a smooth reorganisation of the country's state sector? Reduced to following events in newspapers or on newswires as news first broke at the end of last week, one banker gave vent to his anger: 'Efim is virtually an arm of the treasury. They frankly have to get this one right otherwise Italy will be no better than an Argentina or a Brazil.' The cloud of uncertainty continued to engulf bankers yesterday. 'Everyone is trying to find out what the hell's going on. We're ringing other banks to ask them, but when they pick up the phone, they ask us the same question,' said one. Other creditors worked hard to defuse what was in danger of becoming an angry face-off between the Italian treasury and foreign bankers. However, no banker likes to be told, without consultation, that debts are not going to be paid on time. The manner in which Efim's demise was handled is likely to live on in bankers' memories for some time. Two immediate questions now trouble Efim's creditors. If the group's assets do not cover its liabilities, how great will the shortfall be? And will the Italian treasury's compensation arrangements make good the loss? SG Warburg, the UK investment bank which acts as agent on a number of loans to Efim and its subsidiaries, has been asked to value the group's assets, along with Mediobanca, the private Italian bank. The Italian government's pronouncements suggest that all creditors will be repaid in full. But important questions have yet to be tackled. How will the treasury set the interest rate on the bonds? Will the interests of all the many different syndicates of bank creditors be taken into account, or will some come off worse than others? Squaring the interests of all bank creditors will not be easy. The waves from the Efim affair are likely to be felt more widely. For a start, Italian borrowers will find it virtually impossible to borrow from foreign banks until the dust has settled. That much was clear yesterday as bankers moved to freeze their exposure limits to Italy at current levels until they can gauge the extent of the Efim problem. Many foreign banks have only recently begun to lend again to Italy following a row last year over the collapse of Federconsorzi, an agricultural group. Although banks argued that the group had operated with an implicit state guarantee, they were eventually forced to accept back only three quarters of their claims. Lenders to Italy's other main state holding companies are also now pawing through the documentation behind their loans to see whether their rights are affected. Such documents usually contain cross-default clauses, giving lenders the right to call in their loans if the borrower defaults on any of its other commitments. The position is complicated by the insertion in yesterday's decree of a clause apparently requiring bankers to renounce any claims against Efim which arose before yesterday. 'We are getting legal advice on what it all means,' the head of one syndicate of banks said. The wrangle between Italy and its foreign bankers has come at an unfortunate moment. Moody's, the US credit-rating agency, is already looking into whether it should downgrade Italy from its current AA1 status. It already fails to match up to the AAA standing of the other G7 countries, and any further relegation would have a serious impact in the eyes of the international financial community. With the debacle surrounding Efim, such a move may just have come one step closer. Lex, Page 16</p>

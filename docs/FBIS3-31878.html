			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jezsensky by </F> Cristina Lopez Schlichting in Madrid; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Lopez] As neighbors of the  Balkans, you have a sword of Damocles hanging over your heads.  Last year, you were talking about the threat of the war  spreading to Vojvodina -- the Serbian region where a large part  of the population is Hungarian. Do you believe that this  eventuality is closer?    [Jezsensky] No, fortunately; partly thanks to our careful  moves and partly also because Belgrade has now won through war  what it wanted and is now interested in consolidating and wants  no more problems. The defeat of the most extremist Serbian  groups in the last elections must also be taken into account.  It is true that the Hungarians of Voivodina remain innocent  victims of the economic embargo and that they are harassed by  certain sections of the population -- especially Serbian  refugees from Bosnia and Croatia -- who are pressing them to  leave, but we have detected in Belgrade signs in favor of  granting this minority a certain cultural autonomy.    [Lopez] Around you, there is almost frantic diplomatic  activity between Romania, Serbia, and Greece. Do you not feel  isolated?    [Jezsensky] The three nations are Orthodox and share common  -- Byzantine -- cultural roots, but it would be dangerous to see  these moves as the beginning of a division between the Catholic  and Orthodox cultural worlds in the area. It is true that  Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia share a rejection of the Hungarian  minorities' desire for autonomy, and that Greece and Romania  vigorously supported Serbia at the worst point in the Balkans  crisis, but I believe that the mutual rapprochement now is due  more to a desire to end the Balkans conflict and to maintain an  economic route to the West through Yugoslavia or Romania.    [Lopez] Hungary has just joined the Partnership for Peace.  To what extent do you feel protected by this intermediate course  between NATO and nothing?    [Jezsensky] We have always made it clear that our intention  is to join NATO; from this viewpoint, we disagree with  Partnership for Peace, but at the same time we understand the  efforts of Europe and the United States to reassure Russia.  Moreover, the Partnership is much more than we initially  believed. In fact, NATO's future expansion has been accepted,  and we are being allowed to prepare for later membership. We  will take the opportunity.    [Lopez] I recall that you used to be very much in favor of  strengthening the CSCE....    [Jezsensky] The CSCE is too uncoordinated. Its members are  too numerous, and some of them are not actually European or,  unfortunately, stable. The CSCE has shown itself unable to  resolve the Balkans conflict. It has noble aims, but it is too  large to guarantee European security. To some extent, when  thinking about the CSCE, I recall Stalin's remark about the  pope. How many divisions does he have? The CSCE has no  divisions, but NATO does. That is why NATO is effective.    [Lopez] Speaking of effectiveness, NATO has just taken an  initiative. What will become of this current ultimatum?    [Jezsensky] An ultimatum is a threat in order to try to  secure something. It must be backed up by credible strength but  also by common sense. NATO has this strength, and I believe  that the Serbs will not venture to repeat their contempt of the  ultimatum which was delivered in 1914. At least, Belgrade does  not seem inclined to do so, and although everything depends on  the Bosnian Serbs, I hope that they will withdraw and carry out  what is being demanded, but I also hope that, even if they do  not do so completely, NATO will not find itself obliged to  intervene. Peace is the responsibility of all the parties  involved. Responsibility for the origin of the war is a matter  for an international court and history, but the most important  thing now is to secure peace, even at the cost of not achieving  everything that is demanded. The alternative is mutual  annihilation.   <H5>    Feel Nostalgia for Stalin </H5>   [Lopez] The Russian scene has changed substantially with the  rise of opposition leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. What is  Hungary's stance on this change of scene?    [Jezsensky] Look, Zhirinovskiy does not alarm me personally  or Hungary. What does alarm me is Europe's not taking him  seriously. Although there is no exact parallel, it must be  recalled that Hitler was not taken seriously, either. The  Russian people feel that they have lost an empire. They were  told for decades that everybody loved Russia because it provided  security. Now, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, they  find themselves abandoned by everybody and plunged into poverty.  The West has done a great deal, but it must do more. It must  help seek an economic solution and show them the advantages of  the free market and democracy; help them understand, as was done  with Germany and Japan after World War II, the evilness of the  regimes which were left behind. If the Russians do not see an  improvement in their immediate situation, they will feel  nostalgia for Stalin. They will forget the 50 million dead but  remember the price of bread when he was alive. Zhirinovskiy  cannot be understood outside the Russian situation. That is why  it is imperative to support the minority who see Russia's future  in Europe and who, unfortunately for everybody, did not fare  well in the last elections.</p>

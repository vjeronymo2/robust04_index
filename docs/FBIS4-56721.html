			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Guillermo Quijano, vice presidential </F> candidate for Change '94 coalition, by Axel Rivera at the  coalition's campaign headquarters in Panama City--live]    [Text] [Rivera] Mr. Quijano, will you tell us how you feel  about this process. How are your spirits?    [Quijano] First, I want to say one can say the process has  been clean, clear, precise. The Electoral Tribunal has shown  great honesty in this electoral process, something of which all  Panamanians should truly feel proud. I hope Panama will  continue to hold elections such as today's.    Regarding vote counts, I believe these results include  approximately 40 percent of the cast votes. What we do not have  is an idea of what sectors these results cover. In the  particular case of Panama City's, I believe we have results from  sector 8-7, partial results for 8-6, but I do not know whether  there have been any results for 8-8 and 8-9, where Change '94  held much hope. The same goes for the interior of Panama  Province--western Panama, sectors 8- 1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4, and 8-5.  This also holds true for the Republic's countryside.  Information has been released on the provinces' urban areas and  not from the rural sectors. We will have to wait another hour  or so until we have a higher percentage of results to allow us  to announce some kind of decision.    [Rivera] Can we interpret that you still believe Professor  Carles' trend may continue to increase?    [Quijano] It is possible rural sectors and other Panama  Province sectors may begin to make a difference in the final  result. It is too early to make any prediction. What viewers  can be sure of is that if Change '94 is not the winner we will  recognize the victor, because up to now the elections and vote  count have been clean and honest.    [Rivera] Even if the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] is  the winner?    [Quijano] No matter who the winner is. I believe the only  way Panama can grow politically is by having those who lose  recognize the triumph of the winners. If we win, we also hope  the PRD recognizes our victory.    [Rivera] The latest provincial figures indicate that  Professor Carles lost in Cocle Province, his home province. How  do you explain this?    [Quijano] The reason is that the only votes counted so far  are from the urban sectors of Penonome and Aguadulce, where most  of the voters are public workers and where a high percentage  belong to the PRD and another high percentage belong to the  Arnulfist Party. We now have to reach into the countryside,  Toabre, Tambo, El Roble, all rural sectors in Cocle Province,  where we are strong.</p>

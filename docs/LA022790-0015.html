			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YEAR-ROUND  </P> <P> I have been a year-round teacher for the Tehachapi Unified School District. Our  district, faced with the exact population-explosion problem as Los Angeles, was  forced to adopt the system.  </P> <P> Our district attempted to pass a bond issue but the voters rejected it, forcing  the year-round schedule.  </P> <P> Many parents and community people howled about the "quality" education being  diminished. Their solution, just like the middle-class parents in Los Angeles,  was more money to prevent this. School districts adopting year-round schedules  are saving facilities, improving education and providing a morale boost to  teachers and students. Parents wanting a long summer vacation need to look at  their "spoiled child" syndrome and support a system that saves tax dollars,  time and enhances education. Year-round education is the future we must accept  -- not fight.  </P> <P> RICK A. SCOTT  </P> <P> Tehachapi  </P></p>

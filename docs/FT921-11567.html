			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: North American free trade talks enter top gear NEGOTIATIONS on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), linking the US, Canada and Mexico, are moving at a rapid pace, but President Bush's brief reference to the talks in his State of the Union message sent a signal to political observers that he is still keeping his options open. In an effort to secure a draft agreement before the end of the month, trade negotiators from the three countries have planned an almost non-stop series of meetings, culminating in a possible head-of-state reunion at the end of February. On Sunday, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, will head a delegation to Mexico of congressmen and businessmen, and Mrs Hills will meet with President Carlos Salinas. Next Tuesday, the chief trade negotiators will meet in Ottawa, Canada; and next weekend the three trade ministers will meet in Annapolis, Maryland. A further ministerial meeting has been pencilled in for the end of February in Dallas, Texas. Although the negotiators have remained tight-lipped where differences lie, reports from Mexican newspapers suggest that negotiators have completed 15 draft chapters of the 18 in total. These 15 chapters include brackets where important differences lie, but the hope is that most, if not all, of the brackets will be removed at the Annapolis meeting. The negotiators appear not yet to have drawn up drafts on energy, cars and agriculture, reflecting the extreme sensitivity with which these sectors are treated in all three countries. The agreement on the agriculture chapter has been held up by the uncertainty over the Gatt negotiations - although a decision has been reached to draft an agreement on agriculture before the Gatt round concludes. Cars for the US and the Mexicans are perhaps the most critical sector. They account for 20 per cent of Mexican exports, while support of the US auto makers for Nafta may be essential if the agreement is to pass the US Congress. Recent reports in the Mexican press suggest energy may have become a sticking point. This whirlwind of activity received only a passing mention from the President last Tuesday - but the Gatt Uruguay Round received none. 'In our major trade negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage America's farmers and workers,' he said. 'And we'll get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through the North American Free Trade Agreement, and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.' The latter was President Bush's initiative in 1990 to speed economic integration in the Americas, opening up the possibility of a hemispheric free trade zone.</p>

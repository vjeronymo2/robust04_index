			<p>BFN     [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that certain snags have  prevented the visit of a high-level Palestinian political  delegation to Baghdad. Primarily, Iraqi President Saddam Husayn  has apologized for being unable to receive the delegation at  present.    On the other hand, a Palestinian military delegation, which  has been visiting Baghdad for more than two weeks, discussed  technical issues only at the level of liaison officers between  the forces of the Palestine Liberation Army and the Iraqi Army.    The troops of the Palestine Liberation Army deployed in Iraq  will be the first to enter Jericho through Jordan this week.    Iraq did not agree to allow these forces to leave and to  take  along all their weapons. It allowed them to carry personal  weapons only, that is, a pistol for officers. It also allowed  them to carry 60 rifles as they leave the Iraqi-Jordanian border.    The PLO tried to acquire light weapons and ammunitions from  Jordan. While discussing this issue, Greece said it was willing  to provide the Palestinian police force with light weapons.</p>

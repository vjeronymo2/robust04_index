			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 20 (ATA) -- The Ministry of the  Public Order reported recently that several people have been  detained for keeping arms without permission and criminal acts.  The detention are in conformity with the law.    During the sudden controls the police organs have detained  citizens from Vlore, Pogradeci, Delvina, Gjirokaster (south of  Albania), Shkoder, Hasi, Bulqiza (north) and from Tirana  (central Albania). The police has taken from them tommy guns,  pistols, knives and munitions.    Besides the arms, the police has also confiscated a lot of  anticonstitutional documents which proves the expansionist and  annexionist Greek intentions toward Albania and the Albanian  territories, as well as the flagrant Greek endeavour to make  Greek the southern part of Albania.

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLISEUM'S EMPTY PROMISE COULD MEAN EMPTY SEATS  </P> <P> I just read where the Coliseum Commission is trying to keep Al Davis' Raiders  in Los Angeles by proposing to build a new stadium.  </P> <P> This is the same commission that proposed renovating the old stadium when the  team started playing here in 1982. Does Davis remember the now forgotten luxury  boxes?  </P> <P> The members of the commission do not want Davis to stay, they just do not want  to be held responsible for the Raiders' departure.  </P> <P> JOHN DeWITT, Downey  </P></p>

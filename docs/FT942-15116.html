			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Family planning - Starting up Garth Wiseman was an industrial adviser at the National Economic Development Office until 1992. In 1986 he set up an art dealership, Wiseman Originals, with his wife, Caroline. Now they both work full-time for the company. There is an important element in setting up a small business which is often neglected. The decision to start a business must be made as part of a family or domestic plan. If both partners in a household work they can plan the business to give it time to reach critical mass. One partner can stay in a salaried job to provide the security of family income while the other sets up the business to provide long-term opportunity. One partner helps to minimise the downside while the other helps to develop the upside for the family. The mistake that so many entrepreneurs, and their backers, make is to underestimate the time required for a business to become viable. This is invariably the product of enforced over-optimism. There is a school of thought that suggests that to create a business one has to give body and soul. This commitment is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one. Blood, sweat and tears will not bring its own reward. The analysis has to be right, decisions well judged and action properly implemented. Before my wife and I started our business as print dealers, my wife worked for a gallery on Saturdays for no pay to gain experience and an understanding of the business. I had worked for 25 years as an auditor, bank lending officer and as an industrial adviser at National Economic Development Office and so I had built up an understanding why businesses fail and why they succeed. I had put myself through business school and had trained in marketing and accounting. Between us we not only had a knowledge of the specific business that we were entering but we also had the skills necessary to create and run a successful business. The keys to the success of our business have been: minimising set up costs and ongoing overheads and bank borrowing, employing of one partner only for the first few years until we reached critical mass, managing the household so one of us was free to see clients whatever the day or time. (We are open 15 hours a day, seven days a week including Christmas.) During nearly 20 years as an industrial adviser at NEDO I never encountered a company of the size of the family business my wife and I now run, which has a turnover of Pounds 300,000. A lot of attention is given to setting up small businesses but there has never been much given to those small businesses, like ours, that are four / five years old and have weathered the recent economic turbulence but which need help and good advice to grow further. Businesses do not grow in a straight line but in steps. There are points at which a business needs to spend significant amounts of money to be able to expand to the next threshold. For example, we reached the point where we felt we had to invest in computers. We spent Pounds 5,000 on equipment and consultancy to enable us to spend more of our time doing business, to allow more people to participate in running the business, to improve our control of the business and the amount of information we had on it. Banks and government bodies produce fantastic promotional literature about their schemes and facilities for new small businesses but their delivery is woeful. I have found it difficult to obtain advice from any source that gave me a greater insight into our business. Most of the 'counsellors' are simply of too low a calibre and their experience is too limited to be of much use to an entrepreneur who has to be proficient in a wide variety of skills and must see the whole picture. When running a new small business the gradualist approach to learning is more useful than the one-off course which encourages people to think mistakenly that they now know all they need to know to succeed. My preference would be to have a hot line to a selection of experts with whom I could discuss my problems. The practice of the Prince's Trust of giving unlimited access to a guardian angle is very much along these lines. It is one that government initiatives, whether delivered through TECs or other vehicles, should adopt. Organisations could help by appointing account managers so that small-company managers can go direct to one individual whatever the nature of the problem. Wiseman Originals specialises in 20th century lithographs, etchings, screen prints and relief prints. It is at 34 West Square, London SE11 4SP 071-587-0747</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Technology: Reversing the operation - The job of dismantling the world's nuclear arsenal The United States and the former Soviet republics are embarking on a nuclear disarmament programme of a scale that no one had imagined possible until a few months ago. It will involve dismantling at least 20,000 warheads, ranging from tactical weapons to multi-megaton hydrogen bombs. The process of nuclear dismantling remains shrouded in secrecy, for the simple reason that taking apart a weapon is the reverse of putting one together - and no one wants to risk giving useful clues to building an H-bomb. In the US, UK and France, nuclear weapons are designed with eventual dismantling in mind. The western nuclear powers have been taking apart their old warheads regularly since the 1950s and re-using the materials in more modern ones. For them dismantling is a routine though expensive and time-consuming process, which uses high-technology equipment for remote handling of hazardous materials. The former Soviet Union, on the other hand, has less experience of nuclear dismantling and recycling. Its stockpile contains ancient warheads from the 1960s and, to make matters more dangerous, the nuclear technicians trained to maintain them are said to be leaving their posts in droves, demoralised by the collapse of the Soviet military system and the fact that no one is paying them a living wage. John Simpson, a nuclear specialist at Southampton University's Mountbatten Centre for International Studies, says Russian contacts have told him 'that some of their weapons were simply not designed to be dismantled. In that case, we have to start virtually from scratch, developing ways to get at the fissile cores'. However the Russians do have some dismantling experience, as Viktor Mikhailov, deputy minister of atomic power and industry, made clear in an article published this month in Moscow. 'In fact, our factories are already more occupied with the dismantling of warheads than the production of new ones,' he wrote. Dismantling has to take place in a special cell that is protected with reinforced concrete in case of an accident. There is no risk of a full-scale nuclear explosion but the conventional explosive used to detonate the bomb could conceivably blow up, particularly if the warhead is old and poorly maintained. The containment would then be needed to prevent plutonium - a radioactive and toxic metal - being released into the environment. In the west, the conventional explosive removed from warheads is normally destroyed by controlled burning. But according to Mikhailov the Russians sometimes use it for making synthetic diamonds; when detonated in a sealed chamber it produces pressures high enough to convert graphite, the humble black form of car According to western estimates, Russia has enough cells to dismantle 1,500 to 2,000 warheads per year. That compares with an estimated 15,000 warheads needing destruction under current Russian plans. In addition there are thousands of old weapons in storage, which are likely to present the most difficult dismantling task. The Russians will need western help to build up decommissioning facilities if they are to get rid of their weapons at an acceptable rate. 'The obvious way to speed up the process is to build more cells,' says Simpson. 'But there is a Catch 22.' Cells built for dismantling could be turned round relatively easily to do the reverse - assembling warheads - if the political climate changes. Given the potential instability of the former Soviet states, many proliferation specialists believe the west should concentrate its help on ensuring the physical security of all warheads due for elimination, rather than dismantling them. This means moving them to properly guarded central storage in Russia, making the warheads safe and inactivating their detonators. Francois Heisbourg, director of International Institute for Strategic Studies, says full-scale dismantling of the warheads would be 'worse than leaving them intact' unless foolproof arrangements are in place to safeguard the nuclear materials that come out of the bombs. The International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, is keen to expand its existing role of inspecting the world's civilian nuclear plants and start to supervise the plutonium and enriched uranium removed from weapons, making sure that they are never diverted back to military use. One of the most vexatious issues surrounding nuclear disarmament is what to do with the weapons-grade plutonium. The US already has an estimated 50 tonnes of unwanted plutonium, which was either removed from scrapped warheads or produced for future military use but no longer required, and the weapons decommissioned over the coming years will generated more. The obvious civil use for the plutonium is to generate electricity in power stations. But the type of reactor designed to run on plutonium, the fast breeder, remains far from commercial development. For use in conventional thermal reactors the plutonium has to be combined with uranium in the form of mixed oxide (Mox) fuel. 'Looking at the non-proliferation aspects, the best use of the plutonium is to burn it as mixed oxide fuel,' says David Kyd of the IAEA. Many people in the nuclear industry agree but others are sceptical about recycling plutonium in this way because it is more expensive and difficult to use than straightforward uranium fuel. 'Plutonium recycling is simply uneconomic,' says William Walker of the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex. 'Most plutonium in the world should be regarded not as an asset but as waste to be disposed of.' Suggestions for plutonium disposal range from entombment deep within the earth to firing into deep space. But no one has come up with scheme that is technically feasible, environmentally acceptable and politically supportable. THE IMMENSE destructive power of a modern warhead results from four nuclear explosions - one fusion and three fission reactions - occurring within a few millionths of a second inside its metal casing. At the heart of the weapon is a small 'implosion-type' atomic bomb similar to the one that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. It is detonated by firing a spherical shell of high explosive around a ball of plutonium (or highly enriched uranium). The pressure squeezes the plutonium into a super-critical mass, triggering explosive nuclear fission. The primary explosion transmits an intense pulse of X-ray energy towards a cylinder of lithium deuteride wrapped around a rod of plutonium. This radiation triggers a second fission reaction in the plutonium rod and nuclear fusion between deuterium and tritium - the main source of the H-bomb's awesome power - in the lithium deuteride. The cylinder also contains some tritium gas. The cylinder has a thick outer layer of unenriched uranium (U238) metal. This 'tamper' gives the thermonuclear explosion extra force by holding the deuterium and tritium in place for an extra millionth of a second or so before everything flies apart. At the same time, the intense flow of neutrons from the fusion reaction triggers fission in the U238 itself - adding yet more power to the warhead. The weapon has many other components, including electronics to control the detonator, and radiation shields and mirrors to distribute radiation from the primary explosion evenly over the secondary cylinder.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> CORRESPONDENCE OF TWO MEN OF LETTERS  </P> <P> The Selected Correspondence of Kenneth Burke and Malcolm Cowley, 1915-1981,  edited by Paul Jay (Viking: $29.95, 448 pages)  </P> <P> As a young man in my college years, I engaged in three furious and passionate  exchanges of letters -- the love letters by which I courted my wife, the  letters that my brother and I wrote to each other when he was in Paris and  safely out of reach of the draft during the Vietnam War, and the letters in  which I confided my literary ambitions to a friend from high school who had  sought his own fortunes on a commune in Mendocino. I poured my heart and soul  into those letters, sometimes writing two or three times a day. By the age of  21, however, I found that I had spent my passion for letter-writing, and I  turned to other literary endeavors.  </P> <P> What we discover in "The Selected Correspondence of Kenneth Burke and Malcolm  Cowley" is, among many other things, that the passionate letter-writing of  one's adolescence and young adulthood can be sustained over a lifetime. Indeed,  "The Selected Correspondence" is quite literally the life's work of two  enduring figures of American literature.  </P> <P> Cowley, the distinguished critic and literary historian ("Exile's Return"),  studied at Harvard, volunteered as an ambulance driver in World War I, and  spent his expatriate years in Paris. Kenneth Burke -- who has also  distinguished himself as a critic ("A Grammar of Motives" and "A Rhetoric of  Motives") as well as a poet -- studied at Ohio State University and Columbia,  then dropped out to become "a Flaubert" in New York. Each man went on to invent  himself as a force in the noisy literary battles of the 20th Century. Now we  learn that their most impressive literary achievement may have been the letters  that they have exchanged throughout their lives.  </P> <P> Burke and Cowley, who befriended each other as high school students in  Pittsburgh in the early years of the century, began an exchange of  correspondence that has lasted more than 70 years.  </P> <P> "The Selected Letters" is a sweeping intellectual history of the 20th Century,  an intimate chronicle of the ideas and personalities and events that have  informed and inspired the last four or five generations of American men and  women of letters. At the same time, the book can be approached as a kind of  two-headed autobiographical novel embodied in the letters exchanged by two  bright, ambitious and accomplished men who find in each other a kindred spirit,  a confessor, a goad, a fellow soldier in the literary campaigns, a comforter in  old age.  </P> <P> We first meet Burke and Cowley as brash and callow young men: "Last night I had  the fullest hours of my life; I was at Theodore Dreiser's," Burke writes in  1915. "I managed to worm myself shyly into conversation with Dreiser, but not  until I had suffered the painful humiliation of finding myself addressing the  air."  </P> <P> We see them, too, as men grappling with the vagaries and frustrations of life,  struggling to build careers and relationships and reputations: "I feel hollow  as a sucked egg," Cowley complains in a letter from 1931, when he was working  as literary editor of the New Republic. "If I could drop everything, go to  Europe, write an ambitious book, I'd be cured quickly; but I don't want to drop  the New Republic. . . . What's the answer?"  </P> <P> And we see them in old age, mellow and reflective, enduring the losses of  colleagues and loved ones, and struggling against new infirmities: "For both of  us a mild consolation is that we're not just stumbling into the shadows,"  Cowley writes in 1980. "Both of us are better known in our 80s than we were in  our 60s."  </P> <P> The correspondence is filled with preening and posturing, carping and  kvetching, and -- not infrequently -- the flatulence of inflated egos. ("I  don't want to be a virtuoso," Burke writes in 1918. "I want to be a -- a -- oh  hell, why not? I want to be a -- yes -- a genius.") Early on, we suspect that  Burke and Cowley are writing for readers other than each other -- indeed, they  were writing for the ages. By 1982, Cowley is ready to go public with the  letters:  </P> <P> "I made a review of my literary remains or disiecta membra and decided that  they included material for nine, count them, nine books," Cowley wrote. "One  project we ought to think about is the Burke-Cowley correspondence. By this  time there's nothing like it in the American 20th Century."  </P></p>

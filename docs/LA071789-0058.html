			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO ZEALOTS, BEING FIRST DOES MATTER.  </P> <P> They pride themselves on being first.  </P> <P> For some, it is the thrill of being at opening night. For others, it's the lead  position in the ticket line to get there. Whatever the motivation, there is a  certain number among us who would go to many lengths to say they were first to  screen a movie premiere, or were there at a one-time-only concert, sold-out  play or world championship game.  </P> <P> Understand that these "firsts" don't take their business lightly. And being  first to just any event generally won't do. The thrill lies in "being first to  an event in history" -- as "firsts" like to say -- those once-in-a-lifetime  experiences that can be treasured for years to come: "The Who" concert, the  "Batman" premiere, "Phantom of the Opera," Lakers or Dodgers Championship  finals.  </P> <P> "It is the concept of being a part of something very large and very special,"  explains Cory Haibloom, 31, who was eighth in line at the "Batman" premiere in  Westwood.  </P> <P> "You feel like a part of the celebration," says Tyrone Williams, 29, who went  to the first two Lakers championship games this year and all of last year's  championship series.  </P> <P> But why?  </P> <P> "Part of the excitement comes from when you stand in the lines," says Williams,  who adds that if he doesn't get to the line in time to be one of the first 10  or 20, he passes. The excitement "builds from there until you see the game.  Standing in line is like a kind of karma," he adds. "Everyone is in the same  mood. It makes you feel like a part of the team. You just don't get that from  TV."  </P> <P> Richard Baltin, 32, has the same feeling about movie premieres. "Opening-day  crowds are usually more excited, more fun. The people are true fans, just like  you are. The audience is oftentimes as animated as the screen itself," says  Baltin, who was another first-in-line at the "Batman" premiere.  </P> <P> University of Southern California psychologist Chaytor Mason has a slightly  more complex explanation for what motivates people to stand days in line for an  event.  </P> <P> He contends that "people are likely to wait in lines to be first because  (there) they find others with similar interests ready to go the extra mile as  well. Or there may be resentment for having to be lined up for things.  Consequently," he explains, "they will stand up eight hours to be first in line  so they won't have to stand in the line.  </P> <P> "Even deeper . . . is the emotional aspect," Mason says. Sometimes, he notes,  "people who feel in some way left out in life . . . have the need to experience  something first to remedy" that.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Free Movie  </P> <P> But, then again, there are more practical reasons. "Seeing the movie for free,"  says Baltin, is one of them.  </P> <P> "You simply have to keep in touch with what's going on, when, where and what  studios are previewing the upcoming movies," says Baltin, a seasoned  professional who's already screened this summer's top 10 movies, free of  charge. To do that, "It's very important to network with people," he explains.  "It takes a little effort, but compared to the money I would pay to get into  these movies with a date, it's worth it." He agrees it might be apt to compare  "firsts" to coupon clippers -- people who are willing to spend considerable  time keeping up with the coupon paper-chase to save a comparative few pennies.  </P> <P> Indeed, it seems that time -- and not money -- is what "firsts" are willing to  sacrifice. They are willing to spend countless hours, sometimes days, to  achieve their goals.  </P> <P> Baltin admits, "It takes a certain type of person to stand in a line for eight  days," referring to his friend Jeff's weeklong camp-out at the Egyptian Theatre  in May, 1983, for the opening of the movie "Return of the Jedi."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Kindred Spirit  </P> <P> It was at "Jedi" that Richard's roommate, Cory Haibloom, met Jeff Krispow, 25,  then a Cal State Northridge student. They have been lining up together ever  since, often, they admit, placing first-string status ahead of jobs and  education.  </P> <P> "I took school off" the week "Jedi" came out, says Krispow, who only had a few  weeks then before finals began. "It was worth the risk," he adds.  </P> <P> Baltin and others kid that Krispow is to blame for the eight-day line at the  "Jedi" box office, complaining that he let his paranoia get the best of him.  </P> <P> He started eight days ahead of show time, Krispow says, because "I wanted to be  ahead of the woman who was first in line for 'Empire.' She stood out five days,  and I was sure she would show," Krispow said.  </P> <P> "Concerts are a little different" than movie premieres, acknowledges John Ryan,  22, who was first in line at Ticketron in the Fallbrook Mall for the fall 1987  Pink Floyd concert.  </P> <P> "I waited in line for a day and a half. But I got the most incredible seats . .  . the 14th row back. I mean if I sneezed I probably would have gotten David  Gilmour right in the face.  </P> <P> "You could look at it as time served versus the extra 40 or 100 dollars that I  would have spent to get those kind of seats from a scalper," he adds.  </P> <P> Laker fan Williams agrees, saying, "they expect you to pay $400 more than the  tickets are worth." To save money, he says, "I'll . . . do anything to make  sure I'm one of the first in line."  </P> <P> There are other reasons for being first.  </P> <P> Like the "critic-factor," explains Baltin. "Critics like Rex Reed, who I  personally like very much, give three-fourths of the story plot away in their  reviews. It takes the suspense out of the picture. It's better to beat them to  the picture just to ensure the surprise."  </P> <P> Theater "firsts" are even more meticulous.  </P> <P> "Style is very important to the theatergoer," says Noah Alexander, who was one  of the first in line March 20 at the Ahmanson box office for tickets to  "Phantom of the Opera."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Celebrity Types  </P> <P> "The type of people that you are likely to see when you get tickets to a  Saturday night performance are celebrities," the fashion designer explains.  "You get to see what they are wearing . . . and hear what they talk about."  </P> <P> Is there a limit to the steps these fans are willing to take to be first?  </P> <P> Alexander says "yes," but "I'm willing to defend my first place in line."  </P> <P> He did that during his wait for "Phantom" tickets when, he says, a large group  of people, sidestepping security guards and Ahmanson Theatre representatives,  shoved their way to the front of the line through those who had been waiting  patiently for hours. Alexander, who said he and others suspected the  interlopers had been sent by ticket brokers and scalpers, found it necessary  "to raise my voice and threaten management to let them know that it is their  responsibility to keep things orderly." It was something, says the New York  City native, that would never have happened on Broadway.  </P> <P> "I'm a believer in lines," he continues, "because I feel genuinely when the box  office opens, it's first-come first-served. I am making an investment in my  time."  </P> <P> It paid off two years ago when he lined up for tickets to "Les Miserables" at  the Shubert Theatre. He was first in line at the box office, which got him four  second-row orchestra tickets.  </P> <P> About being first "you're talking about behavior patterns and styles," says  Irene Goldenberg, a research psychiatrist at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric  Institute. "I think that in some ways people focus around certain activities.  It gives them . . . an organization for life."  </P> <P> It also seems to be a sense of being in control that fuels the compulsion to be  first. Some pride themselves on beating the odds, and in most cases that means  beating the scalpers. And, they say, agencies like Ticket Masters often  distribute tickets randomly, giving those first in line little, if any,  priority.  </P> <P> Can the desire to be first become a full-blown obsession?  </P> <P> Says Mason: "Maybe, but on the other hand, it can be very rewarding. It goes  back to the conviviality of meeting the same people at a similar activity . . .  making it a social gathering. Then the people who like to be first look forward  to meeting one another again."  </P> <P> Ryan remembers his first "first" in 1977 when he was 10 years old and walked  into the first showing of "Star Wars." "I wondered to myself, 'Why on earth are  all of these people out here?' I guess that's where my compulsion started."  </P></p>

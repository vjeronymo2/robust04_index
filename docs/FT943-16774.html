			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Coal Investments to raise Pounds 7.9m via placing Coal Investments, formerly Geevor, is raising Pounds 7.9m from a placement to fund the reopening of two former British Coal mines and a joint venture investment with RTZ Corporation. The company, which was the subject of a management buy-in led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, British Coal commercial director until last October, is issuing 11.67m new shares at 68p only 3 months after it completed an Pounds 8m rights issue. However, the latest acquisitions help achieve the stated intention of licensing of selected former British Coal mines and setting up other coal-related operations. It has taken a 15 year lease on the Silverdale Colliery in Staffordshire, under which it will pay British Coal royalties on sales and additional half yearly payments to cover surface rental. In addition, it is paying Pounds 2.8m for a 48.4 per cent stake in the Inter-Continental Fuels group, which controls Inter-Continental Fuels and International Mining Consultants. RTZ will be an equal partner. The companies are involved in coal trading and coal mining consultancy. Mr Edwards said Coal Investments was considering tendering for some of the regional mining packages to be offered through the British Coal privatisation. The company also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 138,000) for the year to March, on turnover of Pounds 24,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lima, 4 Apr (EFE) -- At least 10 convicts were  wounded, some of them seriously, during a knife fight between  two factions of the Shining Path at the prison in the city of  Huancayo, in the Central Andes Region.    The bloody fight was the outcome of an "ideological debate"  between one faction which supports Shining Path leader Abimael  Guzman, who wants to make peace with the government, and another  faction which rejects the proposal and insists on continuing the  "popular war" that it declared against Peruvian democracy in  1980.    An officer of the Huamanccacca Prison of Huancayo reported  that the confrontation began when the dissident group called Red  Path [Sendero Rojo], which rejects peace, launched a harsh  verbal attack against Guzman during a Shining Path meeting in  which the subversive chief's peace proposal was being discussed.    Prison personnel and police had to separate the two  factions,  the source reported. [background passage omitted]</p>

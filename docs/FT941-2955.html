			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / High prices may create gas surplus A surplus of natural gas could arise in 1996-1997 because high prices are encouraging producers in the North and Irish Seas to develop new reserves, British Gas says. Mr Colin Friedlander, director of UK and western European operations for British Gas exploration and production, said gas prices 'remain reasonable' because of the government's decision in December to open up the residential market to competition. A number of new gas marketing companies, such as the gas subsidiaries of the regional electricity companies, are securing supplies in expectation of entering the market, which will be liberalised in early 1996. Power generators are also still negotiating contracts for supplies to fuel some of the gas-fired plants being built or planned. In recent years North Sea producers have put a priority on developing gas fields, largely to meet 'dash for gas' demand from power generators. Mr Friedlander said a recent lull in the announcement of new gas-fired power generation projects had not deterred a number of gas producers from continuing to be 'bullish' about bringing extra supplies to market. A report this month by Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultants, said some gas fields being considered for development could be delayed by insufficient demand towards the end of the decade. Mr Friedlander said development of the largest new gas fields should not be affected by any 'temporary' surplus in 1996-1997. The proposed pipeline linking Bacton in Norfolk to Zeebrugge in Belgium is expected to be operational in 1997 to carry surplus UK gas to European markets.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Essential that clearers heed governor's call (2) Sir, Bouquets to Mr Eddie George for telling the big four banks to support small business more. Brickbats to Mr Kenneth Clarke for wasting the time of his economic secretary, Mr Anthony Nelson, by telling him to explore the relationship between finance and business ('Clarke pledges review of funding for industry', September 10). A committee set up by the then prime minister, James Callaghan, and chaired by the then Sir Harold Wilson examined precisely this issue. Its 1979 report, The Financing of Small Firms, is available from HMSO and is still relevant. Although the recommendations led directly to some of the 'innovations' of Mrs Thatcher's early time in office (notably the Loan Guarantee Scheme and the Unlisted Securities Market), many of the same problems remain. Shortage of low-level capital and the ease with which banks can pull the rug are chief among them. What we need now is action of the sort Mr George is taking, not another inquiry.

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / UK Gilts: Success of future funding in doubt THE Bank of England has every reason to feel satisfied with the way the funding programme has proceeded so far in the 1992-93 financial year. Since the Conservatives won the general election, the Bank has sold about Pounds 11bn of gilts, achieving more than a third of the government's estimated funding requirement. However, against this success, some market participants are starting to wonder whether the Bank's luck will hold, or whether the job of issuing substantial amounts of gilts will prove tough in future. As one UK fund manager put it: 'The funding which has been accomplished so far has been achieved against an unprecedented background - we've seen a Conservative victory, a commitment to the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and low inflation. It's been very easy for the Bank to sell gilts in that sort of environment. The big question is to what extent the UK institutions want to continue stocking up with UK government bonds.' While few of the big UK fund managers are prepared to go on the record, many of those questioned about their portfolios admit they have increased their gilt allocations since the run-up to the election. One manager at a US fund management group said his group's exposure to the gilt market had trebled since just before the April election - from 4 per cent to 12 per cent of total portfolio. Another manager at one of the big UK fund management groups said his firm was a heavy buyer of gilts in February and March, and it had raised the proportion of its portfolio held in gilts from zero to 4 per cent. 'Our reasoning was that the gilts market had started to get very worked up about the possible consequences of a Labour government, despite the fact that Labour repeatedly stressed its commitment to the ERM. We found there was good value to be had in gilts, but we've started to reduce our holdings slightly now because everyone believes that inflation isn't a problem any more.' Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore, says his group has increased the proportion of its global bond portfolio held in gilts from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. However he adds that the balanced portfolios - those invested in a mix of bonds and equities - have kept their gilt holdings at a fairly constant level. If one looks back to the 1970s, the average UK pension fund kept about one-third of its funds invested in gilts. However, during the 1980s, fund managers increased the proportion of their funds invested in equities in order to achieve long-term capital growth: the proportion of portfolios invested in fixed income instruments - gilts and foreign government bonds - fell from 24 per cent in 1980 to 7 per cent in 1989, but increased slightly to 9 per cent last year, with roughly half of that in gilts. 'The bond culture has definitely declined in the UK and it could take time before fund managers really do increase their fixed-income holdings further,' says Mr Henderson. Few UK fund managers seem inclined to raise their gilt holdings much above 10 per cent, and some baulk at moving above 6 per cent. If demand from them for gilts really has peaked, then the Bank may have to rely increasingly on overseas investors to buy up its stocks.</p>

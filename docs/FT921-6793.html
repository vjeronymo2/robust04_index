			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finnish farmers fear the CAP will not fit - Robert Taylor examines the problems posed by the prospect of EC membership THE FUTURE of Finnish agriculture looks like the only serious obstacle standing in the way of successful negotiations to take Finland into membership of the European Community. Tomorrow the centre-right coalition cabinet is expected to agree on making a formal entry application and after a debate and vote in Parliament this will be forwarded to Brussels by the middle of next month. But Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, as leader of the rurally-based Centre party is well aware of the deep anxieties among many Finnish farmers, especially in the north and central areas of the country, who fear they may lose their livelihoods if Finland adopts the EC's common agricultural policy. In fact, his Centre party is split badly over the EC issue. Concern about agriculture is shared by other politicians. President Mauno Koivisto in his opening address to the new session of parliament nearly a fortnight ago drew public attention to the need for Finnish farmers to receive some special treatment if the country joins the EC. 'It is important for Finland that rural areas remain settled and agriculture viable,' he told MPs. He added, however: 'Successful pursuit of these ends may be easier in a European framework than alone with our own resources'. 'We have to make a big reform in agriculture,' admits Mr Pertti Salolainen, the trade minister and leader of Finland's Conservative party. 'The aim must be to maintain self-sufficiency but get rid of export subsidies and surpluses by moving to a lower level of production. However we will need quite a long transition period in the EC for our agriculture to adapt, perhaps at least 10 years.' Finland's still influential Central Union of Agricultural Producers - the main lobbying force of the farming community - is already campaigning openly against the idea of the country's EC membership. 'As the backbone of thriving rural communities agriculture with forestry is a vital part of Finnish economic life,' explains Mr Heikki Haavisto, the organisation's chairman. It must be admitted that only an estimated 8 per cent of the land surface of Finland is suitable for arable farming and agriculture accounts for only 3.9 per cent of the country's gross domestic product and 7 per cent of the workforce - about 170,000 out of 2.5m. But the small size of the sector does not mean that Finns who do not earn their living from the land are ready to see agriculture sacrificed as the price for EC membership. Indeed, the farmers are able to tap a strong sense of nationhood that lies deep in the Finnish psyche. It is no trivial point that the heroes of Finland's winter war of 1939-1940 against the Soviet Union were rewarded for their bravery with portions of land. 'The countryside is an essential part of our national identity and cultural heritage,' asserts Mr Haavisto. In the words of a recent publication from Finland's agricultural information centre: 'Finnish national character is based on a close relationship with the surrounding natural environment and wilds - some might even say we come from the woods. Ancient folklore embodied a mythical relationship between the earth and the forest. Finns live on the borderline between east and west, between field and forest'. The experience of the second world war, when Finland was forced to fight for its own survival alone, strengthened belief in the need for food self-sufficiency and parity in development between the incomes of farmers and wage earners. In the far northern parts of the country Finland's farming difficulties are exarcerbated by low temperatures and an annual growing season of only about 175 days. This has helped to ensure that agriculture is well supported through an elaborate regime of stringent import quotas, even on fruit like oranges and bananas that cannot grow in Finland, as well as export subsidies to bridge the gap between world market prices and domestic producer prices. The expense of all this for the Finnish taxpayer is considerable. Agricultural support amounts to over 4 per cent of the country's gross domestic product and subsidies add up to an estimated FM1,500 (Pounds 190) per head of population. In 1990 the ratio of the producer subsidy equivalent to the value of agricultural output was 73 per cent, compared with 78 per cent in Norway and 77 per cent in Switzerland but an average of only 47 per cent in the EC. At the same time producer prices in Finland are higher than almost anywhere else in the world and twice the EC average. Yet farming is hardly a lucrative business in Finland, which is a country of small farms. The average size is 14 hectares (34 acres) and nearly 60 per cent have under 10 hectares of arable land. The farmers, whose average age is 55, eke out a living almost like an endangered species. 'We simply cannot compete with central European agriculture in the production and sale of milk, meat and cereals,' admits Mr Aho's chief policy adviser. 'Finland has too many small farmers in the far north producing too much,' says Mr Haavisto at the agricultural producers association. In a free market for farm produce like the EC Finnish farmers would find it hard to survive as food prices in the country would fall dramatically to EC levels that are only half those in Finland. 'We agree with the principles and objectives laid down in the Treaty of Rome on agriculture. That is all we want too. We are not asking for anything new but an agreement where the common agricultural policy can be implemented in Finland. Every time a new state has joined the EC the policy has been adjusted,' argues Mr Aho's adviser. A recent study of the pros and cons of EC membership for the Finnish economy commissioned by the government pointed out that agriculture ought to benefit from the EC's regional support policies and that Spain and Portugal were able to negotiate adjustment periods in their EC entry terms of 10 years. Finland will be a net contributor of about FM6bn to the EC budget as an affluent society with a strong industrial and service base. But the policy-makers are convinced that Brussels will recognise the special needs of Finnish agriculture. 'The EC may not be life and death for our farmers but it will bring major structural changes,' admits Mr Aho's adviser. Whether Finland is in or out of the EC the country's farming is expected to contract severely in the 1990s, with the number of farms halving over the next eight years. At the moment EC membership may seem the biggest threat to Finnish farmers, but the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's liberalising Uruguay round looks even more alarming. The country's days of isolationist self-sufficiency are drawing to a close whatever happens.</p>

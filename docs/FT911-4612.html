			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Bush meeting with Dalai Lama risks Chinese anger PRESIDENT George Bush has held a meeting in Washington with the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of 6m Tibetans, risking an angry reaction from Peking. The Tibetan leader, forced to leave his homeland by China in 1959, has frequently had meetings with members of the US Congress which has voted over the years against Chinese actions in Tibet, but his first meeting with President Bush was politically significant. The White House attempted to play down the meeting held at the White House on Tuesday evening. Reporters and photographers were not allowed to record the start of the meeting, as is customary, and no details of the talks were released. After the meeting, the Dalai Lama expressed satisfaction with the visit, and warned that China had escalated its suppressions of Tibet. He said he found President Bush to be a man of 'warm, human feelings.' Since the US and China normalised relations more than a decade ago, the White House has snubbed the Dalai Lama on previous visits. US-Chinese relations are now under strain because of reported arms sales by Peking to the Middle East and the possibility Washington may withdraw most favoured nation trading status for Chinese exports. The Chinese government has protested at the meeting, but the Dalai Lama's supporters portrayed it as a shift from the President's previous policy of appeasing China by remaining silent on Tibet. For several weeks the media in Peking has been carrying almost daily stories on what is officially known as the 'peaceful liberation' of Tibet. In the run-up to the 40th anniversary on May 23 of the 'liberation,' which Tibetans regard as an occupation of their country, tension is reported to be mounting in the capital, Lhasa, where the Chinese army has applied tough repressive measures. Tibetan resentment against Chinese plans to erect a 70m high monument in Lhasa to mark their rule over Tibet, and for a major celebration on the anniversary day, threaten to lead to outbreaks of violence those who feel there is only cause for sorrow. President Bush's meeting with the Dalai Lama contrasts sharply with the refusal of Mr Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, to see the Tibetan spiritual leader on his visit to the UK last month.</p>

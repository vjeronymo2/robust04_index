In the midst of  a prolonged business slump, judging even from past examples, we  will encounter the real severity in the unemployment rate after  this.    With hopes that the slump would bottom out also proving  futile, and GNP for the April-June quarter being the second  quarter of negative growth following the July-September 1992  quarter period, prolongation of the bubble-burst recession  became clear. Along with that, apprehension has spread that the  employment situation will worsen after this, so interest in the  trend of the unemployment rate has begun to grow.    In the initial phase of the recession a period of 2.1  percent  unemployment continued for some time, but beginning about one  year ago, the unemployment rate gradually rose and in July  1993 has become 2.5 percent.    Since the unemployment rate did not increase for a long  time,  it seems likely that we are in a situation in which a view will  spread that Japan's statistics on unemployment are not grasping  the real situation. But before dismissing it as just a problem  of statistics, we should take into account fully the actual  situation of the labor market which lies behind the unemployment  rate. Otherwise, it will be impossible to foresee accurately the  development of the future employment situation that will  accompany prolongation of the recession.  <H5>  The Bubble Reserve </H5>   If we follow the economic white paper for the current fiscal  year and say that the high point of the last period of  prosperity was the April-June quarter of 1991, the unemployment  rate progressed at the same level of 2.1 percent for one year  after that. It began to rise in July-September 1992, five  quarters later.    In past recessionary phases, changes in the unemployment  rate  were such that, generally the rise in the unemployment rate has  been slow in the first half of the recession, and the tempo of  the rise has quickened as it approached the business trough of  the second half. Yet, for the unemployment rate to not rise at  all for one year, as happened this time, is a rare phenomenon  even in past recessions. But it is not completely without  precedent; the situation in the recession following the "Izanagi  boom" of October 1965 to July 1970 resembled this time.    The way in which Japanese companies promote employment  adjustment affects deeply the fact that the tempo of  unemployment-rate increase quickens in the latter half of a  recession. In the initial stage of a recession, companies mainly  promote reductions in overtime, and as the recession advances  further, they gradually begin to reduce employment. Here, too,  they begin with temporary and part-time employees, and finally  adjust regular employment when the recession has become fairly  severe. Therefore, it means that generation of jobless persons,  which raises the unemployment rate, is concentrated in the  latter half of a recession.    The question is the reason which has particularly delayed  the  rise in the unemployment rate this time. It seems that the  greatest reason is found in the labor market during the bubble  period of prosperity.    In the bubble period of prosperity, the effective job offer  ratio rose to 1.4 times that during the Izanagi boom. In a  complete change from what had been the case up till then,  companies were forced to go to considerable trouble to secure  employees. Therefore, memories of that trouble probably did not  fade easily even when they entered a slump. Furthermore, there  are also limitations on labor supply for the medium to long  term. It seems that this kind of situation caused them to hold  back for some time on adjustment of employees. The high level of  company revenue stored up in the bubble period of prosperity  also made such holding back possible.    The unemployment rate turned upward from the July-September  1992 quarter, and, although the rate of increase in the  unemployment rate did not reach that of the recession following  the first oil crisis, it has approached that of the latter half  of the slump following the second oil crisist and returned to  the ordinary rise in the unemployment rate during a slump. This  indicates that accompanying the lengthening of the recession, a  change has begun to occur in companies' heretofore cautious  posture toward employment.  <H5>  The Japanese and U.S. Definitions Are About the Same </H5>   Next, let us turn to the question of unemployment  statistics.  The view that Japan's unemployment statistics do not grasp the  situation of the labor market accurately has been repeated every  time up till now that a slump has occurred. At its root is a  perception, regarding the level of Japan's unemployment being  markedly lower than that of Europe and the United States and  the rise in the unemployment rate during recessions being too  low, that the real situation is not so. Until now the assertion  has often appeared that if one looked at Japan's unemployment  rate by U.S. criteria, it would be twice what it is at present.    It was conventional wisdom that by nature Japan's definition  of an unemployed person was strict, and that the unemployment  rate had become less than in Europe and the United States for  that reason.    But that was not something based on a strict comparison.  Beginning about 1980, after the Statistics Bureau of the  Management and Coordination Agency began to use the kind of  research that makes it possible to change over to U.S.  definition of an unemployed person, quantitative comparison of  Japan's unemployment rate with those of Europe and the United  States became possible. At about that time, based on the results  of that research, I made a preliminary calculation of Japan's  unemployment rate based on the U.S. definition of an unemployed  person. As a result of that, it became clear that the  unemployment rate was at about the same level by Japan's  definition and by the U.S. definition.    The unemployed of Japan's definition are persons 1) among  those who have not done work accompanied by income during the  week of the survey (1 week) and are capable of working, who 2)  actively sought employment in the week of the survey (1 week),  or 3) actively sought employment in the past and are awaiting  the results of that activity.    The U.S. unemployed are persons 1) among those who have not  done work accompanied by income during the week of the survey (1  week) and are capable of working, who 2) actively sought  employment during the past four weeks including the week of the  survey, or 3) have been laid off and are awaiting a return to  work, or 4) have employment arranged to begin within 30 days.    What differs in Japan and the United States is that the  period in which employment is sought in item 2 is short in  Japan, at 1 week, but in the United States it is the past four  weeks, as well as Japan's item 3 and U.S. items 3 and 4.  Japan's item 3 and U.S. items 3 and 4 are all ones that are  included as exceptions in the unemployed by removing the  condition of seeking employment in 2.    Next, based on a February 1993 special labor force survey, I  will make a preliminary calculation of the number of unemployed  according to the U.S. definition. The number of unemployed at  that point in time was 1.57 million, and the unemployment rate  was 2.4 percent.    First, of those in Japan's item 3, we exclude 360,000  persons  who did not seek employment in the last four weeks, and next we  add to the unemployed the non-labor force population other than  those unemployed by the Japanese definition: 120,000 who sought  employment in the last four weeks and 190,000 who had arranged  for employment to begin within 30 days. In regard to U.S. item  3, since Japan has no system of layoffs, we do not adjust it.  The result is that the number of unemployed by the U.S.  definition comes to 1.52 million, and the unemployment rate  comes to 2.4 percent.    Thus, the difference between the Japanese definition and the  U.S. definition is small. But if we look at it separately by  sex, the unemployment rate for females comes out to be higher by  the U.S. definition because it extends the period during which  employment is sought.    In Europe, especially in England, France, and Germany, they  publish unemployment rates based on the number of persons  seeking employment who are registered at employment offices.  Therefore, it is difficult, as it stands, to compare with such  countries as Japan and the United States, which publish the  unemployment rate based on sample surveys.    However, the EC has recently begun to conduct an annual  survey that employs the same definition of the unemployed as the  United States, so comparison with the EC has become easy. The  unemployment rate in that EC survey, for 1991, comes to 7  percent for England, 9 percent for France, and 4 percent for  Germany, considerably higher than Japan. Furthermore, the U.S.  unemployment rate at that time was 7 percent.  <H5>  Cyclical Factors and Structural Factors </H5>   It is possible to view the unemployment rate by dividing it  into the part that fluctuates in response to poor or good  business conditions and the part that is not influenced by  changes in business conditions. The unemployment rate that  fluctuates with business conditions is called the  insufficient-demand unemployment rate, or the cyclical  unemployment rate. On the other hand, the unemployment rate that  is not influenced by fluctuations in business conditions is  called the structural unemployment rate, the balanced  unemployment rate, the full-employment unemployment rate, or the  natural unemployment rate.    The way of referring to them varies because the respective  definitions differ depending on economic theory and unemployment  theory. The difference between the Japanese unemployment rate  and those of Europe and the United States is found mainly in the  part of the unemployment rate that is not influenced by  fluctuations in business conditions.    The FY92 White Paper on the World Economy presented the  results of an estimate which divided the unemployment rate of  Europe and the United States into a cyclical unemployment rate  and a structural unemployment rate. Therefore, applying this, we  shall advance our discussion of the cyclical unemployment rate  and the structural unemployment rate.    According to the cyclical unemployment rate, Germany is 0.7  percent, England and France are 1.7 percent, and the United  States is 3.8 percent; therefore, Germany is low and the United  States is high. Japan is closer to Germany.    The level of the cyclical unemployment rate depends on the  method of employment adjustment. If, as in Japan, one adopts an  employment-adjustment method which emphasizes reduction of  working hours, the cyclical unemployment rate is low. Germany,  too, seems to have a system of shortening working hours, and  it can be seen that adjustment of working hours is carried out.    In contrast to this, because of the diffusion of the layoff  system, emphasis in the United States is placed on adjustment of  employees rather than on reduction of working hours, so the  cyclical unemployment rate seems to have become high.    Concerning the structural unemployment rate, the United  States is 3.3 percent, England is 7.3 percent, France is 7.5  percent, and Germany is 7.7 percent, so it is high in each  country of Europe and the United States. Japan is on the level  of 2 percent, lower than Europe and the United States.    The level of the structural unemployment rate depends on the  supply and demand adjustment in the labor market. If the labor  market's performance is good, the structural unemployment rate  is low, as in Japan. In recent years, in the midst of  internationalization and the advance of technological  innovation, every nation has been exposed to structural changes  in the demand for manpower. If the supply side's response to  structural changes in demand is unsuccessful, the structural  unemployment rate continues to climb.    However long one might wait, there is no hope for recovery  in  demand for types of occupation for which there has been a  structural decline in demand. Workers in such occupations must  acquire new occupational skills and transfer to occupations for  which demand is increasing. If they cannot do that, the workers  will continue to be out of work.    Japanese companies educate and train workers in-house and  are  carrying out employment management that emphasizes making the  best use of staff within the company; therefore, in response to  structural changes in demand, adjustment of supply and demand is  first attempted by assignment changes within the company or the  enterprise group. Then, when it becomes difficult by internal  adjustment alone, it is for the first time left to adjustment of  the market outside the company. That is, in Japan a worker's  change of occupation is promoted in an in-house labor market, so  generation of the structurally unemployed is restrained there.    In contrast to this, in Europe and the United States an  in-house labor market is not functioning as it is in Japan, so  the response to structural changes depends directly on  adjustment of supply and demand in the external labor market.  That apparently invites increases in the structurally  unemployed.    Of course, all sorts of factors have influenced the  difference in the structural unemployment rate between Japan  and Europe and the United States, but it is thought that, among  them, the difference of using an in-house labor market accounts  for considerable weight.    Even in Japan, the rigorous employment adjustment of  dismissals and inviting voluntary retirement was carried out  after the first oil crisis. Therefore, from the 1970's into the  1980's, the unemployment rate at the peak time of business  conditions rose, and the structural employment rate became  higher, albeit slightly, than that of Europe and the United  States.  <H5>  It Is Necessary From a Long-Term Perspective, But... </H5>   The current recession is about to become as long as the one  after the second oil crisis, which, at three years, was the  longest in recent years. In past recessions, the unemployment  rate remained high even after business conditions had passed  their low point and turned to an expansionary phase, taking  some time before the unemployment rate fell. Furthermore, after  the first oil crisis, the unemployment rate continued to rise  even in an expansionary phase. This is because, although  generation of new unemployment declined along with the recovery  of business, the unemployed who did not find new positions  remained unemployed for some time even after the low point in  business conditions passed. From such experiences in the past,  we feel that the unemployment problem would become more severe  in the future.    Moreover, in the current recession, the production index for  manufacturing industries is recently showing its greatest  decline, if one excludes the slump following the first oil  crisis, which was the greatest since World War II.  Notwithstanding that in the initial phase of the recession,  companies refrained from adjustment of employed personnel, the  bill for that would come due after this.    With the strong yen and the cold summer, companies are  revising downward by a wide margin their estimates of future  demand, and are intensifying measures toward employment  adjustment. Lately, newspapers almost every day carry articles  about companies implementing employment adjustment and  suspending for the next fiscal year the hiring of new graduates.    Just a little while ago, managers were howling about the  difficulty of securing workers. Those managers are now  struggling to adjust employment. What a bewildering change.    Even if they can weather the current crisis by implementing  employment adjustment, in terms of the future, it will for the  most part come out to be a loss in the aspect of securing  manpower. Accompanying the advent of an aging society, the Japan  of the future is about to become a society in which the size of  the working population will continue to decline. Do not managers  need a viewpoint that is fixed on that kind of future?    At present it is important to prevent greater deterioration  of the unemployment situation. In order to do that, it is  necessary that business conditions recover as soon as  possible, and company managers have a bright outlook.    Japan's unemployment rate is low and is not sensitive to  business conditions. But as we have seen so far, important  information for grasping movements in the employment situation  is contained in the fluctuations of the unemployment rate. It  seems that making use of this in judging the employment  situation is precisely what is important.</p>

Congress also declared that the development and maintenance of such knowledge and expertise ``depends upon the national capability for advanced research by highly trained and experienced specialists, available for service in and out of Government.'' The program provides financial support for advanced research, training and other related functions on the countries of the region. By strengthening and sustaining in the United States a cadre of experts on Eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union, the program contributes to the overall objectives of the FREEDOM Support and SEED programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The full purpose of the Act and the eligibility requirements are set forth in Pub.

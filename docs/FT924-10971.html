			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / US economy There is less to third-quarter US growth figures than meets the eye. The 2.6 per cent annual growth rate is arresting, but there are few reasons to suppose that the US economy is about to take off. A healthy increase in consumer spending during the quarter was paid for out of savings rather than increased earnings. The markets also take a jaundiced view of trade statistics in the week before the presidential election. On balance, the current growth estimate is more likely to be revised down than up. By the time that happens, the figures may seem like ancient history. If Bill Clinton wins next week, attention will be focused on what kind of fiscal measures he will use to stimulate the economy, and what the Federal Reserve's response will be. Even if Mr Clinton decides on a substantial package, though, it will be the second half of 1993 before it has much impact. Given renewed economic weakness, the Fed may decide it cannot wait that long.</p>

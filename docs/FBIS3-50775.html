The event occurred on Wednesday morning when the peasant  leaders were taken away in a military Jeep in Chiapas State,  where a guerrilla uprising against the government has been under  way for six days.    Jorge Luna, Central's spokesman, deplored the fact that the  minister failed to establish guarantees for the dialogue he  summoned, adding that the "government has lost control over the  Army," which is "deciding what should be done in the area  involved in the conflict."    Luna issued an appeal to prevent a massacre of peasants and  Indians and held the government responsible for the "tragedy  that afflicts our state and our comrades' safety.    Moreover, 11 organizations that make up the Permanent  Agrarian Congress condemned the arrests and sent a document to  Mexican President Carlos Salinas demanding a political rather  than a military solution to the conflict and urging the rebels  to put down their weapons.    According to the Congress, the ownership of land in Chiapas  represents an essential factor for peace and social justice.</p>

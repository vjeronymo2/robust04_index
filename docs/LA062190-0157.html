			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PIRATES REEL AS EXPOS, METS, PHILLIES MAKE UP GROUND IN THE EAST  </P> <P> Just two weeks ago Manager Jim Leyland and his Pittsburgh Pirates had a solid  lead in the National League East.  </P> <P> Maybe even more important, there were no signs the team Leyland feared most,  the New York Mets, who had made a managerial change, were ready to wake up.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the Pirates appear to be in deep trouble.  </P> <P> When journeyman left-hander Bruce Ruffin (5-6) stopped them cold Wednesday at  Philadelphia, and the Phillies rolled to a 7-2 victory, the situation became  serious.  </P> <P> The Montreal Expos are only 1 1/2 games behind the Pirates, the sizzling Mets  and the surprising Phillies are only four games behind and Pittsburgh pitcher  Bob Walk is out at least 15 days with a groin injury.  </P> <P> Ruffin, who came into this season with a 32-38 record, pitched his second solid  game in a row. He gave up five hits and both runs in eight innings. Len Dykstra  led the Phillie attack. He was two for three to raise his major league-leading  average to .384. He scored three runs.  </P> <P> "We stink," the angry Leyland said. "Ruffin pitched good, but we stink.  </P> <P> "We're not hitting, the pitching isn't very good and we're playing sloppy  defense. We can't hold onto the lead playing that way."  </P> <P> Bobby Bonilla provided the only Pirate punch. He hit his 16th home run and a  double, scoring both runs.  </P> <P> New York 6, St. Louis 3 -- Kevin McReynolds hit a three-run home run in the  first inning. The Mets have hit home runs in eight consecutive games and have  cut the Pirates' lead from 9 1/2 games to four since June 7.  </P> <P> The Cardinal players called a clubhouse meeting that lasted 25 minutes after  the game.  </P> <P> "The players closed the doors," Manager Whitey Herzog said. "I had nothing to  do with it. We still aren't hitting and we're making bad pitches."  </P> <P> Vince Coleman stole two bases for the Cardinals and is 56 for 56 against the  Mets.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 9, Atlanta 8 -- Billy Hatcher singled in the winning run in the 10th  inning at Atlanta to give the Reds their seventh victory in the last eight  games and an 8 1/2-game lead in the West.  </P> <P> The Reds scored a run in each of the last three innings to come from behind.  </P> <P> Mariano Duncan walked, was sacrificed to second and scored on Hatcher's hit.  </P> <P> Montreal 3, Chicago 2 -- The Expos had only three hits and trailed, 2-0, at  Montreal when Larry Walker appeared to strike out to end the seventh inning.  But catcher Joe Girardi missed the pitch, the Expos rallied for three runs and  Greg Maddux was a tough loser. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

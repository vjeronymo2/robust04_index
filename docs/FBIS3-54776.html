			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A BELINFORM correspondent has been told at the  Defense Ministry press center that the second stage of reform in  the Belarusian Armed Forces will be carried out in 1994. There  will be further reductions in the personnel of the former  Belarusian Military District, which had numbered 250,000 troops  at the beginning of the reform process. Supporting such a force  was beyond the capabilities of the Republic's budget. In  addition, the country's new military doctrine stipulates the  forming of a nonnuclear force sufficient to protect the national  sovereignty of Belarus. By the end of 1994, troop strength in  the Belarusian Army will have fallen to 100,000.</p>

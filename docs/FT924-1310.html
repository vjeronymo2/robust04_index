			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pepsi wins battle with Perrier PEPSICO, the US soft drinks group, has won its long-running battle to reclaim control of the marketing and distribution of its brand in France from Perrier, the French mineral water company recently taken over by Nestle of Switzerland. The battle between Pepsi and Perrier began three years ago when Pepsi sought to rescind the contract struck in 1962 which gave the mineral water company full control over the production, bottling and sales of Pepsi-Cola in the French market. Perrier started a legal fight to try to prevent Pepsi from ending the contract. However, Pepsi claimed it needed to regain control of its brand in France because Perrier was not managing it properly. Pepsi said its volume share of the French market had fallen from 17 per cent to 7 per cent over the past 10 years. The companies yesterday announced an agreement whereby Pepsi will regain the rights over marketing and distribution, but Perrier will continue to produce and bottle Pepsi-Cola in France. Pepsi recently struck similar deals in Spain and Germany although it stressed that it would not pursue the same strategy in every country and that marketing and distribution would continue to be organised according to the different requirements of individual markets. Meanwhile, Nestle has closed the final chapter in the Perrier takeover by taking full control of Demilac, the investment vehicle through which it orchestrated the bid last spring. This involved Nestle buying the 50 per cent of Demilac owned by Indosuez, the French bank that partnered it in the bid, for an undisclosed sum.</p>

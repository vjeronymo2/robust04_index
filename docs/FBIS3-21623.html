According to information obtained, the government has  instructed the National Coca Control Directorate (DINACO) and  the Coca Eradication Directorate (DIRECO) to fulfill the plan to  eradicate all surplus coca plantations by 31 March "with or  without dialogue."    Jorge Martinez, coordinator of the five federations, voiced  his "deep concern" over the fact that government authorities  "have given this order but they do not want to dialogue because  since January they have repeatedly suspended scheduled meetings.  They promised an answer in writing but have failed to give it."    Martinez asserted: "We are certain that the government is  seeking to justify the compulsory eradication of coca  plantations." He said that in view of this, the latest  emergency meeting held in Ivirgazama decided to declare coca  growers in a state of alert and mobilization.    He added: "We are organized," adding that the committees for  the defense of coca leaf production in labor organizations and  unions "are already alert." He said they have decided to  suspend the voluntary eradication "in response to the  government's lack of interest."    The leader added that "although the government is making fun  of us" they will wait until 16 February for the announced  meeting to take place, even though DIRECO "constantly threatens  and pressures us."    Martinez charges that members of the Victor Ustariz Regiment  and of the Special Forces Training Center (CITE) will enter the  tropical zone to carry out maneuvers, but they believe "it is  part of the plan to use force to eradicate the coca plantations."    In the face of this, he warned that coca growers will begin  a  hunger strike because they do not have the means to face the  military men. He added: "There is a very tense atmosphere, there  is fear that clashes will take place. This is, seemingly, what  the gringos want to justify the intervention."    Martinez recalled that coca growers proposed amending  Supreme  Decree No. 23668 which eliminated the participation of the  peasants as established by Supreme Decree No. 22270. "Now the  government ministry is in charge of promoting development in  Chapare and this is not right. We have made concrete proposals  but have not received any answer."    Martinez added that if the authorities in charge of handling  coca producer affairs do not answer, they will request an  audience with the president of the Republic to whom they will  explain their problems "within the framework of the people's  participation plan he always talks about."</p>

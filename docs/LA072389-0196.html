			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERIORS ;  </P> <P> REARRANGE ITEMS FOR A FRESH, REDECORATED LOOK;  </P> <P> A FEW INEXPENSIVE TOUCHES CAN MAKE A TIRED INTERIOR LOOK NEW, DIFFERENT.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Howard, national president of the American Society of Interior  Designers, understands that many of us live with limited decorating budgets,  have an affinity for clutter and a passion for collecting "interesting little  objects."  </P> <P> Like most interior designers, this Honolulu professional loves "big ticket"  decorating -- splendid Hawaiian homes, luxurious clubs or hotels such as the  Hana-Maui. But she also knows how to tame clutter and how to make the best of  budget decorating.  </P> <P> Her own home is an example. "Twelve years ago I bought an ordinary 1937 tract  house with two bedrooms and one bathroom, and a view of Diamond Head from the  deck." It works well for one person, and "I love everything in it, especially  those things that remind me of the 17 places I lived while I was growing up. My  father was in the military, so we moved often.  </P> <P> "I love all those craft items and silly things that I have picked up in my  travels and all those gifts from friends I have met along the way," she says.  "I like having them out where I can enjoy them all together."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moved the Furniture  </P> <P> Recently, she felt the urge to do a little redecorating. So, she lightened the  color of the carpet, re-upholstered some of the chairs and sofas, and moved a  lot of furniture around. Some pieces she moved to other rooms, where they  suddenly looked new and different to her.  </P> <P> "Then," she says, "I took everything off my shelves and tables and put the  whole lot in the middle of the room, and started putting it back together in an  entirely new way."  </P> <P> By the time she finished, "it all looked fresh . . . and I had rediscovered a  lot of old friends among my possessions. This little exercise in rearrangement  costs no money, just a day of time to work things over and reassess them. I  retire some things for awhile and even throw or give some away. And of course I  add new things from time to time."  </P> <P> Our homes need change to be kept stimulating and interesting, she says. "So why  shouldn't we move things around and gather them together in new ways?"  </P> <P> Last year she decorated an $88,000 "affordable" starter house at the annual  Parade of Homes sponsored by the Honolulu Board of Realtors. Since the rule of  thumb is that a homeowner can spend between 5% and 10% of a home's purchase  price for interior furnishings and decoration, her budget ran between $6,000  and $7,000, retail.  </P> <P> "I put that house together exactly like the move-in family might do it," she  recalls. "I went to retail stores, hardware stores and shopped the Conran's  mail-order catalogue. I went to store sales where I found dining chairs for $39  each and close-out fabric for $1 a yard, and visited Salvation Army stores and  went to swap meets."  </P> <P> She turned a galvanized garbage can upside down to use for the base of the  glass-topped dining table and hung up sheets of shiny aluminum Mylar on walls  she couldn't afford to mirror.  </P> <P> "What I proved," she says, "was that style doesn't have to be expensive. The  job was a creative challenge to me, but the point I most wanted to make was  that young families with limited funds have the option of engaging the counsel  of a qualified interior designer, and then doing the shopping themselves. In  this case, I acted as both the consultant designer and the budget-bound  client."  </P> <P> Many interior designers today, she emphasizes, have hourly or daily  consultation fees which can provide people with a basic color scheme, a room  layout plan, and general guidance on the right scale and appropriateness of  things to be purchased.  </P> <P> Hourly fees for this type of advice usually range from $25 to $100 an hour,  with a national average among interior designers of $70 per hour.  </P> <P> She advises people who opt for this consultation to do a lot of homework first:  Think through their life style needs and their likes and dislikes on color,  pattern, and style.  </P> <P> "Once they have made all these determinations and have a concrete plan in  hand," says Howard, most couples -- or singles -- can bring rooms together that  have "a really cohesive look."  </P> <P> As president of the 28,000-member interior designers society, Howard attends  conferences, markets and meetings promoting the interests of interior  designers. She is nurturing local-chapter projects that involve making homeless  shelters more liveable and attractive, and setting up programs in leadership  training and management skills.  </P> <P> "I feel we have to give back to our organizations and to society as a matter of  personal growth and education," she says.  </P> <P> "I also tell interior designers that volunteerism can translate into more and  better business."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Affairs and Security Committee of the  Latvian Cabinet of Ministers today approved an interim agreement  between the Latvian and Russian Governments on travel from  Latvia to Russia, and return to places of permanent residence in  Latvia of citizens of the former USSR who are neither citizens  of Latvia nor citizens of Russia nor citizens of a third  country. According to the interim agreement, the  above-mentioned people will be able to travel to Russia without  visas and return to Latvia showing documents stating their  identity. The passport of the former USSR, which has an entry  in it about a person's place of permanent residence in Latvia,  will ensure visa-free return to Latvia.    Apart from this, the Committee also approved an agreement  between Latvia and Russia on the work of border representatives,  which envisages nomination of plenipotentiary representatives of  the two states for settling incidents that have occurred on the  border and for tackling problems related to the border. The  agreement provides that each side nominates one plenipotentiary  border representative and two deputies, who will consider  problems arising on the border at conferences after a proposal  from either side.</p>

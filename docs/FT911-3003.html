			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Liquidity pours in as US investors believe the worst is over / Equities 'WOW, WHAT a Quarter]' screamed the headline on Barron's, the US business weekly. It summed up Wall Street's reaction to the performance of US stocks in the first three months of 1991. Between New Year and the end of March, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10.6 per cent, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 13.6 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks a record 29 per cent. The main driving-force behind soaring stock values was an injection of liquidity into the market at the start of the year. In the face of recession at home, imminent war in the Gulf, declining corporate profitability and a banking crisis, institutional and individual investors decided that the time was right to put their money back into equities. The reason: they felt things couldn't get any worse, that the bottom of the recession was near, and that interest rates - already on their way down - would continue to fall. Money poured into the market from institutions, but especially from the big investment funds, which benefited from an inflow of Dollars 3.1bn of private investors' money during February alone. The biggest winners were secondary stocks, perceived by investors to be undervalued and offering the best earnings potential, and the Nasdaq market, which saw average daily volume jump to a record 161m. Medical and bio-technology stocks led the way, while on the Big Board financial stocks shone. Yet the market's ride has not been uniformly smooth. The year opened badly as worries about the approaching quarterly corporate reporting season and the effect of war on the economy sparked a 130-point decline in the first two weeks. The onset of hostilities in the Middle East changed everything. The Dow rose nearly 400 points on a wave of patriotic buying. The war and recession were seen to have been discounted by the market, which was looking forward six months to a period of peace and economic growth. At the beginning of March, prices retreated on inflation worries, profit-taking and some disturbing employment figures. The bulls returned, however, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to stimulate economic activity. Yet the quarter had one nasty shock left up its sleeve: an unexpected profits warning from IBM in late March, which sent the Dow spinning 60 points lower. However, the market's resilience since then, spurred by the first signs of a recovery in consumer confidence, has persuaded Wall Street that the rise in stocks since January has not been a bear market rally, but the beginning of a fully-fledged bull market. As for the second quarter, the opening days of April could give us a clue as to what to expect. The Dow jumped 63 points one day, and dropped 18 points the next. As the economy slowly chugs into life, analysts expect shares to keep going up, but not in a straight line. In Canada, the picture was similar to that seen in the US; the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index rose 7.3 per cent during the quarter, with smaller capitalised stocks making up good ground. In Mexico, the strong market showing at the end of last year was maintained during the first quarter of 1991. The Bolsa Index rose 35 per cent between January and March. According to DA Campbell, the US broking house which specialises in the Mexican mar ket, the gains have been fuelled by strong new demand from overseas investors, an economy growing at a rate of 5 per cent a year, a series of imminent privatisations, and anticipation of a more liberal regulatory climate. Much of the renewed interest in Mexico has been stimulated by the approaching flotation of the remaining shares of Telefonos de Mexico, which makes up 18 per cent of the Bolsa index. The government is planning a global offering of 25-30 per cent of the company, and demand for the stock in the first quarter boosted Telmex's share price by over 50 per cent.</p>

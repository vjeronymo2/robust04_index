			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / EU takes hard line on accession talks deadline The European Union was last night preparing to conclude talks with Sweden and Finland on EU entry by 1995, threatening to leave Austria and Norway to join later if they cannot meet the negotiating deadline of midnight tonight. Mr Alain Lamasourre, French European affairs minister, said: 'There comes a point at which you have to say no more bets, and the wheel stops turning.' At the same time, Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek current chairman of the EU Council of Ministers, warned the UK and Spain that they were jeopardising EU expansion by refusing to change the 12's weighted-majority voting rules to accommodate the newcomers. Mr Pangalos turned the screws on Austria and Norway, saying the union was sticking to the February 28 deadline for a deal to get the four candidates in by January next year. The deadline allows for only a little slippage if the European Parliament is to deliver its mandatory ratification before it submits itself for re-election this June. 'I think it's possible for a number of countries' to come in on the fast track, Mr Pangalos said, in a clear reference to Sweden and Finland, adding that 'those who don't make it will have to stay (negotiating) for the next parliament'. As negotiations among the 12 EU members and between them and the four applicants wore into the night, there was some prospect of an agreement today on an aid regime for highly subsidised Nordic and Alpine farmers. However, Mr Heikki Haavisto, Finnish foreign minister and farmers' leader, insisted that 'we have no reason to be optimistic'. Germany was chairing negotiations with Norway to try to break the impasse over Spanish demands for access to Norwegian fish - flatly refused by Oslo - and Norwegian demands for full and immediate access for its fish products within the EU - unacceptable to France and likely to be widely resisted unless Norway consents to contribute to the EU fisheries resources pool. Austria reported some progress on its demand that restrictions on EU trucks crossing its Alpine passes should stay for 10 more years. But it refuses to go along with the 12's plans for immediate alignment of farm prices to EU levels. 'For us this is a very big psychological problem,' one Austrian negotiator said. On the voting rules controversy, Mr Pangalos said the UK and Spain 'will take responsibility for the political failure of enlargement' if they continue to insist on no change in the so-called 'blocking minority'. At present, 23 votes out of 76 - normally meaning two large and one small member states - can block legislation in the Council of Ministers. If all four applicants enter, the 16 would share 90 votes, and a Benelux-inspired majority wants to maintain the balance between big and small EU club members by requiring 27 votes to block proposals. Talks broke off late last night and are to resume this morning. Pressure builds in EU entry talks, Page 3</p>

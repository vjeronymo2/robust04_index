			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 20 TASS -- If the presidential election  was to be held in Russia today, the two main contenders for the  top post would be current president Boris Yeltsin and  democrat-reformer Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. At least, such a  conclusion is indicated by the results of a survey conducted by  the independent polling company "Mnenie" (Opinion) among a  representative sample of four thousand people in 30 Russian  districts.    However, there is a large danger that the presidential  elections, if held today, would not be valid or would be an only  partly meaningful political exercise. Of those questioned, 38  percent said they did not trust any of the likely candidates,  and 18 percent are already planning to skip the elections  altogether.    Yeltsin proved that he is still considered the lesser of all  the evils, receiving 11.3 percent of the hypothetical votes. In  second place was Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" electoral  bloc, with nine percent.    Yeltsin received proportionately more support among citizens  over thirty years of age. The 18-29 age group pinned their  hopes for Russia's future more on the leader of the Yabloko  bloc, who received 9.5 percent of their votes, compared to  Yeltsin's 7.4 percent.    Yavlinskiy also appealed to the middle and upper classes.  13.7 percent of those with monthly salaries of 100,000 rubles  or more (50 U.S. dollars) supported Yavlinskiy, while 11.5  percent preferred Yeltsin. The president's support among  respondents with 50,000 or less rubles a month was 10.2 percent.    Ex-vice-president and opposition leader Aleksandr Rutskoy  gets most of his support from the countryside and small towns  (seven percent each), although Yeltsin had higher figures among  both types of rural dwellers. Extreme-nationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy did not get into the top three slots except among  country people, who gave him third place behind Yeltsin and  Rutskoy.</p>

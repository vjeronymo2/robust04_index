			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Letter From Sao Paulo: Charismatic crescendo If the Roman Catholic church cared to map its long and continuing decline in Brazil, it should begin by focusing on events in the country's highest security prison, Bangu 1, one Thursday before Christmas. Mr Jose Carlos Gregorio, known as the 'Fat One', the leader of Brazil's most dangerous drug trafficking group who is serving 25 years for assault, was baptised as an evangelical. 'The church is the light on the long road that from now on I want to follow,' Mr Gregorio told a somewhat startled press corps. Few in Brazil's Catholic majority will mourn his desertion to the Protestant flock. But his conversion, along with 10 cell-mates who together face 277 years in jail, shows the potency as well as the wide appeal of Brazil's rapidly growing charismatic churches. Brazil's lower-middle class, its growing number of very poor, as well as 'marginals' like Mr Gregorio, are increasingly looking to these movements to offer solutions to today's problems rather than a promise of a better life after death. 'The traditional Catholic and Protestant churches can't give explanations for the realities of today, they use symbols from Europe and explain poverty as predestiny or sin. New churches can explain things simply,' according to Mr Antonio Gouvea Mendonca, a leading religious studies professor in Sao Paulo. Last Sunday at the Assembleia de Deus (God's Assembly) church in central Sao Paulo, a packed congregation enjoyed two hours of singing and prayer before being whipped up into a crescendo of wailing and excitement by their leader, Brother Luke. A short man in a tightly fitting suit with a gold wristwatch glinting under a cuff, he only slowed the pace of the service twice, when seeking money and food. The church, a simple meeting hall with peeling paint and heavy overhead fans, needed nearly Dollars 2,000 to move to bigger premises. 'Who's going to contribute in full?' he thundered. He told a story about a member of the congregation who donated his last few cruzeiros to the fund, then found five times the amount in a pocket on the way home. 'Alleluia, gracas a deus,' cries of thanks echoed around the hall. Brother Luke also called for sacrifice. The church's 'kilo campaign', which involved members donating a kilo of a basic foodstuff to be distributed to the area's street people, had lost momentum, he said. In the run-up to Christmas he pledged a concerted effort to double the average food takings. 'Let's have a Christmas without hunger,' he called. 'Alleluia,' the audience responded. As his invocations got faster and louder, the tears started. The women started crying first, arms held aloft and trembling. Several of the audience started shaking and an old black woman crumpled into her pew. 'Luz,' she wailed, the Portuguese for light. Protestantism officially arrived in Brazil in 1810. Successive waves of immigrants from Germany and elsewhere in Europe established all the mainstream churches such as the Lutherans, Methodists and Presbyterians by the beginning of this century. According to Mr Mendonca's figures, which are conservative, these groups now account for 4m of Brazil's 150m population. But the Protestant 'explosion' did not take off until the 1950s during Brazil's rapid urbanisation. Waves of immigrants from the country's poor north-east moved to cities like Sao Paulo, where social pressures were often intense and work hard to find. They were attracted by churches which offered a sense of community and escape from daily troubles. Most of these churches are pentecostal. Although their roots were in the US, they are now wholly Brazilian and have adopted some of the mysticism of the country's African cults, still popular in the north. The churches vary greatly in their attention to conversion, hierarchy and dogma. But they share a common history of rapid growth. Their followers have increased from under 1m to 10m-11m in under 40 years, according to Mr Mendonca. The pentecostal 'God is Love' movement is just such a church. Founded in 1962 with an emphasis on spiritual healing, it now occupies a huge disused factory in a run-down area of central Sao Paulo. On the walls hang signs saying 'Seating for 10,220 only'. Six bookshops spread around the cavernous interior sell evangelical records and posters of the movement's founder, pastor David Miranda. During three daily services, a cross section of Brazil's sick, disadvantaged, unemployed and lonely shuffle amid the blocks of pews. The pastor, barely visible behind a glass screen, spends half the service bent double. Only his hand, waving frantically at times, is visible above a lectern. The language is often unintelligible. Several members of the congregation shake violently when the pastor starts chanting. One young man, unshaven and without shoes, is curled up in the corner of a pew, whispering. A middle-aged white woman, who would not give her name, agreed to talk about the church, but only outside its doors. She had come to Sao Paulo from a neighbouring state. After her husband left her for another woman, she started getting headaches and could not see for hours at a time. She visited several other charismatic churches, but claimed to have been 'cured' when she touched the stage of the 'God is Love' church. 'God helped me and now I must help others,' she said several times. She is not alone. Back in Bangu 1, Mr Gregorio left a similar message: 'I have joined Jesus and I am going to teach evangelism to my brothers in prison,' the former drug lord said.</p>

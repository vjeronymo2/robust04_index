			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Vladimir Lukin,  chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee for International  Affairs, thinks that Russia should "more closely coordinate" its  actions with Washington on the issue of a possible introduction  of sanctions against the DPRK.    This issue was discussed today at a closed session of the  Duma Committee for International Affairs. The DPRK's ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Russia participated in the  meeting.    Vladimir Lukin told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the  discussion showed that "the North Korean position is still not  quite clear." According to him, the DPRK "is either trying to  `bargain' for better conditions, or gain the time necessary to  conclude work on the creation of a nuclear weapon."</p>

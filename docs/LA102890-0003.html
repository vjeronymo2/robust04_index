			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> BRAHMS: Hungarian Dances. Staatskapelle Berlin conducted by Otmar Suitner.  Denon 81757 4597 2.  </P> <P> The liner notes state approvingly that "Suitner invariably conducts in an  orthodox manner without any hint of flashiness . . . " Fine for 16th-Century,  five-part motets maybe, but a strange thing to brag about in a recording of the  Hungarian Dances. Generally dense textures, wimpily projected dance rhythms,  sedate lyricism and a merely adequate orchestra combine to produce this utterly  ordinary and forgettable release. TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie slips from its all-time high THE LONDON stock market responded cautiously to yesterday's speech by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, to the annual conference of Britains's governing Conservative party. After moving uncertainly during the trading session, the FT-SE failed to hold an early gain to close 8.4 down at 3,092.4, abandoning both the 3,100 mark and the all-time high on the Footsie Index reached in the previous session. A calmer day in the stock index futures sector, together with a mixed bag of corporate trading statements took the heart out of the equity market. Early trading saw the Footsie bounce to 3,110.6 but the stock market then turned off as the bourses elsewhere in Europe showed unwillingness to extend the gains of the previous session. At the day's low the Footsie was down by about 12 points to the 3,088 area. But selling pressure was moderate and traders expressed little surprise at what was seen as a bout of profit-taking after a strong rise in UK equity prices The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which covers a wider range of equities than the Footise, also lacked support, closing 1.1 down at 3,470.5, still more than 40 points short of the all-time high reached at the end of August. But trading volume was lower in the market yesterday, with the Seaq volume total down to 572.1m shares from 697.4m on Wednesday. However, retail, or customer business, often regarded as the soundest guide to genuine investment activity, was worth Pounds 1.58bn on Wednesday. This total fully sustains the improvement in stock market activity which underpins the recovery in market indices over the past three months. Interest-related stocks, such as retail and consumer issues, lagged the market yesterday despite the hopes that the chancellor of the exchequer might soon sanction a cut in domestic interest rates. The stock market was also held back by renewed lack of support for the oil stocks as investors surveyed the prospect for crude oil prices following the easing of tensions in Russia. Losses in the blue chip oil stocks were mirrored by larger setbacks among some of the second line issues. With currency markets also quieter yesterday, the international blue chips traced a less certain path. Pharmaceutical shares moved either side of overnight quotations without attracting much activity. Profit-taking hung over the blue chip sectors as stock index futures played a less active role in the equity market. Political considerations continued to overhang the London stock market yesterday as the Conservative party conference unfolded in Blackpool, in the north of England. However, expectations of a cut in domestic interest rates have been largely postponed until the government budget, due in November. In the meantime, the political future for the Conservative government and for the prime minister, Mr John Major, remains a matter of uncertainty. Nikko Europe believes that the UK chancellor of the exchequer 'despite his protestations' may soon be able to justify an interest rate cut on other than political grounds, pointing out that the bullish outlook is premised on the the prospect of falling inflation nd short term interest rates across Europe.</p>

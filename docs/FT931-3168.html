			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Tory acclaim tempered by worries over deficit THE TOUGHEST budget for more than a decade was last night greeted by the government's supporters at Westminster with a mixture of weary resignation and dutiful applause. Backing among Conservative MPs for Mr Norman Lamont's decision to tackle the soaring budget deficit was matched by deep concern over the scale of the task facing the government in restoring its battered political authority. Cabinet colleagues said the chancellor's tough package - albeit with most of the pain deferred until next year - was designed to demonstrate that the Treasury had restored a grip on economic policy after last year's sterling debacle. But a scathing Commons attack by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, dispelled any illusions that it would bring short-term popularity. Mr Smith's comment that it was a 'shameful budget from a cynical party' was followed by the private admission of one minister that Mr Lamont had offered no more or less than an 'acknowledgement of the depressing reality'. As Conservative MPs digested the implications of a Pounds 1bn-a-week budget deficit and the blatant reversal of their election tax pledges, one instant judgment was that Mr Lamont had strengthened his hold on the chancellorship. With much of the content of the second budget in November pre-empted by yesterday's package, the consensus was that the pressure on the prime minister to reshuffle his cabinet in July had diminished. Mr Lamont chose also to underline his support among his party's Euro-sceptics with two deliberate references in his speech to his determination to keep Britain's social and tax policies out of the hands of Brussels. But Mr John Major's associates insisted that no decisions had been taken on the prospect or otherwise of cabinet changes, leaving the chancellor's fate dependent on the pace of economic recovery. Strong support for the measures in the Budget to help industry and the unemployed was coupled with relief on the Tory backbenches at the decision not to risk the fragile economic recovery by deferring tax increases until next year. Most thought the chancellor has struck the right balance between promoting economic growth now and persuading the financial markets that the government has a credible medium term programme to reduce the budget deficit. But enthusiasm for the decision to defer the extension of valued added tax, the increase in National Insurance contributions and the reduction in mortgage interest relief was tempered by concern over the medium term outlook. As ministers and Tory MPs studied the fine print they were hit by the realisation that two years of substantial tax increases will still leave a budget deficit of Pounds 30bn by the time of the next general election in 1997. Senior Whitehall officials sought to counter that by stressing that by putting large tax increases in place now the chancellor had left open the possibility of modest cuts in income tax in the approach to the election.</p>

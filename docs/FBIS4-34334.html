			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] The confiscation of the moneybags' [maceta] goods  and assets resulting from ill-gotten wealth is a coordinated and  effective effort being conducted by the General Attorney's  Office and its provincial and municipal branches to fight  corruption in our society. To conduct this systematic work,  prosecutors first make an inventory of the goods in the  possession of the person under investigation and check it  against real income. Those goods without official documentation  are held until the owner proves their legality. The Finance and  Prices Ministry is in charge of issuing confiscation papers and  transferring the goods to the state.    We will hear about the case of another one of these  moneybags  who resorted to illegal wealth to satisfy disproportionate  material cravings. Here is Enrique Valdez Machin, from the  Havana prosecutor's office, on implementing Decree-Law 149  against those who become wealthy through theft, embezzlement,  speculation, and other illegal activities:    [Begin Valdez recording] Havana prosecutors carried out a  search, according to the law, of the home of one of these  renowned moneybags and seized one fan, two ceiling fans, one air  conditioner, two digital clock-radios, two color televisions,  two refrigerators, one freezer, one VCR, three remote controls,  one plastic pool, three cars, one motorcycle, one two-story  house, and numerous vehicular spare parts and domestic items.    How can someone who does not work acquire all these things?  Where did he get the money from? How many years of honest and  well-remunerated work would be required to accumulate even a  portion of the things seized from this house? The  implementation of Decree-Law 149 has brought to light, in all  its crudeness, the situation of many people who took advantage  of the workers' labor to satisfy their personal cravings. The  time of reckoning has come for these social parasites. We are  witnessing the beginning of the end of the moneybags. [end  recording]</p>

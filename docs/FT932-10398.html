			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Sport: New York's hard-nosed heroes - Basketball RECENT New York Knicks' basketball games at Madison Square Garden have been a bit like a night at the Oscars, so hungry has Hollywood-on-the-Hudson been to associate itself with the best sports story in town. In recent weeks, Jack, Dusty, Woody, Spike and Arnold have all been there, tasting the special atmosphere that New York generates every time it looks as if one of the city's teams is on the verge of greatness. When the baseball Mets won the World Series in 1986, New York went berserk, as it did the last time the Knicks won a championship, in 1973. Yet since the mid-1980s, New York sports fans have had little to cheer. The football Giants won the SuperBowl in 1991, but the title was earned against the backdrop of the Gulf War, so celebrations were muted. This year, however, the Knicks have captured the city's imagination. In the regular season they won 60 of their 82 games, ending with the second best record in the 27-team National Basketball Association. To success-starved New Yorkers, the Knicks' performance has been especially gratifying because it was only two years ago that the team seemed mired in mediocrity. In 1991 they scraped into the playoffs, only to go out at the first attempt to the Chicago Bulls in three straight games. That poor effort disgusted the fans and the local media. The season ended in complete disarray. The coach lacked the support of his team and the Knicks' only star, Patrick Ewing, wanted to escape New York. Yet, just two years later, the Knicks are fancied to reach the play-off finals. They have beaten the Indiana Pacers in the first round and start their second-round series against the Charlotte Hornets tomorrow. Much of the credit for the Knicks' renaissance must go to Pat Riley, the team's coach. In the 1980s Riley coached the Los Angeles Lakers to five NBA titles, but when he joined the Knicks at the start of the 1991-92 season there were many who still believed he had not proved himself. Critics argued that the Lakers were so good that it did not matter who coached them. They said that a team led by legends like Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Earvin 'Magic' Johnson would have won five championships if they had been coached by Michael Jackson. In the Knicks, Riley saw an opportunity to win the respect that was denied him in California. Today, Riley has triumphed, and with a team that could not be more different to his title-winners of the 1980s. The Lakers dominated through deft ball-handling and passing, and swift counter-attacks. They were adored by their fans in Los Angeles, who liked to think that the team played the game the way they lived - creative, fast and loose. The Knicks' have won the hearts of their city because their approach meshes closely with New Yorkers' image of themselves - hardworking, tough and uncompromising. Above all, the Knicks' game is built around big men, aggressive defending, and an intimidating attitude that occasionally borders on thuggery. Their bruising style has made the Knicks the most feared team in the league, and hugely popular in New York. It is not surprising that the fans' favourites this year have been Anthony Mason and John Starks, two ferocious competitors whose intensely physical play causes havoc when they defend, and creates scoring opportunities when the ball moves up court. The dark side of streetfighters like Mason and Starks sometimes surfaces. The Knicks' have a poor disciplinary record. On Tuesday Starks was thrown out of a play-off game for head-butting Reggie Miller of the Pacers. The other New York weapons include the dominant presence under the basket and the accurate shooting (especially under pressure) of Ewing, the canny generalship of point guard Doc Rivers and the strongest substitutes' bench in the NBA. Add Riley's long experience of post-season play, and the Knicks look as if they have the ingredients for a championship. Yet, over such a long haul - the playoffs do not end until June and the final three rounds involve a best-of-seven series - it may come down to which team is hungriest for the title. After consecutive championships, Chicago's appetite may be sated. The best teams in the western division - Phoenix and Seattle - have the talent, but there are doubts over their willingness to mix it up with the toughest teams from the east. Furthermore, the Knicks are desperate to win. Ewing, who has won national college championships and Olympic gold, has said he will not feel fulfilled until he wins an NBA title. Veterans such as Rolando Blackman and Rivers know this may be their last shot at glory, and Riley wants to prove he can win it all with a team other than the Lakers. As for Mason and Starks, they have reached the top the hard way - via the basketball wilderness of semi-professional leagues, obscure European leagues, and no-hope 10-day contracts with losing NBA teams. As Starks said recently: 'Remember, I wasn't supposed to be in the pros. But once I got a taste, I knew it was just a matter of time.'</p>

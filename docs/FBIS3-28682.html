The one-year tax cuts worth 5.85 trillion yen were adopted  as  part of a pump-priming package aimed at getting the faltering  economy back on its feet.    The officials said the income tax refunds for the January to  June period will be made in June and those for the second half  at the end of the year.    As for the residential tax rebate, the refunds will be made  in part by reducing such tax payments to zero in June and July  and in part by prorating the remainder for the 10-month period  from August, in equal installments. Currently, the standard  household pays 460,000 yen in income tax and 330,000 yen in  residential tax annually.    With the stimulative package calling for slashing individual  and local residential taxes by 20 percent each, households with  annual incomes of 8 million yen will receive about 160,000 yen,  the officials said.</p>

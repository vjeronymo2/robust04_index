			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Ismat al-Hawari, lawyer: "There Is No Good in a </F> Nation Whose Judiciary's Independence Is Not Safeguarded"]    [Text] It is a sufficient honor, glory, and tribute for the  judicial authority that God's Messenger [Muhammad]--may God  bless him and grant him peace--was the first judge in Islam.  Likewise, it is a sufficient rank and exaltedness for that  authority that the Creator, who is praised and exalted, set  judgeship in the place following prophethood.    Thus He says--may He be exalted [Koran 2:213]: "The people  were one nation; then God sent forth the Prophets, good tidings  to bear and warning, and He sent down with them the Book with  the truth, that He might decide between the people touching  their differences." He who is exalted has also said [Koran  38:26]: "David, behold, We have appointed thee a viceroy in the  earth; therefore judge between men justly, and follow not  caprice." What greater and loftier tribute to the judicial  authority could there be than that the Creator should set it in  a place of elevation and dignity, so that "Just" became one of  the God's Names most beautiful?    I should not be overstepping the fact or offending against  the truth if I affirmed and averred that the independence of the  judicial authority is the sole guarantee that ensures the  citizen the justice he seeks, and that through the neutrality  and independence of that authority justice is upheld. If affairs  of state are managed with justice, the state stands and is  upright; but if justice is not maintained in the state, the  state endures pains and perishes. Impairment of the judicial  authority's independence is impairment of the state's  sovereignty that should prevail.    This is a true saying for Egypt and for history. I swear  that  it is free of any admixture of hypocrisy or flattery; for we  have no remnant of life left to play the hypocrite with any  creature, however mighty his authority and great his respect. We  will hold fast to respect for God; on His strength alone we call  for help, and to none but Him do our heads and faces bow. It is  a true saying that we all must repeat and affirm, that the  judicial authority is the country's inviolable honor. All of us,  rulers and ruled, therefore have an obligation to bring about  its full and unimpeded independence, so that its agents can  perform their duty without fear of tyrant's sword, shunning the  wealth of a ruler as wealthy as al-Mu'izz and the most tempting  of gifts. This will never come to pass except by freeing the  [judicial] authority from subordination to any other authority.    A state that does not preserve the independence of its  judicial authority is a state that refuses to uphold justice and  makes coercion, force, and tyranny the way of governing. You  will find that such a state has lost its way; and having lost  its way, it will not bring dignity to its people, because the  dignity of the people comes from the dignity of the judicial  authority. There is no good in a nation where the independence  of the judiciary is not safeguarded.    There is nothing more dangerous for a people's ethics and  culture than for the executive authority to interfere in matters  of justice or for that authority to impose its tutelage over the  judicial authority, so that it impairs the judiciary's  independence. The judiciary then becomes subordinate to  something else, not to its own conscience. Only the agents of  the judiciary, without supervision from any other authority, can  administer and uphold justice. We must remember and never forget  that when the calamitous massacre of the judiciary took place,  it shook the independence of the judiciary. The massacre was  really a massacre of the people's rights and freedoms. When the  executioners subdued the independence of the judiciary and sent  the law on vacation, dens of oppression and power centers arose.  Vipers rushed forth to usurp power and assume guardianship over  people's livelihoods and resources. They built a spurious empire  of Satanic usurpation. They allowed themselves to commit every  forbidden act. They froze the people into feudal structures.  They created legions of proteges and political adolescents. We  must realize and ponder how when the judiciary lost its  independence, the people lost their freedom. When the people  lost their freedom, proud Egypt lost every war it entered  against its enemies. Thus when judicial independence does not  exist, it is an enormous wrong against the judiciary itself.  Indeed, it is a shameful wrong on the part of whoever impairs  that independence. Wrong leads only to wrong; bats multiply in  the darkness. Thus there is no room for freedom without the  independence of the judiciary: for the citizen's freedom comes  from the freedom and independence of his judge. We have already  discussed in previous articles how it would be a matter of  justice to abolish the Ministry of Justice. That ministry must  disappear. Its continued existence is an impairment of the  judicial authority's independence. It is the imposition of a  hateful tutelage that the executive authority spreads over the  judicial authority.    The time has come for us to call on President Mubarak for  help--he who is calling for the building of an Egypt of justice  and purity, that it may be recorded in the pages of his  administration's history that there was no tutelage over the  judicial authority, no interference by the executive authority  in the administration of justice, and no impairment of the  judiciary's independence. No to the existence of the Ministry of  Justice! Yes--a thousand times yes--to the Higher Judicial  Council, the legitimate father of the agents of the judicial  authority and to every matter related to justice in Egypt!</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (31): Innovative solution for couriers - Case study When the so-called 'ring of steel' was thrown around the City of London in 1993 to prevent terrorist attacks it made it increasingly difficult for courier companies to use vehicles for delivery and collection. Federal Express, a market leader on the busy transatlantic route, came up with an innovative solution  - it set up a team of 15 City Foot Couriers and equipped them with the latest data communications hand-held computers from Psion, operating over the Ram packet-switched mobile data network. The Psion HC R400 hand-held radio data terminals combine a MS-dos compatible computer and a radio packet modem in a single rugged battery-powered package weighing less than 1kg and small enough to fit in a pocket. The process of delivering and collecting packages is controlled by a dispatch centre which sends messages to individual couriers. By scrolling through a series of menus on the hand-held devide, couriers select an appropriate response, informing the centre that the message has been received and will be acted upon. Federal Express has its own private mobile radio system for its fleet-based operations, but this did not offer the same facility for data transmission and has limited coverage. Mr Graham Richie, manager for systems development, explained: 'The dispatch and delivery system (Dads) we use for vehicle operations is PMR-based and requires a licence to operate. It is also expensive to maintain. 'A large number of the banks, broking houses and blue chip companies in the area enclosed by the 'ring of steel' are our customers. To maintain and improve our service to them we needed a foot courier service with a more flexible communications operation. 'The expense involved in extending the PMR system was prohibitive; the Ram Mobile Data solution was the most cost-effective, reliable option and an important enhancement to our intercontinental service.' Federal Express tested the mobile data solution over several months using separate hand-held computers and modems. As soon as the Psion HC R400 integrated unit was available in August, the decision to roll-out was taken. Because the operations manager can keep tabs on all couriers, he can monitor workloads and change schedules to maximise the number of deliveries each individual can make. Federal Express expects to increase productivity with some couriers making 50-60 drops before midday. Customers benefit from faster, more accurate information on the status of their consignments  - once a parcel has been delivered the courier can key proof of delivery into the Psion which then links to the central system to update the sender. Psion and Federal Express worked closely together to integrate the mobile terminals with the host application using Psion's generic application programming interface (API), Universal Radio Interface (URI), which handles the communications over the Ram network. URI 'talks' to the Dads host from a PC gateway and to the mobile applications running on the Psion devices. It manages the 'life' of a message, alerting the dispatcher if customer service is going to fall outside promised response times. The success of the City implementation has prompted federal Express to investigate the possibility of implementing the same system in its London West End operations, which are experiencing increasing traffic flow problems.</p>

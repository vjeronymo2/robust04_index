Approximately $50,300 is available in FY 1994 to fund this award. It is expected that the award will begin on or about July 8, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. A continuation award within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to provide assistance to the MDPH to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Conduct active rabies surveillance in the vicinity of Cape Cod;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Evaluate the efficacy of an oral wildlife rabies vaccine in Cape Cod; (3) Ascertain the epidemiologic determinants and public health consequences of the study; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Determine whether the cost of the program is beneficial towards rabies control in a region of high density of humans and companion animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CDC will provide consultation and technical assistance in planning, conducting and evaluating the studies to achieve program goals; provide serological and other appropriate laboratory assays to determine rabies status; and collaborate with MDPH in applying the results of these studies to other appropriate venues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Immunization and Infectious Diseases. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where To Obtain Additional Information.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is authorized under section(s) 301 [42 U.S.C. 241] 317(k)(1), and 317(k)(3) [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(1), and 247b(k)(3)] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. Applicable program regulations are found in 42 CFR part 51b, Project Grants for Preventive Health Services and 42 CFR part 52, Grants for Research Projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke-Free Workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Assistance will be provided only to MDPH. No other applications are solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to MDPH. The MDPH is located in Boston, Massachusetts. Issues surrounding the surveillance, diagnosis and reporting of rabies throughout the State fall under the MDPH authority. The department promotes cooperative efforts among the local town and county health departments of this State, shares knowledge on important public health issues and is a central resource for the development and distribution of educational material for both professional and technical development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During 1993, the MDPH supported a plan to promote the use of oral rabies vaccine among wildlife in the vicinity of Cape Cod. The MDPH has developed appropriate educational materials, diagnostic criteria, methods for determining epidemiologic factors which might be associated with rabies exposure and its consequent control throughout the State. In addition to existing baseline data concerning rabies prevalence and already-developed educational vaccination campaign materials, the MDPH has other characteristics which are essential to the study including: The authority to promote active rabies surveillance and diagnosis in the region of study; ready access to major colleges and universities and important cooperators such as wildlife rehabilitators in the vicinity of Cape Cod; for promotional and collaborative activities access to community Cape Cod health centers which have the facilities necessary to gather and quantify the needed statistics; and a system developed for veterinary and public health tracking of exposed animals and humans. No other such oral wildlife rabies program having the geographical advantage offered by Cape Cod has been initiated in the United States. Thus, the MDPH is uniquely qualified and the only eligible applicant for this study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application is subject to Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs as governed by Executive Order (E.O.) 12372. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of proposed Federal assistance applications. The applicant should contact their State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective application and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. Information on the Massachusetts SPOC is included in the application kit. If the SPOC has any State process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should forward them to Edwin L. Dixon, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., Mailstop E&hyph;18, room 314, Atlanta, Georgia 30305. (The receipt date for SPOC comments will be 60 days after the application deadline date.) The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' for State process recommendations it receives after that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Health System Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number is 93.283.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Where To Obtain Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If you are interested in obtaining additional information regarding this project, please refer to announcement number 456 and contact Leah D.

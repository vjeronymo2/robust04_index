			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Letter: Radical restructuring needed to increase house supply in UK Sir, Your suggestion on the phased abolition of Miras ('Housing choices', January 13) is sensible and could be marginally improved by linking it to notional rather than actual interest rates. Could we also call it mortgage subsidy? However, fiscal changes are only one side of the housing equation. At present personal housing subsidies (housing benefit, Miras and income support to unemployed home-owners) amount to Pounds 13.3bn and bricks and mortar subsidies of Pounds 3.76bn. This produces little incentive to increase supply and results in the housing version of musical chairs where repossessed homes end up being occupied by homeless families on housing subsidy. This creates an unemployment and benefit trap for those looking for work and does nothing to stimulate house building and renovation, a key to wider economic recovery. We now need to look at the supply and affordability of rented housing. I am afraid that that needs a much more radical restructuring than your 'modest investment incentives for landlords'.

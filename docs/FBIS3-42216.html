			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kamal al-Sa'id Habib, "one of the founders </F> of the Al-Jihad Organization," by unidentified AL-SAFIR reporter  in Cairo; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [AL-SAFIR] Some reports say  al-Jihad and the Islamic Group might merge. How true is this?  Were there unification attempts in the past? Why did they fail?    [Habib] Al-Jihad will remain al-Jihad, and the Islamic Group  will remain the Islamic Group. Unification has not been  proposed because there are major differences in our methods of  action. Undoubtedly, the Islamic Group is now more prominent  than al-Jihad, but this is because the two organizations have  different views. While al-Jihad believes in comprehensive  change, the Islamic Group believes in the promotion of virtue  and the suppression of vice. The small operations that gave the  Islamic Group prominence are part of the group's method of  action. Al-Jihad, on the other hand, believes in comprehensive  change as the basis of its movement. Therefore, al-Jihad is now  weaker than it was in 1981. It lacks organizational foundations  and has no unified leadership. In addition, it received many  blows since the assassination of President al-Sadat in 1981.    [AL-SAFIR] Do you believe rumors that there is a split in  al-Jihad between Ayman al-Zawahiri and Colonel Makkawi?    [Habib] Colonel Makkawi's story is really strange. I think  there is an attempt by the media to highlight some names and  suggest there is a split in the organization. At any rate,  Ayman al-Zawahiri, Colonel Makkawi, or others represent only  themselves or small groups within al-Jihad; they do not  represent the al-Jihad Organization. Within al-Jihad, there are  many schools of thought that take independent actions; it is  known that al-Jihad groups work independently. Therefore, I  believe that the groups representing al-Jihad are too varied to  be incorporated into one organization. I stress that there is  no organization for al-Jihad in the full sense of the word;  there are groups that believe in the general thought but express  themselves with different mechanisms. [passage omitted]    [AL-SAFIR] Is daily violence in the Egyptian streets a way  to  achieve power? Does al-Jihad believe that violence is needed at  this particular stage?    [Habib] Violence and clashes with the state will not produce  positive results; indeed, they will not serve the Islamic  movement in general. It is better to open up society and try to  establish the Islamic presence inside its normal structure. The  strategic outlook should be given precedence over this "din,"  which will not lead to necessary changes. In short, the current  violence does not benefit al-Jihad or the Islamic movement in  general. Those in the Islamic movement who practice violence  are a sector that has been forced by the state to do so. They  feel their lives are threatened at any moment by military  courts, even when they live abroad. Therefore, they are  practicing violence irrespective of its results. We must stress  that, historically, it was the state that started violence  against the Islamic groups and counterviolence was thus  imperative. In addition, the absence of the Islamic shari'ah  forces Muslims to demand its implementation, even through  violence.    [AL-SAFIR] After each operation, people wonder what the  Islamists really want. We are posing this question to you.    [Habib] It should not be taken for granted that the  Islamists  are the ones who are carrying out these operations. Egyptian  society has been infiltrated and the perpetrators could be the  Mosad, some armed Christian organizations, or even the state  itself. We do not want to assume that the Islamists are  terrorists. Although there are some groups deviating from the  general course, such as al-Shawqiyun and others, al-Jihad has a  clear cultural mission. I, therefore, rule out the possibility  of al-Jihad carrying out such operations. We hope the state  will implement the Islamic shari'ah so that people can rest.  [passage omitted]    [AL-SAFIR] The government is now calling for national  dialogue. How do you view this dialogue, knowing that the  Islamic groups, especially al-Jihad, are not participating?    [Habib] The government's call is not serious. I believe the  president made the call without realizing that there are other  forces stronger than him. Concerning the mechanism of  implementation, the call for the dialogue is not serious. If it  was, then all political forces would have been invited. I think  al-Jihad and the Islamic Group have conditions for joining the  dialogue. These include releasing detainees, refraining from  intervening in Islamic preaching in mosques, and refraining from  desecrating sanctities. These are simple and legitimate  demands. Dialogue is needed to end Egypt's crisis, but dialogue  in its old form is fruitless. [passage omitted]    [AL-SAFIR] Where are the political Islam groups heading?    [Habib] Those groups need to revise their mechanisms and  plans to link them to reality. I believe violence will not  produce results. It will not serve the Islamic movement and  will not decide the issue. All of society needs a change and  the outlook toward change must be comprehensive. Islam in Egypt  will inevitably remain, and when the Islamists reach power there  will be no struggle among them, as there is in Afghanistan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Unwarranted Pressure"; quotation marks as </F> published]    [Text] The substance and tone of the remarks made on  Thursday in Washington by a senior Clinton administration  official who deals with South Asia has brought home the  uncomfortable reality that American policy in the region is  becoming increasingly interventionist and that such  interventionism does not augur well for India. Under the guise  of "conflict resolution" which has become one of the new  buzzwords of the Clinton administration's largely amateurish  effort to stay "engaged" in America's self-prescribed "manifest  destiny" to lead the post Cold War world, U.S. policy in the  region is becoming less and less apologetic about an activist  role in the arena. The Clinton administration's "creative  diplomacy" in South Asia which seems to have no pretensions to  any other interest except to strap the region into some kind of  nuclear non-proliferation regime translates into sustained  pressure on India and Pakistan to "come to the table." This can  only result in a substantial erosion of sovereignty in  decision-making for both countries.    The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, Ms.  Robin Raphel's questioning of Kashmir's status as an integral  part of India might not really be the key indicator of the  discernible tilt in policy against India, given that all  Washington's pronouncements have had the in-built premise that  Kashmir is disputed territory. That the U.S. regards part or all  of Kashmir as disputed is not so much a point of issue, given  the undeniable historical reality that Kashmir's status was the  subject of U.N. resolutions, but what is of concern is the  marked hardening of the U.S. attitude towards India's position  in the dispute, including a hint of an intervention in the  problem that will not be in India's interest.    There are three new elements that stand out in Ms. Raphel's  presentation that are the critical indicators of the tilt  against India. The first is an unsubstantiated assertion that  Pakistan's support in fuelling the militancy in the Valley is  not as much as it used to be. Not only would this formulation  give greater credibility to the claim that the stir in the  Valley is wholly spontaneous and indigenous, but it would  reinforce the attempts from across the border to keep the  militancy "spontaneous." The second disturbing element is that  in a shift from the stand of the Bush administration the Clinton  administration now appears to be questioning the efficacy of the  Shimla Agreement. Until now, the American emphasis on Shimla had  implied an acceptance of India's argument that Kashmir was an  issue to be resolved bilaterally. Another indication of the U.S.  interest in internationalising Kashmir is the suggestion that  America will sound out Russia on a joint initiative for conflict  resolution in South Asia.    The Narasimha Rao administration appears to have been taken  by surprise by the unfriendly tenor of these remarks, especially  because it has in recent months tried to respond to American and  international pressure by setting up a human rights commission  and also indicating a willingness to talk to Pakistan on  Kashmir. But what the Government has not perhaps taken into  account is that precisely because it took these steps only under  pressure and is perceived to be amenable to this sort of  pressure, does Washington find it tactically rewarding to turn  up the heat.    As we had said earlier in these columns, India's position on  Kashmir is becoming increasingly vulnerable because of the  continuing inability to initiate a political process in the  State, the sharpening perception of the Indian State as an alien  oppressor, reinforced by the image of the Army laying siege to  the religious symbols of the Kashmiri people. But most troubling  is New Delhi's reluctance to accept the reality that the only  way to take Kashmir off the world's radar screen is to engage  Islamabad in a mutual confidence building exercise so that an  insecure regime in Pakistan does not feel compelled to invite  external mediators in, at the cost of the region's sovereignty.</p>

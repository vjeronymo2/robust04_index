			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA FREEWAY  </P> <P> Becoming 41 years old was trauma enough, but then the Ventura Freeway  construction project began! Since I live in Agoura Hills and work in the San  Fernando Valley, this project scared me. I could see myself in bumper-to-bumper  traffic day in and day out. I began securing supplies for the ordeal: fresh  drinking water, crackers, stress reduction tapes, and a new pair of sunglasses.  I convinced myself that being away from my family that much longer would make  them appreciate me even more.  </P> <P> Well, to my astonished delight I am thoroughly enjoying being 41 and the  Ventura Freeway project has been a well-executed and obviously well-planned  endeavor, so far. The complexities of the project are apparent as I weave my  way from one side of the freeway to the other and detour to previously less  traveled roadways under the watchful eye of the Highway Patrol and traffic  guards.  </P> <P> The most amazing thing of all is that I am actually making better time now than  before the project . . . so much for absence making the heart grow fonder.  </P> <P> MARGARET FERRY  </P> <P> ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Agoura Hills  </P></p>

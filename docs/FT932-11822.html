			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (2): Cross-border launching pad - Luxembourg NESTLING between Germanic and Latin Europe is Luxembourg, the tiny country whose liberal tax and regulatory regime has made it the centre of choice for companies marketing investment products. 'If Luxembourg's status was not available within the European Community, somebody from outside the EC would invent it,' said Mr Mike Hemming, marketing director at Commercial Union Financial Management International. Forget tax, Mr Hemming said. Luxembourg's charm is its proximity to central Europe, its reputation for Swiss-like banking secrecy laws, its multilingual, multicultural workforce and the sway it holds in the minds of the sort of European investors that CU hopes to persuade to buy its products. CU offers two so-called 'umbrella funds', totalling Pounds 150m in assets, which are based in Luxembourg and marketed throughout Europe. 'Most mainland Europeans would recognise Luxembourg as a European banking centre. They wouldn't recognise Dublin,' he said, referring to Luxembourg's nascent rival in the north-west corner of the European map. Moreover, in spite of the high quality and low cost of Dublin's workforce, 'we decided we needed a multilingual workforce who could talk to our series of distribution outlets throughout Europe,' Mr Hemming said. And in spite of its reputation as a high-cost location with red tape to be cut, competition from other offshore centres has failed to dent Luxembourg's popularity as the centre from which European cross-border products are launched. Moreover, Luxembourg has moved to cement its role as the centre for European financial services by developing a fiscal regime for the sale of life insurance and pensions products which rivals any other offered within the EC. Luxembourg's greatest strength has been its historical role as the centre for retail investment funds which have been marketed as pan-European products. From the late 70s to the end of the 80s Luxembourg funds have posted annual growth rates of 12 to 60 per cent. The greatest spurt came from the 1983 law establishing the SICAV (an open-ended fund similar to a unit trust) as the capital investment company which offered collective investment opportunities. By October 1992, there were 2,248 such schemes with assets totalling LFr6,016bn. That corresponds with 70 schemes with assets of Lfr118bn in 1980. Investment professionals caution against viewing Luxembourg as a low-tax regime. Indeed, quite the opposite. Unlike any other European centre, funds carry an annual six basis point tax d'abonnement which does not exist in any other country. However, Luxembourg does allow non-domestic investors to be paid interest and dividends gross of withholding tax, making it the logical home not only for investment trust-type products but also myriad other investments such as Eurobonds which appeal to the proverbial 'Belgian dentist' seeking to avoid tax in his home market. Still, Luxembourg's pre-eminent position in the sale of European financial services is not unassailable. For one thing, according to Mr Bob Ash, vice-president at Chase Investment Bank who oversees the marketing of offshore centres products, 'service providers in Luxembourg are expensive'. One regulatory quirk which has stuck in the craw of those who market collective investment schemes has been the requirement to use a Luxembourg bank - not the Luxembourg-based branch of another European bank - as a depository. This limits the choice to roughly three providers and the lack of competition has quite understandably affected fees. Britain's Unit Trust Association and other similar European trade associations have successfully lobbied for changes to the so-called Ucits legislation which governs cross-border collective investment products. The changes will force local governments to allow the choice of depository to be a branch of any EC-based bank, and should result in lower costs. Also, Mr Ash said, staff costs are relatively high in Luxembourg. 'We have been able to expand our staff in Dublin by about 30 people over the past year at no problem,' he said. Well qualified staff are available at affordable salaries, another factor when considering where to base the European centre for the sale of cross-border products. However, Luxembourg's regulatory authorities, the IML, have been sensitive to the rising competition from other offshore European centres. 'They have started to cut a lot of the red tape,' Mr Ash said. 'In 1990, the approval queue was up to six months,' Mr Ash said. 'Now, depending on complexity, you can receive approval in under four weeks,' he said. Moreover, the IML has shown its willingness to allow for innovation in product design for collective investment vehicles, a factor which is likely to help Luxembourg compete. Among the recent innovations given the green light by the IML within the past year are the use of derivatives, the creation of real estate investment funds, corporate finance funds and the so-called fund of funds which purchases shares of other collective investment vehicles.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 20 (AA) -- Turkey is against any kind  of forceful border changing policy, the Foreign Ministry said on  Wednesday [20 April].    Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said at his weekly  briefing that a draft was signed by the 11-nation Minsk Group in  an effort to find a solution to the problem in Nagorno-Karabakh,  during their meeting in Prague on April 11-15.    Ataman said it is the second document signed after the Rome  Agreement, adding that it is very important that free exchange  of ideas can be held between representatives of conflicting  sides.    He said that Armenia should give up its new offensive  against  Azerbaijan, which is a violation of UN, CSCE and other  international norms.    Ataman renewed Turkey's support for Azerbaijan's violated  territorial unity.</p>

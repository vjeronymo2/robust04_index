			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Arpad Goncz by unidentified </F> reporter at the Duna Palace in Budapest -- live]    [Excerpt] [Reporter] As president of the Republic, what do  you consider to be the next important thing from the country's  point of view, the thing which you advise to the country?    [Goncz] That the country should have a stable and acceptable  government.    [Reporter] The people have expressed their view quite  radically and -- in both rounds of the elections -- quite  massively, in terms of turnout.    [Goncz] The people deserve respect and honor for this.    [Reporter] However, after this, should the parties not be  expected to effect the transition in a similarly radical and  speedily manner? Will you ask the party leaders tomorrow to do  this?    [Goncz] That goes without saying. The campaign, the election  is over, now all parties must bear in mind the welfare of the  country.    [Reporter] When do you plan to convene the National  Assembly?    [Goncz] The National Assembly must be convened within 30  days  of the announcement of the election result, but I sincerely hope  that I will be able to convene it as soon as possible. I cannot  give a date.    [Reporter] Mr. President, when can peace and calm be  expected  to prevail in the country again?    [Goncz] I do not feel that the country is in a state of war.  I could hardly have conceived a more peaceful election. So, I  believe that the state of calm will be reestablished soon -- the  campaign is over. As to when the nation's peace of mind is to  prevail, let me say that it will occur if the nation can draw a  final account of all the phases of its history prior to 1918 and  close that account. However, it might take a generation.  [passage omitted]</p>

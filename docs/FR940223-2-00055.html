Consequently, when the order mentions ``language specialists,'' it includes anyone who rents equipment, organizes conferences, performs teleconferencing or pr&eacute;cis writing, supervises or coordinates interpreters, reviews or revises translations, or provides recordings of interpretations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

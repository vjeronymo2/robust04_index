			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe foreign limit British Aerospace was forced yesterday into its second announcement over the level of foreign investment, revealing a breach of the 29.5 per cent ownership ceiling. BAe said it would now take steps to sell the 0.03 per cent of shares exceeding the government-imposed limit at 'the best price reasonably obtained'. The announcement came after the market had closed and BAe shares had slipped 5 to 501p on turnover of about 700,000. BAe finds itself in a similar situation to Rolls-Royce, which has also had to force the sale of foreign-held shares breaching its 29.5 per cent limit. Both companies are believed to be lobbying to have the ceilings - which were imposed to prevent the two defence-related companies being dominated by foreign interests - raised to 49.5 per cent. Rolls-Royce declined 6 to 175p. Shares in high street bank Lloyds jumped yesterday as hopes for a pick-up in growth and for lower UK interest rates prompted one securities house to lift forecasts and another to promote the sector. The shares were 13 better at best before drifting with the market to close a net 6 ahead at 568p. UBS sharply upgraded dividend and profits forecasts and issued a buy recommendation. The house believes Lloyds has begun to adopt a more expansionary attitude and that the bank's dividend will increase by 15 per cent a year to hit 25.5p this year and 34p in 1996. UBS raised its 1994 forecast by Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.37bn and its 1995 number by Pounds 70m to Pounds 1.62bn. Meanwhile, Salomon International, the US investment bank, highlighted its belief that interest rates have further to fall and focused on the banking sector as offering attractive yields as well as exposure to further rises in the stock market. National Westminster, up 6 at 470p, and TSB, a penny firmer at 219p, also benefited from the Salomon recommendation. Strong results from Next powered the shares forward 6 to 231p, with turnover reaching 7.3m. Profits for the high street retailer were at the top end of market forecasts and the final dividend was doubled. Analysts were further encouraged by the comments on current trading, with talk that sales from the mail order business were 20 per cent above last year's level. A raft of upgrades pushed next year's forecasts towards the Pounds 90m mark, with some bullish analysts looking for another doubling of the dividend to 8p. But with the shares having performed so strongly, there were some notes of caution being struck. Hoare Govett was one house suggesting the shares as a 'hold', with doubts over whether the impressive sales performance could be sustained. Croda International fell steeply after announcing a big increase in full-year profits to Pounds 48.9m. The company said there would be no pension holiday this year and some dilution from a disposal. The two technical factors are expected to knock about Pounds 3.9m off earnings and analysts lowered forecasts accordingly. Smith New Court reduced its 1994 estimate by Pounds 4m to Pounds 40m and advised customers to take profits yesterday. The shares weakened 24 to 352p. Hickson International eased only 2 to 208p in spite of a year which saw profits drop to Pounds 22.1m from Pounds 24.3m previously. Analysts felt most of the bad news was out of the way and there was optimism over a new washing detergent agent. Kleinwort Benson held its profits forecast at Pounds 28m. Oil shares again reacted to this week's sharp falls in oil prices. Fundamentally bearish broker SGST reiterated its gloomy stance and argued that oil price weakness was now a long term fact of life rather than a temporary phenomenon. British Petroleum retreated 9 1/2 to 356 1/2 p on very heavy turnover of 14m shares following a sharp fall in New York on Monday night. Exploration and production group Enterprise Oil lost 3 at 404p. Shell Transport recovered 2 to 659p from what many consider an oversold position. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo shed 7 to 614p after Swiss rival Ciba-Geigy said it was confident about its efforts to market a cheap version of Glaxo's Zantac, the world's top-selling drug. British Biotechnology, which announced a one-for-three rights issue at 400p a share to raise Pounds 40m to pay for product development, added 5 at 470p. The rights issue had been flagged but analysts pointed out that the issue included a warrant which would yield a further Pounds 48m in 1996, thus solving the company's funding requirement for the next two years. Standard Chartered was one of the few banks in the sector to lose ground as Credit Lyonnais Laing lowered its profits forecasts and reinforced its sell stance. Worries on Hong Kong margins prompted Lyonnais Laing to cut this year's estimate by Pounds 26m to Pounds 441m and next year's by Pounds 23m to Pounds 425m. The shares receded 17 to 1046p while rival HSBC moved forward 17 to 764p, with some talk of switching between the two. Manufacturer Dominick Hunter made an encouraging market debut, opening at the issue price of 200p but gaining 24 at 224p. Coal Investments, which was suspended last month at 76p, resumed trading at 77p and jumped to 84p. Publication of the full report and accounts saw Reed International bounce 16 to 851p. The shares fell recently in spite of increased figures as analysts focused on the pressure from rising paper prices, but those worries have receded as companies have stressed that they have locked in prices.</p>

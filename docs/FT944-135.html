			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor (1): Catholic Church is about faith, not politics Sir, Robert Graham and Paul Betts make a fundamental error in their article about the Pope: they refuse to see the Catholic Church with the eyes of faith and, rather, interpret it as a modern democratic state ('Twilight crusade of an obdurate Pope', December 24/25). Therefore their interpretation centres on the idea of a right and left, two groups who could alternate in their control of the seats of power. This is an attractively simple approach, particularly when the present holy Father is seen as a man of the 'far right'. This, however, is a view shared by many writers since the days of Pope Pius XII and the dream of a dream ticket modern Pope who would set things to right. The late Peter Hebblethwaite's biography of Pope Paul VI describes him as the 'first modern pope', but it was Paul VI who reiterated the Church's clear teaching (taught also by Vatican II) on the intrinsically sinful nature of artificial contraception. With the eyes of faith, the Church is not a democracy with majority opinions ruling on doctrine. There is a clear corpus of doctrine on faith and morals, which is taught in continuum through the tradition, in a living voice, of the Church. This body of doctrine may be better explained and understood, but it can't be explained away. This body of doctrine is held by those who are faithful to the Church and is found in all the documents of the Church and Popes. There are many matters in which there may be division from the Church but not in the minds of these faithful to the Church. People all over the world are looking for clear, simple explanations and reasons for believing and they have found them in two best sellers: the Catechism of the Catholic Church and Crossing the Threshold of Hope. People want their beliefs to be authenticated and related to something outside themselves, and perhaps here lies the appeal of the Catholic Church.

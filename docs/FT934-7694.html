			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (33): Still a long way to go - A look at progress on banking reforms THE appointment last July of Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier, to head the People's Bank of China signalled the government's intention to accelerate reform of the financial sector. But despite considerable strengthening of the central bank's power since the summer, there is a long way to go before China has a viable and competitive banking system. Over 14 years of reform, dramatic changes have occurred. Originally little more than a means of directing credits to state enterprises according to the central credit plan, China's banking system has become an increasingly important source of funds for enterprises and a means of recycling the large pool of domestic savings. In 1984, the People's Bank of China became the central bank, with its commercial activities transferred to a newly created bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Meanwhile, the other three state banks were encouraged to expand outside their traditional areas - agriculture, construction and trade finance. The big four still dominate the banking system, but since the mid-1980s there has been an explosion in the number of non-bank financial institutions engaged in domestic currency lending, direct investment and trust business. Meanwhile, the government has increased the number of banking licences granted to foreign banks. Although still prevented from engaging in domestic business, they have made a significant dent in the trade finance market. One western banker estimates that Shanghai's 26 foreign bank branches have won more than 25 per cent of that market. Yet as the banking sector has become more sophisticated, flaws in the system have become more obvious. Problems exist in the following areas: Non-commercial lending. The state banks remain obliged to lend to state enterprises, regardless of commercial criteria, so the government has been obliged to keep tight control on competition in the banking sector and on the banks' interest rates policy. Up to 40 per cent of the banks' loans to state enterprises are believed to be non-performing, although the Bank of China prefers to describe them as 'overdue'. This lack of competition effectively prevents the central bank from using indirect instruments of monetary policy such as changes in reserve requirements to control credit. Under-regulation. Another result of the lack of permitted competition for deposits by the banks, combined with lax regulation by the PBC, has been a mushrooming of illegal lending to non-bank financial institutions who then on-lend at much higher interest rates. One western banker estimates that, as a result of the crisis in the real estate sector, as much as 90 per cent of this bank to non-bank lending may now be irrecoverable. Much of this lending occurs outside the published credit plan, and is mysteriously recorded in the government's monetary survey as 'other items, net'. Last year, net domestic assets grew by 32.7 per cent - 10 percentage points faster than allowed for in the credit plan. Lax regulation has led to a series of financial scandals and frauds involving non-bank institutions. In March of this year, the PBC issued a circular which tightened access to the interbank market to keep non-banks out, prohibited real estate lending, and shortened maturities on interbank lending, although the decree was not enforced until July when Mr Zhu took over. Decentralisation. The government tries to use the PBC branch network to drain surplus deposits from the relatively few, normally richer, surplus provinces to redirect them to those in which the growth of deposits lags behind credit demand. But it has faced growing pressure from PBC branches, often with close ties to local governments, which have sought to make changes to the credit plan. 'Each province has a head branch of the People's Bank,' explains Mr Lu Baifu, vice-director of the State Council's development research centre. But, he says, the bank has been losing control of its provincial branches. 'The PBC cannot use it (the provincial branch) to adjust monetary policy. It has become a hindrance to the activities of the central bank.' Mr Zhu's first priority has been to re-establish control over the regional PBC branch network and to assert the PBC's independence. 'In the new financial system, the main objective of the central bank is to stabilise the value of the currency,' says Mr Qin Chijiang, director of the PBC's Monetary Research Institute. 'At the moment, the PBC has only limited power to change interest rates, but our reform direction is to increase it gradually.' Next year, according to Mr Qin, the government intends to establish three policy-oriented banks which will take over the non-commercial activities of the state banks, thus allowing the commercial banks to choose their customers and set realistic lending rates. Meanwhile, the PBC is trying to build a national interbank market, improve the bank's asset and liability management and strengthen its own supervisory capabilities. Yet, as one western banker in Beijing points out, 'the big question is not how to reform the banks but how to reform their loss-making customers.' Foreign observers doubt whether the government will be able quickly to free the state banks from their obligations to lend to state enterprises. 'The government has got to make it clear to the commercial banks that it is not their duty to lend to loss-making state enterprises,' says an international financial official. 'That means impressing on local governments and managers that they must make state enterprises profitable.'</p>

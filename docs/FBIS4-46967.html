			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Borys Perhamenshchyk: "Metropolitan Filaret: </F> 'Whose Purpose Does This Falsehood Serve?'"]    [Text] Most Blessed Metropolitan Filaret--one of the  leaders of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kiev  Patriarchate--received me at his residence, which is situated in  a three-storey building at 36 Pushkin Street in our capital.    Our discussion touched upon the refutation by the UOC-KP  [Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kiev Patriarchate] of a report  published in the Ukrainian business journal NOOSFERA. The text  of this report has been widely disseminated by the mass media.  It was obtained--as indicated--"from a source close to  government circles." The gist of this published item lies in the  statement that on 14 May of this year V. Kryzhanivskiy,  Ukraine's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the  Russian Federation, had a meeting with Aleksiy II, Patriarch of  Moscow and All Russia. Discussed at this meeting was the  granting of autocephaly to the UOC-KP, as well as the secret  meeting between Metropolitan Filaret and the leader of the  Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan  Vladimir (Sabodan). At this meeting agreement was allegedly  reached concerning the unification of both Orthodox branches  into a single, integrated confession. In the opinion of a  "reliable source," the leader of the UOC-MP [Ukrainian Orthodox  Church-Moscow Patriarchate] would have to become the patriarch  of the newly unified church.    Here is what my fellow-conversationalist, Filaret, stated on  this score. "It is not true. Some persons would like me to have  a personal meeting with Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan), but  there was no such meeting. Nor could such a meeting take place  behind the back of the patriarch of Kiev and All Russia-Ukraine.  Such disinformation by no means stabilizes the coordinated work  of both hierarchies, but--on the contrary--leads to dissension  and discord. Whose purpose does this falsehood serve?"</p>

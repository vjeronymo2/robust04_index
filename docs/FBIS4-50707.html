			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, May 20 (XINHUA) -- Southeast China's Fujian  Province plans to employ 3,000 foreign experts to help with its  economic development, while sending 5,000 of its own people  abroad to take advanced training courses in the coming two years.    These people will be mainly involved in the fields of  agriculture, industry, science and technology, and education.    One of the first provinces in China to carry out the reform  and open further to the outside world, Fujian has long paid  attention to inviting talented people, an official of the  provincial bureau of personnel said.    A survey shows that 1,800 technicians, managerial workers  and  experts in culture and education from Japan, the United States,  Germany, Italy, Denmark, and Taiwan and Hong Kong have been  invited to work in the province since 1984.</p>

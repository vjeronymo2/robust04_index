			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet by Nguyen Ngoc </F> Truong, TUAN BAO QUOC TE editor in chief; place and date not  given: "Foreign Policy in the Period of Renovation"]    [Text] In 1993, our country's international  activities yielded important results. In 1994, Vietnam enters  a crucial year of renovation and development. Following is an  interview by TUAN BAO QUOC TE with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet on  a series of issues, namely, the outstanding features of the new  diplomacy, the key aspects of foreign policy in 1994, and what  is new in the investment policy.    [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] May we ask you to evaluate our  country's  international activities in the past year?    [Vo Van Kiet] Our country's international activities in 1993  took place in a very rich manner and in many fields --  political, economic, cultural, and physical education and  sports -- and realistically served our goals of peace,  independence, and development for the sake of prosperous people,  strong country, and civilized society. The results of these  activities have contributed to enhancing Vietnam's international  posture and have favorably allowed us to pursue the economic and  political goals of our foreign policy in the coming years.    The leaders of other countries and international friends  whom  I had a chance to meet all advocated Vietnam's foreign policy  and highly evaluated our renovation. The fact that the country  was being developed in a stable manner and important  socioeconomic achievements were being made in the renovation  effort in recent years served as a basis for our country's big  advantage in its international activities. Reality has  affirmed that the domestic and foreign line and policies we are  developing are correct and suitable for the present trend and  allow our country to move forward along with other nations in  the region and in the modern world.    [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] What are the outstanding facts in these  activities?    [Vo Van Kiet] We were walking steadily with both feet:  building the multifaceted cooperation relations with our  neighboring countries and countries in the region, and  diversifying the international relations, including relations  with the big countries and political and economic centers in the  world. The good relations we had with the region created  favorable conditions for us when our country extended relations  to other parts of the world. At the same time, the fact that we  had diversified and multilateral relations and had retained the  traditional relations with the countries that had been  cooperating with and supporting us created even more favorable  conditions for us within the region. The efforts to consolidate  our relations with neighbors and countries in the region were  linked with the policy of diversifying international relations.  An important aspect of our diplomatic activities was economic.  Thus our international activities were both profound and broad,  were aimed at central and important points, and best served our  national construction and defense. These could be considered the  peculiar and new aspects of Vietnamese diplomacy.    I would like to add that while we were developing the  above-mentioned moves, we also did our very best to strengthen  the friendship and cooperation relations with our traditional  friends and wholeheartedly supported the struggles of the people  of other countries for national independence and social  progress. This fact reflected the principled character of  Vietnam's indivisible foreign policy and also conformed to the  Vietnamese people's profound international sentiment.    [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] Can we call what you have just  mentioned  the foreign policy of the period of renovation?    [Vo Van Kiet] The years and months of the struggle for  national liberation had given birth to the revolutionary  diplomacy combining national strength with the strength of the  era and making great contributions to glorious feats of arms,  such as the liberation of the South and the reunification of the  fatherland. The diplomacy of the revolutionary period of  national liberation had inherited and absorbed the quintessence  of the millennial diplomacy of national defense and  construction, and at the same time had been raised by the  brilliant diplomat, Ho Chi Minh, to the height of the diplomacy  of the era. This inheritance and development was the law of  social movement.    On the other hand, any foreign policy is determined by an  actual historical ciscumstance. The world diplomacy is moving  from one stage to another. The international situation is  undergoing quick changes, with the grouping of new political and  economic forces. Vietnam is an underdeveloped country having  not so vast a land area and average economic potential but it is  situated in a region that enjoys the most dynamic economic  development in the world and includes many countries with strong  economies and important political positions. From now until  1995 the economies of Asia may reach an average growth of 7  percent while the world as a whole cannot surpass the rate of  growth of 2 percent. In and outside of the region, both  politicians and businessmen are urgently making adjustments to  accommodate the Pacific Era in the 21st century.    The foreign policy of our country is entering a new stage  switching from serving the national liberation struggle to  serving the renovation, and, in facing the task of contributing  to the renovation of the country, setting foreign policy  guidelines and goals for the immediate and long terms by winning  more friends and having fewer foes, in accordance with Ho Chi  Minh thought, and by adopting lively and flexible conduct and  counteracting formulas. Even in this process, the party and  state everyday must handle many complex international issues,  which require that we apply principles and tactics in a correct  and timely manner in order to gain advantages for the country  and people and to conform to the common trend. I would need  more time to review the rich reality, but I think that the new  foreign policy is capable of combining the national character,  the traditional diplomacy, and the characteristics of the era.    [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] What is the focus of foreign policy  activities in 1994?    [Vo Van Kiet] In 1993, the process of our country  normalizing  and expanding its international relations was basically  completed. In the years to follow, we need to consolidate and  raise the quality of these relations and pay attention to the  key locations. Our political and diplomatic activities must be  strongly aimed at economic aspects and serve the economic goals  that have been set. This is not only the work of the  foreign-affairs organs of the party and state but also the  responsibility of all sectors and echelons, and has to do with  the development of cooperation programs in many fields in our  country.    [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] What about the economic focus of  foreign  policy?    [Vo Van Kiet] In the last few years, thanks to our policy of  openness, we were able to attract a large volume of foreign  investment, to step up exporting, and to some extent to resolve  the budgetary difficulties regarding sources of revenue and  mobilizing capital investment for the national economy. In  1994, we need to continue to increase export by 20 percent, by  25 percent in 1995, along with gradually improving the  allocation of export goods, to return to the traditional markets  in Russia and Eastern Europe, and to have access to new markets.    [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] Please let us know the new aspects of  the 1994 investment policy.    [Vo Van Kiet] The country is entering a new period of  development. We must attain a rate of growth no less than 8  percent per year and work hard to double the 1990 GDP level by  the year 2000. To do so we must have a lot of capital. We have  been paying attention to mobilizing the sources of domestic  capital. In the last 3 years, the total investment in  development came close to 70,000 billion dong; the projected  total in the next two years will amount to 90,000 billion dong.  This way we will be able to achieve the goal set for domestic  capital investment for the years of 1991-1995. However, a lot of  idle capital exists in the population. In 1993, we were able to  mobilize only less than one-half of the people's  capital-contributing capacity. The government is urgently  drafting a law on domestic investment.    About foreign capital, there has been a major gain due to a  breakthrough in the establishment of our relations with  international financial and monetary organizations, with the  ability to acquire capital and then expand new industries. The  countries and international organizations that participated in  the International Financial Assistance Conference held in Paris  have agreed to grant us loans under favored conditions totaling  1.86 billion dollars in the 1993-1994 fiscal year. The official  aid for development from a number of industrialized countries  also has greatly increased. Direct private foreign investment  continues to increase quickly. The total of such capital being  put to actual use in 1993 amounted to $800 million, nearly twice  the total in 1992. However, in the present stage, the ability  to get foreign capital greatly depends on our ability to accept  and use it effectively in our country. Therefore, we will give  priority to investment projects aimed at improving our  infrastructure, processed goods for export, and manufacturing  sectors, which will help to resolve the unemployment problem.    On this occasion, I congratulate TUAN BAO QUOC TE for being  published for the first time. As the country is being  renovated, the press needs to be renovated and modernized.    [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] Thank you, Mister Prime Minister.</p>

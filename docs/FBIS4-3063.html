			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (CNS) -- The daughter of Deng  Xiaoping, Ms. Deng Nan, said that her father was in good health  and still did much routine work including reading a lot of  material and taking walks. She added that she and her father  had played bridge the day before yesterday.    Ms. Deng made the remarks in reply to questions related to  the state of her father's health when attending a press  conference at the State Council press office in her capacity as  the Vice Minister of the State Science and Technology  Commission, together with the Vice Minister of the State  Planning Commission Mr. Chen Yaobang, both of whom elaborated on  a White Paper on China's population, environment, and  development in the 21st century.    Ms. Deng said that she understood the wide concern for her  father's health and that she and her family members were used to  various rumours regarding her father's state of health and even  joked about them. She repeated that her father was in a good  state of health and clearly showed his care for the build-up of  the country including the White Paper on the outlook for China  in the next century.    Speaking on the White Paper, Mr. Chen said that it employed  the spirit of the United Nations Environment and Development  Convention held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June, 1992, and  was worked out by the Chinese Government with the participation  of 52 departments and social institutions involving 300 experts  with four revisions. The paper was discussed and endorsed at a  meeting presided over by Premier Li Peng last March 25.    The paper, based on the State situation and population as  well as environment and development, makes known the general  strategy for promotion of coordination of the economy, society,  resources, and the environment in a bid to achieve continuous  development. It will serve as a guiding document for a medium-  and long-term programme for national economic and social  development. It will also be used as a reference in the  formulation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the programme for  the year 2001.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Francis Van den Berghe: "Belgium Trying To Talk </F> Asylum Seekers Into Leaving Embassy"]    [Excerpts] The occupation of the Belgian Embassy in Havana  by more than 100 Cuban asylum seekers, was still deadlocked on  Wednesday [8 June]. The main obstacle was the asylum seekers'  persistent refusal to leave the building. The Belgian  authorities continued to try to convince them to do so.  According to Havana, the Belgian authorities submitted a list  with 121 names to the Cuban authorities. On Wednesday, a  Brussels communique stated that there were 124 Cubans in the  embassy.    The Cuban Foreign Ministry announced it would not resort to  violence to chase the intruders from the Belgian ambassador's  residence. "It is up to Belgium to take action," the Cuban  Embassy spokesman in Brussels stated. Brussels and Havana fully  agree on the position to be taken. "Belgium should try and talk  the intruders into leaving," spokesmen said.    Brussels sent Willy Verriest, former Belgian ambassador in  Havana, as a special envoy to Cuba. According to the Belgian  Foreign Ministry, this is necessary because of the problems the  Belgian Embassy is experiencing with simultaneously negotiating  with the Cuban authorities, convincing the intruders, and  finding food for 124 people. [passage omitted]    Both countries agree that all legal procedures for traveling  abroad should be respected. Since Cuba has promised not to  prosecute the intruders for unlawful entry, Belgium is trying to  make them leave. [passage omitted]    During the present incident, Belgium has not issued any  statements about human rights. Shortly after the embassy  takeover, Foreign Minister Claes said that "the intruders should  not have any false illusions." [passage omitted]</p>

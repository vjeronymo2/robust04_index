This is the third best figure so far, after the  record in 1990 (22.33 billion net kilowatt-hours) and the 1992  result, which was 0.5 percent higher than that of 1993. The  average rate of use for Swiss nuclear reactors was 85.6 percent.    In addition to electric current, the nuclear reactors at  Goesgen and Beznau I and II also delivered long distance heat.  The cardboard mill in Niedergoesgen took some 150 million kWh  of industrial heat from the Goesgen reactor. The two Beznau  reactors provided around 108 million kWh of thermal energy to  the regional distance heating network in the lower Aar Valley.    Since the Leibstadt reactor was commissioned in 1984, total  Swiss nuclear production has stayed above 20 billion kWh.  Fluctuations from one year to the next are mainly the result of  shutdowns of varying length for annual inspections.  <H5>  Goesgen Leads The Pack </H5>   In 1993, the Beznau I reactor was down for 100 days. That is  the longest stoppage for this reactor since it was commissioned.  The two steam generators were changed and the Nano emergency  system was put into place.    Goesgen recorded the highest net production of all Swiss  nuclear reactors, with 7,408.130 million kWh and a 90.5 percent  rate of use. It was followed by Leibstadt (7,338.055 million  kWh). Beznau I produced 2,156.305 million kWh, which was less  than the 2,650.931 million produced by Beznau II and the  2,568.475 million produced by Muehleberg.</p>

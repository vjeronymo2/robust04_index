			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PANTHERS RALLY FOR TIE  </P> <P> Ed Frazier kicked a 42-yard field goal as time expired to cap a 22-point  comeback in the final 9:09 as No. 10 Pittsburgh tied No. 9 West Virginia,  31-31, Saturday night at Morgantown, W. Va.  </P> <P> Major Harris threw a career-high four touchdown passes and West Virginia  capitalized on six Pitt turnovers to take a 31-9 lead late in the third quarter  before the Panthers rallied.  </P> <P> Adam Walker ran two yards to cap an 80-yard scoring drive that made it 31-15  and Eugene Napolean fumbled on West Virginia's next possession, allowing Alex  Van Pelt to hit Henry Tooten with a nine-yard scoring pass with 4:41 to play.  </P> <P> Pitt (3-0-1) then pulled off a successful onside kick, setting up an apparent  29-yard field goal by Frazier. But a roughing-the-kicker penalty kept the drive  alive, and Curvin Richards made it 31-28 with a five-yard touchdown run with  2:55 to play.  </P> <P> West Virginia (4-0-1) failed to run out the clock and had to punt with 49  seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Van Pelt, intercepted four times earlier in the game, hit Tooten with a 25-yard  pass on fourth-and-eight to move the ball to the Mountaineers' 33. With seven  seconds remaining, he found Tom Huebner open down the left sideline for eight  yards, allowing Frazier, who earlier missed an extra point, to kick the tying  field goal.  </P> <P> Army 56, Harvard 28 -- Bryan McWilliams, Ben Barnett and Calvin Cass each  scored on short runs in the second quarter, rallying the Cadets to victory at  West Point, N.Y.  </P> <P> Harvard (1-2) surprised the Cadets with two first-quarter touchdowns to take a  14-0 lead.  </P> <P> Quarterback Tim Perry hit fullback Art McMahon with a five-yard pass touchdown  pass for a 7-0 lead only 3:21 into the game.  </P> <P> Harvard made it 14-0 less than two minutes later on a lucky bounce. Perry  completed a 27-yard pass to halfback David Haller, but he fumbled at the Army  13-yard line and teammate Mark Bianchi picked up the ball and ran it in for a  touchdown.  </P> <P> But the Cadets (2-1) scored seven straight touchdowns to secure their 10th  consecutive win at Michie Stadium.  </P> <P> Rhode Island 18, Brown 13 -- Chris Poirier rushed for 190 yards and scored the  go-ahead touchdown midway through the final period as the Rams rallied from a  13-0 deficit at Providence, R.I.  </P> <P> Rhode Island (2-2) won the Governor's Cup for the second straight year. Brown  (0-3) lost its 12th consecutive game.  </P> <P> Bucknell 36, Dartmouth 20 -- Scott Auchenbach threw three second-half touchdown  passes and Dan Scocca ran for a career-high 126 yards and two touchdowns to  lead the Bison at Lewisburg, Pa.  </P> <P> Bucknell (2-1) scored 22 unanswered second-half points after trailing Dartmouth  (1-2) by 20-14 at the half.  </P> <P> Connecticut 31, Yale 20 -- Matt DeGennaro passed for one touchdown and ran for  another as the Huskies scored 31 unanswered points to win at New Haven, Conn.  </P> <P> Freshman tailback Victor Taylor scored on touchdown runs of one and 11 yards as  the Huskies (3-1) came back from a 7-0 deficit to lead 31-7 midway through the  fourth quarter. The Bulldogs dropped to 2-1.  </P> <P> Northeastern 20, Cornell 0 -- Sophomore quarterback Dan Daponde threw a pair of  touchdown passes as the Huskies broke away from their wishbone offense and won  at Ithaca, N.Y.  </P> <P> Daponde threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Scott Adams in the first  quarter and then hit split end Jerey Sadberry for a 27-yard touchdown in the  third period.  </P> <P> Sophomore David Rusk kicked field goals of 25 and 35 yards as Northeastern  improved to 3-1. Cornell slipped to 1-1.  </P> <P> Holy Cross 46, Princeton 0 -- Tom Ciaccio passed for 343 yards and Dave Murphy  intercepted two passes to become the Division I-AA career leader as the  Crusaders romped at Worcester, Mass.  </P> <P> Murphy's interceptions gave him 26, two more than Holy Cross' Bill McGovern and  Isaac Holt of Alcorn State.  </P> <P> Lafayette 52, Columbia 14 -- Frank Bauer threw for 281 yards and four  touchdowns, three to Mike Grau, as the Leopards won at Easton, Pa.  </P></p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Travel: So near but so far to Dublin RISING UP through Courtstown Forest, the Way was steep. A hot spell had turned the pine needles into blonde scented sawdust rather than the grey sludge it normally resembles. Yet expectation made light of the incline. At the stile marking the 1,550-ft crest of the hill, the views were as exhilarating as the map had promised. Dublin, the Bay and Howth stretched out to the north, virtually beneath one's feet. What makes the Wicklow Way unique among long-distance footpaths is the final section down into the city. How many European capitals could be surveyed from a wilderness mountain peak barely an hour's stroll from the restaurants and shops of a great metropolis? These are no tame, well-manicured uplands landscaped for the urban adventurer. Glencullen is the last east-west valley before one reaches Dublin itself. Whitewashed farms dotting the lower slopes, huge boulders littering the sheep pastures and the heather-clad slopes of Glendhu and Cruagh mountain remind the traveller remote Scottish glens. Yet as the crow flies it measures just seven miles to O'Connell Street, Trinity College, and the heart of the city. Country ways predominate here. An old boy in battered thorn-proof trousers and, despite the sun, thick tweed jacket, ambled up Glencullen with me for a mile or two, curious that anyone in possession of his wits should should walk for pleasure. As the Irish tourist board admits in its literature, the concept of hiking trails is relatively new in Ireland. The 81-mile Wicklow Way, from Dublin to Clonegal, Co Carlow, was opened in 1981 and was the first long-distance footpath in the republic. My aged companion was anxious about how I would accomplish the journey back from central Dublin to my parked car. 'You'll want to take the bus to Bray, it's cheaper than the train,' he advised. 'But the hell with the money. You're on holiday.' In fact, those enjoying part of a holiday walking on the Way would be hard pressed to spend very much. Despite its proximity (in motoring terms) to major urban centres such as Dublin, Bray and Wicklow, the well-marked track can feel as remote as the Himalayas. The sense of distant timelessness may be linked to the geological history of the region. The Wicklow mountains, an area approximately 30 miles by 25, are nearly six times older than the Alps. Probably the best-known peak is Sugar Loaf mountain, south of Dublin. Its almost perfect conical shape is visible almost throughout the 20 miles of walking closest to the city, although the Way never directly touches it. Sugar Loaf has always been some sort of a focal point. Following the death of Charles Stewart Parnell, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party and home rule advocate, his followers devised a novel lighthouse to be built on the summit. Considerable sums were donated but eventually, in the 1950s, the money was used to provide books for the children's library at nearby Bray. A more understandable historical project are the gardens of the Powerscourt estate, skirted by the Wicklow Way as it ducks beneath the 300 ft Powerscourt waterfall and edges around the deerpark. The Italian and Japanese gardens were started in the 18th century by the Viscounts Wingfield and are considered by some critics as the final flowering of the formal aristocratic garden in Europe. Back on the Wicklow Way, the serious walker is more likely to be interested in the vegetation underfoot than the borders of Powerscourt. In the mid-section much of the ground cover consists of heather. To the the south, from Aghavannagh to Clonegal, the hills are lower and possessed of wondrous green turf. But remember that the legend of the 'hungry grass' is prevalent across Ireland. Doctrine has it that when pedestrians tread on this fierce vegetation they succumb to sudden weakness and hunger. Tradition explains that the grass occurs where a famine victim died or a coffin was placed during a pause in a mountain funeral procession. The ITB (150 New Bond St, London W1, tel: 071-493-3201), publishes numerous pamphlets on walking in Ireland, including a detailed guide to the Wicklow Way.</p>

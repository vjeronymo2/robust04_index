			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Novel cash exercise at Butte In a cash-raising exercise almost certainly unique to the UK, Butte Mining has sold to a group of investors the rights to some of the proceeds it hopes to collect from a lawsuit in the US. Butte is seeking damages of more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 201m) and asks that these be tripled to about Dollars 1bn under US anti-racketeering legislation. The UK group said it had raised Pounds 1.3m gross by issuing 1.9m zero-coupon, three-year loan notes with additional rights. These rights effectively give the investors, who include clients of Derivative Securities, 38 per cent of the first Dollars 10m of any proceeds from the lawsuit, 12 per cent of proceeds between Dollars 10m and Dollars 20m and 5 per cent of proceeds exceeding Dollars 20m. Butte has previously revealed that Deutsch &amp; Frey, its US contingent-fee attorney, is entitled to one third of the gross proceeds from the litigation. The management team is entitled to a further 5.25 per cent but of that 4.5 per cent would be paid only on proceeds above Pounds 15m. Money from the loan note issue will be used to fund the running costs of the group until the lawsuit comes to trial. Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, said it would give Butte the bare minimum a public company required to keep going for another 2 1/2 years. 'The defendants won't be able to starve us out now.' Butte has sold most of its assets and has only two full-time and three part-time employees. Mr Lloyd-Jacob said he and Mr Graham Andrews, finance director, who are both working half-time for half pay, 'have kept the company going so far on air and credit cards.' The loan notes have a nominal value of Pounds 1 each and have been issued at 67 1/2 p to give holders the equivalent of a 14 per cent gross compound return at the end of three years. They are also redeemable at any time at the company's option at a 14 per cent discount to the nominal value. Security is a first floating charge on Butte's assets.</p>

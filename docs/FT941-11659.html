			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Arts: Life in a cold climate - Cinema THE BLUE KITE Tian Zhuangzhuang WAYNE'S WORLD 2 (PG) Stephen Surjik LES VISITEURS (15) Jean-Marie Poire JACK BE NIMBLE (18) Garth Maxwell BODIES, REST AND MOTION (15) Michael Steinberg THE CONFORMIST (18) Bernardo Bertolucci Here are some of the rewards offered to good filmmakers across the world. In America, they give Oscars; in Britain, Baftas; in France, Cesars; in Europe, Felixes; in China, detention sentences and/or visa confiscations. This is what happened to Tian Zhuangzhuang. 'Where is he?' we cried last year at Cannes when his film The Blue Kite became the sleeper of the Directors Fortnight. This movie about the everyday terrors of life under the sway of Mao and his Little Red Mind should be spoken of in the same awed breath as Farewell My Concubine. Passion, compassion and a searching, majestic irony join together in the history of a family concussed by Communism. So where was Tian? Back in China after having his exit visa taken away. And why does The Blue Kite trespass across forbidden political airspace? Because it chronicles 20 years in the life of a family based on Tian's own as its members endure the cruel, interchangeably wintry seasons of Maoist rule. From the Sino-Stalinism of the early 1950s the film moves through the 'Hundred Flowers' and the 'Great Leap Forward' and finally the Cultural Revolution. Iced-up movements all: designed less to enhance or advance the lives of the people than to crystallise the tyrannies of their leaders. Nothing wintry, though, about the movie. Characters sketched with lightest shadings grow their own irresistible warmth and colour as we watch. There is the librarian Shujuan (Lu Liping), wistfully enduring a life of serial wedlock as she loses one husband to political exile, then marries his repentant betrayer, then ends up with a dried-out old Professor. There are her quizzical, button-bright son Tietou (our main point-of-view character); her yappy Marxist sister; her sweet-natured, weak-willed brother, who loses his girlfriend to one of several passing purges; and others still, filling up a fresco of Chinese street life that seems real to every brushstroke. Tian portrays this life built on deprivation and thought-policing with a naturalism at once tender and abrasive. Popular Maoist songs are offered up for mockery: 'We don't give peace to invaders or bad people]' sing a bunch of wedding guests; 'Wipe out waste, decay and bureaucracy]' warble a group of schoolchildren. But the movie never stops at mere scorn. It swells from the modest, multiple-choice pathos of early scenes - divided families, fractured loyalties - to a kind of vast silent tragedy: the story of a nation whose people survived despite an experiment in nationhood that grimly, resoundingly failed. Wayne's World shocked the planet recently by disproving King Lear's theory that nothing will come of nothing. Two completely empty heads, the comedy showed, could fill cinema cash registers across the globe. Wayne (Michael Myers) was the head with long dark hair and a face like a Halloween turnip. Garth (Dana Carvey) was the head with long blond hair and a face like Norman Bates's mother. When not co-hosting their DIY chat show on public-access TV, our teenage twosome sallied forth from Aurora, Illinois, to spread the gospel of rock culture and insane catch-phrases. In Wayne's World 2 they stage a 'real' pop concert - Waynestock - with help from Kim Basinger, Charlton Heston, Aerosmith, Rip Taylor and any other celebrity who happened to be trapped inside Paramount Studio's perimeter fence during shooting. This is the mixture as before, so why is it so much funnier? One reason: its silliness-on-a-loop humour works like mesmerism, lulling you with repetition before manipulating your funny-bone at will. Reason two: in translating themselves to movies from their Saturday Night Live American TV slot, Myers and Carvey have developed a flair for duffing up movie lore itself. Jurassic Park, Field Of Dreams and The Graduate are among a dozen-odd films invited into the script's orbit in order to be knocked about. And the best joke is a delayed-action gem about the function of melons, chicken crates and sheets of replacement glass when wheeled into place on a movie street. Most comedy traditions can be seen in terms of Biblical genealogies. Bill and Ted begat Wayne and Garth and Wayne and Garth might have begotten - by triangular interbreeding with Monty Python - Jacquouille and Godefroy in Les Visiteurs. This has been the greatest box-office success, bar none, in French cinema history. Fourteen million Gauls have paid umpteen million francs to watch a medieval knight and his squire (tall and stately Jean Reno, squat and manic Christian Chalonge) flung into present-day Languedoc after a mix-up with a witches' spell. Here they experience culture shock and so does the audience. (How is your ear for 1990s-colloquialised Medieval French?) The posh hotel in which Jacquouille and Godefroy run bewilderedly amok is none other than J's old family castle now converted into a relais and managed by limp-wristed Jacques-Hebri (Chalonge doubling up). It is also owned by a descendant of the knight's 12th century fiancee Beatrix (Valerie Lemercier, France's answer to Penelope Keith, also doubling up). There is, as you see, much doubling up: more than there may be among non-French audiences. Having taken a nervous eternity to reach Britain, the film now offers its blend of esoteric Gallic humour with high-pressure subtitles. Will audiences in outer Wolverhampton crack up at the sight of two time-confused Middle-Agers washing their faces in a bidet? Or throwing Chanel No 5 into the bath as if it were bath mousse? (But what would they know about bath mousse?) Or falling foul of 'supermarkets,' those strange indoor stadiums filled with wire-mesh chariots? And so on, with a mixture of overzealous slapstick and undernourished reliance on the hilarity of anachronism. Jean-Marie Poire's film suggests that more than a Channel Tunnel is needed to create a trans-manche link between French and non-French senses of humour. But then they may say the same after seeing Wayne's World 2. But Les Visiteurs is beaten to this week's wooden spoon. That is shared between Garth Maxwell's Jack Be Nimble from Australia and Michael Steinberg's Bodies, Rest And Motion from the US. The first is a ill-stirred stew of violence, hypnosis and revenge, all about two separated-when-young siblings (Alexis Arquette, Sarah Smuts-Kennedy) who reunite for a spot of grown-up carnage. Steinberg's film is an Arizona-set tale of drifting lovers. Here the wooden spoon could have been used to hit everyone over the head. It might have instilled some vitality into Eric Stoltz, Bridget Fonda and Phoebe Cates; though Britain's Tim Roth does better, leavening his portentous Zen-buddyist dialogue with an almost plausible South-Western accent. The title, by the way, comes from one of Newton's Laws: but not the one about the danger of sitting near overripe or prententious plantings in case they drop heavy objects on you. See instead Bertolucci's 25-year-old The Conformist, reissued in a new print and looking a dream. Which of course it is: the reveries of a 1930s political chameleon (Jean-Louis Trintignant), evolving from closet homosexual to Fascist hit man to casualty of history. The images dazzle; the camera behaves like Torvill and Dean on hallucinogens. A good film-maker reaches his peak of almost-greatness, just before he sold out to gift-wrapped Maoism (The Last Emperor) and guff-wrapped existentialism (The Sheltering Sky).</p>

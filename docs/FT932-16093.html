			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Pechiney first-half loss warning PECHINEY, France's state-controlled packaging and aluminium group, warned yesterday that it would make a loss in the first half of this year. Group profit last year dropped sharply to FFr203m (Dollars 36.9m) from FFr820m in 1991. Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's president, said he would like 'to use the first window that opens up' for France's new government to privatise his group, but the low price of aluminium, Pechiney's main raw material, might delay this. The poor showing stemmed largely from competition from what Mr Gandois called 'massive amounts' of Russian aluminium. Last year, the group took over the aluminium activities of Pechiney International, its publicly-traded subsidiary of which it owns 67 per cent, to make Pechiney International more attractive to investors. Pechiney International's operational profit rose 19 per cent from FFr901 in 1991 to FFr1.07bn. Some 85 per cent of this subsidiary's FFr35.3bn turnover last year was in packaging, mainly of food and drinks. That allowed it to maintain its level of profitability. The rest, however, was in turbine components, where profitability, was cut from FFr675m in 1991 to FFr344m last year. Pechiney is maintaining a FFr5-a-share dividend for its international operation, but cutting its group dividend from FFr13 for 1991 to FFr10 for last year. Mr Gandois forecast that the Pechiney group would see the benefit of recent restructuring in the second half of this year, while Pechiney International's profit would rise further this year, though by a smaller margin than last year.</p>

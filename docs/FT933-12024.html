			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / 500,000 workers to vote on strike HALF A MILLION local government white-collar workers belonging to Unison, the new public-sector union that brings together Nalgo, Cohse and Nupe, are to vote on industrial action over pay, Lisa Wood writes. In a ballot announced yesterday they rejected the 1.5 per cent offer by local government employers made in line with the government's pay ceiling. Unison members will be asked to vote on an initial six days of strike action over a six-week period. If they decide to take action it will start early in October.</p>

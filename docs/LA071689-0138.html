			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PERCEPTION OF AIDES' CORRUPTION ERODES AQUINO'S POPULARITY  </P> <P> As chief of the anti-smuggling agency in the Philippines, Jose Almonte calls  himself an "economic warrior."  </P> <P> His greatest challenge, however, is knowing if the enemy includes his own  superiors.  </P> <P> Almonte, like many who supported Corazon Aquino's rise to power in 1986, is  waging a war against corruption in which battle lines are blurred.  </P> <P> Last year, for instance, he charged two Aquino-allied congressmen with  smuggling, only to see Congress retaliate by slashing his agency's budget to 5  cents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popularity Eroded  </P> <P> Charges of official corruption are striking deeper and deeper into the  once-mighty moral shield of President Aquino's government. Although she is seen  as untainted, the perception of graft by her underlings -- and her weak action  against it -- has eroded her popularity.  </P> <P> Almonte, a former army officer, fights smuggling with the same moral zeal that  he once fought Communist guerrillas. In 1986 as a colonel, he helped plan a  coup attempt against Ferdinand Marcos. When Aquino took power, she made him the  first officer promoted to the rank of general and later appointed him to the  bureau that battles smuggling, a popular crime in this nation of more than  7,000 islands.  </P> <P> "Corruption under Marcos was a wholesale theft of dollars from foreign loans,"  he said. "Now we see Filipinos stealing from each other."  </P> <P> In a recent land-reform scandal, for instance, a group of people tried to cheat  the government out of $2.5 million.  </P> <P> "That was the size of Imelda Marcos's kitty for flowers," Almonte said. Even  within his own department, known as the Economic Intelligence and Investigation  Bureau, Almonte has a tough fight. The temptation to take bribes or make off  with a confiscated container of imported goods is great among the bureau's  low-paid workers. He has already fired 300 out of 1,000 employees.  </P> <P> But, he admitted, until Aquino comes out more strongly in both action and words  against corruption, his crusade is constrained. For the first couple of years  of her six-year term, she pursued a policy of reconciliation among Filipinos  rather than exercising tough leadership against wrongdoers.  </P> <P> Most observers say it is unclear whether there is any more or less corruption  under Aquino than there was during Marcos. What is certain is that corruption  is more easily exposed even as Filipinos expect more from Aquino, whose  anti-graft campaign against Marcos helped to bring him down. Aquino has slowly  tried to reform the court system, but the effort remains limited because she  does not want to appear to be hand-picking judges and thus gaining favors.  </P> <P> Three recent incidents, though, have forced Aquino to get tougher against  corruption.  </P> <P> One was the land-reform scandal, known as the Garchitornena affair, that many  observers say has set back a key Aquino program by six months. The president  formed a special investigative body to clean up the affair in June and  appointed a new chief of the land-reform agency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Army Major Killed  </P> <P> Another was the killing of an army major during a holdup that revealed deep  military and police involvement in financial crimes, sparking an Aquino-ordered  crackdown in military ranks.  </P> <P> The third was political sniping by Aquino's nemesis, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile,  over her family's plan to "reform" their 14,000-acre sugar estate. The plan,  using a legal loophole in the 1987 land-reform law, would leave two-thirds of  the estate's ownership in family hands, while giving one-third of the  corporation's shares to the 6,000 workers over the next three decades. Enrile's  criticism of the plan angered Aquino. She launched a counterattack by bringing  up Enrile's past deeds when he served as defense minister under Marcos.  </P> <P> But more than just sparking a Filipino political feud, the dispute caused  Aquino to make some careful admissions. She shelved the family land-reform plan  for the time being and announced in a speech June 19 that "corruption has  returned, if not on the same scale (as under Marcos), certainly with equal  shamelessness."  </P> <P> She promised renewed anti-corruption efforts that would "spare no one." She  threw her support behind a new private group called the National Coalition for  Transparency (meaning clean government).  </P> <P> She tried to explain why no one from the Marcos era has been jailed for  corruption, saying she feared being accused of waging a "political vendetta."  The military came in for an attack too. She ordered Defense Secretary Fidel  Ramos to remove "scalawags and misfits" from the armed forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Order of Battle'  </P> <P> Ramos quickly told commanders to draw up an "order of battle" against the  corrupt in uniform, while claiming that the military justice system had already  investigated or punished 1,195 service personnel.  </P> <P> How far such talk will go is unknown. The battles over corruption are often  seen by observers here as just shadow-play for the 1992 presidential race or as  a reflection of public disappointment after the high hopes of Aquino's  overthrow of Marcos.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that now,  following Prime Minister Rabin's statements on the readiness to  evacuate settlements on the Golan Heights in exchange for peace,  Syrian President al-Asad had good reason to emit positive  signals toward Israel. The foreign minister told our  correspondent Hayim Hecht that the change indicated by Rabin's  remarks lay in the statement itself and not in its content. The  foreign minister added that the government realized that Syria  was always slow to react.</p>

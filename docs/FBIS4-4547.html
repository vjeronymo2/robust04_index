			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- The Cabinet today approved the  draft amendments to the Constitution which allows for the  setting up of the Court of Appeal and a code of ethics for  judges.    Law Minister Syed Hamid Albar said several other draft  amendments to the Constitution were approved, including the  appointment of judicial commissioners, clarifying the practice  of constitutional monarchy and the appointment of a Chief  Justice for the Court of Appeal.    He said the amendments would be tabled in Parliament in  April  or May.    With the setting up of the Court of Appeal, there will be  three levels of higher courts -- the High Court, Court of Appeal  and the Supreme Court.    Syed Hamid said this would enable the country to have a  three-tier system.    "Any judge who is qualified for the High Court will be able  to sit in the Court of Appeal," he said, adding that there would  be a panel of judges for the court.    He said the Chief Justice for the Court of Appeal would be  appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong [Paramount Ruler].    Syed Hamid was speaking to reporters at his office after the  weekly Cabinet meeting.    On the code of ethics, Syed Hamid said the Cabinet had  approved a new provision to Article 125(3) of the Constitution.    "The new provision will allow for the Yang di-Pertuan Agong  to prescribe a code of ethics which should be observed by  judges."    Syed Hamid said the code of ethics would cover the  performance and duties of the judges in terms of their honesty  and integrity.    "Any judge who breaches the code of ethics will have action  taken against him including being dismissed from his post," he  said, adding that the Lord President [Chief justice of Federal  Courts Malaysia] would decide if any judge had breached the code.    The public had a right to details about the code of ethics  as  it would be a step towards creating a better public image for  judges.    Syed Hamid also said the Cabinet had approved the  substitution of the word "misbehaviour" in Article 125 with "any  breach of the code of ethics".    "The Cabinet has also approved that the word `advice' in  Article 40 of the Constitution be defined to avoid  misunderstanding," he added.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil traders interviewed THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday revealed that officers from the US Department of Justice had been interviewing traders with London-based oil companies, Reuter reports. Market reports said several companies were being interviewed by US investigators after some traders in August 1992 cut brokers' commissions. An OFT official confirmed that it sat in as an observer at talks last week in London between the Justice Department and some trading companies, although no British investigation was under way. The office is the UK authority to investigate allegations of anti-competitive behaviour. The official would not name the companies involved or what issues were raised by the Justice Department. Trade sources said that some companies last year informed oil brokers in Britain, the US and Singapore that commission paid to them on account of crude oil trading would be cut by 30 per cent. Commissions were cut from 0.5 cents a barrel to 0.35 cents on trade in the North Sea Brent forward or 15-day paper market. Brokers at the time said they felt that they had no option than to agree to lower commission rates. At least one brokerage company might be seeking financial compensation, brokers said. One broker, who refused to be identified, said any compensation could run to millions of dollars. Crude oil prices fell yesterday, extending a sell-off that began late last week against a background of concern about weak world demand. December futures for the benchmark Brent Blend sank to Dollars 16.57 per barrel during London's afternoon trading session, down from a close last Friday of Dollars 16.85. Prices, which fell 20 per cent earlier in the year, had until late last week seemed more stable.</p>

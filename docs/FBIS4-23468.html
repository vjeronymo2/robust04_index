			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] has intensified its shelling of Cuito over the  past 24 hours. Cuito no longer receives humanitarian  assistance, and the food situation has worsened. Our  correspondent Abel Abraao has further details.    [Begin Abraao recording] Wounded and hungry people in Cuito  have been begging for humanitarian assistance. The political  and military situation has not experienced major changes here in  Cuito over the past hours. UNITA rebels continue to shell the  city, after experiencing heavy defeats in direct clashes with  government forces.    Despite heavy defeats, Jonas Savimbi's men are still  determined to overrun Cuito. Over the past 12 hours, more than  2,000 shells of various calibers were fired on the city,  interspersed with infantry attacks.    Meanwhile, more than 500,000 wounded and hungry people are  begging for humanitarian assistance from international  organizations. People are already dying of hunger in large  numbers. International humanitarian organizations have not been  flying to Cuito for the past 10 days because of military  instability in this region. Since the war began on 26 May, more  than 400 civilians have died, most of them old people, women,  and children. [end recording]</p>

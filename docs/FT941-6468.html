			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / EU sees price for aligning policies European Union member states could achieve nominal convergence in inflation and interest rates by 1996, and in budget deficits by 1998, according to a 'scenario' published yesterday by the European Commission. Its report on the European economy in the year 2000 gives a variety of possible outcomes based on different policy assumptions. However, the Commission warns that even a gradual path to 'convergence' would require moderate wage increases, tough budget policies, and a recognition that unemployment would only start falling in 1996. The jobless rate would still be 7.5 per cent in the year 2000. A more radical approach to labour market flexibility - including a reduction in employers' social security contributions for low-wage earners - could cut unemployment faster, according to the Commission. Thus the average growth of employment could be 2 per cent, associated with GDP growth of 3.5 per cent. Assuming that real wage costs per head remained one point below productivity, at about 0.5 per cent per year, the unemployment rate could fall to 4.5 per cent by the end of the decade. 'This favourable scenario, appealing as it might be, implies very stringent requirements for public policies and private behaviour, together with the need for strong co-ordination at the Community level,' the paper says. If member states pursue a 'do nothing policy' and drop efforts to achieve convergence, they risk social tensions and a return to 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policies. The EU would be 'plunged into the deeply divergent conditions that prevailed 20 years ago' after the first oil crisis shock, 'but with a worse social situation'. Mr Gordon Brown, UK shadow chancellor of the exchequer, called yesterday for a new European recovery fund to finance job-creation projects, investment and training. Without putting a price tag on the new fund, Mr Brown said it would bolster EU-wide efforts to tackle the next recession. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, was sympathetic to the idea.</p>

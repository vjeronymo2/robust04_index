			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Judit Brogyanyi: "Is Coexistence at a </F> Crossroads?"]    [Text] The results of the first round of elections in  Hungary had a great impact on the politics of Hungarians in  Slovakia. The coalition talks on joint participation with the  Coexistence at the autumn elections which was initiated by the  Hungarian Civic Party and the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement [MKDM] still have not brought any results. In fact,  the reluctant Coexistence has even postponed the signing of the  expired agreement on a two-party coalition with the Christians  which was first made two years ago.    The concern of the electors is shown by the facts that the  local organizations of the three political parties have made  agreements of their own will, and an action to collect  signatures is in progress which was started with the signatures  of renowned personalities of the nearly 600,000-strong Hungarian  community to win the support of people who are in favor of the  coalition. The Coexistence's latest statement that called for  making a union rather than a coalition appears to have ignored  the obvious intentions of the citizens. According to the MKDM,  this statement proclaims generalities, it lacks concept, and  there is not even time to detail the ideas and to draw them up  precisely, and it rejected the idea.    The seriousness of the situation is shown by the fact that  the chief editor of UJ SZO, the only Hungarian weekly newspaper  in Slovakia, one that strives for balance between the parties  and carefully maintains its independence, wrote a rather open  analysis headed "Crossroads," turning to the Coexistence and  especially its chairman, because -- as Jozsef Szilvassy writes  -- "the conductor's baton is still in Miklos Duray's hands."  Acknowledging Duray's truly unique merits in the actions  against the previous regime, he points out that "the politician  who had a keen perception and made excellent analyses even at  the beginning of the 1990's," and who quickly realized Meciar's  serious mistakes, perhaps came under the Hungarian Democratic  Forum's [MDF] influence too much and committed himself as a  staunch adherent of the Hungarian government party -- "it can be  assumed for what kind of ideological, current political, and  financial reasons." According to UJ SZO, Duray did not learn  from the MDF's politics fraught with mistakes; in fact, "due to  his bias and his nostalgia for the false ideas of the last  century, he did not even manage to dispel the suspicion among  the small group of well-intentioned Slovak intellectuals that  territorial autonomy is not the only one of his final goals."    According to UJ SZO's chief editor, in politics, the merit  of  yesterday does not excuse the mistakes of today. Therefore, the  Coexistence, whose politics disappointed many people, should re-  examine its past actions and especially its links with Hungary  because we would all suffer the consequences if the "political  movement that has a significant basis remained within the  constraints it had created."    The Coexistence's union plan is presumably guided by the  thought that the new political unit would integrate all four  Hungarian parties in Slovakia and, within the union, it would  vindicate the political leadership to itself, the experts  believe. The reluctant party leadership is visibly worried  that, recognizing the requirements of political realism and the  consequences of the Hungarian Socialist Party's victory in  Hungary, the Hungarians who make up 11 percent of the population  would be happy to support Weiss's left-wing party that also has  Hungarian deputies, or the sober Hungarian civic liberals who  learned from the mistakes of the former government.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Although the Chairman of Karabakh's Defense  Committee Robert Kocharyan has confirmed his support for an  organization comprising unrecognized states, he has noted that  his remark to this effect carried in the newspaper IZVESTIYA has  been misinterpreted.    "I believe" -- he said in an interview with Interfax on  Thursday -- "that the nations fighting for self-determination  and independence should combine their efforts and coordinate  their actions with the measures undertaken by the international  community to settle ethnic conflicts."    IZVESTIYA reported on May 26, with reference to Kocharyan,  that an alliance of unrecognized states would be formed soon.  According to the newspaper, Kocharyan expects Karabakh to be  joined in the organiziaztion by Crimea, Abkhazia, Adjaria, South  Ossetia, and Transdniestria.    He explained in this connection that "Karabakh's experience  in attaining recognition as party to a conflict through  persistent efforts could be instructive for other unrecognized  states such as Abkhazia, Transdniestria, and South Ossetia."    Meanwhile, Aleksandr Karaman, a vice-president of the  self-proclaimed Dniester republic, has described such an  alliance as feasible. In a telephone interview with Interfax on  Thursday, he said that such a union had long ago been thought  about and some work toward this end had been underway.    He recalled that the matter had been touched upon at  top-level talks between Transdniestria, Abkhazia, and some other  unrecognized former USSR territories.    "It's natural that people with similar destinies try to come  together to solve similar problems collectively. Unity is the  best way to prevent the repetition of tragic mistakes," Karaman  remarked.    However, Vice Chairman of Transdniestria's Supreme Soviet  Vladimir Bodnar has declared that his republic does not intend  to join an alliance of unrecognized states. He has told an  Interfax reporter that he knows nothing about plans to set up  such a union.    "I do not understand why attempts are being made to draw us  into an organization that we are not going to join, all the more  so why Transnidestria is mentioned alongside with Crimea and  Abkhazia, having a certain official status and quite ample  powers," Bodnar said.    "We seek to cement ties within the CIS rather than create  some new alliances," he added.    Chairman of Adjaria's Parliament Aslan Abashidze declared in  an interview with Interfax on Thursday that there are no  separatist trends in the republic. "It is an integral part of  Georgia, and this blessing should be treasured," Abashidze said.</p>

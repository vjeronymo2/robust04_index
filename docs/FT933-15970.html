			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Mexico's leading paper to be sold for Dollars 90m MEXICO'S biggest-selling newspaper, La Prensa, is about to be sold for Dollars 90m to a group of investors led by Mr Carlos Abedrop, a wealthy Mexican businessmen, and Mr Jesus de Polanco, Spain's most powerful media baron. Mr Abedrop, a shareholder in Mexicana and Aeromexico, the country's two largest airlines, is head of the investor group, and expects the purchase to be completed in a few weeks. Mr de Polanco, who will be investing through his publishing house Editorial Santillana, will take a significant minority stake. La Prensa is a downmarket newspaper with a circulation of up to 280,000, and is owned by several hundred shareholders. The newspaper also owns several publishing companies, that together print more books than any other Mexican company. La Prensa already prints Mexico's school textbooks on contract for Editorial Santillana, the largest publisher of textbooks in Spanish, with sales throughout Latin America. Mr de Polanco also owns, through other holding companies, El Pais, Spain's largest newspaper, radio stations, book shops, a television channel, and a significant minority stake in Britain's Independent newspaper. When the purchase of La Prensa is complete Mr de Polanco is expected to concentrate on the publishing rather than newspaper side of La Prensa. Mr Abedrop has said his only interest in La Prensa is commercial, and will not change the newspaper's pro-government, sensationalist editorial line. However, Mr Abedrop has never before shown any interest in newspapers, leading some to suspect his investment is politically motivated. 'He has bought the paper as an instrument of political control to protect his business interests,' says Mr Raymundo Riva Palacio, an editor of El Financiero newspaper. The sale of La Prensa comes as El Norte, the Monterrey-based newspaper, is forging ahead with Dollars 50m investment in producing a new Mexico City newspaper, even though Dow Jones, the parent company of the Wall Street Journal, has backed down from taking a 49 per cent equity inter-est. El Norte says the two sides are still talking about a 'strategic alliance in both print and electronic form', but Dow Jones's stake will be much less ambitious than originally planned.</p>

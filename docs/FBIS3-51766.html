			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 21 Jan (PL) -- Juan Contino, first secretary  of the Union of Young Communists [UJC], denied today the  existence of a generational struggle for political power in Cuba.    In an exclusive statement to PRENSA LATINA, Contino said  there is a tendency to talk about a generational succession,  which is an inappropriate term, because it implies: You got up  to here; now I will continue alone.    He said there are three generations of revolutionaries  living  together in Cuba, and far from disagreeing they agree fully  regarding principles, ideas, and goals of the revolutionary  process, which began in January 1959.    Contino, who is 33 years old and a member of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, also denied Cuban  society is facing a crisis of values.    Contino conceded, however, there are groups among the young  population (5.7 million people, ranging between 0 and 30 years  of age Cuba) that are involved in criminal activities, but this  is triggered by the difficult economic situation Cuba is facing.    Contino said the crime rate has increased as well as  displays  of social indiscipline and "jineterismo" (a local term to denote  a form of prostitution that is linked with tourism), but most of  these cases are isolated cases and not the general behavior of  young people.    Contino said that in the eyes of the UJC each individual  case  is undoubtedly a problem. He added the UJC is trying to  approach those youths who are involved in criminal activities,  so as to educate them.    Contino said there is a strong campaign against crime,  because in the difficult situation Cuba is facing, there is a  thin line between criminal and counterrevolutionary actions.    Contino said Cuban youths in general are highly motivated  politically, which shatters the argument that young people are  withdrawing from the revolutionary process.    Contino referred to relations with the young believers as  very good, and he confirmed relations with their organizations  are smooth.    The UJC was founded in April 1961 as a selective and leading  organization, and it has a membership of 550,000 from the entire  population of 3.1 million youths.</p>

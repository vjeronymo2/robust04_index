			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Burton - Other companies The UK fashion retail group, which includes such names as Debenhams, Top Man and Top Shop, Burtons and Principles, is expected on Thursday to report an increase in reported pre-tax profits, after exceptional items, from Pounds 30m to about Pounds 35m - but a fall in underlying profits. As last year's figure was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 11.9m to cover the costs of the move towards greater part-time working, pre-tax profits will actually have fallen.</p>

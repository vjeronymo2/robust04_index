			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Letter: Nationalist answers evade 'green' global problem Sir, It is surprising to hear Colin Hines, a Greenpeace activist, proposing purely national solutions to global and environmental problems ('The green view on subsidiarity', September 16). As the problems of Franco-German disputes over waste movements show, nationalist solutions shove the problem into somebody else's back yard. A practical subsidiarity would incorporate strong European guidelines with flexibility for national implementation. Only in this way can the European Community avoid the mistakes of the US. There, a multiplicity of state regulations has distorted the market and rendered entrepreneurial waste management practice uneconomical. The Franco-German example shows that trade and good environmental practice must go hand in hand. Subsidiarity on environmental issues means strong EC guidelines adaptable to local circumstances, not fresh trade barriers.

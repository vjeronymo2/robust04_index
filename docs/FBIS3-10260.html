The office led  by Senator Bernard Sansaricq is getting ready to vote on a  resolution regarding disciplinary measures aimed at the absent  senators. The resolution's preamble refers to articles of the  Constitution and the Senate's internal rules on penalizing  legislators who persist in skipping sessions for the purpose of  sabotaging the legislative power.    The first article of this resolution provides for suspension  with four months' loss of pay for senators whose behavior is  determined incomprehensible and irresponsible. The resolution  goes farther in its second article, providing for a commission  to investigate possible participation by the senators in  reinforcing the embargo and other sanctions against Haiti.    It should be noted that no voting has yet occurred on this  resolution, which is circulating in the Senate of the Republic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As part of the two-day visit to Dubrovnik of the  diplomatic corps accredited to Albania, talks were held in  Dubrovnik's Argentina hotel this afternoon between Croatian  Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader and Albanian Foreign  Minister Alfred Serreqi. After the talks Ivo Sanader gave the  following statement:    [Begin Sanader recording] It is true, as Albanian Foreign  Minister Serreqi said, we have met several times before, the  last time at the Crans Montana forum in Bucharest where we  exchanged our governments' official stands and viewpoints  regarding the crisis in the entire territory of southeastern  Europe. Our talks now were very pleasant and interesting and to  us also necessary, because we will put forward a request to the  UN General Assembly--as our public already knows--to include the  peaceful reintegration of the UNPA [UN Protected Area] into the  Republic of Croatia on the agenda of a session scheduled for the  third week of September.    For this item to be included in the agenda we will need help  from all countries and all our friends. To this aim our  Minister Granic sent Minister Serreqi a letter of support [as  heard]. We hope-- and we discussed it today---that Albania will  support this request by Croatia. I can say that the minister  promised us something of this kind.    This was one issue. Another one concerned bilateral  relations and the situation in the region, in both Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Kosovo,  and especially expectations linked with the plan that the  Contact Group will present at the beginning of July. I briefed  the minister on our stand regarding this matter and we agreed on  the whole about the key issues and ways in which the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina should be resolved. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Observer: Gogol-eyed Some light relief at last for Russian TV viewers less than wholly addicted to a gruesome Saturday evening series entitled Catastrophes of the Week, an undiluted diet of terrible accidents and human tragedies. The bright spot is New Year's eve, when the schedule promises a Russian version of the UK programme Spitting Image and its rubber puppets created to demolish the publicly pompous. Called Kukly - Puppets - the show will constitute a reprise of 1994, with star turns from the likes of Viktor Gerashchenko, hapless former governor of the central bank axed after October's rouble crisis. The mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, is also promised an outing. With his attachment to undertaking forays into the city's sewage system, he must be a parodist's gift.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTION OF MICHAEL MILKEN  </P> <P> It is interesting to compare Benjamin J. Stein's column "With Friends Like Mike  Milken . . . His LBO Advantage Is Cut From the Hides of Workers" to Paul Craig  Roberts' column "Junk Bond King Victim of Envy, Legal Lynching" (Op-Ed Page,  April 12).  </P> <P> In a nine-paragraph article, Roberts devotes one glowing and superficial  paragraph to analyzing the effect of Milken's machinations in the junk-bond  market. The other eight paragraphs amount to a rather shrill and  unsubstantiated outpouring of "moral" outrage at those who would dare attack  poor billionaire Mike Milken.  </P> <P> In comparison, Stein devotes his article to a close examination of the impact  that a leveraged buyout has on a company -- particularly on the employees. As  Stein correctly points out, leveraged buyouts are achieved through the use of  "high-yield bonds and other devices to finance takeovers of companies by their  managements or by outsiders." This then requires the acquired company, now  loaded with debt, to take draconian measures to streamline its operation in  order to service the debt. In other words, while Milken and the lawyers get  rich, workers are "laid off, cut back, and disenfranchised."  </P> <P> One can only wonder at the underlying motivation for Roberts fuming "moral"  indignation and consuming concern for Milken and his total lack of compassion  for the real victims of leveraged buyouts -- the workers.  </P> <P> LARRY SIEGEL  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTION BILL SOUNDLY DEFEATED  </P> <P> A measure to prohibit abortions in California after 24 weeks of pregnancy was  soundly defeated in the state Senate's health committee.  </P> <P> The measure by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) would have allowed abortion  after the sixth month of pregnancy only if the mother's life were in danger,  the fetus were seriously deformed or if doctors determined it couldn't live on  its own. Committee members didn't even bother to hear testimony from about 20  people who wanted to testify against the measure, acknowledging that they  already intended to vote against it. Not a single member voted for the measure,  and five voted against it.  </P></p>

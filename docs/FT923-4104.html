			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Insurance pay claim under fire THE UNION representing 220,000 employees in the western German insurance industry yesterday signalled its reluctance to exercise wage restraint and demanded a pay rise of 7.5 per cent for 1992-93. The Bonn-based insurance employers' association said the claim was too high, given difficult conditions prevailing both in the insurance sector and the German economy as a whole. The Bundesbank is urging settlements of around 3 per cent for next year. Mr Gerhard Renner of DAG, the white collar union representing private sector insurance workers, said the claim was justified in the light of rising business volume in the insurance industry, which would eventually feed its way into profits, and because of rising material burdens faced by employees. The claim does not cover insurance employees working in eastern Germany, who at present get 75 per cent of the wages paid to colleagues in the west.</p>

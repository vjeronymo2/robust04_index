			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jonathan Hill and Shiny Li] </F>   [Excerpt] Governor Chris Patten has thrown a veiled insult  at senior Beijing official Lu Ping, warning that any deliberate  attempt to avoid him during a visit to Hong Kong would be  perceived to be "small-minded". Mr Patten played down the  apparent snubs by Mr Lu, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, and the Bank of China yesterday, saying he did  not feel "particularly neglected".    Mr Lu, who arrives in the territory tomorrow, has rejected  an  invitation to meet Mr Patten to discuss transitional issues.  The Governor has also been left off the guest list of a Bank of  China ceremony on Monday to celebrate the issuing of Hong Kong  banknotes.    In an interview with the Sing Tao Group, Mr Patten said he  regretted Mr Lu's refusal to meet him. "If it was deliberate,  which I can't believe, I think it would seem to people to be  rather small-minded, so I can't believe that it is meant in that  way," Mr Patten said. "If he phoned up this afternoon we could  clear the diary."    Mr Patten said he wanted to discuss the government's  measures  for tackling property speculation with Mr Lu because the issue  straddled 1997. "It's partly because there are longer term  implications that I was very keen to discuss the issue very  candidly with Mr Lu," he said. "I think the people of Hong Kong  want to see us cooperating."    Mr Patten earlier responded to the Bank of China's snub,  saying he hoped everyone who had been invited to the ceremony  had a "smashing time". It was the second time the Governor was  snubbed by Chinese officials in 24 hours. Nevertheless, Mr  Patten continued to garner political points in suggesting that  Mr Lu was too busy to discuss the livelihood issues affecting  Hong Kong people in the transitional period.    Banking officials said earlier that Mr Patten was not on the  guest list for the ceremony because it was a financial matter  and therefore not appropriate to invite him. The Governor  stressed that financial officials from the Hong Kong government,  including the Director of the Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam,  would be free to attend if they wished. Financial Secretary Sir  Hamish Macleod embarks on a trip to Britain today and will not  attend. A number of Hong Kong officials had extremely good  working relationships with the financial -- authorities in China  and it "would be a shame if they weren't able to go to what is  an important ceremony," Mr Patten said.

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Dollars 400m Vietnamese gas study British Gas, TransCanada PipeLines and Japan's Mitsui signed a deal with the state oil company PetroVietnam for a feasibility study on a Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) project to open up Vietnam's natural gas market. The project will harness gas now flared off during oil production in Vietnam's Bach Ho (White Tiger) offshore field, southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, and bring it ashore. After extraction of liquid petroleum gas, 'lean gas' will be used for power generation and development of new industries, the companies said.</p>

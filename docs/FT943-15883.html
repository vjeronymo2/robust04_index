			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Quality of teacher training under fire The quality of teacher training provided by universities is to be subjected to new checks by the government, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, announced in the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes. In a move likely to arouse fresh controversy over political interference with academic freedom he said grants made to universities for teacher training courses would be conditional on access being given to members of the government's schools inspectorate. Mr Patten said: 'The bottom line will be no inspection, no funding.' He stressed that by attaching the requirement for inspection to the grant it would not be necessary to seek statutory authority in the education bill. Justifying the new approach, Mr Patten referred to a recent report that said almost half of newly appointed primary school teachers felt ill-equipped to teach English. The bill was given a third reading by a government majority of 35 (284-249),and now returns to the Lords.</p>

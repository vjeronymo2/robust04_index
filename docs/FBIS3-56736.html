			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" No. 11 feature] </F>   [Text] According to Interfax's sources, President Boris  Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin are now  discussing the set up of a new Russian government.    The president had accepted the resignation of Yegor Gaydar  who told Interfax that he more or less knew who would be serve  in the government. In his view, Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays,  a member of Russia's Choice, should not resign while Vice  Premier and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov should.    Officials in Fedorov's secretariat told Interfax Tuesday  that  he had rejected the prime minister's offer to stay as finance  minister in the reorganized government but had not resigned  either of his positions.    When he met Chernomyrdin Monday, Fedorov demanded special  powers in pursuing his financial and economic policy "in line  with what he was promised when he was appointed vice premier in  1992."    Fedorov told Interfax that he could stay "as just the  finance  minister" if there was just one first premier, Oleg Soskovets,  but not if there are four or five vice premiers.    He confirmed that he had also demanded that Aleksandr  Zaveryukha should not be a vice premier and Viktor Gerashchenko,  governor of the Central Bank of Russia.    Fedorov's aides told Interfax that he sent a letter to  Yeltsin Tuesday morning outlining his view of the situation and  conditions on which he would agree to stay in the government.    Meanwhile, an informed source in the government told  Interfax  that Chernomyrdin had decided not to have Fedorov in the  government "on his conditions."    The same source says that this opinion is shared by the  president.</p>

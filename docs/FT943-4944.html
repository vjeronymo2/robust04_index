			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil plunges 8.6% as minister quits Sao Paulo plunged 8.6 per cent in heavy midday trading as investors sold on concern that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidential candidacy would be damaged by the resignation of Mr Rubens Ricupero as economy minister, writes Michael Morgan. The Bovespa index fell 4,630 to 49,045 at 1300 local time in turnover of RDollars 216.5m (Dollars 243.5m), but foreign selling was said to be limited by the Labor Day holiday in the US. In earlier London trading, Brazilian stocks traded as ADRs were marked as much as 10 per cent lower from the prices at which they had closed on Friday on Wall Street. Mr Robert Barclay of Baring Securities commented that uncertainty about any action by the electoral authority, over whether to permit Mr Cardoso's candidature to continue, would overhang the market until a decision was announced. He expected the market to fall by as much as 20 per cent over the next two weeks, especially as it was already looking for an excuse to take profits. Mr Barclay added that he still expected the PSDB party to recover from the crisis and for Mr Cardoso to be elected as president, which would prompt a sharp market rebound in share prices before the end of the year. Equities had shot up to last week's level on confidence that Mr Cardoso would win the October 3 presidential vote. The Bovespa index had risen 24.5 per cent in August.</p>

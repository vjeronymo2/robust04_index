			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Playgroups for politicians British tax-payers are about to spend more on teaching under-fives. Do not hesitate. Rush out and buy. Pick companies heavily into egg-boxes, water-colours, paint sets, plastic bricks, and sharp objects suitable for throwing at random. The auction for the tots' vote has begun. Mr John Major made his bid at the Conservative conference in October. Good quality pre-school places will in due course be provided for four-year-olds whose parents want to take them up. What? Reluctant to invest in the prime minister? Not a penny? Have no fear. Labour's policy is more expansionary than Mr Major's, and just as cheap. The opposition offers universal nursery education - without increasing any taxes, you understand. Taxes? Heaven forfend] On the government side the education secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, is inventing a means of delivering her boss's careful promise. She is juggling a familiar mix of potential providers: playgroups, private and voluntary establishments, and local education authorities. Choice will be her slogan. Let us decide upon the basis of what would be educationally beneficial, she will say. You can bet on at least a few more places for four-year-olds before the next election. Her Labour opposite number, Mr David Blunkett, has a more complicated task. He is preparing to reposition Labour's policy, so that it may become a close replica of the Conservative scheme, while looking different. He is working with the same list of providers as Mrs Shephard, but appears to want 'integration', favouring elected authorities while not upsetting the powerful voluntary movements or challenging the existence of private nurseries. Choice will be his implied slogan. The word-play used to express Labour's strategy once it is settled should be a source of infinite delight. Mr Blunkett's boss looks with greater favour on schools that have opted out of local education authority control than I suspect Mrs Shephard does, yet the process of converting the people's party is turning out to be predictably tedious. The main difficulty is this: Labour is lying under its blanket, keeping perfectly still, not daring to breathe, deeply afraid that it might wake up and find that what has been happening to the Conservative party is all a dream. Meanwhile there is movement in the room. The deputy director of the Centre for Policy Studies, that well-known nutter, has come thumping along to say that she favours a voucher system for nursery education. 'Nutter?' I would have patience with the critics of Dr Sheila Lawlor, some of whom are to be found among her supposed Conservative allies, were it not for the awkward fact that from time to time she is right. She is half-right on this occasion, as we shall see in a moment. The centre she deputy-directs was inspired by the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who once undertook to provide universal pre-school tuition. The lady never got around to it. Nor did Lord Joseph, who has just died. He founded the CPS, and helped Dr Lawlor prepare her latest pamphlet*. As with her, his political sanity was often in doubt; for which we should be grateful. It was his charm, as it is her saving grace. I recall several long conversations with the then Sir Keith, in particular one in the early 1970s, in which he said that he would love to be secretary for education but feared that if he followed his instincts in that post the teachers would march round his offices and pelt him with rotten vegetables. At the time he was secretary for social services. A decade later he was moved to education but, alas, failed to change much. The protest marches did not take place. It would have been a triumph if they had. He too proposed a voucher system, but for 5 to 16-year-olds, not toddlers as in the case of Dr Lawlor. This was derided as mad, but what is the logic of the system of open enrolment in state schools if not to attach the money to the pupil rather than the academy? Yet Dr Lawlor is half-wrong this time. She sees local education authorities as inherently evil wasters of money and purveyors of politically-correct schooling designed to shape society. Kindergartens controlled by Labour-run education authorities would turn out what were once called in the trade 'state babies'. Dr Lawlor knows how to defend us from her nightmare. Give parents Pounds 700 a year in vouchers, she argues, allow them to contribute as much again from their own pockets, and the private and voluntary academies could capture the market. You can hear Mrs Shephard and Mr Blunkett in chorus: 'But vouchers are so cumbersome'. Perhaps they are. Deployed as Dr Lawlor proposes they would constitute an elaborate mechanism for circulating money from all tax payers to middle class parents, which she implicitly rejects. A means-tested voucher system, which would help children of low-income parents, is dismissed on the ground that it 'would go against the tradition in this country of providing free schooling'. In effect, it would also be a levy on middle and higher income tax payers. That, however, is the point. The results of studies in the US suggest that children in poor families in city centres do better if given a 'head start' in a nursery. Dr Lawlor questions the applicability of these conclusions to the general population (and indeed doubts the research methodology), but the evidence is strongest when applied to the least well off. Here is Mr Blunkett's opportunity, as indeed Mrs Shephard's. The latter has not ruled out any system, yet. She, and he, should promise vouchers for poor families. Both could explain to their separate constituencies why a variety of school organising principles, state and voluntary, suits the mood of the times. Both might profit from Dr Lawlor's observation of the French, who educate the majority of their toddlers in state schools, but 11.8 per cent privately. The basis for their success, she says, is 'a greater consensus between state, teachers and parents than in Britain - a shared confidence in a system which favours the transmission of knowledge and rigorous but distinct academic or vocational education, and reflects a long tradition of enlightened state control of schools'. We can't emulate that, she argues. We could try. * Nursery Choices. CPS. Pounds 5 from 52 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU.</p>

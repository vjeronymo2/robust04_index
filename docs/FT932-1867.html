			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (11): Locked out of the new market - Michael Smith on the imminent collapse of the remnants of Britain's once great coal industry SUCH WAS the public furore over the UK government's pit closures programme last October that it seemed that only a fundamental change on energy policy could get ministers off the hook. Six months later, however, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, won parliamentary support for a programme which was remarkably similar to that which led to the original decision to close 31 pits. Although 12 of the pits were reprieved and another six mothballed, the stay of execution for some, and probably most, will be short, and British Coal has already given notice that it wants to close three. The problem is that the government did little to create the room in the market essential for their survival. That means that towards the end of the century, the fuel constituents for electricity, the main market for coal, will be used in much the same proportions as were envisaged before last October. Coal will still be the largest element, with perhaps 40 to 50 per cent of electricity in England and Wales being made from it. But that compares with about 70 per cent in 1990. The difference is mainly accounted for by the growth of gas, which may claim 25 per cent of the market against nothing at the beginning of the decade. Nuclear power, strengthened by the opening of the Sizewell B plant and improved efficiency, has the potential to increase its 23 per cent market share. Coal has been in constant decline since the second world war but few production drops have been as steep as that between last year, when 65m tonnes went to the generators, and next. So far at least British Coal has the promise of only 30m tonnes in 1994-5. The fate of the 12 reprieved pits depends largely on how much more the corporation can persuade the generators to take, but this is unlikely to be more than 8m tonnes, enough to sustain perhaps half of the dozen pits and none of the further six which have been mothballed. The sharp sales drop is down to two main factors. The first is that the economics of building power stations are such that all new power stations under construction or being planned will be gas-fired. The government's coal review sparked vigorous debate about whether electricity from new gas stations was cheaper than that from existing coal plants, but the generators have no doubt about which form of electricity is cheaper if building a plant from scratch. PowerGen, the generator, says the 900MW station it has opened at Killingholme, Humberside, this year has taken three years to build, half the time a coal plant would take. The station will be run by 36 people, less than a fifth of the staff needed for a conventional coal-fired station. But if that helps explain why gas is preferred by generators it does not in itself account for the extraordinary speed of the dash for gas. There is a surplus of electricity in the UK; so why build more plants so soon? The answer has its roots three to four years ago when electricity was privatised. The move to gas would probably have happened anyway. But it has been speeded by the government's creation of just two generating companies. Fears of the two companies exercising a duopoly influenced regional electricity companies in deciding whether to help build gas-fired generating plants; 11 of the 12 have done so. Their participation was essential because they can provide guaranteed markets for the output. Supporters of the coal industry say the competition from gas is unfair because the recs (regional electricity companies) can pass on the costs of the electricity they produce to consumers. The recs, after all, have signed 15 year contracts with the gas generation companies they partly owned but only five year deals with the coal industry. However, the UK electricity regulator has ruled that the recs made sound economic decisions in setting up the plants. In the coal review ministers came under strong pressure from the parliamentary industry select committee to restrict the access of gas to the electricity market. As if to emphasise its rejection of this approach, the government, on the day the white paper was published, gave planning consent to a large gas-fired generator at Connah's Quay in North Wales. In doing so it was able to emphasise its free market approach. More important, a halt on the dash-for-gas could have landed the government with a myriad of compensation claims. It had, after all, always encouraged the recs' diversification and the move into gas generation. Ministers potentially had more leeway with nuclear power, as it owns all the major nuclear companies, including Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear. Again it resisted any curbs on future generation. Failing to bring Sizewell B in Suffolk on stream was never a serious consideration but at one stage the ageing magnox reactors appeared in danger. Again money was a primary consideration. Closing them early would have hit inflows into the Treasury at a time when public finances are tight. Perhaps in an attempt to balance this lack of action, the government claimed some success in cutting back orimulsion, the bitumen based fuel imported from Venezuela. The coal white paper suggested that Venezuela had volunteered a cut of 500,000 tonnes of coal equivalent a year. This was at the margins anyway and would not save even one pit. Shortly afterwards, however, BP Bitor, sole importer of the fuel, said it expected existing sale levels to continue. So what did the white paper change? The major difference between the October plan and that now in place is that the government has introduced the idea of subsidies. It says it will foot the bill between imported coal prices and those produced from the 12 reprieved pits. The caveat is that British Coal must first find a market for them. Given that the UK last year imported 20m tonnes of coal, that in theory should not prove too onerous. However, at least half of the imported product is of a specialist nature not easily accessible in the UK. That perhaps means that 10m tonnes can be displaced by UK coal. The hope is that by the time the subsidy is withdrawn, at the time of the coal industry's privatisation within two years, some of the reprieved mines will have got the costs down to a level where they can compete effectively with imports. Perhaps some of the mines that British Coal no longer wants will be able to compete with imports in the private sector. However, few analysts believe that more than a handful of the reprieved or closing mines will survive in the long term.</p>

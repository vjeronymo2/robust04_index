			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Proposals override the statutory indexation - Income tax allowances and assessments The rates of income tax, the personal allowance and the married couple's allowance for those under 65, the basic rate limit above which higher rate tax is paid and the income limit for age-related allowances will remain at current levels for 1994-95. The chancellor said that, from April 6, 1994, he would increase the blind person's allowance by Pounds 120 to Pounds 1,200, and restrict relief for the married couple's allowance, and the other allowances and reliefs linked to it, to 15 per cent. The married couple's allowance for those under 65 and related allowances will be held at current levels, but the age-related married couple's allowance will rise by Pounds 330, for 1995-96. The Treasury said: 'These measures will have an overall yield of Pounds 550m in 1994-95 and Pounds 1.55bn in 1995-96. 'The chancellor's proposals will mean that the statutory indexation provisions will be overridden. These provisions adjust the main allowances and tax thresholds in line with the percentage increase in the retail prices index unless Parliament decides otherwise. 'In the March Budget the former chancellor announced that relief on the married couple's allowance would be restricted to 20 per cent for 1994-95. At the same time, the age-related married couple's allowance for those aged 65 and over would be increased by Pounds 200, so that the extra tax paid by the elderly as a result of this change would be no greater than for people aged under 65 on similar incomes. The former chancellor announced that for 1994-95 the lower rate band would be increased by Pounds 500 to Pounds 3,000. 'The increase of Pounds 330 in the age-related married couple's allowance for 1995-96 will ensure that the extra tax paid by the elderly as a result of the further restriction of the allowance to 15 per cent is no greater than for people aged under 65. 'The restriction of the married couple's allowance to give relief at 20 per cent in 1994-95 and 15 per cent in 1995-96 will apply to the allowances and reliefs which are set at the same level as the married couple's allowance for those aged under 65, that is: the additional personal allowance (mainly for single parents); the widow's bereavement allowance (given to a widow in the year of her husband's death and the following year); and the relief for maintenance payments to a divorced or separated spouse. 'The increase in the blind person's allowance is the first for four years. The allowance is given to people who are registered blind. In Scotland or Northern Ireland, where there is no register, the equivalent requirement is that a person must be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential. There are about 30,000 claimants. 'People making maintenance payments currently qualify for tax relief at their marginal rate on the amounts they pay, up to a limit of Pounds 1,720. As announced in the March Budget, the relief on these payments is due to be reduced to 20 per cent from April 6, 1994. From April 6, 1995 the rate of relief will be further reduced to 15 per cent. 'People who entered into maintenance arrangements before March 15, 1988 may currently qualify for relief at their marginal rate of tax on payments up to the total amount on which they received relief in 1988-89. The relief they receive on the first Pounds 1,720 of their payments will be restricted to 20 per cent for 1994-95 and to 15 per cent for 1995-96. Any payments between Pounds 1,720 and the 1988-89 limit will continue to qualify for relief at the payer's marginal rate. 'In general, the tax treatment of people receiving maintenance payments is not affected by the proposed changes, regardless of when their arrangements were made. 'Relief will be withdrawn on any maintenance payments made to or for the benefit of children when they reach 21, in the minority of cases where relief would currently continue beyond that age. The change will take effect from the date of the child's 21st birthday where it occurs on or after April 6, 1994. 'The yield in 1994-95 from holding allowances and the basic rate limit unchanged will be about Pounds 550m (compared with an indexed base). 'The yield from the measures announced for 1995-96; restricting the married couple's allowance for those aged under 65 and related allowances to 15 per cent; keeping these allowances at the same amount; and increasing the age-related married couple's allowance by Pounds 330; will be about Pounds 830m in 1995-96, rising to about Pounds 1,030m in a full year. 'The restriction of the value of the married couple's allowance and linked allowances and reliefs will be implemented for employees by making a reduction in their PAYE tax codes. The amount of the reduction will depend on their marginal rate of tax and hence on an estimate of their income. If in the event this estimate proves to be incorrect it will be put right at the end of the tax year. Codes for 1994-95 taking account of these restrictions will be issued early in 1994, when taxpayers will be given a fuller explanation. For taxpayers not covered by PAYE, the restriction in relief will be made in assessments or in calculating repayments. 'The chancellor proposes to restrict to 15 per cent the relief on mortgage interest paid from 6 April 1995. 'The rate of tax relief on interest paid on certain loans used for the purchase of life annuities by elderly people will not be affected by the chancellor's proposal. Relief at the basic rate of tax will continue to be available to people over 65 who take out loans to buy these life annuities.' The chancellor announced proposals for reforms to the system for assessing personal tax. The Inland Revenue said: 'The legislation proposed for the 1994 Finance Bill will: replace the preceding year basis of income tax for the self-employed with the simpler current year basis. The change will have immediate effect for businesses starting after April 5, 1994, while existing businesses will move to the new basis for the tax year 1997-98; allow all those who complete tax returns for 1996-97 and later years to calculate their own liability to income tax and capital gains tax, if they wish; introduce a uniform set of dates for the payment of income tax and capital gains tax, starting from January 31, 1998. The proposals will affect the 9m or so people expected to receive tax returns in April 1997. Under the new proposals taxpayers who receive returns will be invited to work out their own income tax and capital gains tax liability from the tax year 1996-97 onwards. They will have to send their tax return and tax calculation by January 31 following the end of the tax year. Taxpayers can however ask the Inland Revenue to work out the amount of tax due if they submit their returns by an earlier date (September 30). The arrangements for collection of tax through PAYE and deduction at source will remain broadly unchanged. Where income tax above a certain amount has to be paid directly, two interim payments will be due on January 31 in the year of assessment and July 31 following. The balance of any income tax together with any capital gains tax will be due at the same time as the return is submitted on the following 31 January 31. In the majority of cases payments and returns received by the Inland Revenue will be accepted without question. The Revenue will then have broadly one year in which to raise enquiries into those returns. The same rules will apply broadly speaking to companies, to come into effect not earlier than for accounting periods ending after March 31, 1996. For the self-employed, tax will be charged by reference to the profits of the 12-month accounting period ending in the tax year. This will in most cases allow a taxpayer to self-assess tax liability by reference to one period of accounts only. But the profits arising in the first tax year of a business will be assessed for that year. The rules for the transition to the new system of taxing the self-employed will allow the profits for the transitional year 1996-97 to be assessed on the average of profits for that year and the previous one. Businesses which start up after 5 April 5, 1994 will go straight on to the new current-year basis. Details of these rules will be contained in the 1994 Finance Bill. Under the new arrangements each individual partner in a business will be assessed on his or her share of the partnership profits. The changes will affect new businesses starting after April 5, 1994 and the computation of profits for existing businesses in accounting periods starting normally in the tax year 1994-95.</p>

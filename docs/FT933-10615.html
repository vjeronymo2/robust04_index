			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sibelco extends hostile bid for Watts Blake SIBELCO has extended its hostile Pounds 87m offer for Watts Blake Bearne, the world's biggest supplier of ball clay. The private Belgian group, which produces silica sand for the glass industry, said it had received acceptances representing 0.6 per cent of Watts' shares, bringing the total controlled or owned to 45.7 per cent. Sibelco was now seeking control, an adviser said, although previously the group had said Stock Exchange requirements to make an offer once a holding had gone above 30 per cent was the impetus for its bid. If the Belgian company does not win control, it may buy up to 1 per cent a year without making a second offer. Sibelco was determined to hold on to its investment, an adviser said. Watts yesterday welcomed the small number of acceptances as proof that the bid undervalued the company. It added that it regretted 'the further period of uncertainty' the extension would cause. Watts has been on the block since January when three shareholders, including Sibelco, decided to sell their stakes, totalling 45.2 per cent. When no buyer was found, Sibelco launched its own bid at 420p a share in June. Ceramics Holdings, with 15.6 per cent, accepted the bid, while Quarzwerke of Germany, with 14.8 per cent, agreed to act in concert with Sibelco.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government  said on Friday Japan should take a proper action in connection  with Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's recent remarks on Japan's  role during World War II regardless of his retraction of the  remarks Friday.    Nagano was reported to have apologized over and retracted  his  controversial remarks, saying, "My recent remarks about the past  history were not appropriate ... I am retracting the statement  in its entirety."    The Japanese minister earlier said Japan fought during World  War II to "liberate Asian colonies from Europe" and the massacre  said to have been committed by the Japanese Army in Nanjing,  China was a "hoax."    A Seoul Government official said in a comment that "we can  hardly regard Nagano's retraction as having completely rectified  the distorted view of past history on the part of an incumbent  Japanese cabinet member."    "We expect the Japanese Government to make an official  clarification and take a proper action as Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu asked Tokyo earlier in the day," the official said.    Press reports from Tokyo indicated that in a press  conference  in Tokyo Nagano regretted it that his remarks set off public  uproars in South Korea, China and some other relevant countries.    Stating he was feeling responsible for his remarks, Nagano  said that he would leave the issue of whether he would resign as  justice minister to the judgement of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : PENELOPE ANN MILLER: FRESHMAN UP AGAINST BRANDO AND DENIRO  </P> <P> "The Freshman's" Penelope Ann Miller has, mercifully, but a single scene with  the feisty, tail-snapping, eight-foot Komodo dragon-impersonating lizard around  which the plot revolves. The downside is that Miller must share the screen with  a far more terrifying presence: Marlon Brando.  </P> <P> "I wasn't intimidated by him at all," says the L.A. native of the legendary  actor. "In fact, I found him to be very friendly and sweet. When I met him, he  gave me a big bear hug. . . . He cracked a couple of my ribs."  </P> <P> She had the gumption to darken her hair for the audition. You see, a sandy  blonde just doesn't cut it portraying the daughter of New York "importer"  Carmine Sabatini.  </P> <P> Miller has done plenty in features, TV and on the stage, but she is still  enough of an unknown to be in an American Express commercial. Not for long,  though. The daughter of actor-filmmaker Mark Miller is teamed with Robert  DeNiro and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the soon-to-be-released "Awakenings" and  "Kindergarten Cop."  </P> <P> "You never really know how you're gonna feel when it happens," says Miller of  the fame thing that seems to loom. "I don't get recognized very much because I  look so different in my movies. I'd rather be acknowledged for my work than for  me as a personality."  </P> <P> There was a familial atmosphere on the set of this little comedy. Because of  that, Miller, like almost everyone else, was floored when Brando called it  "terrible, a stinker," soon after production ceased. Brando later withdrew his  critique, but damage was done.  </P> <P> "I was definitely shocked. I mean, everybody was," says Miller. "Nobody  expected it, because that wasn't our experience. That wasn't his experience, so  we didn't understand what happened.  </P> <P> "We thought: 'Is this a joke?' " DAVID PECCHIA  </P></p>

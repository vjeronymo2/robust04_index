			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Passions run high over Canadian forest - An increasingly bitter battle between fellers and conservationists THE BATTLE for British Columbia's majestic cedar, hemlock and Douglas fir trees is being waged with especial ferocity over a scenic web of forests and waterways on the west coast of Vancouver Island, known as Clayoquot Sound. The passions were evident last weekend when police arrested three people suspected of setting fire to a bridge leading to the forests. Environmental activists have been blamed for several other acts of violence. Another bridge was destroyed by arson two years ago and on the night that the town council of Tofino, the community closest to the sound, voted to support logging in the area earlier this year a fishing boat on the local beach was set on fire. Fearing another outbreak of violence, the Vancouver police were out in force last month at the hotel where MacMillan Bloedel, one of two companies at the centre of the Clayoquot Sound storm, held its annual meeting. Radical environmental groups have already threatened to 'spike' trees in the Clayoquot Sound forests with metal stakes this summer. The spikes pose a serious hazard to loggers and diminish a tree's commercial value. British Columbia's social-democrat government tried to defuse the tensions in mid-April by spelling out a compromise which met some, but not all, the demands of logging companies and their workers on the one hand, and conservationists on the other. But the battle for Clayoquot Sound is far from over. MacMillan Bloedel expects to be bogged down for at least a year in negotiating the details of how it will cut down the trees that the government has agreed to set aside for commercial logging. Mr Dan Miller, British Columbia's forests minister, concurs that 'it will take some time for the companies to design these plans and to submit them to us for approval'. The conservationists, for their part, plan to fight MacMillan Bloedel and International Forest, the other company whose cutting licence includes Clayoquot Sound, every step of the way. 'We will watch everything and challenge everything,' says Ms Vicki Husband, director of the Sierra Club of Western Canada and one of the sharpest thorns in the side of the British Columbian forestry industry. The province's government last monthasked a senior judge to examine allegations that it created a conflict of interest by buying a sizeable block of MacMillan Bloedel shares at the same time as it was coming to a decision on Clayoquot Sound. The forests of the 262,000-hectare sound are not only important in themselves to both sides but also epitomise the wider questions in the debate on forestry and the environment: to what extent should trees be cut down to maintain jobs and investments in forests and saw-mills? Or should the forests be preserved entirely for wildlife, environmentalists and tourists? MacMillan Bloedel says the sound would provide about 10 per cent of the annual feedstock required by its mills at nearby Port Alberni. The company already faces reductions of up to 14 per cent in tree-cutting licences for other provincially-owned forests supplying the Alberni mills. The timber industry also worries that the wrangle at Clayoquot Sound is part of a developing pattern of endless negotiation, harassment and, increasingly, violence which have come to bedevil logging operations across the west coast of North America. More than two years ago, the provincial government divided the nearby - and equally picturesque - Carmanah Valley between working forests and wilderness areas. But operations there remain suspended as the authorities and the companies haggle over detailed working plans. Environmental activists see it differently. Ms Husband describes Clayoquot Sound as 'a very rare and valuable eco-system', which is one of the biggest original temperate rain forests remaining along the west coast. Armed with detailed maps, she demonstrates how logging has denuded old-growth forests on Vancouver Island. 'They've raped and pillaged, to put it mildly,' Ms Husband says. Under the government's mid-April decision, about a third of the sound would be permanently off-limits to commercial forestry. Some 45 per cent would be available for logging, while 17 per cent would be 'special management areas' where especially strict tree-cutting rules would apply to protect scenic corridors, wildlife habitats and recreation areas. The government has promised to ensure that harvesting is carried out 'sustainably'. It plans, for instance, to restrict the size of clear-cuts, insist on greater use of helicopters to carry out felled logs and to set aside substantial buffer zones between tourist areas and logging activity. The cost of cutting trees in Clayoquot Sound is thus likely to be high. The companies warn that this may encourage such undesirable practices as 'high-grading', in which only the most valuable trees are removed. None the less, MacMillan Bloedel is satisfied that the government's decision is the best it could realistically hope for. Mr Patrick Armstrong, a consultant whose clients include several British Columbian forestry companies, says that it 'is a win for the forest sector if you put it in the context of the times, the issues and the pressures that were being applied'. But the government has promised to double the area of land set aside for parks and wildlife refuges to 12 per cent of the province. Mr Armstrong echoes the industry's concern that the tug-of-war over Clayoquot could be the forerunner of a multitude of similar battles.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: John Menzies shows sharp improvement to Pounds 3.8m MR JOHN Menzies, chairman of the Edinburgh-based retail and wholesale group which bears his name, said the company had 'produced a result which is satisfactory within the overall economic environment' when it revealed a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 3.8m in the six months to October 31. The shares rose 16p to 482p. In August, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission initiated an investigation  -scheduled to be completed by July - into the wholesale distribution of newspapers in England and Wales, territories where, according to Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, group managing director, Menzies has a market share of about 16.5 per cent. He said he was confident of a 'favourable outcome', stressing that the MMC's brief was for newspapers only, not magazines and periodicals, and did not cover Scotland, where Menzies is strong. Its UK market share is about 20 per cent. On the distribution side, Mr Noel-Paton said that turnover at John Menzies Wholesale rose 12 per cent. TBD, now including Hammick's book wholesale division since the sale of the Hammick's retail bookshop chain, saw turnover fall, partly because of the drop in consumer demand for recorded music. Mr Noel-Paton said this was a recessionary downturn, but also influenced by the impact of video games and a lack of availability of good new product - 'it's hard to get too excited by the latest compilation of Abba hits'. Turnover at Universal Office Supplies was up 12 per cent 'in a flat market', and 20 per cent when RMG, acquired for about Pounds 2.5m from Waverley Cameron in August, was included. The 274-strong John Menzies retail chain was 'resilient' with turnover 'flat in real terms', though it traded below budget. The 171 Early Learning Centres in the UK achieved a 10 per cent turnover rise 'with no erosion of margin'. Apart from the small wholesale business which was sold to its management, Early Learning Inc, the US operation, will be completely closed by the end of February. Mr Noel-Paton said: 'We did everything possible to effect a sale and led a lot of horses to water, but none of them drank.' Group turnover grew to Pounds 531.9m (Pounds 489.3m) and interest charges fell Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 1.6m. Earnings emerged at 2.9p (0.9p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.8p (3.6p).</p>

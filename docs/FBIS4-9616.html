			<p>BFN     [Text] Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the Croatian delegation for  talks with Serbs in the occupied areas, and head of the state  delegation for relations with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces], has sent a letter to Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary  general's special envoy, concerning the results achieved in the  implementation of the 29 March cease-fire agreement and problems  in this connection, as well as the normalization of  Croatian-Serbian relations on the entire territory of the  Republic of Croatia. The letter reads, inter alia:    The main precondition on which the talks were based was that  the cease-fire agreement was only the first step toward the  normalization of relations, after which talks were scheduled to  take place on the opening of roads, oil pipeline, long-distance  power lines -- i.e. on the normalization of the economic  situation. The final part of the talks concerns the political  solution: The inclusion of UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] in the  legal and economic system of Croatia. The sovereignty of the  Republic of Croatia has never been called into question and that  was the clear and resolute stand of the international community.    In keeping with the cease-fire agreement, the Croatian side  has so far implemented all points of the agreement within the  agreed deadline. The Serbian side failed to fulfill numerous  obligations that it took upon itself -- we single out the  withdrawal of heavy weapons and the separation of forces -- and  it rejected the work of the police, in accordance with the  proposal of UNPROFOR's civilian sector.    All this goes to show that only a small part of the  agreement  has been implemented and that its key points have not been  implemented in full. For this reason the UNPROFOR could not say  that the implementation of the agreement was proceeding well and  that both sides had a positive approach to and a desire to  implement it.    In response to our frequent demands that the agreed  obligations must be met, the UNPROFOR asked us to be patient and  give the Serbian side time. In our assessment the Serbian side  has been stalling the implementation of the agreement  intentionally, ultimately wishing to avoid its obligations. The  key tasks laid down in the agreement were not implemented by the  time of the last session of the joint delegation, held on 23  April.    An agreement on the place where the new meeting is to be  held  has not been reached either. The Serb side has put forward as  its condition for resuming negotiations the abolition of a part  of a UN Security Council resolution regarding the supervision of  imports and exports of goods on the occupied territories of  Croatia.    Even though the official representatives of the Croatian  authorities have been trying to create a favorable climate for  negotiations, the Serb representatives have been creating  extreme tensions. In addition, they have been trying to equate  the cease-fire agreement with the settlement between the two  states, their goal being the Cypriotization of the Republic of  Croatia, Hrvoje Sarinic writes in his letter to Yasushi Akashi,  adding that Martic, Mikelic and others have been speaking about  the need to open up the process of succession, about access to  the sea, a corridor to Hungary, Slovenia, and so on.    Their demand that meetings be held only on the border  between  the occupied and the free areas or abroad is also indicative.  There are no indications today when the next meeting could be  held, even though we proposed that negotiations may be held in  Knin, Plitvice, or in any place in Croatia.    We are aware of the connection between the situation in  Bosnia- Herzegovina and behavior of the Serbs living in the  occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia, but we are also  convinced that such behavior and arrogance should no longer be  tolerated and that there will be no positive results until the  international community has forced the Serbs to comply with the  resolutions and agreements that they have signed, not to flout  everything and make a mockery of everybody and not be punished  for it.    From our viewpoint, the establishment of the supervision of  borders, as envisaged by UN Security Council Resolution 769, is  a condition without which it is impossible to bring the  situation back to normal and create conditions for the  resolution of the crisis, as links between Belgrade and Knin are  stronger than ever before.</p>

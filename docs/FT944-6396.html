			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Reformers favoured Mr Ernesto Zedillo is this evening expected to name reform-minded politicians to many of the key positions in his cabinet, writes Damian Fraser. Rumours were circulating yesterday that Mr Esteban Moctezuma, a close aide of Mr Zedillo who has established good relations with the opposition, would be appointed to the powerful post of interior minister. Top positions also seemed assured for pro-reform economists such as Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the current trade minister, Mr Luis Tellez, Mr Zedillo's main adviser on government policy, Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the deputy finance minister, and Mr Jose Angel Gurria, the former debt negotiator. Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, has decided not to accept a position in the cabinet for personal reasons, according to a report in yesterday's El Universal newspaper. After President Carlos Salinas, Mr Aspe was the leading figure in pushing for economic reform over the past decade. Expectations that many of President Salinas's reformist government ministers would remain in office has contributed to the recent rebound in the stock market. Yesterday short-term interest rates fell by 10 basis points to 13.85 per cent.</p>

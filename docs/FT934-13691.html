			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Positive factors offset by mild profit-taking Wall Street US SHARE prices ended a directionless session in negative territory yesterday as continued profit-taking outweighed the positive impact of good economic news and a late bond market rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6.99 at 3,635.32. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.23 to 466.22, while the American SE composite finished 5.00 down at 476.10. The Nasdaq composite, which has been the year's strongest performer, was especially hard hit by profit-taking, surrendering 14.20 at 768.71. NYSE volume amounted to 296m shares. In recent weeks secondary and broader indices have outperformed the Dow as investors searched for inexpensive stocks and shied away from the shares of companies whose earnings are tied closely to economic cycles. This trend pushed the S &amp; P 500, the Amex composite and the Nasdaq composite to record highs, while the Dow stayed below its all-time peak. In the last two days the trend has been reversed, with Dow stocks faring well and secondary and other issues falling from their recent summits. This partly explains why Dow and cyclical stocks were mostly firmer in early trading yesterday, while shares of medium-sized and small companies and growth-oriented technology firms languished. By mid-afternoon, however, even prices of cyclical and blue chip stocks began to lose ground. They ended the day rooted in negative territory, in spite of some good economic news - housing starts rose strongly in September  -and a recovery in bond prices that pushed bond yields lower. Philip Morris fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 in volume of 4.3m shares after reporting a 25 per cent drop in net income for the third quarter and warning about further difficulties in the fourth quarter. Analysts attributed some of the selling to profit-taking. Citicorp rose more than Dollars 1 in early trading before easing to end just Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 35 3/4 , following news of a sharp improvement in third-quarter earnings to 97 cents a share. Brokerage and investment banking stocks continued to tumble on concern about future profits. Merrill Lynch gave up Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 93 1/2 , Paine-Webber fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 3/8 and JP Morgan slipped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 72. A range of industrial shares helped to support the Dow: among them Caterpillar advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 82 1/2 , Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 5/8 and Sears Roebuck Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 56 3/8 . Canada TORONTO closed lower in moderate trading, the market having receded from record highs after 10 straight sessions of gains. The TSE 300 index shed 14.0 to 4,174.7 and falls led rises by 423 to 341 after volume of 51.6m shares.</p>

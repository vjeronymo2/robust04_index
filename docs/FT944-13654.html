			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Conseco delays Kemper takeover Conseco, the US life insurance group, yesterday said it would not complete its planned Dollars 2.7bn acquisition of Kemper this year, due to a delay in lining up finance for the bid. The news follows growing uncertainty in recent weeks about the financial backing for the highly-leveraged transaction. In spite of the delay, Conseco said its bid would go ahead, and that it was still 'exploring' the sale of one or more of its life insurance company holdings to reduce the debt portion of the deal. 'With or without asset sales, we remain confident that financing for the acquisition of Kemper will be available on terms acceptable to Conseco,' said Mr Stephen Hilbert, chairman. If it does not sell assets, Conseco's high debt level after the acquisition would almost certainly lead to a downgrade of its credit standing by the rating agencies, adding to its borrowing costs. The company has already received commitments from banks for Dollars 1.2bn of debt to back the Kemper takeover. Under the terms of that loan, any cash raised by the sale of the life company interests would be used to repay part of the bank debt. Conseco is also planning to begin selling Dollars 750m of junk bonds early next month. This part of the fund-raising is backed by a letter from Morgan Stanley, Conseco's adviser, which says it is 'highly confident' the money can be raised. Although not legally a form of underwriting, the investment bank's decision to stake its reputation on the success of the financing implies a heavy commitment to the transaction. The deal needs the approval of both companies' shareholders, regulators and investors in Kemper's mutual funds. Conseco added that it would seek to postpone a hearing by Illinois insurance regulators set for next Wednesday. Kemper had third-quarter operating earnings of Dollars 32.7m on its continuing operations, which before one-off factors were flat on last year.</p>

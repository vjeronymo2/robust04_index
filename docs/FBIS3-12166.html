Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that a closure was also  clamped on Qiryat Arba'. In practice, however, it is not being  observed and every two hours a convoy of cars and a bus to  Jerusalem leaves Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. The convoys are  escorted by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops due to  stone-throwing incidents in the area of Halhul.    In several Israeli Arab settlements where the Islamic  Movement is in power, a general strike is still observed today  and will continue tomorrow. Our correspondent Yo'el Dar reports  that Police Minister Moshe Shahal has promised Knesset Member  Tawfiq Zayyad that all the Israeli Arabs detained in riots  yesterday will be released today. Some 23 of the youths detained  yesterday in riots in al-Tayyibah and al-Tirah were released  this morning. Only two youths suspected of throwing stones were  remanded in custody.    Riots continue this morning in Bedouin settlements in the  Negev. Youths are hurling stones at passing cars, and a  policeman was slightly injured by a stone. An Egged Company bus  was set on fire in Kusayfah; no one was hurt, and the police  arrested three rioters there. Rocks were hurled at reporters in  Tel Sheva'. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that riots  also take place in 'Aro'er and Laggiyah, and the police are  trying to restore order. The 'Arad-Beersheba highway is still  closed in the Kusayfah region.    In al-Tayyibah in the triangle, masked youths armed with  axes  staged a demonstration and set tires on fire.</p>

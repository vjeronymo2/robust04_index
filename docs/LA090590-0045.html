			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR USED IN KIDNAPING OF 3 RECOVERED;  </P> <P> CRIME: POLICE HAVE LITTLE ELSE TO GO ON IN THE RAPE OF THE VICTIMS AND THE  DEATH OF ONE GIRL, 15.  </P> <P> Ontario police investigators inched forward Tuesday in their hunt for three men  in a grisly weekend kidnaping that left one teen-age girl dead and two other  women raped and stabbed.  </P> <P> A car used in the abduction was recovered Tuesday afternoon abandoned in the  community of Rubidoux, near Riverside, but detectives said their investigation,  including interviews with the surviving victims, had produced little useful  evidence.  </P> <P> "We don't have much of anything at this point," Detective Mike Cormican said.  "It's very vague."  </P> <P> Cormican said police "are not ruling out the possibility that this was a  gang-related crime," but declined to elaborate on a connection.  </P> <P> Authorities identified the homicide victim as Yvette Woodruff, 15, of Ontario.  The San Bernardino County coroner's office said she was shot in the head.  </P> <P> Cormican said that Woodruff, a girlfriend and the friend's mother were abducted  by three men in their 20s as they arrived at a home in the 200 block of North  Campus Avenue about 2:15 a.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> The three apparently committed a robbery inside the home and then kidnaped the  women at gunpoint, fleeing in a car driven by one of the victims.  </P> <P> Cormican said the women were taken to a field near an industrial area on the  city's isolated eastern edge. There, the three were raped, Woodruff was shot  and the two other women were stabbed before their attackers drove off, Cormican  said.  </P> <P> The survivors walked half a mile to a pay phone and summoned police, but  Woodruff was dead when authorities arrived at the scene shortly after 4:30  a.m., officials said.  </P> <P> The older woman was hospitalized with multiple stab wounds, and her daughter  was treated and released.  </P> <P> The episode -- which was the third kidnaping and homicide in Ontario this  summer -- has left the city jittery.  </P> <P> "We don't believe they are related, but unfortunately we've had a string of  these come up this year," Cormican said. "It's an unusual and unpleasant thing  for Ontario."  </P> <P> The unsettling series began on June 2 when Herbert Farley, 65, was abducted  from behind a grocery store after his wife, Lula, 71, was shot and killed in  the parking lot. Police found Herbert Farley's bullet-riddled body two weeks  later. A suspect, Steven Valdez, 19, of Ontario was arrested in July.  </P> <P> Last month, a mentally disabled woman was kidnaped from her Ontario home.  Antonette Mena, 21, was found strangled in the Mt. Baldy area soon after, and  two suspects have been arrested.  </P></p>

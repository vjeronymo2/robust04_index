			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DON'T BE A 'WISEGUY'  </P> <P> I, and many women I know, are furious with Stephen J. Cannell for quarreling  with and getting rid of Ken Wahl. Without him, "Wiseguy" is just another  violent show.  </P> <P> We all loved Vinnie and wanted there to be more of him and his love life, and  less of the many gangsters.  </P> <P> Cannell left Vinnie -- half out of his mind after that horrible episode in that  wet little Oregon town with the crazy mayor -- delivering disgusting bloody  garbage to the dump and stealing watches for money. What is all this nonsense  -- a grudge of some kind?  </P> <P> Please, Mr. Cannell, bring Vinnie (Ken Wahl, only Ken Wahl) back, and we will  watch "Wiseguy" as often as it airs.  </P> <P> Joan Scheid, North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: HSBC Holdings It was the Bank of England which brought in Sir Peter Walters and Mr Brian Pearse to sort out Midland Bank long before HSBC's successful bid. Now that the job is done, a natural break seems in order. That, rather than disagreement, seems to be behind yesterday's announcement that the two men are moving on. Set against expectations that Mr Pearse would eventually assume the chairmanship of Midland, though, the news re-inforces the impression that HSBC is tightening its grip on its new acquisition. The market will thus be alert for any shift - more probably of emphasis rather than direction - in strategy. One issue relates to the loan market, where Midland has become noticeably more aggressive. It admits to concern over the fall in margins on large UK corporate loans. How far it is prepared in practice to restrain its lending as competition for business increases is another matter. Then there is the question of the speed with which HSBC's sophisticated retail technology can be adapted to the UK market. Getting the answers right requires local experience of the type HSBC is forfeiting with the departure of Mr Pearse. Admittedly, a group with such a far-flung empire always has to wrestle with the question of how decentralised control should become. The latest message from Midland is that its parent knows best.</p>

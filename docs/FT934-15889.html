			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / No go for Blair House Accord It would be 'untenable' for the US-EC deal on farm subsidies, known as the Blair House accord, to be modified in any way without jeopardising the entire Uruguay Round, Mr Peter Cook, the Australian trade minister, said yesterday, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. He was speaking before leaving for trade discussions in Brussels and a Cairns Group meeting in Geneva. David Owen adds: Mr John Major, the British prime minister, also warned yesterday of the consequences for the world economy if the Uruguay Round collapsed, Speaking at his Conservative party's conference in Blackpool, Mr Major warned: 'You are playing with fire.' If the talks collapsed in two months' time, it could unleash 'protectionism, poverty and unemployment on a scale we haven't seen since the 1930s'.</p>

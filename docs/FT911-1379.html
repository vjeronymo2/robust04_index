			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / The European Market: Power plant competition opens charged debate - Free trade threatens link between utilities and plant suppliers WHEN European Community electricity suppliers clashed last month over access to power transmission grids, they were simply illustrating the inevitable, and normally inviolate, connection between politics and energy. Further up the supply chain the thorny issue of fair competition for power plant orders is producing a similar politically-charged debate. Equipment producers are asking how the European Commission's efforts to liberalise the EC energy market and open up public purchasing to competition will affect the cosy arrangements between many national utilities and their power plant-manufacturing compatriots. For proponents of free trade the outlook is generally positive. Spurred by privatisation, the UK market is now open to all-comers, as shown by last year's award to Siemens of a Pounds 350m contract to build a 900MW power station at Killingholme, Humberside. That broke the domination of the UK power plant market by domestic companies. More open competition may take longer elsewhere, but seems inevitable. Some obstacles remain, however, and US suppliers in particular are worried about their access to the post-1992 market. Mr Percy Barnevik, president and chief executive of Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, says: 'Many people say they don't believe (open competition) will happen because it's breaking a 100-year tradition. 'These national industries in power plant have been protected and isolated, each in their own country. But the British have been the first of the big markets really to open up for public bidding. The French and the Italians will probably come last, but there is no way they can continue with protection five or 10 years from now. I don't think Brussels would allow it.' A recent study* by Mr Steve Thomas and Mr Francis McGowan, of Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit, points out that EC countries are not the only culprits. Few goods, they say, are further from the ideal of being freely traded in a world market based on price and quality than the main components, notably the turbine generator, of power stations. 'Throughout its history, the heavy electrical industry sector has been characterised by a dominance of protected home markets and suspected cartel behaviour by the producers,' the study states. Looking at purchases by EC countries, it points out the consistently high proportion of generator sets supplied to home markets, with trade between EC countries accounting for just 8 per cent of the 318,540MW of capacity supplied since 1955. But, says the study, the significance of trade between supplier countries is even more marginal than the figures indicate, as intra-EC trade generally involves customer countries with no manufacturing capability. EC power plant manufacturing capability is almost totally concentrated in four member states, the UK, France, Germany and Italy. 'It is this lack of trade, and its possible roots in the way that procurement decisions are made, that the Commission wants to tackle,' say the authors. It suggest a number of reasons why the current situation has developed. Close relationships between users and suppliers are vital, and utilities see considerable advantage in placing business with trusted local suppliers. Governments have often obliged utilities to buy from domestic suppliers because of broader industrial policy objectives. This has long been a tradition in France, for example. The utility may be circumscribed by market-sharing activities of the suppliers themselves, or less explicit behaviour such as not bidding seriously in each others' markets. The central factor, however, is seen as the utility's operating environment. 'For most of the century,' says the study, 'electricity has been a cost plus industry. There has been no real incentive to minimise cost.' In recent years EC governments have managed to keep their mainly state-controlled utilities out of directives on liberalising public purchasing. But the 1992 proposals, which identify public procurement as a key obstacle to a single market, have given the Commission the initiative. After much debate EC industry ministers finally passed the so-called Utilities Directive in September. From 1993 utilities will have to give a fair chance to equipment suppliers in all member states. 'Public' means 'public supply' rather than public ownership, so that includes practically every power generating company in Europe apart from industrial cogenerators. Much will now depend on how the programme is policed. Compliance procedures for the directive are being discussed, and utilities are unhappy that EC regulators may be able to stop a contract in its tracks if an infringement is spotted. Nevertheless, the study cites recent events in the UK to suggest that, when confronted by a more competitive regime, utilities adopt a different approach to purchasing decisions. It also believes the recent cross-border mergers among suppliers, blurring their national identity, may weaken the utilities' duty to support their local manufacturer. Another key objective for the EC in liberalising the utilities' purchasing policy was to achieve a much-needed rationalisation in the European heavy equipment industry. The prospect of changing attitudes from utilities and governments has been a factor in producing the new alliances, the study says. But other trends in the industry - changing technology and faster growth prospects in non-EC markets - have helped produce this rationalisation of overcapacity anyway. The new-look European heavy equipment sector, with cross-border ownership and manufacturing, is generally enthusiastic about the new arrangements. Swiss-Swedish ABB, after all, is technically based outside the EC, but Mr Barnevik says with some justification: 'If there was no change from the present situation, no one would be better placed than we are because we have a seat in each country.' At GEC Alsthom, the Anglo/French joint venture that emerged from the rationalisation of the late 1980s, Mr Jim Cronin, joint managing director, says he is praying for 1992 to become a reality, accompanied by monetary union. 'Even with the ERM we are not going to get open competition easily for capital goods projects. We still have differential interest rates, and there is no means for inter-government financing.'

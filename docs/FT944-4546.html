			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Turks find way round sanctions on Baghdad: Trade is benefiting the Kurds At the Habur Bridge border point between Iraq and Turkey, it hardly looks as if Iraq is still under sanctions. Thousands of trucks parked two abreast are lined up for two miles on either side of the bridge, waiting their turn to cross the frontier. The trucks, all of them Turkish, carry sacks of flour, sugar, cement and other building supplies into Iraq and bring diesel on the way back. Drivers can make a small fortune by selling the fuel at three times the price in Turkey. Roads on either side of Habur Bridge are streaked black with fuel which has leaked from tanks filled to overflowing. The air reeks of diesel around the Iraqi border town of Zakho, where trucks load up at improvised filling stations. Turkey claims it is still enforcing UN sanctions on Iraq, imposed in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. But it has never hidden its dismay at the embargo's cost and is pushing to have it lifted. Officials claim sanctions have cost Turkey Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.5bn) over the past four years. Iraq was once Turkey's biggest trading partner and business with Iraq helped sustain its south-east region, one of the most backward in Turkey. In September, Turkey decided to relax sanctions which had barred nearly all border trade with Iraq. Turkey says it now allows only food into Iraq and lets each truck import just 1,500 litres of fuel. Only 600 trucks are allowed across Habur Bridge each day. Diplomats say the government timed its decision to win votes in elections scheduled for December 4 but since postponed. The border trade, worth several million dollars a day, is revitalising a region weakened by years of blockade. The local chamber of commerce says 400,000-500,000 people in south-eastern Turkey are benefiting from the resumed trade. Freight agents say rates have increased by half and some days, no trucks are available. Conditions in northern Iraq, controlled by western-supported Kurdish rebels, are gradually improving. Money is entering the economy, creating jobs in a region suffering over 60 per cent unemployment. Welding, for instance, is a growth industry in Zakho. Men weld huge steel tanks for loading onto the backs of trucks for filling with diesel. This is because, to comply with sanctions, Turkey forbids the export of steel tanks to Iraq. But it allows exports of sheet steel, welded into tanks and later discarded in Turkey. Most trucks, though, head to the oil town of Mosul, still controlled by Saddam's Baghdad government. There they barter flour and sugar for diesel. One tonne of flour is worth 6,000 litres of diesel. The trade raises awkward questions for UN sanctions. Western diplomats say they are prepared to turn a blind eye for the time being, since Turkey's support is needed on other matters, such as renewing the mandate for Operation Provide Comfort. The joint British, French, US and Turkish support operation for the Iraqi Kurds is based at Turkey's Incirlik airbase; parliament is to approve its next six-monthly mandate by the end of the year. Sanctions also cover the Kurdish-occupied region where Saddam's writ no longer runs. The UN does not want to undermine Iraq's territorial integrity by lifting sanctions in the north and give de facto recognition to a separate Kurdish state. The border trade is bringing a dash of prosperity for the Kurds, but their leaders admit it also helping Saddam. Mr Jalal Talabani, one of the Kurds' two political leaders, says: 'Turkey is violating sanctions. (Trade) is more helpful to Iraq than Kurdistan'. At the moment, Mosul is getting Dollars 500,000 in cash and kind every day from its exports to Turkey. Resumed trade is highlighting the Kurds' own difficulties in forming an autonomous government. The factions led by Mr Talabani and his rival, Mr Massoud Barzani, have only recently agreed to support a new coalition government after spending most of the summer fighting each other in battles that cost 8,000 lives. Mr Barzani's men control the Habur Bridge customs office, and its revenues of about Dollars 100,000 a day. The government claims it is not receiving the money, saying trade only benefits the area under Mr Barzani's control. Criminal gangs on both sides of the frontier and corrupt Turkish officials are beneficiaries of the Habur Bridge traffic. Drivers say they must pay bribes equivalent to 8-9 per cent of their load to Turkish customs officers. Felemez Buran, a truck driver, says: 'If you don't pay, they don't let us through. Everyone takes money. If you pay good money you can bring 30,000 or 40,000 litres of diesel. If you don't pay, you cannot even bring 500 litres.' Drivers have to contend with Kurdish guerrillas, now the only armed presence in northern Iraq, and crime syndicates in Turkey. They all demand their share in protection money. Anyone unwise enough to refuse paying risks having their trucks incinerated. Last week, gangsters set fire to two trucks. The fire did not spread to the thousands of others parked nose to tail - luckily for everyone there - drivers, Kurds, customs officers.</p>

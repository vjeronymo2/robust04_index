			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Treasury sets date for UK privatised debt sale The UK Treasury's previously-announced sale of debt issued by privatised companies will take place on July 18, Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank acting for the Treasury, said yesterday. The sale, which the Treasury hopes will raise between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn, includes bonds issued by British Telecommunications, London Electricity, Manweb, National Grid, National Power, Scottish Hydro and Seeboard. Issuers have been invited to submit firm offers to buy back their debt by noon on July 18. National Grid has pre-emption rights to repurchase the two bonds selected for inclusion in the sale. If these rights are exercised the bonds will not be available for sale to third parties. The Treasury holds debt with a face value of Pounds 2.7bn issued by privatised utilities. This summer's sale of debt forms part of the Pounds 5.5bn privatisation programme for 1994-95. The programme, which was announced in last November's Budget, includes the receipt of final payments for BT3 shares and the sale of remaining stakes in the electricity generators.</p>

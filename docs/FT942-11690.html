			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (9): How Unisys recovered They are smiling again at the Jolly Road, Blue Bell, headquarters of Unisys, the largest high-technology company in the Philadelphia region. After years of heavy losses that brought the computer manufacturer to the brink of disaster, the company is making a strong comeback. Unisys was created in 1986 when Michael Blumenthal, then chairman of Burroughs, masterminded an audacious plan to form a giant computer company by acquiring rival Sperry for Dollars 4.8bn, combining two of the oldest companies in the computer industry under a new name. At the time, Mr Blumenthal boasted that within a few years Unisys would achieve annual revenues of Dollars 20bn and challenge International Business Machines' dominant role in the computer industry. Instead, Unisys became the first of the large US computer companies to suffer the effects of a market shift away from proprietary mainframe computers to networks of standard desktop machines. Burdened with heavy debts from the Sperry acquisition and the high costs of maintaining two incompatible product lines, Unisys plunged into heavy losses in 1989. To make matters worse, the company's defence business became embroiled in a Pentagon bribery scandal. Over the three years 1989-1991, the company recorded total losses of almost Dollars 2.5bn as it drastically restructured its operations, taking charges totaling Dollars 1.6bn to cut its workforce and consolidate operations. Analysts were predicting the company's demise. Defying the prophets of doom, however, Unisys, under the leadership of James Unruh, appointed to replace Mr Blumenthal as chairman and chief executive in 1990, has staged a recovery all the more remarkable because it comes as two of the company's largest competitors, IBM and Digital Equipment, are struggling to adjust to adverse market trends. The turnround began at the end of 1991, when Unisys recorded a modest fourth-quarter profit. The company has not looked back since. Over two years, its profits doubled to Dollars 565.4m in 1993. Net debts had been reduced from a peak of almost Dollars 4bn to Dollars 1.1bn at the end of 1993. The return to profitability has not come without human costs. The workforce, which numbered about 120,000 at the time of the merger, has been reduced to 49,000. Retirement benefits have been slashed and the company has closed several plants. Unisys now appears, however, to be ahead of competitors in streamlining its cost structure and rationalising capacity, say analysts. 'The turnaround is real. . . No management in the computer business has executed better over the past two years,' said Curt Rohrman, of First Boston, in a recent report on the company. Revenues, however, are still declining. For 1993, the company reported sales of Dollars 7.7bn, down 23 per cent from a 1990 peak of Dollars 10.1bn. Only about 10 to 15 per cent of Unisys' sales are to new customers. To offset declining sales, Unisys is focusing increasingly upon the services side of the computer business, providing systems integration and consulting services to its customers. Analysts expect the company's service and consulting revenues to grow by 20 to 25 per cent over the next few years from Dollars 1.6bn in 1993. 'We are not going to become a computerless computer company,' Mr Unruh says, 'but we are in the information management business, rather than the computer business. Our services and systems integration revenues grew by 19 per cent world wide last year.' The company has targeted the airline, health care, insurance, banking and phone companies as areas where it can offer specialised software and services. It plans to offer similar software to banks, car rental agencies, hotels and insurance companies, enabling them to provide better service and to research their customers' buying habits. The new software could generate sales for Unisys of as much as Dollars 1bn over five years, industry analysts predict. In a bid to boost flagging sales of mainframe computers, Unisys has moved ahead of competitors in a transition to more cost-efficient semi-conductor chips built using the same chip technology widely used in desktop computers. Ironically, these chips will be manufactured, to Unisys' specifications, by its long-time rival IBM. Unlike traditional mainframes, Unisys new computer systems will not require elaborate water cooling systems. This will make them better suited to today's networked computer systems, in which computers are typically spread throughout the offices of a company or organisation. As confidence in Unisys' future rises, the company has won several prominent orders. These include a Dollars 1bn contract for an Amazon-region environmental surveillance system; a Dollars 127m contract to computerise the largest savings bank in Russia; and other banking-automation contracts in eastern Europe totaling Dollars 400m. 'We see 1994 as a year of visible progress in differentiating Unisys in the market-place,' says Mr Unruh. In Philadelphia, this raises the hope of new jobs. Unisys is one of the largest employers in the region, despite the cutbacks of the past few years. The company currently employs about 4,300 in and around the city, down from 5,600 at the end of 1990.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  The turnround at Unisys (Dollars )  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Years               Sales         Net income      *EPS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993        7,742,500,000        565,400,000      2.69 1992        8,421,900,000        261,200,000      1.46 1991        8,696,100,000     -1,393,300,000     -9.37 1990       10,111,300,000       -436,700,000     -3.45 1989       10,096,900,000       -639,300,000     -4.71  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Earnings per share  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

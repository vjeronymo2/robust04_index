And  although the relevant agreements were reached at the meeting in  Ashgabat, according to a number of experts the prospect of  admission is in doubt.    Now the latest session of the CIS Coordinating Consultative  Committee has opened in Moscow.    "In principle the question has already been resolved,"  TRUD's  correspondent was told by Ukrainian Embassy Minister-Counselor  Vladimir Fedorov. "The only thing being discussed now is the  terms."    But I. Korotchenya, executive secretary of the CIS  Coordinating Consultative Committee, has a completely different  opinion.    "This question was still being worked on in Minsk," he  recounts. "At the moment it is too complex to admit Ukraine.  The republic has not signed the economic union's charter."    Immediately after the end of the session, TRUD's  correspondent asked Committee Chairman A. Shokhin to comment on  the situation.    "Today we approved the idea of joining and even the draft  agreement on Ukraine's admission," he remarked. "The time this  process will take depends on the republic itself."</p>

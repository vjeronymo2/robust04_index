			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by GIA for TASS] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi 16 May TASS -- Chairman of the Georgian  parliament, Eduard Shevardnadze, met with visiting lawmakers of  the Russian state Duma, deputy chairman of the Duma Committee  for Affairs of the Commonwealth, Vyacheslav Igrunov, and  chairman of the Duma Counting Commission, Khachim Karmokov, on  Monday [16 May].    The delegation of Russian parliamentarians arrived in  Georgia  to attend a session of the political committee of the  parliamentary assembly for economic cooperation of Black Sea  countries. Participants pointed out that they are pinning great  hopes on the assembly as another factor of strengthening peace  in the world.    The talks between Shevardnadze and the Russian lawmakers  focused on Russo-Georgian relations. It was pointed out that  the break off of political, economic and cultural ties which  traditionally existed between the Russian and the Georgian  people runs contrary to their interests. The sides pointed out  that considerable efforts should be made to bring these  relations to a new level. Prerequisites for this have been  created by documents signed by the Russian president and the  Georgian leader in Tbilisi. Parliamentarins of the two  countries should consider the documents with a great sense of  responsibility and ratify them in time, the sides said. In this  connection, both sides expressed an intention to step up  contacts between Russian and Georgian parliamentarians.    The meeting was attended by the Russian ambassador to  Georgia, Vladimir Zemskiy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Document" rubric: "Law </F> on Electoral Rights To Be Passed to President One of These Days.  Central Electoral Commission Expects To Push it Though State  Duma Before Summer Recess"]    [Text] Nikolay Ryabov, chairman of the Central Electoral  Commission [CEC], has said that one of these days he will submit  to the president the draft law "On the Main Guarantees of the  Electoral Rights of Russian Federation Citizens," drawn up by  CEC experts. The document will reaffirm the "framework"  provisions regulating the conduct of elections, which under the  new Constitution should be "specified" in local election  statutes in each Federation component. The CEC chief recalled  that in the absence of "federal legal guidelines" regional  elections were held from December to April only on the basis of  local enforceable enactments. The draft law, its authors say,  will guarantee the right to appeal in court against the  violation of electoral rights, a right which was not set forth  in some local "electoral codes." This version, however, also  merely mentions the responsibility of violators, but lacks a  specific mechanism of punishing them. What Nikolay Ryabov sees  as the "key" provision of the new law is the solution to the  question of the Central Electoral Commission's funding:  according to the draft, a separate line in the government  budget will be introduced to finance the CEC. Ryabov explained  that "the government has suggested that it itself should give us  money, as it gives it to any ministry, but we refused, seeing  this as a matter decisive for the commission's independence."    CEC members will be appointed by all branches of power: the  CEC chairman, by the president; his deputy and six commission  members, by the Federation Council; and the CEC secretary and  the other six members, by the State Duma. Local electoral  commissions will be formed under the new law "on a parity basis"  by regional representative and executive branches of power.    The draft stipulates "equal terms" and "equal rights" in the  nomination of candidates by electoral associations. The term  "electoral association" itself is defined in the draft as "a  public association, the charter of which envisions participation  in elections, created and registered in accordance with law not  later than six months before the announced date of the  respective elections."    "Independent" candidates will be required under a provision  of the draft law to state their party affiliation publicly.  According to Mr. Ryabov, this was done taking into account the  lessons of the recent local elections "so as activists of a  certain hue, who have already been branded three times, will no  longer be able to pass for lambs."    The final draft of the law will be presented today to the  roundtable at the Central Electoral Commission, to which State  Duma and Federation Council deputies, leaders of political  parties, and influential public figures have been invited.    According to Aleksandr Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the  Central Electoral Commission, the draft was approved in general  by senior officials at the presidential administration. Nikolay  Ryabov hopes that the president himself will also approve the  document and will sponsor it at the State Duma as his own  legislative initiative. Afterward, the CEC chief thinks, the  State Duma will have to pass the law "On the Main Guarantees of  the Electoral Rights of Russian Federation Citizens" even before  its summer recess.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / De Klerk fails to win over Chief Buthelezi THE South African government last night failed to persuade Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, to return to constitutional negotiations after a three-month absence. President F W de Klerk and most of his cabinet held eight hours of talks yesterday with Chief Buthelezi and senior officials of Inkatha and the KwaZulu black homeland whose government Chief Buthelezi leads. Both sides said after the talks that progress had been made, but that no immediate return to multi-party negotiations was in prospect. 'We made no decision about going back to the talks. It is just not possible at present,' Chief Buthelezi said at a joint press conference with President de Klerk, who nonetheless declared 'there is light at the end of the tunnel'. The two agreed to set up joint committees to seek further progress. Inkatha left the talks in protest at a decision to hold multi-racial elections next April. Government officials believe it is essential that Chief Buthelezi accept the constitutional deal which will eventually emerge from these talks. This could be achieved without his party returning to the multi-party table. The Inkatha leader has recently returned from Germany and the UK where he came under heavy pressure to moderate his demand for autonomy in Natal. Meanwhile an official of the African National Congress said the ANC president, Mr Nelson Mandela, would ask the United Nations to remove sanctions against South Africa when he addresses the General Assembly next week. Mr Stanley Mabizela said Mr Mandela would call for the repeal of all remaining sanctions except those against arms sales. Previously, ANC officials had insisted that the international oil embargo must also remain. Parliament yesterday began debate on the first of four transition laws that will give blacks a share of power for the first time.</p>

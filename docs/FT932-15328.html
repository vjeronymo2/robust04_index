			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Observer: Mandarin syndrome Whether it was the Chinese or the British who blinked first in the tortuous business of arranging talks about talks on the future of Hong Kong, the mandarins at the Foreign Office made quite sure that Chris Patten could not claim too much of the credit. The announcement coincided with a London news conference given by the governor of Hong Kong. But a telephone call to the FO's well-staffed news department asking for the time and location of the event hit a brick wall. Even though the event was taking place at the FO a well-spoken young lady in the news department told callers that everyone was busy in an internal briefing. She could give no details of any encounter between Patten and the press. The media should call back later. By the time the department's own meeting was over, so too was Patten's press conference. Perhaps, after all, the friends of Beijing still hold sway among the mandarins of King Charles Street.</p>

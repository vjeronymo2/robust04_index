			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Professor Kenichi Iga, Tokyo Institute of  Technology, first proposed the concept of the surface emission  laser in 1977. At that time, devices like the optical computer  were mere dreams. Even the idea of an optical interconnection  that can transmit a large quantity of signals via an array of  surface emission lasers had not been thought of. Actually,  Professor Iga's proposal was motivated by a simple  thought--trying to find a laser that could be mass produced  better.  <H5>  Sandwich the Activated Layer </H5>   Professor Iga began research on semiconductor lasers for  optical communication in a group led by his advisor, Dr.  Yasuharu Suematsu (formerly president of Tokyo Institute of  Technology). Although his research proceeded smoothly, and he  was able to make prototype elements that actually worked,  Professor Iga also felt dissatisfaction.    At that time, the mainstream method for manufacturing  semiconductor lasers was to split a crystal to form a smooth  surface called a cleavage plane, and then make that into a  reflective mirror for a resonator. With that method it was  difficult to mass produce elements of uniform quality. Some  researchers proposed making elements without cleavage planes,  such as in distribution feedback lasers that incorporate a  diffraction grating, but Professor Iga says, ``Because it was  not my own idea, it just didn't feel right to me.''    After a lot of thought, what Professor Iga came up with was  the structure of a perpendicular resonating laser in which the  activated layer (emitting part) is sandwiched between reflective  films above and below, and the laser light is generated  perpendicular to the substrate. With this structure, a number of  elements could be formed on a single substrate, and the lasers  could be mass produced merely by cutting them off one by one.    Preceding Professor Iga's idea, researchers at Xerox in the  U.S. announced the creation of a surface emission laser in 1975.  It had diffraction gratings piled on top of the activated layer,  and basically the structure was pretty much the same as previous  lasers. Then in 1987 researchers at MIT proposed the reflective  mirror type of surface emission laser. This device had a crystal  with a cleavage plane cut at a 45 angle set in the path of  light emitted horizontally and used this crystal to change the  direction of the light, but the method for generating the light  was no different than before. Compared with these methods,  Professor Iga's idea is truly innovative.  <H5>  Scholars Originally Skeptical </H5>   Yet, a long time passed before the value of his idea was  recognized. In 1979 Professor Iga made prototype elements with  activated layers of indium-gallium-arsenic-phosphorus and cooled  with them liquid nitrogen to generate pulsed oscillations.  Professor Iga says, ``If a large current was applied they would  light up for an instant before they fell apart.''    At academic conferences these experimental results got a  very  cold reception, and most scholars thought the elements could  never be put to practical use. In addition to Dr. Suematsu,  however, a small number of researchers from the U.S. and former  Soviet Union encouraged Iga by saying his results were  interesting and worth pursuing.    Then unexpected advantages appeared. Researchers realized  that surface emission lasers will be most suitable for hookups  to optical fibers because they emit a narrower beam than  previous types of lasers, etc. It was discovered that short  wavelength prototype lasers made by replacing the original  material with gallium-arsenic elements also required less  current for oscillation than older surface emission lasers.  Research on surface emission lasers was selected by MOE for its  Specially Promoted Distinguished Research funding in the latter  half of the 1980s, and this provided a budget for Professor Iga  to make his own state-of-the-art device for manufacturing  semiconductor thin films. In the fall of 1988 about ten years  after he first proposed the idea, working with Assistant  Professor Fumio Koyama, Professor Iga created a surface emission  laser that could produce continuous short wavelength emissions  at room temperature. This triggered research throughout the  world because the advantages of surface emission lasers made  them promising candidates for the main components of optical  computers and next-generation optical communications systems.  Professor Iga's group went on to achieve continuous oscillation  at room temperature in the 1.3 wavelength band suitable for  optical communications, so at last Professor Iga's dream was  becoming reality.  <H5>  Beyond Expectations </H5>   Now all major electronics manufacturers are doing research  on  surface emission lasers. Their main focus is the development of  surface emission lasers that will form the optical  interconnections in MITI's Real World Computing (Four  Dimensional Computer) Project which will last for the next ten  years, and ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) Projects in  the U.S. Professor Iga created the surface emission laser  because it would be easy to mass produce, but now it has grown  into an element far beyond his original concept.    Several faculty members who worked with Professor Iga on  research have moved on to other universities, and former  students in his lab now work for domestic and foreign  semiconductor manufacturers. All continue their cutting-edge  research. We can expect research on elements for practical  application to accelerate rapidly in the future. Professor Iga  intends to remain at the forefront saying, ``Signal hookups for  parallel computers, etc., should be realized in the near  future.''   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-47A>           Structure of Perpendicular Resonator Surface Emission Laser </FIG></p>

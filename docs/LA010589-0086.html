			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL IN OJAI PROMOTES DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS TO POST OF CITY MANAGER  </P> <P> Rejecting the idea of a job search for a new city manager, the Ojai City  Council on Tuesday promoted Public Works Director Andrew Belknap into the  position that Geoffrey Grote will vacate Jan. 27.  </P> <P> Belknap, who also serves as assistant city manager, was named to the city  manager's post because of his "outstanding performance" over the last 2 years  and because his knowledge of existing programs will make the transition  smoother, said Grote, who has resigned for personal reasons.  </P> <P> Belknap, who will receive about $60,000 a year, including a car allowance, will  run the day-to-day administrative affairs of Ojai. He said he wants to  streamline budget procedures, restore the downtown arcade facade and develop a  long-term vision for Ojai with the City Council.  </P> <P> A former public works management analyst for the city of Oxnard, Belknap holds  bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Grote praised the council's decision to promote a staff member because "it  makes for a much smoother transition and it makes a great of sense  organizationally."  </P> <P> Ojai employs about 25 city staff members, Belknap said, which prompted the  decision to appoint from within. "They want to maintain some continuity in the  things we are working on here. In a small city like Ojai, when you have a  vacancy, it really has a dramatic effect on the work output."  </P></p>

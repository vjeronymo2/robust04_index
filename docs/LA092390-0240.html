			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS  </P> <P> Baseball Diamond to Be Scaled Down After Complaints  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley Recreation and Park District has decided to scale down a  diamond at Fiore Field to protect neighboring residents from baseball  bombardment.  </P> <P> Park officials unanimously decided to reduce the size of one diamond, a  300-foot field, to between 120 and 140 feet, park board Chairman Mike Berger  said Friday.  </P> <P> The diamond will now be able to handle games for handicapped Little League  youths.  </P> <P> Neighbors living next to the field have complained that baseball players hit  balls over a 20-foot fence into their yards.  </P> <P> To make up for the loss of a larger diamond for older youths, the size of a  nearby field at Waverly Park has been increased to handle older Little League  players, General Manager Tex Ward said.  </P> <P> A second baseball diamond that has also caused problems will be monitored  closely by the park district to see if there are continuing complaints, Berger  said.  </P> <P> "We feel we've corrected the vast majority of the problems," Berger said.  </P> <P> The $65,000 project also includes adding parking, creating areas for pitching  warm-ups and batting cages as well as setting up picnic grounds and a  playground.  </P> <P> The area Little League has agreed to contribute $10,000 to the project.

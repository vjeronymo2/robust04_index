			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) HCFC&hyph;142b. HCFC&hyph;142b (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, are acceptable alternative blowing agents for CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Polyurethane slabstock and other foams. (a) HCFC&hyph;123. HCFC&hyph;123 (or blends thereof) is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams. From the standpoint of technical feasibility, HCFC&hyph;123 represents a viable alternative to CFC&hyph;11 as a potential blowing agent. More specifically, the physical properties, thermal conductivity, and aging of foams blown with HCFC&hyph;123 are similar to those blown with CFC&hyph;11. As a result, HCFC&hyph;123, which has an ozone depleting potential significantly lower than that of CFC&hyph;11, has the potential to replace CFC&hyph;11 in many applications. Nonetheless, commercial availability of HCFC&hyph;123 is limited at present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HCFC&hyph;141b. HCFC&hyph;141b (or blends thereof) is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams. Although its ODP of 0.11 is relatively high, HCFC&hyph;141b offers almost immediate transition out of CFCs in this sector. Not only does HCFC&hyph;141b offer a technically feasible alternative to CFC&hyph;11, it is currently available in sufficient quantities to meet industry demand. The use of HCFCs in polyurethane slabstock and other foams is subject to further restriction under section 610 of the CAA, which banned the use of class II substances in noninsulating foams after January 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams. HCFC&hyph;22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than either CFC&hyph;11 or CFC&hyph;12. However, significant process changes may be necessary to accommodate the low boiling point of HCFC&hyph;22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, are acceptable alternative blowing agents for CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Carbon Dioxide. Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane slabstock and other foams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Extruded Polystyrene Boardstock and Billet. (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. HCFC&hyph;22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than CFC&hyph;12. HCFC&hyph;22, however, has a relatively high permeation rate out of polystyrene, thus affecting insulation performance. Users must be in compliance with the section 610 Nonessential Products Containing Class II Substances Ban.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HCFC&hyph;142b. HCFC&hyph;142b is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock foam. HCFC&hyph;142b offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than either CFC&hyph;11 or CFC&hyph;12. Users must be in compliance with the section 610 Non-essential Products Containing Class II Substances Ban.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- A team of seven Canadian  lawyers accredited as interational observers on Sunday [1 May]  pronounced South Africa's first all-race elections -- especially  the adjudication of electoral disputes -- as free and fair.    "On the basis of political activity and the voting of  approximately 60 polling stations we observed, we concur with  the European observers' conclusion that this election was  substantially free and fair," Mr Andrew Orkin, co-ordinator of  the legal team, said in a statement.    The lawyers said they had observed the Independent Electoral  Commission's [IEC] investigation into, and settlement of, many  complaints and nearly half of the 45 cases sent to trial or  appeal. Although the voting and counting would invevitably lead  to more complaints they were confident that all election  complaints would also be dealt fairly and impartially, the  statement said.    The Canadian jurists' report on the electoral complaints  system was co-signed by the legal observers affiliated with  Oxfam Canada and the European Community observer unit.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Yarrow wins Pounds 400m navy order A CRUCIAL order for three new Royal Navy frigates worth almost Pounds 400m went yesterday to Yarrow Shipbuilders of Glasgow after a fierce competition with rival yards. The order, announced in the Commons by Mr Tom King, defence secretary, ensures work for the Clydeside yard well into the mid-1990s and leaves all three other UK naval yards still searching for shipbuilding orders for that period. About half the total value will go to Yarrow, a subsidiary of Britain's General Electric Company (GEC). Defence officials said it had been 'a clear win on cost grounds' against bids from VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness, Swan Hunter of Tyneside and Southampton-based Vosper Thornycroft. The government, however, is widely seen as also having had strong political reasons for wanting to place the work in Scotland, especially after the announcement earlier this month of plans to close the Ravenscraig steel complex in Lanarkshire with the loss of 1,200 jobs. Workers at Yarrow reacted with delight and relief to the news that they had won the order for all three frigates. 'It's excellent,' said one of the shipbuilding workers. 'It means job security for the next three years,' said another. Local Labour politicians and trade unionists had raised the possibility of the yard closing down if the order had gone elsewhere. That idea was dismissed earlier this week by Sir Robert Easton, Yarrow's chairman. Sir Robert said yesterday, however, that redundancies would still be needed before work began on the new ships unless further orders were secured. Yarrow, which has been in negotiation with Malaysia over an order for two corvettes, shed 645 jobs late last year, reducing the workforce to 2,750. The contract follows a recent Pounds 200m order for four chemical carriers won by Kvaerner Govan, the Norwegian-owned merchant shipyard on the other side of the Clyde. It is also the second big defence order for GEC this week. The group leads an international consortium which will provide electronic warfare equipment potentially worth Pounds 1.5bn for the European Fighter Aircraft. Yarrow, which lost the competition for the last batch of warships to Swan Hunter, has now won nine of the 13 orders placed for Type 23 anti-submarine frigates. Officials said placing orders in batches had proved much less expensive than spreading them between different yards. Work on the new ships is due to begin late this year and continue for about four years. At least one further batch is planned, but that order is expected to be about two years away. Future Royal Navy orders are not expected to be sufficient to sustain all four yards, which were privatised in 1985-86. Swan Hunter, which currently employs 3,800 including 1,000 on short-term contract, said it was 'naturally disappointed' that its 'extremely competitive bid' had failed. VSEL, which currently has no orders for surface warships, said it still needed a share of the frigate programme to provide work following completion of Trident nuclear-missile submarines. Vosper Thornycroft said it would also keep trying for a share of frigate orders. The Ministry of Defence also announced yesterday it was buying the ice-breaker Polar Circle, which it currently leases, from Rieber Shipping of Norway to replace HMS Endurance in the South Atlantic. The price was not disclosed.</p>

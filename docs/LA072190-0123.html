			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECT FOR NEWPORT'S ART MUSEUM FIRED;  </P> <P> DESIGN: THE BOARD VOTED TO HIRE NEW YORK'S KOHN PEDERSEN TO PLAN AN ELABORATE  EXPANSION.  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor Art Museum has dumped renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano  as designer of its new $30-million expanded building and plans to hire the  prominent New York architecture firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates to take  Piano's place, museum officials announced Thursday.  </P> <P> The museum's board voted "overwhelmingly" Wednesday night to switch to Kohn  Pedersen, board president Thomas H. Nielsen said. The firm's co-founder and  partner William Pedersen, who will serve as head architect on the project, was  hired privately by museum trustee Donald L. Bren early this year to develop  alternatives to Piano's design after some prospective major donors to the  $50-million overall fund-raising campaign -- which includes a $20-million  endowment -- complained about the estimated cost and amount of gallery space in  Piano's design.  </P> <P> Nielsen said that Pedersen's alternative, while not expected to save any money,  would offer greater flexibility in its use of space for galleries and other  needs.  </P> <P> Nielsen said he called Piano in Genoa, Italy, on Thursday, but reached only an  assistant who expressed "disappointment" on Piano's behalf over the museum's  decision. Attempts by The Times to reach Piano, whose projects include Centre  Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Menil Collection museum in Houston, were  unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Piano, who was originally hired for the project in November, 1987, worked to  modify his plan according to museum trustees' desires, but his structural  design for the building's roof posed unacceptable "limitations," Nielsen said.  </P> <P> "The Pedersen design involves a series of different buildings to house  different functions and (has the) ability to change (the function of) these  buildings to meet different needs," Nielsen said.  </P> <P> Trustee James V. Selna, who has been closely involved in the design  negotiations, said Pedersen's plan would result in more gallery space --  targeted at 40% of the 75,000-square-foot building.  </P> <P> Kohn Pedersen projects include the recently completed Western Digital building  in Irvine for the Irvine Co., whose chairman is Bren and vice chairman is  Nielsen.  </P> <P> Pedersen said Thursday that the company has never designed a museum, though in  the early 1970s Pedersen assisted architect I.M. Pei in designing the east wing  of the National Gallery of Art in Washington.  </P> <P> The museum trustees also voted Wednesday to terminate work with Blurock  Partnership, the Newport Beach architectural firm that was assisting Piano.  </P> <P> Contracts with both Piano and Blurock have been fully honored to date, Selna  said, noting that the cost of developing Piano's design totaled about $1  million.  </P> <P> Controversy has dogged museum officials' efforts at developing a design for  their new building, expected to approximately triple the size of the existing  site.  </P> <P> After learning in January that the museum had temporarily suspended his project  after 2 1/2 years of work, Piano wrote to the board in March expressing  surprise and grief about hearing from Pedersen, not the museum, that the  American architect had been retained to provide alternative designs.  </P> <P> Bren, who pledged 10 acres of the Irvine Co.'s land in Corona del Mar where the  new museum would be built, has final veto power over major elements of the  building's design. Some museum insiders said that Bren was personally  dissatisfied with Piano's plan, and that he engaged in a "power play" by hiring  Pedersen without prior approval of the full museum board. He has refused to be  interviewed on the subject, but a senior museum official who requested  anonymity said Bren took action only after he was approached by the chairman of  the museum building campaign, David S. Tappan Jr.  </P> <P> (Bren was not present for Wednesday's vote, which caused no trustees to resign  or potential donors to withdraw their support, Selna said.)  </P></p>

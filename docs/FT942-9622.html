			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: ISS postpones share listing in New York International Service Systems, the industrial cleaning group, yesterday blamed difficult conditions in the US equities market for the postponement of a planned share issue in the US and a listing in New York. The group said that an issue at the present time could not be carried out at a price level satisfactory to ISS. The Danish group last year acquired National Cleaning Company, a US group with 20,000 employees and an annual turnover of about Dollars 500m, which means that 40 per cent of ISS's turnover takes place in North America. The acquisition cost ISS DKr585m (Dollars 87.3m) and was financed by bank loans with possible equity financing. An issue of 3m shares was planned in the US, and the group had hoped to raise about DKr620m with the issue priced at about DKr225 per share. ISS B shares fell by DKr8 to DKr231 in Copenhagen yesterday. ISS's turnover in 1993 was about DKr13.30bn. National Cleaning Company was included for the final seven months of the year. Net profits increased to DKr461m from DKr265m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Jorge Perez, director of Santiago de las </F> Vegas Sanatorium and deputy director of medical care at Pedro  Curie Institute, by Roberto Cavada; date not given; all figures  as heard -- recorded]    [Text][Cavada] Doctor, I think it would be good  to give the current number of seropositive cases.  [Perez] Currently, we have 979 patients who are  seropositive to the Human Immunodificiency Virus [HIV] in Cuba;  of these, 71 percent are males, and 29 percent females. Of this  group of patients, 230 have developed Acquired Immunodificiency  Syndrome [AIDS] since 1986; of these 230 patients, 144 have died.  [Cavada] We have been told, and other sources we have  consulted have told us, that there are only slightly over 80  patients in Cuba right now.  [Perez] Yes. If you subtract the 145 deaths from the  230 AIDS cases, the result is exactly 83 patients. That is the  number alive today.    In Cuba, the number of HIV infections to date is 85. The  main  goal of the Cuban program is to identify people before they  become ill. This is in contrast with other programs in the world  that identify seropositive individuals after they have already  become ill or when they go to the hospital, or by chance.    The goal of the Cuban program is to detect seropositive  cases  as early as possible as to give counseling and also do  preventive work so that this disease does not spread. This is  the reason our figures are much smaller than those of other  countries. We never have had an unchecked geometric growth of  this infection. We have had a small mathematical growth in the  number of seropositive cases since 1987. In 1986 we detected a  number of cases accumulated from prior years.</p>

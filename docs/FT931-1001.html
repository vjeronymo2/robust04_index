			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Appeal Court upholds BCCI ruling A HIGH COURT ruling won by former customers of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International that they could 'set off' deposits against their debts to the bank was upheld yesterday by the Court of Appeal. Three judges dismissed appeals by Touche Ross, the BCCI liquidators, against High Court orders made last December by Mr Justice Hoffman in favour of two groups of associated companies and their directors who had banked with BCCI. When the bank was wound up Impexbond Ltd and Tucan Ltd together owed about Pounds 3.3m while a guarantor director, Mr Nasir Abdul Amir, had deposits which were worth about Pounds 4.5m. In the second case director Mr Raees Ahmed had Pounds 426,000 on deposit while his companies, High Street Services Ltd, Cira Ltd and Portman Fashions Ltd, owed more than Pounds 1m. Both men had signed BCCI's standard guarantee forms for their companys' debts. Touche Ross had argued that the setting off could not apply because no demands under these guarantees had been made of either director. But Lord Justice Dillon said the principle of setting-off was long established in bankruptcy, insolvency and company liquidations where there had been mutual credits, mutual debts or other mutual dealings. The criteria for applying set-off had been met in these cases. If there was a set-off between Mr Amir or Mr Ahmed and BCCI it must automatically reduce or extinguish the companies' debts. It was not something BCCI could put in a 'suspense account', he ruled.</p>

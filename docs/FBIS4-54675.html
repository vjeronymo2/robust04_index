			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said at a meeting with  workers at the Warsaw FSO [Automobile Factory] today that, by  organizing strikes, Solidarity is not fighting in the interest  of employees but is seeking to achieve the upper hand over other  trade unions. According to the speaker, Solidarity has been  deliberately avoiding negotiations with the government. It has  announced the escalation of strike action because the aim of the  union is to overthrow Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet.    Jozef Oleksy said that trade unions should primarily fight  to  resolve problems of employees and not play political games for  their own benefit.</p>

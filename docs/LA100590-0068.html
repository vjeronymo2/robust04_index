			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURY COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MEINERS OAKS;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER MAY SELL LAND TO PARK GROUP  </P> <P> A developer who has waged a five-year battle to develop Besant Meadow in  Meiners Oaks may sell the property to a land conservancy if he loses his legal  bid to build on the land.  </P> <P> The conservancy has mounted a hurried campaign to buy the property to preserve  its wetlands and create a public park.  </P> <P> "Meiners Oaks is one of the largest urban areas in the county without a park,"  resident Robert Unruhe said.  </P> <P> "If we could preserve this as a wildlife habitat, the whole valley would  benefit," he said.  </P> <P> John J. Schuck of Franciscan West Developments in Santa Barbara has asked the  Besant Meadow Preservation Group to make a bid on his 25-acre parcel if he  loses his battle with the county to build 50 residences.  </P> <P> Schuck recently petitioned the state Supreme Court to appeal county growth  controls that impose costly measures on his development plan.  </P> <P> The court has yet to say if it will hear his case.  </P> <P> Encouraged by Schuck's recent interest in selling the land, 20 members of the  nonprofit conservancy met Wednesday to form several fund-raising committees,  said Richard Handley, a science teacher who is conservancy president.  </P> <P> The citizens group organized five years ago to oppose Schuck's earlier attempt  to build 150 condominiums on the site.  </P> <P> Now with a five-member board of directors and mailing list of 200 names, it has  obtained nonprofit status and is working with the Santa Barbara Land Trust to  orchestrate a drive for grants and donations.  </P> <P> Two recent $100 donations brought the group's treasury to $500, but the  purchase price could be $1 million or more, members said.  </P> <P> Handley said the first step in the process will be to obtain an appraisal of  the land's value.  </P> <P> The conservancy envisions restoring the wetland stream running through the  meadow, establishing a bird refuge and creating a park-like village commons  along Lomita Avenue, said member Michael Krumpschmidt, who is a social science  teacher at Matilija Junior High School.

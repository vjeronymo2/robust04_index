			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Observer: Bark before bitten Given Britain's delicate political condition at the moment, Observer's pulse beat a little faster on news that The Sun, Britain's best selling newspaper, was launching 'a major contribution' to the country's democratic process. Could it be the launch of an 0898 hotline where its readers could vote on whether the PM was a goner? Better still why not upstage its rival Daily Star, which yesterday suggested that ex-BP boss Sir Peter Walters should chair a national government, with The Sun's own national reconstruction plan? In the event, The Sun's Politicians Complaints Commission is not even its own idea. Patsy Chapman, who is editor of the News of the World and admittedly from the same stable as The Sun, first suggested it in The Guardian in July. However, The Sun has adapted Ms Chapman's plan and instead of having a code of conduct drawn up by MPs themselves has set up its own 10-point of code of practice for politicians. This includes the famous Chamfort maxim: 'In great affairs men show themselves as they wish to be seen; in small things they show themselves as they are.' War hero Major General Ken Perkins, who is married to Churchill's grand-daughter and has been a military adviser to The Sun, will chair the new body. He will have a board of 'commonsense' people, including a taxi driver, a solicitor and an unemployed steelworker, to vet complaints and help him rule when MPs are letting the side down. Its deliberations will be entirely independent of The Sun and other newspapers are welcome to join. True, The Sun will pick up the tab for the first year and the initiative has all the hallmarks of yet another of Sun editor Kelvin Mackenzie's publicity stunts. Even so it would be wrong to ignore it completely. When there is concern about press invasion of privacy, The Sun intends to show politicians that it can still bite back.</p>

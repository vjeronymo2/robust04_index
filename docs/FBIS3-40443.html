			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Meteosat 6 Takes Its First </F> Picture of Earth"]    [Text] The new European weather satellite will be  operational around the beginning of February and transferred to  Eumetsat, which has chosen Ariane to also launch the three  second-generation Meteosats beginning in 1998.    Last week, the European Space Agency [ESA] disseminated the  first photo of Earth taken by the new European geostationary  satellite Meteosat 6 launched by Ariane on 19 November (see AIR  &amp; COSMOS no. 1449). Meteosat 6 was first placed in  geosynchronous transfer orbit, and 37 hours later boosted into  geostationary orbit at an altitude of 36,000 km. Injected at  19W, it drifted slowly eastward, passing at 10W on 17  December. There, it underwent a speed adjustment, enabling it to  attain its final position by the end of January, at 0  longitude, where it will be placed in operational service, and  transferred to the European space meteorological organization  Eumetsat, as of the beginning of February 1994.    But as of 29 November, Meteosat 6 took its first photo in  the  visible spectrum. It will not begin imaging in the infrared  spectrum until the multispectral radiometer built by Matra  Marconi Space has cooled. Matra Marconi Space is Aerospatiale's  principal cooperating group. Aerospatiale is the prime  contractor for the building of the seven Meteosat satellites.    Meteosat 6 will shortly replace Meteosat 4, which will then  be repositioned over North America, to serve as a cyclone  early-warning satellite beginning with the 1994 season. In this  function, it will replace Meteosat 3, which is running out of  fuel and will have to be replaced within a few months. Meteosat  3 has been on loan to the United States since 1991.    The last of the series, Meteosat 7, is to be launched by  Ariane around the end of 1995. At that time, the ESA will also  transfer property and operational responsibility of all  Meteosats to the Eumetsat organization, which will then operate  the new MSG [Second-Generation Meteosat] satellites.    In this connection, Eumetsat's board of directors has  settled  on the choice of launcher for the future satellites and  "approved the signing of a contract awarding to Arianespace the  launching of all three MSG satellites." Charles Bigot, chief  executive officer of Arianespace, confirmed to us the signing of  this contract, effective 25 November, covering the launching of  the three approximately 1.5 ton weather satellites beginning in  1998. But, he says, the agreement also covers the launching of  the European polar weather satellites Metop, by Ariane, after  the year 2000.</p>

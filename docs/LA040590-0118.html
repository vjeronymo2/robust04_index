			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BABY STEP FOR ECOLOGY;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: A MALIBU MOTHER, DETERMINED TO STOP USING DISPOSABLES, WINS HER  CAMPAIGN TO GET A DIAPER SERVICE FOR THE COMMUNITY.  </P> <P> Lori Lerner Gray is a born-again environmentalist. She recycles cans, plastic  and paper. She composts. Her garden is organic. She monitors the house to make  sure the lights are turned off and has given son Scott, 13, a three-minute egg  timer so he won't waste water while taking showers.  </P> <P> In short, the Gray household in west Malibu is almost a model of the new  environmental ethic for the '90s -- "Reduce, Reuse and Recycle" -- except for  baby Rachel, 6 months old, whose 90 disposable diapers a week are adding  steadily to the Southern California landfill problem.  </P> <P> "Here's Earth Day coming up and I am lugging out these huge bags of diapers to  the trash," her mother frets. "It is more convenient, but the guilt is  never-ending."  </P> <P> That had not been the plan. When Rachel was born last October, Gray called  Dy-Dee Diaper Service in Pasadena, whose newsletter she had picked up at her  obstetrician's office in Santa Monica. "It's a great service -- they have cloth  diapers and they deliver something like 90 clean diapers every week and pick up  the dirty ones," she said. "Also they're very environmentally oriented. Their  newsletter has all sorts of reasons why disposable diapers are a threat to the  environment."  </P> <P> In fact, it was a statistic in the newsletter that had sparked her resolve.  </P> <P> "They said that 18 billion disposable diapers are buried in U.S. landfills  every year. That's the figure that got to me. And they don't degrade. And by  the way, it turns out that even the biodegradable diapers don't degrade  either."  </P> <P> Dy-Dee had a convert. But when Gray called, she learned that Dy-Dee Diaper  Service didn't do Malibu.  </P> <P> "They said it was too far away, and they didn't have the demand here. And when  I checked around, I discovered they are the only diaper service available."  </P> <P> The campaign was on. After a couple of conversations with the service  representatives, she called the company president, Brian O'Neal, who proved to  be "an OK guy," she said, and willing to negotiate.  </P> <P> First they decided that Rachel's diapers would be picked up in Santa Monica  where Lori's husband, Larry Gray, is supervising a construction project ("He  was willing to schlep a bag of dirty diapers to work once a week"). But then  she had second thoughts.  </P> <P> "I've been hearing a lot lately that we can all make a difference, and I  decided it was time to take a stand. I thought, let's get the diaper service  out here."  </P> <P> So she renegotiated and O'Neal agreed to send his diaper trucks to Malibu if  she could enlist 30 customer families.  </P> <P> Gray knew she was not alone; she thinks of herself as typical of her baby boom  generation. After a 15-year career as a radio news director, she carved out a  niche that allows her to work from home by starting Radio Links, a company that  produces entertainment features for radio stations.  </P> <P> "I'm 38, and a lot of women my age are having babies," she said. "And we are  all getting very conscious of the environment. People are changing right before  your very eyes."  </P> <P> So she posted little signs all over Malibu -- in nursery schools, the Point  Dume Pharmacy, the Baby Gym, in pediatrician's offices -- with the Dy-Dee  Diaper Service telephone number.  </P> <P> "I stopped women in the supermarket who were buying diapers. Basically I relied  on word of mouth. There are a lot of babies out here."  </P> <P> Gray picked up support as she made her rounds. Anne Coffey of west Malibu was  No. 11 to sign up.  </P> <P> "I think it's great that somebody is doing this," Coffey said. She had tried to  get diaper service 15 months earlier when her son, Harry, was born. "It was a  dead-end street -- they had no interest at all in coming out here.  </P> <P> "I used disposable diapers and felt guilty. We are finally becoming aware that  if we leave all our garbage around, our kids are going to be in trouble."  </P> <P> By last week Gray had 29 names, and was still in hot pursuit of No. 30.  </P> <P> "We do give her credit," said Dy-Dee president O'Neal. "It's really amazing  when someone calls and wants your service when you are spending hundreds of  thousands of promotional dollars to get others to see your point of view."  </P> <P> The business, something of a diaper empire, was started in 1938 by O'Neal's  father, he said, and "the environmental issues have always been a part of our  advertising, but that hasn't been a factor until lately. Our business has grown  substantially in the last year and a half."  </P> <P> His brother, Tim, runs the service in Orange County, which goes as far east as  Riverside and as far north as Downey. Brian O'Neal's office in Pasadena  services "everything else including Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley, the  Antelope Valley and Victorville."  </P> <P> Combined, said O'Neal, "we send out 32 delivery trucks every day that run on  clean-burning fuels. We print 52,000 copies of our 20-page newspaper (the Wet  Set Gazette) for expectant mothers and we have about 19,000 customers and 18  customer service representatives. A 90-diaper service costs $11.60 per week. We  wash about 1.3 million cotton diapers a week."  </P> <P> And beginning Tuesday, some of those diapers will come from Malibu, he said.  </P> <P> "I hadn't thought there were enough customers out there to make it worthwhile.  But if word of mouth only can produce 25 to 30 customers, we know we'll get  more when we put our trucks and advertising out there.  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Allianz disclosure helps clear fog - The unveiling of the insurer's financial might ALLIANZ'S decision to disclose its holdings of 10 per cent or more in financial and industrial companies is a milestone in the history of the Munich-based insurer. The significance of the move lies in what was disclosed - large stakes in 11 German financial and industrial companies and five foreign ones - and because the disclosure was made at all. It serves to flesh out the contours of Allianz's role as a dominant force in German corporate and financial life, a position the company shares with the Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank. It demonstrates the shareholdings that criss-cross corporate Germany. There has never been any doubt about Allianz's financial might. Its portfolio of investments was worth DM184bn (Dollars 108bn) at book value alone at the end of last year. As Mr Emilio Galli-Zugaro, the group's Italian press officer, likes to joke, this would be enough to settle his home country's national debt. Some of the bigger equity holdings have been known for some time. For example, the 25 per cent stake in Munchener Ruckversicherung, the world's largest reinsurance company, 22 per cent in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, and more than 20 per cent in the Bayerische Hypo-Bank, another large bank. The size of other stakes could previously only be guessed at. Now we know that Allianz owns 14.4 per cent of the BASF chemicals group, 12.9 per cent of the RWE energy-based conglomerate, 14.8 per cent of the Linde engineering group, 12.1 per cent of the Veba conglomerate, 16.9 per cent of BHF-Bank. In total, Allianz revealed stakes worth DM8.9bn at the end of June. This is only part of the portfolio, as only stakes of 10 per cent or more were disclosed. Allianz's tradition of secrecy was the hallmark of Mr Wolfgang Schieren, the architect of the company's spectacular expansion over a number of decades. Two years ago he stepped up from his position as chief executive to the supervisory board, succeeded by Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle. Mr Schulte-Noelle would have had to make the dislosures anyway: new securities market legislation to be introduced in Germany next year is likely to set a 5 per cent threshold for disclosure of share stakes, compared with 20-25 per cent at present. That is not to underestimate the new chief executive's break with the past in releasing the information. Many big German companies are reluctant to make such disclosures. Siemens revealed two large holdings last month only after it lost a court case brought against it by Professor Ekkehard Wenger, a well-known champion of shareholders' rights. (One of those holdings was a 3 per cent stake in Allianz.) Prof Wenger had intended to pursue Allianz in the courts as well but was silenced by Mr Schulte-Noelle's decision. Allianz's decision to provide more information is not an isolated act. It has to be seen in the context of moves by a number of large companies to enhance their disclosures to shareholders. The most obvious example was Daimler-Benz's move to publish its accounts according to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), a precondition of the mould-breaking listing of its shares on the New York stock exchange earlier this week. German banks have also taken steps to bring standards of disclosure up to what Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, has jokingly described as the standards of the 'civilised' (ie non-German) world. German corporates are increasingly keen to engage in investor relations activities. This was brought home again this week as retailer Kaufhof Holding announced plans to establish a sponsored American depositary receipt programme for its ahares in New York, thus becoming only the second non-financial German company to woo US investors community in this way. These developments show a decisive, if not all-pervasive , shift in the the attitude of the management of big German companies to minority shareholders  -predominantly the foreign institutional investors whose interests have not tended to be paramount in German corporate decision-making.</p>

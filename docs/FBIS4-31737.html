			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Corneliu Vadim Tudor: "On the Death of Moses </F> Rosen"]    [Excerpts] Motto: "De mortuis nil nisi bene [bonum]" (Let  nothing be said of the dead but good) -- Chilo of Sparta.    I received the news of the passing into eternity of Rabbi  Moses Rosen on Friday, at 1900. I was in Iasi, in a spring  garden under a dried-out oak tree upon which some thoughtful  farmer had placed a sign: "A tree which is well-cared for has  388 years of life". I did not see any signs of life but,  nevertheless, no one dared to cut it down. [passage omitted]    Almost all the members of the leadership of the Greater  Romania Party [PRM] were in Iasi -- for a news conference. At  dawn, after the plane landed, we went to the Church of the Three  Hierarchs to lay a wreath with a tricolor ribbon at the tombs of  the glorious voivodes Dimitrie Cantemir and Alexandru Ioan Cuza.  Of course, Romanian Television did not show any part of it, not  a word. Then, there was a dialogue with trade union leaders,  which I could not attend since I had had only three hours of  sleep in three days and three nights and I was exhausted.  Professor Mircea Musat represented me. Finally, from 1430 to  1330, there was the much-awaited news conference before a packed  hall. Many people said that it was a triumph for us, but the  mouths of some impostors in the county press could not be shut  up even by the earth from Eternity Cemetery. I hope that I can  publish the entire discussion soon.    I do not know how it happened, but in the whirlpool of the  dialogue with the press and the people in the hall, the name of  Moses Rosen came up. Of course, at that time no one knew that he  had died. To the surprise of many people, I was very restrained.  Indeed, I even praised him for his participation, during very  frosty weather, in the Alba Iulia festivities on 1 December  1993. "Do you want Vadim to say that I am not a good Romanian?"  -- the rabbi responded to presidential counsellor Victor  Opaschi, who asked why he, an 81-year old man, did not stay  home, in a warm place, that day. And I said, in Iasi, that  indeed. at least on that occasion, the rabbi was a good  Romanian, humiliating our political opposition which had  boycotted the National Day celebrating the 75th anniversary of  the Great and Eternal Union.    The rabbi also went into the Orthodox Church (which he had  never done before) and wore a tricolor rosette with the picture  of Avram Iancu. At that time, I realized that we can never know  the depths of the human soul. For the first time in my life, I  had fond feelings for that old man who had traveled over  snow-covered mountains, while those who claim to be "national",  "Christian", and "democratic" and who live off the corpse of the  great Iuliu Maniu insulted the National Day. I said this to  President Ion Iliescu. Then I spoke, publicly, at a PRM press  conference on that paradoxical December. A few weeks later, when  I had collected two pages of material critical of the rabbi, I  had a change of heart and I remembered the little man with the  teary eyes and frosty beard, on the stage decorated with fir  trees, and I did not publish any of it. Indeed, I even sent the  galleys to Ion Iliescu (something I never do) and I wrote him a  few words, saying that I could not see any merit in carrying a  fight to the absurd, especially when the adversary is old,  powerless, and sick.    "Moses Rosen is dead!" a friend announced to me that Friday,  near Iasi. There were a number of guests, besides me, including  Iasi professor Gheorghe Buzatu, who had just returned from  Israel, as well as Professor Mircea Musat, our parliamentarians  Iuliu Furo, Anghel Stanciu, Ion Marinescu, Ion Carciumaru,  Theodor Constantinescu, Viorel Burlacu, Marcel Moldovan, Dan  Cristian Popovici, Generals Traian Bandila and Theodor  Paraschiv, and other members of the PRM leadership such as  Mircea Hamza, Dan Mirescu, Cornel Ciontu, Sever Mesca, and  Alexandru Mica. The news passed quickly through the small garden  where we were eating, from parliamentarians to newsmen, from  newsmen to the leaders of the local prefecture. Then, I  experienced a strange feeling: Instead of rejoicing (as someone  who said to me: "I have some good news for you!" would have  thought) -- I was sad. My greatest enemy had died and I was  suffering as one would after the death of a friend. I still did  not know the human soul. I read in history books that, after  their enemies died, our great voivodes made merry and feasted  and even gave donations to the church. Since I am not a voivode  and since I am animated by somewhat more Christian charity, I  cannot do this. With the death of Moses Rosen, 15 years of my  life become more barren. He began to denounce me to the  leadership of the Romanian Communist Party and in the world  press in 1979.    In 1980, after the publication of the famous article  entitled  "Ideals" [Idealuri], he denounced me once again. I was visiting  him, accompanied by a Jewish photo-reporter Armand Rosenthal  (one of my colleagues at AGERPRES, a particularly fine man), and  I tried to give him a dignified explanation. But the rabbi told  the world press that I had become a fascist and he told me to  leave. This was not true and I do not know what made him falsify  the truth.    In September 1980, he made the biggest mistake of his life:  He sent a terrible letter to the Romanian Academy demanding that  Volume IX of the complete works of Mihai Eminescu be taken off  the market, calling the National Poet a fascist, Iron Guard  supporter, hooligan, fool, and pornographer. This was a bit too  much, a bit above the level of tolerance of the Romanian people.  Three people protested this move: Alexandru Oprea, Pompiliu  Marcea, and myself. The first two died under mysterious  circumstances. One had a cardiac arrest while bathing (at 50  years of age!) and the other drowned, in broad daylight, in Lake  Herestrau. I did not die because God loved me, even though the  rabbi said to one of his fellow Jews, in reference to the rumor  that I would be receiving a grant to go to Italy: "If Vadim goes  abroad, he might find himself with a knife in his back!" I did  not go. I stayed home to see how my book of verses, "Saturnalia"  [Saturnalii], was taken out of bookstores and libraries, also by  the rabbi.    From April to November 1984, I was banned from the press and  the radio. I did not appear on television, which, at that time,  was controlled by Jews, from April 1984 to September 1990. These  were hellish times for me. I was dragged into lawsuits. I  received death threats on the telephone. There was ferocious  psychological pressure. I was pursued. Most of the people  regarded me as if I had the plague. Elena Ceausescu decided that  I should receive severe sanctions from the party, after a  memorial session and after Emil Bobu, instigated by her, put me  at wit's end! Isn't that right, Ion Traian Stefanescu and  Constantin Radu? You were there. My beloved parents prayed daily  for me. My mother wept and her health became frail. She took  everything to heart. But the wounds began to heal. It was hard  for me but I did not die of hunger.    In 1990, after these events, the rabbi defamed Eminescu once  again, calling him a fascist and Iron Guard supporter, in an  Iasi review. Then he criticized a number of Romanian writers,  from Fanus Neagu and Al. Calinescu to Eugen Barbu and Cezar  Ivanescu. This was too much. The man did not know any bounds. He  was convulsed by the tremors of a strange malady; dismembering  Romanian culture. In 1957 he had denounced Mihail Sadoveanu's  novel "The Axe" [Baltagul], at all forums. Later on, he  criticized Vasile Alecsandri and Octavian Goga, threatening  that, if he is not satisfied, we would not receive  most-favored-nation treatment from the Americans, which was an  exaggeration on his part, since the United States also had very  great strategic interests in the area.    But, in 1990, he was in for a definite reaction. Romanians  could respond to him since the press was free. Immediately, he  disseminated throughout the world press the scare that "there is  the scent of a pogrom in Romania." No one believed him. His time  had passed. What pogrom? Who has anything against the Jews? At  about the same time, in front of Coral Temple in Bucharest, he  installed a sort of monument on which it is written that Romania  was, allegedly, one of the centers of the world Holocaust and  that we killed 400,000 Jews by terrible tortures. These were all  lies, but I think that they were not originated by him but by  the leaders of world Zionism who would like to blame the  Romanian people to demand $50 billion in damages, as a greedy  person revealed, in Tel Aviv.    The same holds true for the whole saraband of lies about the  army and Marshal Antonescu. The televised appearances of the  rabbi were scandalous, especially the one at the beginning of  1994 when, for 30 minutes, in prime time, he levied unimaginable  insults against the Romanian people. Intentionally, I did not  publish anything on the part of ROMANIA MARE which would  escalate a useless scandal. As you probably remember, I  presented the opinions of some disgusted Romanians, which had  been published in EVENIMENTUL ZILEI and ORA. Probably His  Eminence, if he was still lucid at that time, was shaken by the  lightning bolts and agitation of the people's rage. It exceeded  all limits. Later, two patriotic historians, professors Gheorghe  Buzatu and Florin Constantiniu, went to the television studio  seeking the right to reply and to restore some of the sullied  honor of the army and the Romanian people. They were not allowed  to do so. The rabbi was stronger. He acted like a head of state.    However, there is someone even stronger: God, who cut short  the thread of his life. Some say that the curses of the war  invalids who were mutilated at the battlefront, while the Jews  swept the snow on the streets and drank hot cinnamon wine, got  to him; others say that the anathemas of the Orthodox priests  got to him; finally, someone telephoned me to tell me that he  took along with him another great man who had been defamed by  the rabbi, Eugen Barbu [founder of ROMANIA MARE], both dying in  the same intensive care room in the Elias Hospital. I will not  make any statement on this. There is a fatality, a  predestination which is beyond us.    This is not the time or the place to judge the sins which  Moses Rosen committed against the Romanian people. Who knows,  perhaps they can be compensated for by his very great service to  his people Israel, helping about 400,000 Jews to leave Romania  for the Promised Land, the land of their ancestors, which is  quite admirable, and to his credit! As for me, I have the  courage and honesty to forgive him for the days and nights of  nightmares which he caused for my parents and me. To forgive and  forget in the Christian way. This is the difference between  Christianity and Zionism, which does not forgive, does not  forget, and even invents, constantly, other plagues, other  holocausts, and other hunters of men.    I prefer to remember the rabbi as I saw him, in the flesh,  for the last time, on that unforgettable day of 1 December 1993.  At that time, a large part of his sins was washed away. I  recognize this but I would have every reason to ignore such a  thing. I am not an anti-Semite. I cannot be inherently against  any people. And I cannot persecute the people who wrote the  Bible. This is why I was saddened in my soul at the death of  this old man. Perhaps I was reliving the sorrow of King David  who had fought with his unyielding son, Absalom. But, when he  found out that soldiers had killed him in an olive grove, he,  the King of the Psalms, cried his heart out and ripped up his  clothes. What strange alchemy is in the Romanian soul!    As for the funeral ceremony, which was broadcast live on  Radio Bucharest, for two hours on Sunday evening, I believe that  this was too much and it exasperated many citizens. I am  relaying only a few of the telephone messages which we received:  "It's a wonder that Iliescu did not proclaim a national day of  mourning!"; "Is it possible that Nicolae Ceausescu's  gravedigger, the sinister Gelu Voican, was not there?"; "Rabbi  Neuman of Timisoara screamed hysterically and insulted the  Romanians; he claimed that Moses Rosen fought against the  Communists but he forgot to say that Rosen was a close friend of  Ana Pauker [former Foreign Minister, a Jew] and that he was a  deputy in the Grand National Assembly for 40 years."; "A week  ago, the great bishop of Tomis and the lower Danube, the 80-year  old scholar Antim Nica, died but Iliescu did not go to his  funeral and Radiotelevision reported 1,000 times less about the  bishop than it did about the death of the rabbi"; "Where did the  American rabbi get the term "great genius" for Moses Rosen?";  "The richest man in Romania has died. Who got his money?"; "Did  you read ORA on Saturday? On page 1, Nicolae Cristache has given  the amazing title: "An Outstanding Personality of the World Has  Died," as if the rabbi from Moinesti were an "outstanding  personality" like Jesus Christ. Moses, Alexander of Macedonia,  Julius Caesar, Dante Alighieri, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci,  Napoleon Bonaparte, Beethoven, or Brancusi!"; "Moses Rosen died  but we still have the new Israeli ambassador who recently  insulted Eminescu, calling him anti-Semitic and slaughtered  Marshal Antonescu, once again, calling him a war criminal, even  though, when you were in Iasi, you called for his expulsion from  the country"; "When will Iliescu get out of the clutches of  Eugen Preda-Glotter, director general of Radio? In the past four  years, a number of great national cultural figures died, such as  Edgar Papu, Ion Lancranjan, Eugen Barbu, Geo Bogza, Eugen  Ionescu, Academician David Prodan, Petre Tutea, Father Dumitru  Staniloae, Gina Patrichi, Gheorghe Cozorici, George Constantin,  Theofil Valcu, Jean Georgescu, and Cella Delavrancea, and there  was not a single minute of direct radio coverage of their  funerals"; "Who is paying for the charter flight to Israel  [where Rosen was buried]?"    We reproduced only a few of the indignant telephone calls  from ordinary Romanians who could not understand how their  Sunday and Monday evening radio programs could be replaced by  the two live broadcasts, from Bucharest and Jerusalem. We  reproduced these opinions because this is the democratic way.  Radio subscriptions are paid for by Romanian contributors and  they have the right to know what is being done with their money,  their nerves, and their time. But, it is all over now. Let us  accept the idea that it was a more special funeral of a more  special clergyman, representing a special tribe of people. Let  us not be evil and do what we criticize others for doing.    The rabbi desired my death but I did not desire his death.  The rabbi made judgements about me but I did not make judgements  about him. The rabbi banned me in my country but I did not ban  him. I could not and I did not want to. After December 1989, the  rabbi derided his great benefactor, Nicolae Ceausescu, which I  did not do, although the former head of state punished me  because of the rabbi. Also, Jews in Israel and the United States  criticized Moses Rosen unsparingly for 40 years, but he did not  accuse any of them of anti-Semitism.    "Moses Rosen is dead!" -- the silent trumpet of that voice  which gave me the news that the enemy of my home and of Romanian  culture had crossed the threshhold to eternity still resounds. I  was as sad as if my best friend had died. Undoubtedly, he was a  person of international caliber, an educated man, a brilliant  scholar of the Bible and the Torah, a character from a novel, a  devoted husband, a distinguished pastor of Jewish souls. I think  that all these qualities will carry a lot of weight at the Last  Judgement. May God forgive him his sins, value his merits, and  give rest to his tormented soul. Lord, have mercy on him! I  forgave him long ago.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, June 10 (TANJUG) -- Fehmi Agani, second in  command in the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo (DSK) party of the  Albanian separatists in the southern Serbian province of  Kosovo-Metohija (Kosmet), openly admitted on Friday that the  Republic of Albania was guiding the activities of the political  movement of the Albanians in the province.    The DSK vice-chairman told a press conference that "identity  of stands between the DSK and Albania" was reaffirmed on  Thursday during the talk between DSK Chairman Ibrahim Rugova and  Albanian President Sali Berisha.    Agani said that "consultations and coordination of DSK  activities with Albania were one of the major results of the  political movement of the Albanians in Kosovo-Metohija." Agani  admitted that Albania's "strong support" was the major factor of  success of the struggle for the fulfillment of DSK demands.    The Albanian separatists have been trying for decades to  secede Kosovo-Metohija from Serbia, i.e. the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.), using conventional terrorist methods and  attacking members of the police and the army. The F.R.Y.'s  attempts to develop good-neighbourly relations with neighbouring  Republic of Albania remain unsuccessful because Tirana is  persistently and openly supporting the separatist movement in  Kosmet, thus meddling with the F.R.Y.'s internal affairs.</p>

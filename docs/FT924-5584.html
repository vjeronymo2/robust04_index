			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Chicago airport backed ILLINOIS Governor Jim Edgar has outlined a plan to locate a third international airport in the Chicago area near rural Peotone, disregarding criticism that it would be too far away and would not draw airlines or passengers, AP reports from Chicago. The Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) plan includes proposals to build an additional runway to relieve congestion at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and create a Dollars 423m high-speed rail system linking down-town Chicago to the proposed new airport about 35 miles away. The airport would create 102,000 construction jobs and 167,000 permanent jobs by 2020, Mr Edgar said. The Illinois Senate turned down an earlier proposal for a Dollars 10.8bn airport, for which Chicago Mayor Richard Daley fought for three years.</p>

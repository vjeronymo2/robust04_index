			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (35): Conglomerates illustrate a paradox - The prices which rose most sharply last year were those of shares themselves. As a result, some of the star performers have been from the City / Focus on the UK 500 There is a curious paradox lurking in this year's UK industrial rankings. On the one hand, BTR has moved from 11th place to 8th, while Hanson has held its position at 9th. Conglomerates, it seems, are a good thing. On the other hand, look at Imperial Chemical Industries. Last year ICI decided it was too much like a conglomerate for comfort, and split itself in two: a new high-tech company called Zeneca, and a new ICI taking in bulk chemicals. The combined value of the two is now Pounds 12bn, which would rank ICI in its old form as 10th in the UK, displacing Marks and Spencer. The year before, ICI only ranked 16th. So conglomerates, it seems, are a bad thing after all. In fact, both sides of the paradox make perfect sense in their own terms. The relevant characteristic of both BTR and Hanson is that they are well and conservatively managed. It is this, quite as much as their diversity, that equips them to survive in the present tough economic conditions. It is worth recalling that the biggest company in the US by market value is now a quintessential conglomerate, General Electric, with activities ranging from stockbroking to building locomotives. Again, the relevant characteristic is management. Mr Jack Welch, GE's boss, is perhaps the most admired manager in the US. As for ICI, the fact that it has been able to add value by splitting itself up is perhaps not surprising. Successive generations of ICI management have toyed with the idea for decades, if only on the grounds that making investment decisions across the range of ICI's businesses was becoming increasingly hard as the technology became more sophisticated. Other members of the top 100 companies in the UK, such as Vodafone and Courtaulds, are the successful products of demerger. The argument for and against conglomerates is an interesting one in theory. In practice, it seems, it is more a matter of horses for courses. The rankings contain another wider paradox, this time to do with the theme of inflation. The single biggest reason for the strength of the UK stock market in the past year has been the realisation that stable prices may not be a mere cyclical phenomenon, but part of a deeper economic shift. But that same factor has resulted in some of the year's biggest casualties. The big supermarket chains, for instance, need rising prices to ensure high margins, which in turn are needed to finance their ambitious expansion programmes. Unsurprisingly, therefore, Sainsbury and Tesco have taken a hammering. Some of the smaller supermarket chains have fared even worse: William Low, which last year was a respectable 360th, is now within an ace of falling out of the rankings. Similarly, the soaring share price of Guinness in the late 1980s was based above all on persuading Scotch drinkers around the world to pay ever-increasing prices for their tipple on the basis of its snob appeal. In a world of stable prices, that game is over. Guinness has fallen from 8th to 16th. The niche malt whisky maker Macallan-Glenlivet has slumped from 282 to 383. On the other hand, look at British Steel. This, one would think, must surely have been a casualty last year. The business press has been full of the crisis in Europe's steel industry, and of faltering attempts to cut capacity. But on the contrary, British Steel has been a star performer, jumping from 90th to 59th. The reason - and here is the real paradox - is that it has successfully raised its prices several times in the past year. British Steel is not alone. The building materials companies such as Redland and Blue Circle have also raised prices, and have jumped in the ratings accordingly. There is a further twist. Part of the reason for these companies' strong performance is linked to the property market: Land Securities and MEPC, for instance, have also risen sharply in the ratings. This is because the market detects signs of recovery in property: that is, prices are rising again. From a purely industrial viewpoint, the net effect of all this is slightly depressing. Of the 49 sectors in the London equity market, 22 consist of companies which actually make things. Of those, only four rose in the rankings last year: building materials, housebuilding, fabricated metals (largely steel) and aerospace. The first three have been touched on: the fourth is chiefly based on the remarkable recovery at British Aerospace, which in turn owes much to the renaissance of BAe's Rover subsidiary. Less cheerfully, 10 of the industrial sectors fell in the rankings. Again, the sectors worst affected have been those most hit by falling prices - in particular, drugs, tobacco and drink. It is an illustration of the global effects of deflation that in drugs and tobacco particularly, the bad news has come from the US. For drugs, the deciding factor has been President Clinton's campaign to reduce health costs. For tobacco, it was Philip Morris's dramatic decision last April to slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes. But from an investment viewpoint, none of this is a reason to be down-hearted. After all, the prices which rose most sharply in the UK last year were those of shares themselves. As a result, some of the star performers in the rankings have been from the City. The stockbroking firm Smith New Court has come from nowhere to enter the rankings at 381. The merchant bank Schroders went from 130 to 90. Along with its fellow merchant bank Warburg, it won itself a place last year in the FT-SE index of Britain's 100 biggest companies. The fact that hopes of a reviving economy have principally benefited folk in the City is scarcely surprising. Indeed, it illustrates to perfection an old maxim in stockbroking. The way to make money, says the maxim, is as follows: find out where the action is - diamonds in South Africa, oil in the North Sea - and go there. But whatever you do, do not get involved in diamonds or oil yourself. Sell sandwiches.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK biggest employers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             UK500    Company                         Sector    Rank      Employees  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 BAT Industries                     171       6         197989  2 BT                                 223       1         170700  3 BTR                                591       8         135133  4 Sainsbury J                        493      19         120119  5 Imperial Chemical Industries       622      28         117500  6 British Aerospace                  523      91         108500  7 Lonrho                             171     146         106161  8 British Petroleum                  212       5         105750  9 Grand Metropolitan                 421      14         102405 10 BET                                171     116         101408 11 HSBC Holdings                      112       4          99148 12 General Electric Company           541      13          93228 13 Tesco                              493      38          86066 14 National Westminster Bank          112      17          85900 15 Bass                               421      37          84095 16 Forte                              464      78          81000 17 Boots Company                      492      32          79738 18 British Gas                        222       7          79377 19 Barclays                           112      18          76852 20 Hanson                             171       9          75000 21 P &amp; O Steam Navigation             303      48          71133 22 Asda Group                         493      88          69288 23 RTZ Corporation                    634      21          68298 24 Lloyds Bank                        112      20          67083 25 Argyll Group                       493      45          65937  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke plans to reduce staff in reorganisation Ladbroke is to reduce its head office and central services staff by more than half in a reorganisation which will be completed by the end of this year. The hotels, betting and retailing group said the number of head office and central administrative staff would be cut from 280 to 120. Not all of the employees affected would be made redundant as some will be moved into Ladbroke's divisions. Members of the head office legal department will be moved into the group's individual businesses. Posts which will be eliminated completely, however, include 85 jobs at a group distribution depot in Barnsley. Ladbroke said profits in the three months to the end of September were ahead of the same period last year and recovered the first half shortfall - pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 were Pounds 57.3m after exceptional items, compared with Pounds 62.5m. Hotels in the UK, particularly in London, showed increases in both occupancy and room rate. Hotel performance in continental Europe and Japan, however, was below last year's level and significant recovery would not be apparent until 1995. Hilton's performance overall was slightly below that of the corresponding period last year, the group said. Retail betting in the UK was hampered by dry summer weather and hard ground, but had since recovered. Credit betting in the third quarter was lower than in the second, although Ladbroke described results as 'satisfactory'. The Vernons pools business performed well. Sales at Texas Homecare were slightly down on a like-for-like basis, but margins improved following measures taken in the first half. The shares rose 1p to close at 154p.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Slow progress on the 'green' route: EC environment ministers face a tough task after Rio TOMORROW'S meeting of European Community environment ministers at Gleneagles in Scotland will show that progress on enforcing environmental rules remains elusive, in spite of the UK's vigorous promises of action three months ago when it took over the EC presidency. The informal council meeting will be the first time all 12 environment ministers have met since the Rio Earth Summit in June. It has been called because of the summit's weighty legacy of administration. Heading the agenda is the task of putting into practice the Rio resolutions on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and preserving biodiversity - the distribution of the world's species. The UK intends to ratify the climate-change convention - for which it needs parliamentary approval - by 1993, but has given no date for biodiversity. The Gleneagles meeting will also consider how to promote 'the greening of all EC legislation'. That policy is expected to have the support of Mr Karel van Miert, who took up a six-month appointment as EC environment commissioner in June, and who is also the community's transport commissioner. DG11, the EC environmental council's policy development arm, has had little influence with other Brussels directorates, and several large Mediterranean projects have recently received EC money although they were then deemed to be environmentally harmful. Behind the scenes, members of the UK team are lobbying for Mr Miert to remain commissioner after December - he has given a more encouraging response to the UK position than his predecessor, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana. However, moves to enforce EC 'green' rules more vigorously - which Mr Michael Howard, UK environment minister, announced would be a priority - are making slow progress. Gleneagles will be told that representatives from national enforcement agencies will have their first meeting in November, but that falls short of the UK's original plan for a central 'inspectorate of inspectorates'. Nor does the repeal of some EC legislation on water standards at which Mr Howard hinted in June, now look likely.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CiU Satisfied With Its Support for </F> Government"]    [Excerpt] Barcelona -- The Convergence and Union (CiU)  coalition's liaison committee yesterday expressed its  satisfaction with "the course of negotiations with the central  government and the positive expectation" of new agreements on  autonomy policy.    Among these expectations, CiU highlights the transfer of  powers in agriculture and justice, public health funding, and  the autonomous police law, Europa Press reports.    The liaison committee assessed as positive CiU's  contributions in economic policy, especially in the negotiations  on the reform of the labor market, "which are aimed essentially  at assisting the necessary economic recovery, job creation, and  confidence-building."    The committee also referred to the coming European  elections,  and commented on an opinion poll which places CiU as the winning  political force in Catalonia, since the pol indicates that CiU  will succeed in defeating the Socialists in nonautonomous  community elections for the first time.    As CiU spokesmen Pere Esteve and Eugeni Perez-Moreno  explained, the nationalists' macropoll indicates the prospect of  a loss of votes for the Socialist Party of Catalonia and a  continuation of the upward trend registered by the People's  Party in the last legislative elections.    With respect to this poll, the liaison committee believes  that it is quantitatively and qualitatively "favorable" for CiU,  because it places the coalition as the winner of these  elections, and because it represents "a very favorable  assessment of the work performed by Chairman Pujol in Europe and  of the policy upheld by CiU in the European Parliament, as well  as of the policy conducted by the coalition in Catalonia and at  the national level."

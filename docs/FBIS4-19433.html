			<p>BFN     [Text] "A government cannot govern if its policies are not  accepted in both chambers of parliament. Were that to happen,  there would be no other solution than to go back to the  electorate with a majority that would be confirmed and  strengthened by the experience. I hope this does not prove  necessary." Silvio Berlusconi has thus added his voice to those  who think there might be a new general election if Giovanni  Spadolini were to win.    Earlier the Northern League's Roberto Maroni had warned: We  will have another general election and "we will say that the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] and the PPI [Italian Popular  Party] were in cahoots to bring the institutions to a standstill  and we will ask the nation for greater power."</p>

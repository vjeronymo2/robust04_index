			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Nigerian oil strike turmoil continues Further oil output losses and the continued closure of the main commercial banks yesterday hindered Nigeria's military regime in breaking the six-week oil strike and getting the economy back to normal. Anglo-Dutch Shell, which operates about half Nigeria's 2m b/d oil industry, announced yesterday the temporary closure of its Forcados terminal, which exports 500,000 b/d. Shell has not disclosed how much of the other 500,000 b/d produced at its Bonny Terminal is being lost because of political strikes by the two oil workers' unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, aimed at installing jailed opposition leader Mr Moshood Abiola as president. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for October fell to Dollars 15.75 in late London trading yesterday, 60 cents down on Friday's close. Mr Don Etiebet, oil minister, said many oil workers had reported to work. But oil officials said it was too early to say if the strike had been broken. Mr Aminu Saleh, secretary to the government, warned banks yesterday that unless they opened by tomorrow he would 'review their licences'. The big commercial banks, all privatised last year, hold most of the banks' deposits; for the government to close them would paralyse the system. The banks joined yesterday in the latest auction of foreign exchange in which Dollars 100m will be sold. The acute shortage of foreign currency in Nigeria has cut the auctions from fortnightly to one a month.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Japan gets liquor tax deadline THE European Community and spirits-exporting countries have given Japan a deadline of next April to meet its obligation under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to harmonise its liquor taxes. The deadline was presented to Japanese officials by a delegation of international spirits exporters and comes six years after a Gatt ruling that Japanese liquor taxes discriminate against imports. 'When the trade imbalance of the EC and Japan is in excess of Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.8bn), the implementation of the 1987 Gatt ruling is one of tremendous importance to us,' said Mr Ron Brown, chairman of the European Business Community Liquor Committee. Whisky and brandy pay six to nine times more tax than shochu, a traditional liquor. Imported spirits account for 8 per cent of the Japanese market, compared with 30 to 40 per cent of other developed countries with a uniform tax system for all spirits, according to the European Confederation of Spirits Producers.</p>

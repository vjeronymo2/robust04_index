			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTERS CLOSE RANCHO SECO PLANT: 'THE NUCLEAR ENERGY QUANDARY'  </P> <P> Your editorial correctly asserted the nuclear power industry must learn some  lessons from the voters' decision to turn off the Rancho Seco nuclear plant.  Here's another lesson for the list: nuclear waste.  </P> <P> The industry went full-bore into nuclear power production before finding a safe  way to dispose of deadly radioactive wastes or decommission the plants.  Furthermore, nuclear power does pollute. Each year, the average 1,000-megawatt  nuclear reactor produces 25 metric tons of highly radioactive wastes. All these  wastes are being stored on site at each reactor.  </P> <P> A National Academy of Sciences study prepared for the Department of Energy  states that we do not know if current technology can safely isolate those  wastes from the environment. Repeated failures at the Waste Isolation Project  Plant in Carlsbad, N.M., where the DOE plans to store radioactive defense  wastes, indicate that safe nuclear waste disposal is a contradiction in terms.  </P> <P> The commercial nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nev., is flawed  because it was a politically expedient choice, the bomb testing at the nearby  Nevada Test Site and the potential for earthquakes. In the nuclear industry's  best-of-all-possible worlds, it won't even begin to accept nuclear wastes until  the early part of the next century. This is nothing but a hasty and ill-advised  remedy to a dangerous, deadly problem.  </P> <P> MARY O' DRISCOLL  </P> <P> National Press Coordinator  </P> <P> Safe Energy Communication Council  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

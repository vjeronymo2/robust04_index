			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Arts: Live Like Pigs - Theatre The revival of John Arden's Live Like Pigs at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs 35 years after it was first performed on the Court's main stage is a must both for students of drama and of social history. The most interesting aspect of it is the way it is rooted in the immediate postwar past, yet uncannily looks forward to a rebellion against the welfare state. The date is 1958 or thereabouts; British standards of living were rising rapidly and bureaucratic controls were being reduced. Yet that is not how it comes out in the play. Bureaucracy is seen as all-powerful, whether from the Town Hall, which allocates housing, or the National Insurance Office, which checks indirectly on people's movements. The intention behind the welfare state may be benign (Arden doesn't overtly concede even that); his play suggests that it was feared, not loved, by those whom it was set up to help. As for rising affluence, the only visible consumer good in Live Like Pigs is an old-fashioned gramophone which plays 78s. Possession of this is enough to pin a suspicion that it may have been stolen. There are no telephones, no TV and only a reference to cars, though there is a regular bus service. The underlying idea of Arden's play is a good one and has stood the test of time. An extended family of travelling people who used to live in a caravan by the railway siding is moved into a new housing development. Next door is a more conventional family where father and daughter have jobs, the mother does the washing, and there is a settled way of life. The two families clash, just as the inflow of migrants has continued to lead to clashes with the more established community. Live Like Pigs is more subtle than outright confrontation. There are sexual exchanges between the families. The conventional working class man remembers the experiences he had during the war and falls for Big Rachel, sensationally played by Kathryn Hunter as one of the travellers. In the end, the established community turns on the outsiders. But there have been some striking changes in attitudes. The policeman who enters is not automatically presented by Arden as chief villain. If anything, he is rather less culpable than the man from the Town Hall: simply out of his depth in the new order. The female doctor who comes fom the National Health Service is shown as utterly useless. In those days there were no social workers. Theatre styles have changed, too. Live Like Pigs is three hours long and has an unnecessary chorus. The influence of writing for TV has made this kind of play much shorter and tighter. Yet produced by the Classics on a Shoestring Company and directed by Katie Mitchell, Arden's work is still a classic of its kind. Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, (071) 730 2554</p>

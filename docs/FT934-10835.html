			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian freight tariffs up 50% RUSSIA has raised rail freight tariffs by 50 per cent for oil, metals, coal and other goods transported within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) but export cargoes will not have to pay the higher fees, reports Reuter from Moscow. A ministry telegram obtained yesterday said the state pricing committee decided on October 20 to raise tariffs within the CIS (including Georgia and Azerbaijan). But the increase did not apply to cargoes destined for export to non-CIS markets 'through Russian railway stations located near ports or state frontiers'. The telegram, dated October 19, said freight charges would be based on tariffs set in 1989 multiplied by 2,463 for wagon and container dispatches, and by 4,922 for smaller deliveries. With the exception of export cargoes, 20 per cent value added tax will be maintained for all goods, the telegram said. It was not clear if the new fees will also apply to imports, including metal ores and concentrates brought to Russia for tolling - refining the metal in Russia and selling it to export markets. Many companies complain high rail tariffs, taxes and other costs are making trade unprofitable. Trade sources say there have been rumours of a further rise in freight tariffs by 15 or 20 per cent this month. One official source said there would probably not be any increases, at least until December.</p>

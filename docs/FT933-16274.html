			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Japanese to open Midlands textiles factory TORAY, Japan's biggest textiles company, will on Wednesday open the east Midlands' second-biggest inward investment project after Toyota's car plant at Derby. A Pounds 50m weaving mill at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, will employ 200 people in its early stages, rising to as many as 400 in two years. The new jobs will make little impact on Mansfield's unemployment, swollen to more than 6,000 by mine closures. The highly automated plant's output will help reduce the Pounds 42m polyester fabric import bill that Britain paid Japan last year. Toray also plans to export the UK-made fabrics to the rest of Europe. The factory will take polyester filament and twist it in a variety of ways before weaving it. Mr Colin Purvis, secretary-general of the British Apparel and Textile Confederation, said this would create the most sophisticated textures in polyester fabrics available in the UK. Most of the buyers of the cloth will be clothing suppliers to Marks and Spencer, the UK's biggest garment retailer. Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, Europe's biggest textiles company and a clothing supplier to M and S, said: 'This is good for the British textiles industry. You've got much quicker response and a much shorter supply line for these fabrics.' The Mansfield plant will eventually double Toray's fabric output in the UK to 39m metres a year. The company's UK turnover should rise to Pounds 80m a year as the new plant joins others at Hyde, Cheshire, and Bulwell, Nottinghamshire.</p>

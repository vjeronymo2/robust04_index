			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEWARD BOUND;  </P> <P> S. KOREA'S EXPORT-ORIENTED FIRMS ARE TARGETING A NEWLY AFFLUENT DOMESTIC MARKET  THAT'S NOW THE KEY PROP IN THE NATION'S ECONOMY.  </P> <P> Until this year, Namil Metal Co. sold all $38 million of its stainless steel  cookware overseas, 40% of it in the United States.  </P> <P> But now Namil is gearing up to enter the fastest-growing market in sight: the  one at home.  </P> <P> In July, the firm launched its first sales program in South Korea -- with an  electric coffee percolator and a stainless steel toaster that does not get hot  on the outside. In November, it will start marketing its pots and pans here.  </P> <P> "Korean wives won't buy one pot or pan. They want a whole set," said Cho Gyu  Gon, the firm's export manager. "A five- or 10-piece set costs between $150 and  $300," and, until recently, most Korean housewives could not afford such a  purchase.  </P> <P> But now that families with annual incomes of around $18,000 are becoming more  common in South Korea, Namil feels that a market for its products has developed  at home. By 1993, Cho said, the firm expects to sell $40 million in products --  about 40% of its projected sales -- in South Korea.  </P> <P> However, the country as a whole is undergoing a transformation even faster than  the one that Namil plans.  </P> <P> This year, for the first time since South Korea began to shake off the yoke of  grinding poverty in the mid-1960s, demand at home will replace exports as the  major prop of economic growth. And this historical transformation promises to  be permanent.  </P> <P> Wage increases of more than 60% since late 1987, labor disruptions and the  increased value of the won currency have spurred a major and sudden decline in  the growth of exports. Cries of alarm have arisen from government and business.  But also emerging, virtually unnoticed, is a new picture of the nation's 42  million people -- not as mouths to feed but as consumers armed with soaring  buying power.  </P> <P> Domestic demand will support 85% of the growth in the gross national product  this year -- a complete reversal of the past -- said Ro Sung Tae, director of  research coordination at the government-funded Korea Development Institute.  Between 1981 and 1988, increases in exports provided 75% to 80% of growth,  according to the Bank of Korea.  </P> <P> Even with an expected recovery in exports, demand at home will support about  65% of GNP growth next year and will continue to provide more than 50% of  growth into the future, Ro added.  </P> <P> "The days when you could look at the Korean trade balance and tell whether the  Korean economy was doing well or not are over," said a Western diplomat, who  asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> In an annual white paper on trade, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and  Industry declared that South Korea -- and Taiwan, as well -- were  "restructuring" to become "domestic-driven" economies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buying Better Products  </P> <P> Already, the United States is reaping gains from the change. Aided partly by  South Korean government efforts to divert sourcing of machinery from Japan to  the United States, U.S. exports to this country soared 46% last year and are  increasing by more than 20% this year. By comparison, from 1982 to 1986, U.S.  sales to South Korea never grew by more than 9.6% a year.  </P> <P> Richer Korean consumers are buying upgrade food and beverage products -- like  fruit, beef, almonds and wine -- as Seoul carries out pledges to gradually open  its agricultural markets. Imported furniture, too, has suddenly become a hit  product.  </P> <P> Service industries, such as advertising, banking and insurance -- in which the  United States is interested -- are also growing.  </P> <P> Signs of change are emerging everywhere.  </P> <P> Domestic car sales are expected to increase by at least 40% this year -- and,  if auto makers can produce the vehicles, demand could rise by as much as 60%.  With its sales in the United States down sharply this year, Hyundai Motors, the  top exporter, expects to sell more cars at home than abroad for the first time  since 1984.  </P> <P> Air conditioners, color television sets, refrigerators and washing machines are  so much in demand in South Korea that electronics firms have stopped offering  discounts and, instead, have raised prices by about 10%.  </P> <P> Construction contracts, in terms of floor space planned in new buildings, are  up 36.8%. Hyundai Construction &amp; Engineering Co., which only a few years  got 90% of its orders overseas, is now conducting 70% of its business at home,  said Chung Hoon Mok, the firm's president.  </P> <P> So strong is the domestic construction boom that the government has started  curtailing exports of steel bars, cement and glass to keep projects running.  </P> <P> Household consumption of electricity is rising by 18.5% compared to last year,  dwarfing a 1.9% increase in factory consumption of electricity.  </P> <P> In the first half of the year, not only had the number of South Koreans  traveling overseas soared 74% but spending by each had also doubled, compared  to last year, to $2,320, the Transportation Ministry said. By comparison,  visitors to South Korea spent only $1,355 per trip, the ministry said.  </P> <P> "For years, Korean leaders have been telling the people to live frugally and  sacrifice for the future," the Western diplomat said. But for the average  Korean whose disposable income has increased in the past two years, "the future  is now."  </P> <P> Firms mainly engaged in domestic business scored double-digit growth in sales  and profits, while export-oriented companies were doing only half as well, the  Bank of Korea reported. Domestic-oriented firms were also accumulating assets  faster and raising productivity by bigger margins, the bank added.  </P> <P> Already, the overall business of the Hyundai conglomerate of companies, one of  South Korea's most export-oriented business groups, is divided almost equally  between the domestic market and overseas activities, Chung said. At its peak,  he said, the group did 87% of its business overseas.  </P> <P> Chung also said rising protectionist sentiment in the United States, South  Korea's main market, is adding a coercive element to the transformation. "For  protection against the protectionists, we're going to have to look inward for  the first time in the country's economic development," he said.  </P> <P> Major new projects planned by the government promise to provide an even greater  stimulus to growth at home in the coming years. Among them are plans to build  two major satellite cities of Seoul, to construct 2 million housing units by  1992, to expand subways in Seoul and to develop industrial complexes on the  country's west coast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low Export Growth  </P> <P> Growth in consumption that has exceeded 10% so far this year, however, has not  replaced the decline in the growth of exports. In the first half of the year,  overseas shipments increased 6.7%, compared to a 29% spurt last year, and the  trade surplus fell to $2 billion, only 44% of the black ink in the same period  in 1988.  </P> <P> This year, Ro predicted, exports will grow by only 3%.  </P> <P> And with the GNP expected to increase by no more than 7.5% after three straight  years of 12%-plus growth, almost no one is happy about the transformation of  the economy -- although the government of President Roh Tae Woo prescribed just  such a change last fall in a new five-year development plan.  </P> <P> So far, Roh and business leaders have devoted all of their attention to the  negatives of the economic transformation.  </P> <P> On June 19, the president declared war on spiraling wages, announcing his  intention to hold future pay raises to less than 10% a year. Painting the  country as if it were on the brink of economic collapse, officials released a  spate of statistics purporting to show that South Korea was pricing itself out  of competition in international markets and announced new policies to promote  exports.  </P> <P> Businessmen warned that exorbitant wage increases would increase unemployment  and cause a cost-push inflation.  </P> <P> Leaders of the ruling party have even started calling for a reversal of the  won's appreciation to promote exports, saying the South Korean currency, which  rose 16% in value last year, should now be devalued by 3%.  </P> <P> The Korea Herald, in an editorial, condemned the domestic spending spree as  "overindulgence in a quest for luxury" and "decadent commercialism."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Real Problems  </P> <P> Hyundai Construction's Chung also viewed it as an unhealthy development. "Rapid  wage increases," he complained, "are not turning into savings and new  production facilities but are going into private consumption."  </P> <P> Experts agree that some aspects of the boom constitute real problems. Land and  stock transactions -- which brought speculators windfall capital gains equal to  35% of the GNP in 1987, according to Ro -- are one such problem.  </P> <P> "In 1988 and 1989, the gains will be even bigger," the Korea Development  Institute analyst added. This "asset effect," along with wage increases, he  said, is contributing to greater consumption.  </P> <P> Plummeting investment in new factory equipment to increase productive capacity  is another worry, Chung insisted. "There's a rush to grab what you can grab  right now," Ro complained.  </P> <P> What Deputy Prime Minister Cho Soon called widespread inequities in wealth  contribute to that mentality. Cho said in a speech in June that a majority of  the people feel that they live in relative poverty while the rich keep  accumulating ever-greater wealth.  </P> <P> While 20% of the people receive 43.7% of the national income, the poorest 40%  get only 17.7%, Cho said. The inequity in land ownership, however, is far  greater: The richest 5% of the population possesses 65.2% of the privately  owned land, he said.  </P> <P> Workers have refused to heed calls for moderation, Ro said, because "they don't  believe the statistics the government and management provide. Even more, they  believe they can demand more because the government has been accommodating  their demands. They believe they have been sacrificed in the process of  economic growth and deserve rapid wage increases."  </P> <P> Indeed, even the underworld is becoming more assertive.  </P> <P> A thief who broke into a home in an upper-class section of Seoul in June  started sending extortion letters to his victim demanding compensation when he  discovered that the jewelry that he had stolen consisted entirely of  imitations.  </P> <P> Then there was the knife-wielding man who broke into the home of a former  defense minister and demanded cash. Offered the equivalent of $1,050, he  threatened the retired general with bodily injury and said the sum should have  been beneath the dignity of a former Cabinet official. After the victim  promised to hand over an extra $3,000 the next day, the robber left. But when  he came back to collect, police were on hand to greet him.  </P> <P> "If you're looking for a docile, well-disciplined, cheap work force, you're no  longer thinking of Korea," the Western diplomat said. Korean workers, he added,  are convinced that "we've got to get as much as we can as soon as we can  because this (situation) can't go on for long."  </P> <P> Businessmen, however, are quietly making adjustments to the new era in South  Korea, producing more high value-added products such as videocassette  recorders, sophisticated computer-controlled machine tools and semiconductors.  </P> <P> South Korea, as Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry noted, has  already surpassed France and West Germany in its semiconductor production.  </P> <P> Korean manufacturers are also carrying out automation programs to reduce labor  costs.  </P> <P> Namil's Cho, for example, said his firm plans to nearly triple its annual sales  to $100 million in five years without adding to its present labor force of 600  employees. And textile makers and footwear manufacturers are moving some of  their operations out of the country, mainly to Southeast Asia.  </P></p>

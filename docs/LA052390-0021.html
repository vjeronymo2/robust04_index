			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> WHY BUCK THE WATER-RATIONING TIDE?  </P> <P> As the dominant local water consumers, residents and businesses in the city of  San Diego can make or break the County Water Authority's urgent call for  conservation this summer. San Diego uses about 40% of the county's water  supply; without its participation, the countywide goal of a 10% water savings  between June and September would be difficult to meet.  </P> <P> Sadly, instead of adopting the modest mandatory water-use restrictions  recommended by the Water Authority, San Diego has decided on a 60-day program  of voluntary conservation. In addition to undermining the effort for a uniform  countywide conservation program, the city's initiative, drawn up by Mayor  Maureen O'Connor, is the kind of gamble that the county can ill afford this  summer.  </P> <P> Before Monday's San Diego City Council vote, 16 of the Water Authority's 24  member agencies had adopted its call for mandatory restrictions on washing  cars, watering lawns and hosing sidewalks.  </P> <P> Customers of those agencies now can reasonably argue that mandatory  restrictions unfairly target them, while the county's major users are free to  water their lawns at mid-day. And what are San Francisco Bay Area communities,  some of which have rationed water, to think of the cooperative spirit of the  city at the end of the state's pipeline?  </P> <P> Under the 60-day test, O'Connor will ask some of the city's biggest water users  to find methods of conserving water. If the plan fails, O'Connor argues, the  council can switch to a mandatory system. But by then, we will be two months  into the four-month summer season, with little time left for a strategy change.  </P> <P> The crux of O'Connor's gambit is that San Diegans are somehow different, that  they are more than willing to sacrifice if government embraces them as partners  instead of mandating behavior.  </P> <P> Perhaps. In 1977, during a bad drought, county residents racked up a 16%  savings under a voluntary program. But in 1988, when the city and county called  for voluntary conservation, only 4% was saved.  </P> <P> O'Connor also claims that her plan is more equitable than the Water Authority  program, which largely targets external irrigation.  </P> <P> The program is just the kind of against-conventional-wisdom venture that  Maureen O'Connor loves -- and that she has pulled off in the past: Witness the  success of last year's arts festival. This time, however, it would have been  wiser to follow expert advice and set an example for the rest of the county.  </P></p>

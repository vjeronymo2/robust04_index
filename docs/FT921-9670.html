			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: CGS in bid for Swedish competitor CAP Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest computer services group, is making a SKr500m (Dollars 88.3m) bid for Programator, its Scandinavian competitor. CGS said the acquisition would mark the group's return to a strategy of 'external growth' after a period of consolidation. In 1990 CGS took control of Hoskyns, the largest UK computer services concern. Since then CGS has taken over Scientific Control Systems in Germany and sold a minority holding in its own equity to Daimler-Benz, the giant German industrial group. Programator, which is based in Sweden, is the biggest Scandinavian computer services company. It mustered sales of SKr1.9bn in 1991 and employs around 2,500. The deal has already won the agreement of the larger shareholders in Programator - Sandvik the speciality steel and carbide group, the gas company Aga and the Wasa insurance group. As a result Cap Gemini Sogeti controls 51.4 per cent of Programator's equity and 82.2 per cent of the voting shares. The new organisation, consisting of Programator and Cap Gemini Sogeti's Nordic unit will have a turnover of SKr2.7bn and employ around 3,500. CGS's net profits fell by 10 per cent last year to an estimated FFr560m (Dollars 105.4m) from FFr623m in 1990. Sales increased by 9.3 per cent to FFr10.02bn.</p>

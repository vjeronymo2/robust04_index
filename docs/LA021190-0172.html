			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN PUSHING FOR BAN ON HONORARIUMS;  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE: HE SAYS LAWMAKERS SHOULD GIVE THEM UP WITH OR WITHOUT A PAY  INCREASE IN THE WAKE OF SEN. MONTOYA'S CONVICTION.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), contending that the corruption  scandal surrounding former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya has permanently tainted the  practice of accepting honorariums, is pushing for an outright ban on the  lucrative payments to legislators.  </P> <P> Brown, the Legislature's leading recipient of honorariums, said legislators  must shore up their image by imposing the ban on themselves regardless of  whether they receive a pay increase.  </P> <P> "It's going to kill me," said the flamboyant Assembly Speaker, who reported  receiving $92,111 in honorariums in 1988. "It's all the money I used to pay for  the kids' schooling. It's all of the money I used to pay for my alimony. And  it's some of the money that I used to pay for my ties."  </P> <P> Brown said he has been quietly lobbying members of the Assembly and is now  confident that they will vote for a ban on honorariums. In the Senate,  President Pro Tem David A. Roberti said his members also would vote for such a  prohibition but may still prefer to link it to a pay increase.  </P> <P> The differences between the Assembly and Senate may be resolved in the coming  weeks in a two-house conference committee that will consider a variety of steps  to improve the ethical conduct of the Legislature.  </P> <P> Brown and Roberti agreed in separate interviews that pressure on the  Legislature to act has been intensified by the Feb. 2 conviction of Montoya on  seven counts of extortion, racketeering and money laundering.  </P> <P> Montoya, who resigned his Senate seat effective Friday, was found guilty by a  federal court jury of using his position to extract honorariums and campaign  contributions from people with business before the Legislature.  </P> <P> Among the most damaging evidence presented at his trial was a secret videotape  of Montoya accepting a $3,000 "honorarium" for simply meeting with two federal  undercover operatives for breakfast at a restaurant near the Capitol.  </P> <P> In 1988, the last year for which figures are available, members of the  Legislature accepted $729,000 in honorariums, most of it from groups with an  interest in matters pending before the Legislature. Unlike campaign  contributions, honorariums are personal income for legislators and can be spent  for any purpose.  </P> <P> Traditionally, the term honorarium has meant a payment for a specific service  on which there is no set price. In California, legislators usually make some  sort of speaking appearance in exchange for their honorarium checks. But in  some cases, members of the Legislature have received thousands of dollars in  "honorariums" for merely touring a company or going to a meeting with company  officials.  </P> <P> Now, Brown said, Montoya's infamous videotaped breakfast at Pennisi's Cafe here  has made it politically unacceptable for legislators to take honorariums, even  as speaking fees for legitimate appearances.  </P> <P> Brown, who has long been at odds with Montoya, a Whittier Democrat, said a ban  on honorariums for legislators would be "Joe Montoya's ultimate revenge."  </P> <P> "There is never going to be any appreciation or understanding of the difference  between conduct similar to that attributed to Joe Montoya and (public  appearances by other legislators) if they're both called honoraria," the  Speaker said. "In order to stop having to answer questions about it, let's just  ban it."  </P> <P> Last year, the Assembly and Senate voted to put a comprehensive ethics measure  on the June ballot that would ban honorariums, limit the gifts legislators  could receive, strengthen conflict-of-interest laws, require lawmakers to hold  their meetings in public and restrict lobbying by legislators who leave office.  </P> <P> However, the proposed constitutional amendment -- titled Proposition 112 --  links all these measures to the creation of an independent salary commission  with the power to give legislators a pay increase.  </P> <P> Aside from honorariums, the measure does not restrict legislators' outside  income, such as the hefty fees Brown and other lawyers receive from clients who  hire them.  </P> <P> Roberti, the sponsor of Proposition 112, said he still favors tying a ban on  honorariums to a potential pay increase. Without the receipt of speaking fees,  he said, many legislators will have trouble surviving on their annual salary of  $40,816, plus a tax-free expense allowance worth about $20,000 a year.  </P> <P> "It's difficult for people to live on $40,000 a year and maintain two houses,  send the kids to school and pay the mortgage," the Los Angeles Democrat said.  </P> <P> At the same time, Roberti said that if the proposal for an outright ban on  honorariums were to come to a vote on the Senate floor, it would pass easily.  "I'm open to debate," Roberti said. "The issue is not settled."  </P> <P> The crucial decision on the precise shape of the legislation to be presented to  the two houses will be made in the conference committee. That panel is likely  to include Roberti, Brown and Republican leaders.  </P> <P> In addition to the honorarium question, the conference committee will decide  how to implement other portions of Proposition 112, including the tougher  conflict-of-interest standards and a limit on gifts to legislators.  </P> <P> The gift issue, in particular, may erupt into controversy. Brown opposes any  restriction on gifts while others are pushing for annual limits ranging from  $100 to $250 from a single source. In 1988, legislators reported receiving a  total of $501,000 in gifts -- nearly as much as they received in honorariums.  </P> <P> "The requirement ought to be, you have to report any gift over $250, not that  you can't take it," Brown said.  </P> <P> For the Speaker, the top priority is to erase the public perception that  legislators can be bought just by showing up for breakfast and receiving an  honorarium check.  </P> <P> "I really want to make sure that no one on this floor is perceived as being  compensated for anything other than real work," Brown said. "The personal  sacrifice is not as important as the institution."  </P> <P> HONORARIUM BAN URGED  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown says California legislators should give up  honorariums regardless of whether they receive a pay increase.  </P></p>

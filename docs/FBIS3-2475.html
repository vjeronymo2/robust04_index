			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 0605 GMT on 16 February broadcasts the  54-minute third of a 10-part series consisting of nine lectures,  and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV Lecture  Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming the  Economic System"    The third lecture, entitled: "The Foreign Exchange Control  System," is given by Zhu Xiaohua, vice governor of the People's  Bank of China and concurrently director of the State  Administration of Exchange Control.    Zhu begins by saying: The resolution of the CPC Central  Committee on certain issues concerning the establishment of a  socialist market economy adopted on 14 October 1993,  specifically requires reform of the exchange control system and  establishment of a floating exchange rate system on the basis of  market supply and demand, and under proper control; as well as a  unitary and standardized foreign exchange market to make the  Renminbi gradually become a convertible currency. To further  implement the requirements raised by the resolution, the State  Council and People's Bank of China issued circulars on  accelerating reform of the exchange control system. The reform  measure will have a great impact on China's economic opening up  and development in the future.    He continues: The coexistence of dual exchange rates  resulted in two calculating standards and two prices for the  Renminbi in the past. Zhu says: "It was not conducive to the  transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms, to the  utilization of foreign funds, to international economic  exchanges, or to the development of the market system as a  whole." Furthermore, Zhu notes: "Deepening reform of the  exchange system is an objective requirement for economic  development under the situation of accelerating development,  reform, and opening up." He then goes on to outline the main  points of the reform measure:    1. Beginning from 1 January 1994, two different exchange  rates were merged and a unitary floating exchange rate system on  the basis of market supply and demand, and under proper control  has been implemented. Zhu says: "Implementation of the new  exchange rate system has important significance for China in  opening up its doors wider to the outside world and developing  economic cooperation, trade, and contacts with all the other  countries in the world; and meanwhile, complies with the  exchange rate requirements of the IMF and GATT on their members  and signatories." He continues: "The new exchange rate system  will lay a foundation in terms of a monetary system for the  Renminbi to become a convertible currency in the future."    2. The system of retaining a portion of foreign exchange has  been abolished. It is no longer necessary to turn over a  portion of foreign exchange to the higher authorities.  Meanwhile, banks are authorized to settle and sell foreign  exchange. Zhu explains: "This means enterprises may gain the  full amount of their receipts from exports."    3. Mandatory plans for foreign exchange receipt and  disbursement have been canceled. The state will mainly employ  economic and legal means to achieve macroeconomic regulation and  control over the balance of international payments of foreign  exchange.    4. Foreign exchange certificates will no longer be issued.  Foreign exchange certificates which have already been issued and  are in circulation may continue to be used; they will be  gradually recovered through conversion. Foreigners, Overseas  Chinese, and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots traveling  in China may continue to use foreign exchange certificates in  their possession. They may also use their passports and relevant  identification documents to convert them into foreign exchange  at the official exchange rate announced on 31 December 1993.    5. An interbank market for the trade of foreign exchange  will be established to improve the mechanism for formation of  exchange rates.    Zhu says the reform has been implemented to make the  Renminbi  on current account conditionally convertible. It means the  state will rely on its industrial, trade, investment, and  banking policies to guide and regulate enterprises' foreign  exchange receipts and disbursement; and will adopt an exchange  rate policy that reflects market supply and demand to maintain a  balance of international payments. Because a system for banks  to sell foreign exchange has not yet been established, and  because a unified national foreign exchange market has yet to  take shape, the foreign exchange regulatory market will continue  to operate in accordance with original procedures. All the  Renminbi funds needed during the current transition period shall  be paid by the People's Bank of China.    Touching on the importance of exchange rate stability, Zhu  says: "Stabilizing the exchange rate is an important condition  for guaranteeing the success of reform. Stabilizing the  exchange rate will create a favorable environment for reform  and, as such, it is an important task for us to guarantee the  success of the foreign exchange system reform." We must be  aware of not only its difficulties but also its possibilities,  and we must have confidence. In this connection, he further  points out:    1. Exchange rate stability is dependent on our macroeconomic  situation. The macroeconomic environment is the foundation on  which we can maintain exchange rate stability. The 16-character  policy -- "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, promote  development, and maintain stability" -- decided upon by the  central authorities this year will enable us to properly handle  the relationship between reform and development, and between  development and stability. Zhu stresses: We will have the  prerequisite for maintaining exchange rate stability so long as  we conscientiously implement this policy.    2. China has a relatively adequate foreign exchange reserve  and, as such, it is capable of intervening in the market and  handling risks that may be encountered.    3. Market supply and demand are the factors that determine  the exchange rate. China has maintained a basic balance between  the supply of and demand for foreign exchange due to proper  measures taken to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control  since the second half of last year. Zhu says: Our consistent  policy is to maintain a balance between foreign exchange  receipts and disbursement, and to maintain a little surplus.  When we pay attention to achieving a basic balance between the  supply of and demand for foreign exchange, we will be able to  maintain basic exchange rate stability. Zhu stresses that it  also poses an issue that requires concerted efforts by all  departments concerned.    4. The impact of the merger of exchange rates on price hikes  is not great. Zhu says: First of all, in the past few years,  the government has tried to apply the official exchange rate to  as small a scope of business activities as possible. As of the  end of 1993, more than 80 percent of import and export-related  foreign exchange was actually calculated on the basis of the  rate on the foreign exchange regulatory market. The official  exchange rate -- 5.8 yuan Renminbi against $1 -- was rarely  applied in actual operation. Most import commodities were  purchased at the prevailing foreign exchange regulatory prices.  Furthermore, beginning from 31 December 1993, China lowered its  customs duties for some import commodities, thereby reducing the  import costs for enterprises. As hotels for foreign tourists  and airlines also use U.S. dollars to calculate costs, their  price adjustments do not affect most of our residents at home.  Though the pressure from inflation does exist, it is not  necessarily related to the merger of exchange rates. To prevent  problems that may crop up and to reduce the risks of reform, we  must rely on close and timely coordination among all departments  concerned, and must also have a favorable macroeconomic  environment. Only when we have maintained a balance between  total supply and total demand on the whole by adopting such  macroeconomic measures as industrial, monetary, and financial  policies can we minimize the pressure from inflation.    At 0659 GMT Zhu concludes: China is likely to encounter some  specific difficulties and contradictions in the course of  implementing various reform measures. It requires us to keep  summing up experiences, readjust some specific policies in a  timely manner, and continuously improve various measures.</p>

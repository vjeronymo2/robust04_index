			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, December 29 (XINHUA) -- Momcilo Perisic  [name as received], chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav  Armed Forces, today blamed foreign powers for the outbreak of  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In an interview with the Yugoslav TANJUG News Agency and the  Army newspaper, VOJSKA, Perisic accused foreign powers of  pursuing a policy of instigation of war in Bosnia, which was to  a large extent successful in spreading the war.    Most of the European countries had supported the separatist  forces in the former Yugoslavia and provided them with military  assistance, the chief of the general staff said, adding that the  world's biggest firearm salesmen and war Mafia had a hand in the  Balkan war.    Perisic stressed that the superpowers, in seeking their  strategic interests in the Balkans, had used their trump card of  military force. Even the U.N. force had become a tool in their  pursuit of these interests, he added.    The Yugoslav military chief warned that the civil war in  Bosnia, once spreading to the whole region, would run beyond  control and threaten the security of those countries which had  helped splitting the former Yugoslavia.</p>

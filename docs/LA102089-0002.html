			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING RTD BUSES ON TIME  </P> <P> Hooray! Someone wrote an article, not just a letter, about the awful RTD  service. I don't think the average bus rider has the ambition to write a  letter; riders are too tired from standing in buses or waiting for one.  </P> <P> There is a printed sign in all buses that says it is unlawful to stand in the  stairwell. Most of the drivers don't seem to pay attention to it. Since they  cut down on the service on June 25 it seems they can't say to wait for the next  bus because who knows when there will be another one.  </P> <P> I hope Wishart's article will wake up some of the officials to improve the bus  service.  </P> <P> MARGE WALLACE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ORANGE, FULLERTON SET FIREWORKS VOTE  </P> <P> Voters in the cities of Orange and Fullerton will decide in November whether to  prohibit "safe and sane" fireworks.  </P> <P> Councils in both cities this week voted to put the issue on the ballot.  </P> <P> In May, the Orange council passed an interim ordinance banning some fireworks,  including "Piccolo" or "Whistling Petes" and sparklers, deemed most dangerous  by the Fire Department.  </P> <P> According to a recent Fire Department report, firefighters found no illegal  fireworks for sale during this year's Fourth of July holiday period but  confiscated several boxes of the banned items from Orange residents.  </P> <P> Fireworks are illegal in all of the county's unincorporated areas; only six of  the county's 29 cities allow the sale and use of fireworks.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> N.Y. BALLPARK LAW IS A CORKER  </P> <P> "Wine heah! Get your ice cold Chardonnay!"  </P> <P> Sure, it sounds unlikely, but it won't be illegal in New York state much  longer.  </P> <P> Soon, ballpark vendors will be allowed to hawk Pouilly Fuisse with the peanuts  or Chateau Lafite with the Crackerjacks.  </P> <P> A law legalizing wine sales at ballparks and race tracks was signed Wednesday  by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. It's aimed at boosting sales for New York's struggling  wineries, officials said.  </P> <P> The law goes into effect in three months.  </P> <P> Nobody's popping corks at New York's two baseball stadiums, where team  representatives say they don't expect much demand for wine at ballgames.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't even know how to serve Chablis. Chilled, right?" said Joel White,  head of customer services for the Yankees.  </P></p>

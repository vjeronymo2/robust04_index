			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Speculation on realignment SPECULATION that another realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism could take place before the end of the year dominated trading yesterday, pushing the higher-yielding ERM currencies down against the D-Mark, writes James Blitz. Although tensions inside the ERM have eased considerably since the crisis of early autumn, a shadow has continued to hang over the weaker currencies in the system, the Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo and Irish punt. All three currencies remain close to their ERM floors against the D-Mark, while dealers have continued to question whether their current rates are competitive enough against the strengthened German currency. Although German money market rates are coming down, there are fears that the Bundesbank will not ease rates as quickly as the markets anticipate, keeping interest rates in those countries with weaker European currencies unsustainably high. Yesterday Mr Helmut Schlesinger underlined the degree of restraint in Bundesbank policy by saying that most countries had budget deficits that were too big, and that the Maastricht criterion that deficits should be 3 per cent of GDP should be narrowed. Speculation about new ERM parities was fuelled by a newspaper interview with Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, in which he said a further realignment in the ERM would probably be needed before the end of the year to restore stability. 'We are absolutely open to all changes of parities,' he said. Later in the day, Ireland announced that it would be lifting all its remaining exchange controls by the end of this year. Both moves may suggest that pressure is being put on Germany to agree to a realignment in tandem with the cut in official rates that is anticipated by the end of the year. The Italian lira's strong performance against the D-Mark has also led to speculation that it could re-enter the ERM at the same time as a realignment. The lira yesterday closed at L854.6 per D-Mark, some 15 per cent above its September low. Mr Solchaga's comments, and their implications for German rates, were cited as one reason why the dollar rose to DM1.5845 yesterday, its highest level since the historic low was reached on September 2. The dollar later ended in London at DM1.5785, up around a pfennig on the day. In New York it finished higher at DM1.5830. Speculation on German rates also helped sterling. The currency was boosted by the UK government's narrow victory in the vote on European union in the House of Commons, but later fell back to close at DM2.4275, down  3/4 pfennig on balance. However, the D-Mark appreciated against the weaker ERM currencies. The peseta slipped to a close of Pta71.58 from a previous Pta71.17.</p>

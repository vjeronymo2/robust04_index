			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MEL TO THE RESCUE!  </P> <P> Is Goldie Hawn a damsel in distress -- at the box office? And can superhot Mel  Gibson save her?  </P> <P> He has just wrapped Universal's "Bird on a Wire" with Hawn, who hasn't had a  substantial hit since 1980's "Private Benjamin," which grossed $70 million  domestically and earned her an Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, grosses for  Gibson's "Lethal Weapon 2" have passed $102 million.  </P> <P> In "Wire," Gibson plays a former '60s activist on the run from drug smugglers  with Hawn, his former flame-turned-hotshot lawyer. (The modern script doesn't  even make reference to the fact that Hawn, 44, is a decade older than Gibson.)  </P> <P> A rep for the actress called the role "a complete change of pace" for the  actress: "It allows Goldie to do comedy, and be part of a touching love story.  And as an adventure, this film is also very physical."  </P> <P> But it's no comeback attempt, the spokeswoman stressed: "Goldie doesn't feel  like she's been anywhere to come back from."  </P> <P> For the record, Hawn's post-"Private Benjamin" box office:  </P> <P> "Seems Like Old Times" (1980) -- $38.2 million; "Best Friends" (1982) -- $36.6;  "Swing Shift" (1984) -- $6.6; "Protocol" (1984) -- $26.1; "Wildcats" (1986) --  $26.1; "Overboard" (1988), $24.5 million.  </P> <P> The star's Hawn-Sylbert Movie Co. recently landed a seven-picture development  deal with Hollywood Pictures, the new arm of Walt Disney Productions -- which  has a recent tradition of reviving floundering careers.

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Insecurities come to haunt Singapore's top men: Kieran Cooke looks at the fears within the ruling People's Action Party that protest may grow IT HAS been an eventful and somewhat macabre week in the normally placid world of Singapore politics. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong made an urgent appeal last Sunday for new political talent to step forward. His cabinet, he said, was ageing and had to be revitalised. The next day, it was announced that two of the island republic's most senior political figures, Mr Ong Teng Cheong, first deputy prime minister, and Mr Lee Hsien Loong, second deputy prime minister and minister for trade and industry, were suffering from cancer. The statement said that the disease had been detected early and that chances for successful treatment were excellent. There has been obvious compassion for the men, mixed with surprise at the way in which the illnesses were announced simultaneously, but, above all, the statement led to renewed speculation about the future direction of Singapore's politics. Mr Lee, 40, is the son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the man who dominated almost every aspect of Singapore life for much of the last 40 years and who, in 1990 stepped down as prime minister to be succeeded by his deputy, Mr Goh Chok Tong. The received wisdom was that Mr Goh would merely serve time before a resumption of the Lee dynasty, that the younger Lee would at some unspecified date take the helm. Though officials say the younger Lee, now undergoing chemotherapy treatment, is likely to resume his ministerial duties shortly, uncertainty about his future has caused political nervousness. Since independence from British colonial rule, Singapore's politics has been remarkably stable, with the People's Action Party (PAP), formed in the early 1950s as an anti-colonial party, exercising almost complete dominance and for many years controlling every seat in parliament. Under the party's guidance, Singapore has been transformed into a well-developed country with one of the highest standards of living in Asia. Yet, despite its achievements, the party has noticeable insecurities. It was fashioned in Mr Lee Kuan Yew's image, and, as Mr Raj Vasil, a writer on Singapore politics, says, the elder Lee is the party in the eyes of Singaporeans: 'The PAP does not have much of an identity independent of the (then) prime minister and the government headed by him. Its image, identity and appeal are almost entirely derived from the personality of the prime minister ..' His departure was traumatic. Mr Goh has tried to bring in a more open style of government, introducing a limited degree of glasnost, allowing Singapore's carefully controlled citizens to view slightly risque films and permitting a small measure of dissent. But he has found it exceptionally difficult to fill Mr Lee's shoes. Mr Lee, now entitled senior minister, still exercises a great deal of influence, retaining his post as PAP secretary general. Mr Goh, seeking a popular mandate, called a surprise election last year. The PAP was returned to power, winning 77 of the 81 parliamentary seats, but the fact that some form of opposition, however small and disunited, was emerging was seen as a near disaster for Mr Goh and his party. A popular interpretation of the election was that Singaporeans felt nervous under the more relaxed regime of Mr Goh: only when the younger Lee - stamped in the same no-nonsense, authoritarian style as his father - put a firm hand on the helm would the party's complete dominance be re-established. But a degree of popular unhappiness with the party had set in well before Mr Goh's ascendancy. While many able technocrats were recruited to PAP ranks, few figures with any noticeable political talent emerged. 'A lot of yes-men and sycophants were nurtured under Lee,' says one political analyst. 'He only has himself to blame if there are no real personalities to succeed him.' The party tended to concentrate too much on the mainly English-educated, increasingly affluent middle class. The views of the people on the housing estates - mainly the Chinese-educated who were finding life increasingly expensive and hard - were being largely ignored. Both the younger Lee and Mr Ong are key figures in regaining support among this group. They are among the few government ministers who speak Mandarin fluently and read the Chinese-language newspapers. While Mr Lee is seen as arrogant and is not a particularly popular figure, he is respected as a gifted and able minister. Mr Ong, as head of the Singapore Trades Union Congress, provides important contact with working-class voters. Mr Goh has promised a number of by-elections in the near future, and the small, fragmented opposition is unlikely to pose any serious challenge. Yet the PAP is deeply concerned about a rising protest vote.</p>

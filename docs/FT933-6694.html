			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / People: Stevens takes the stage at Carnegie Simon Stevens, head of international equities at fund managers Invesco, has been headhunted by Carnegie Group to run its UK arm, Carnegie International; he replaces Lars Bertmar, who remains the broker's group chief executive. Invesco, which has been through a turbulent few years, is just beginning to repair its UK operation, and, after a wave of departures, seems to be stemming the staff exodus. But 41-year-old Stevens (right) says 'it is all about opportunities and how well they fit your aspirations and character'. He has a high respect for Bertmar as 'a thinker' and approves of his strategy of concentrating on niche markets, in this instance particularly southern Europe. Carnegie has itself suffered some upheaval. At the end of 1991, Bertmar, a former corporate financier at Svenske Handeslbanken, sacked the three senior managers of Carnegie International, and took responsibility for London himself. Stevens' job will be to market the services of the analysts around Europe, 'to make sure the product is appropriate for the UK market' as he puts it. The Spanish and Portuguese teams already top the Extel ratings in their country sectors. Bertmar also has ambitions to build a corporate finance capability in those countries, from Spain to Turkey, where there is brokerage expertise. While he has not worked inside a merchant bank's corporate finance division, Stevens spent a couple of years in the corporate planning department of Grand Metropolitan and held a similar job at Ocean Transport and Trading. Stevens may soon find himself working for a new owner, as Carnegie's parent, the troubled Swedish Nordbanken, said more than a year ago that its profitable brokerage subsidiary was up for sale in order to allow it to concentrate on domestic banking business.</p>

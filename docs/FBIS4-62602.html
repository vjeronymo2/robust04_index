			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Charles Freeman, assistant secretary for regional  security at the U.S. Defense Department, will arrive in Estonia  today. More details now from Peeter Kaldre:    [Begin recording] [Kaldre] A U.S. working group on defense  matters will arrive in Estonia today, led by Charles Freeman,  assistant secretary for regional security. He will have  meetings with Defense Minister Indrek Kannik and Defense Forces  Commander Aleksander Einseln.    Defense Minister Kannik, what has brought about a visit to  Estonia by such a high U.S. defense official?    [Kannik] A joint meeting of Estonian-U.S. working groups on  defense issues will take place today. During the meeting both  Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman and European  [Principal Deputy Assistant] Secretary at the State Department  Alexander Vershbow will provide a survey of the United States'  European policy. Freeman will focus in his speech on the United  States' positions on issues to do with the Partnership for Peace  program, and Vershbow will speak about the new security  situation in Europe.    Defense Forces Commander Major General Aleksander Einseln  and  myself will speaking on behalf of Estonia at this seminar. Maj  Gen Einseln will introduce the current process of drafting a  defense conception as well as defense reorganization in Estonia  -- that is, the organization of Estonian defense forces and  their aims. He will also provide a survey of the issues to do  with the formation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion.    I will speak about the Estonian security considerations in a  broader sense, within the European context.    [Kaldre] You say that a joint Estonian-American working  group  exists. When was it set up and how often does it meet?    [Kannik] In this case it would be more correct to call it a  joint seminar, with corresponding people from the U.S. working  group and Estonian representatives meeting. There is no set  time (?for the meetings) but the intention is that they should  be held on a regular basis. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

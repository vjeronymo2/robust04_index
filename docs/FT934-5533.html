			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Pre-Budget boost for Clarke as industrial output heads upwards Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was given a pre-Budget fillip yesterday with further evidence that the UK economy is continuing its recovery. A rise in the money supply and indications of a sharp increase in manufacturing output will encourage the chancellor later today as he delivers a Budget statement expected to concentrate on reducing the large fiscal deficit through a modest tax rise. M0, the narrow measure of the money supply, rose 5.1 per cent in the year to November to continue recent strong growth which has underlined buoyant consumer spending. Sentiment about an upturn will be helped by a survey today from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply which showed manufacturing orders and output grew strongly this month. Although the seasonally adjusted M0 figure was lower than the 5.4 per cent rise in the year to October, growth in notes and coins, which accounts for 90 per cent of the measure, was particularly strong. This jumped 5.5 per cent in the year to this month, after a comparable 5.3 per cent in the 12 months to October, and indicated that consumers are spending relatively freely. The economic data heartened investors on the London stock market, where the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares shrugged off a large fall in Japanese stocks to gain 24.4 for a close of 3,135.8. Sterling was also strong, rising 1 pfennig against the D-Mark to close at DM2.5425, and nearly a cent against the dollar to Dollars 1.4880. In late New York trading sterling stood at Dollars 1.4895 and DM2.5417. Long-dated gilts gained a quarter of a point on expectations that Mr Clarke would predict a fall in public borrowing from about Pounds 50bn this financial year to roughly Pounds 40bn in 1994-95. However trading was subdued because of worries that anything less than a determined attack by Mr Clarke on the gap between public spending and revenues could push down bond prices after their sustained rise in recent months. The City is expecting the chancellor to unveil a Pounds 2bn tax rise from next April, on top of the Pounds 6.7bn already announced. Mr Clarke may also shave Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn off the public spending control total for 1994-95, previously set at Pounds 253.6bn. Mr Richard Kersley, equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment group, said financial markets were confident Mr Clarke 'will not risk anything aggressive' over taxation because of the need to sustain the recovery.

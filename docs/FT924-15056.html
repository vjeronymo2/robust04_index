			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Chairmen meet and exchange views on bid THE chairmen of Hanson and Ranks Hovis McDougall met yesterday and had 'a useful exchange of views' regarding Hanson's Pounds 780m cash offer for the food group, writes Maggie Urry. The two sides agreed not to disclose any further details about the talks. As well as Lord Hanson and Mr Stanley Metcalfe, the two chairmen, the meeting was attended by Mr Tony Alexander, chief operating officer of the conglomerate, and Sir Peter Reynolds, deputy chairman of RHM. It is thought that the talks did not result in either an out-of-hand dismissal of the offer or a discussion of a price which RHM could recommend to its shareholders. Each side will consider the points made and further talks are possible. Lord Hanson had written to Mr Metcalfe on Monday, when he announced the offer, inviting him to a meeting. A brief statement from NM Rothschild, Hanson's merchant bank, said the two chairmen 'were grateful for the opportunity to meet'. RHM's share price dipped yesterday but recovered to close at 239p, down 2p on the day, but still above the 220p a share offer. Hanson's shares rose 1p to 203p. Hanson also announced some further disposals of peripheral businesses in the US. It has agreed the sale of Weber Aircraft of California, which makes interior equipment for aircraft, for Dollars 85m (Pounds 49.5m), Dollars 37m above book value. The purchaser is Air Cruisers, a US subsidiary of Groupe Zodiac of France. Weber incurred an operating loss in the 1990-91 financial year. The lighting systems division of Halkey-Roberts and A&amp;S Building Systems were also sold. The sale of Ranger Footwear was completed. Together, these three were sold for Dollars 11m, compared with a book value of Dollars 8m, and incurred an operating loss of Dollars 3m in 1990-91.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Technology: Fine-tuning your network - Worth Watching Companies with interlinked local and wide area networks invariably use network management tools to warn them of network failure. But not all of them use the tools to get optimal use from the network. With this in mind, data-networking specialist Datarange, of High Wycombe, is launching a service to help companies 'tune' their networks to get them running as efficiently as possible. The solution could be as simple as filtering out broadcast messages from PCs on neighbouring networks and giving certain calls priority. Datarange: UK, 0494 441256.</p>

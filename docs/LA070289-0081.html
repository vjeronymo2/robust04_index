			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FATAL ACCIDENT IN ANAHEIM BAY  </P> <P> I read with interest the brief editorial about the dangers of alcohol and  boating ("A Goal of Sobriety at Sea," June 25).  </P> <P> However, the editorial contained an error. It stated that the boating accident  in Anaheim Bay that killed five people happened in 1983. It actually happened  in 1984.  </P> <P> As an editor, I understand that such errors can creep into copy. But I feel  it's important to correct the error in print for two reasons: one, those killed  were alive in 1983; and two, because this editorial might, in turn, be used as  a reference someday and 1983 would go on to be incorrectly cited as the date of  the accident.  </P> <P> I think it's great what Mothers Against Drunk Driving is doing. Within the  boating press, there has been a lot of discussion about the topic of alcohol  and boating. I am happy that the subject is seeing the light of day in the  general press as well and hope the message continues to reach more people.  </P> <P> LINDA YUSKAITIS  </P> <P> Sea Magazine  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: New European Parliament inquiry into EC farm fraud A new European Parliament inquiry into European Community farm fraud is to be headed by Labour Euro MP John Tomlinson. The probe is going ahead despite assurances from Mr John Gummer, the British president of the council of EC agriculture ministers, that the problem is under control. Mr Tomlinson, MEP for Birmingham West, has been asked by the European Parliament's budgetary control committee to produce a detailed report on losses to EC taxpayers - estimated at Pounds 2.5bn a year - from the community's complex system of grants and subsidies. Mr Tomlinson yesterday described the EC's farm policy as 'the greatest incentive to crime in Europe today'. Earlier, Mr Gummer played down the extent of the problem, insisting that frauds highlighted by the EC's court of auditors had already been tackled.</p>

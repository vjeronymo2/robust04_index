			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Technology: Pick of the Russian software crop - Andrew Fisher on the wealth of engineering talent in Moscow Doing business in Russia might not seem the most attractive of propositions just now, let alone employing experts there to develop a core part of your business. But one US computer company, Pick Systems, has found that the skills of software writers in the former Soviet Union have enabled it to expand its product range more quickly and cheaply than if it had relied solely on the facilities at its Irvine, California, headquarters. 'We couldn't afford to put the same amount of resources in the US for cost reasons,' says Denis Hill, a Pick director. The company, which developed computer systems in the 1960s for the US Army in Vietnam, employs nearly 60 software engineers (two-thirds of its total) in Moscow, and plans to double this by spring. Unlike some other international computer concerns, Pick is not simply using Russian software experts to develop applications for local use. Pick software is widely used in Russia, operating at some 200 sites in Moscow and St Petersburg, one of its chief functions being to keep an eye on tax payments. The company wanted to do more than this, however. Having begun to employ Russian experts four years ago when they first became available after the Soviet empire collapsed, it then decided to put them to work on developing its basic operating software - designed before the emergence of open systems such as Unix - and adding new functions. These are now about to come onto the market. 'We are seeing the first fruits of our labour,' says Glyn Yarnall, UK sales director, about Pick's Moscow development centre. It will soon move from its cramped offices in the Olympic stadium. Pick's Russian employees, whose average age is about 30 - 'these are fast track, really bright young guys,' says Hill - have developed both a graphical user interface (to simplify on-screen instruction) and a structured query language (enabling easier access to databases) to strengthen the company's software range. 'Without Moscow, this would have cost more and taken longer,' adds Yarnall. Because of their academic background and the fact that, in the communist days, they had to do without western computer equipment and thus work out their own systems and solutions, Pick's Russian employees tend to have a stronger scientific leaning than those in Irvine, reckons Hill. 'These people have a really solid education in software engineering.' Although costs are rising rapidly in Russia, they are still significantly lower than in the US, apart from office rents. Hill says the cost of the Moscow operation is around Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 16,500) a month; in the US, the figure would be around Dollars 500,000. With the benefit of modern communications techniques, it is easy for Irvine and Moscow to keep in touch electronically. Obviously, the company will not always be able to choose from among the best of Russian engineers, whose skills have also been used by companies such as Apple Computer. Pick's first crop of recruits included software engineers who had worked on Soviet aeronautical, military and satellite programmes, as well as in computer research. 'It is a blunt fact that if we didn't take them on, someone else would have,' says Yarnall. 'But you can't always get that calibre, so you also have to go for the second division people.' Despite the temptations of life abroad, Pick's Russian employees are generally content to stay where they are. 'They're not always keen to move,' notes Hill. 'They weren't used to mobility under communism. But they have enormous opportunities in Moscow, while in the US it is tougher to compete.' Having just returned to Irvine from Moscow, Hill says the Pick employees there - for the past six months, including no one from the US - worked right through the latest crisis. 'They're living the adventure of what's going on in their country.'</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Bucket shops may gain rules leeway The Civil Aviation Authority is considering scaling down plans to regulate airline ticket 'bucket shops' in spite of support for tougher legislation from consumer bodies and trading standards officers. The authority proposed in June that anyone other than an airline who accepted payment for air travel would either have to produce a ticket immediately or show that it had an Air Travel Organiser's Licence. The shops, which sell airline tickets at a discount, told the authority they would have difficulty meeting the licensing requirements. The tougher proposals were supported by tour operators, consumers bodies and trading standards officers. The authority said it was now considering granting bucket shops licences under less onerous conditions than those which have to be met by tour operators. To receive a licence, tour operators have to arrange a bond equivalent of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of their turnover. The bond is used to compensate customers if the operator goes out of business. The authority said that if airlines were prepared to undertake to honour tickets once they had been issued by bucket shops, the shops could arrange bonds of about one-third of those required from tour operators. The authority said it would also be prepared to grant a special class of licence to air ticket vendors without a bond. It would only do this, however, if airlines selling through these vendors entered into a legally binding agreement with the authority to honour tickets.</p>

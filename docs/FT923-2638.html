			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Asarco tries again for minor stake in KGHM ASARCO, the US metals producer, has renewed efforts to secure a minority share in Poland's KGHM copper mining and smelting combine amid new signs of labour unrest there. Yesterday unions at KGHM called a 24-hour strike for September 23 after KGHM's new management refused to meet for pay talks in the wake of a six-week long strike suspended last month. They have threatened to resume their strike on October 6. The strikers suspended the action last month after being told that increases would be made once new legislation easing wage controls had been passed by parliament. The legislation has since been delayed and yesterday KGHM's management promised an interim pay settlement by the end of this month 'in accordance with the company's financial possibilities'. Meanwhile Mr Robert Muth, an Asarco vice-president, has been meeting government officials in Warsaw this week. Asarco first signalled its plan last May. Mr Muth had planned to talk to the KGHM management, but it did not want to see him while it is wrestling with the labour troubles. Asarco is pressing the Polish government to grant them a three year management contract for KGHM. A draft agreement being discussed with the Poles would give Asarco six months to negotiate the purchase of a minority share in KGHM after the expiry of the management contract. The Poles would be bound to retain state control of the combine while KGHM was being managed by Asarco which pledges to maintain the present level of output unless instructed otherwise by the Polish government. During the management period, Asarco would work on a long-term strategy for KGHM which would form the basis of its investment offer. It also proposes to work towards enhancing KGHM's market value as well as working towards 'international environmental, pay and work safety standards'. The Western Mining Corporation from Australia has also expressed a strong interest in investing in KGHM. KGHM produced 229,000 tonnes of refined copper in the first seven months of this year or 3.1 per cent more than in the same period last year.</p>

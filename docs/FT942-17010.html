			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Arts: RSC's Ghosts - Theatre Watching Jane Lapotaire these days is a very curious business. That we have few actresses with such intelligence, authority or accomplishment must be beyond question. Yet it has been years since I could believe in one of her stage characterisations. Right now, London has the chance to see her in the great role of Mrs Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts, with the RSC in the Pit. Watching and listening to her, you cannot help but find new insights into the role and into the whole fabric of this marvellous play; but you also see a portrayal so calculated in moment-by-moment delivery, so full of clever motifs, and so carefully arranged in its final expression of dismay, that it creaks. This is too bad, not just because of the waste of Lapotaire's talent, but also because she dominates Katie Mitchell's staging of the play, excellent in so many other respects. This production - which I reviewed at its premiere at Stratford's The Other Place last May - now launches the RSC's new London season. It embodies many of the best virtues of the RSC, of Mitchell, and indeed of Lapotaire. For a close scrutiny of Ghosts, it is unlikely to be surpassed for years to come. Mitchell fastidiously observes the detailed realism of Ibsen's play. The play is - among other things - about syphilis, and repression, and hypocrisy, and women's struggle for social freedom; but, in Mitchell's hands, those things are the more powerful because she never nudges them into undue significance, or allows any anachronistic touch to remind us how modern the play's implications are. Vicki Mortimer's designs are haunting, perfectly creating the spartan elegance of a Norwegian interior. And Tina MacHugh's lighting conveys both the darkness of this room, and the distant pallor of the daylight outside (though the final dawn is none too persuasive). Details of offstage sound, or the maid's duster, or Pastor Manders's hat, all contribute beautifully to the eloquent whole. Simon Russell Beale is a strongly morose Oswald. If one does not quite believe that his last words would really be 'the sun, the sun', then one certainly attends to his protest that sunshine and the joy of life have never been part of his life at home. John Carlyle's Pastor Manders is a superb performance, bringing a wealth of life to this stiff character. Alexandra Galbraith and John Normington, however, have slightly coarsened their detailed interpretations of Regina and Engstrand. Should their self-servingness be quite so obvious? The 'ghosts' become more fascinating the closer you attend. Lapotaire hints in the first two acts that Oswald's father may not be the late Lieutenant Alving but the still present Pastor. In the last act, however, she seems simply to have given up this last vestige of her love for the Pastor. In her most grand and repeated gesture, Lapotaire suggests that Mrs Alving keeps being failed by men. She stretches out one arm - palm downward, fingers parted like a claw - towards the memory of her husband, or the Pastor, or her son. Then she lets the arm fall, slowly, slowly. But the gesture sums up the failure of Lapotaire's performance. Trying to show Mrs Alving's spontaneous emotions (normally very contained in her body language), this gesture actually turns out to be the most unspontaneous thing Lapotaire does.

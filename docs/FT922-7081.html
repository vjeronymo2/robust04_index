			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Names take fresh action on deposits LLOYD'S Names yesterday launched two new attempts to prevent the authorities at the insurance market from drawing down on their deposits to meet losses. In the High Court Mr Justice Potts gave leave to six Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting at the mar ket - connected with the Gooda Walker Action Group, which represents more than 2,100 Names, to seek a judicial review of Lloyd's. In yesterday's hearing Mr Alan Newman QC, for the Names, argued that Lloyd's had 'failed properly to have regard to the interests of members' when making the cash calls and drawdown procedures. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker group, said: 'We look forward to exposing the parlous state of Lloyd's regulation to the cold light of judicial scrutiny for the first time in its history.' Solicitors Bentleys Stokes and Lawless are advising the group. Judicial reviews are actions against public or semi-public bodies which are alleged to have failed to observe their - often statutory - duties. In a separate action, Withers, solicitors acting on behalf of the Distressed Names Spiral Action Group, issued 10 writs against the Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young and Devonshire agencies yesterday. The writs are regarded as test cases and allege negligence by the agents. They also claim that the spiral reinsurance transactions - deals in which Lloyd's syndi cates and London companies reinsure each other's high-level exposure to catastrophe risks - were entered into 'without the authority of the Names involved'. Withers said yesterday that it had been advised by counsel that Names have a 'very strong if not overwhelming prima facie case for negligence in respect of the underwriting business of the Rose Thomson Young agency'. Both actions aim to obtain injunctions to prevent Lloyd's from drawing down on the deposits that all Names must lodge when they join Lloyd's to meet insurance losses. Last month more than 800 Names, represented by solicitors Michael Freeman, failed to obtain injunctions.</p>

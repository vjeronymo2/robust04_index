			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The body of a murder victim found two years and eight months ago in Idaho has  been identified as that of a 25-year-old Monica Hibbs of San Jose, authorities  said. A possible suspect -- someone Hibbs' parents knew their daughter to be  traveling with when she disappeared -- is in jail on another charge in Northern  California, officials said. The identity was not released. A truck driver found  the body May 2, 1986. Franklin County Sheriff Don Beckstead said the body was  nude and wrapped in three plastic bags. An autopsy revealed the victim had died  from several knife wounds and had suffered a blow to the head. The body was  buried as a "Jane Doe" when no leads about her identity turned up. "It has  always made us feel good to observe that people have placed flowers on her  grave, but we are greatly relieved to have her identity resolved," Beckstead  said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Khavronin report: "Concepts and Prospects"] </F>   [Text] The main attention at the first conference of  ranking personnel of the Ministry of Defense on 1 November was  paid to the concept of army organizational development. An  extensive report was delivered by Defense Minister Pavel  Creanga.    In his opinion, the chief merit of the concept devised in  the  fall of last year is that it systematized all measures for the  accelerated creation of the armed forces. This document deals  only with military matters proper. The remaining  factors--preparation of the economy, creation of state reserves,  strengthening of morale--will be the subject of other  prescriptive enactments. Pavel Creanga believes that practice,  operational-technical measures, and the experience of work among  the troops confirm the topicality of the concept. The minister  criticized the proposals which Nicolae Petrica, former chief of  the main staff of the armed forces of the republic, sent to  President Mircea Snegur. Why? Petrica believes that a decisive  role under today's conditions should be assigned not so much the  regular forces as large-scale trained reserves (140,000), that  is, a kind of "working army." It was proposed to this end that  the republic leadership create under the auspices of the  Ministry of Defense a network of centers for the military  training of the youth. And that the permanent staff of the armed  forces consist of 6,500 men.    The defense minister explains why this is unacceptable: A  threat to the republic's military security may be seen not in  acts of aggression and wars of the nuclear powers and military  blocs but in possible local conflicts, in which the Republic of  Moldova would be forced to defend its independence and  territorial integrity. Whence the conclusion that the armed  forces should be such as to be able to quickly localize the  center of tension, ensure defense of the borders, and cut short  possible provocations and encroachments on independence.  Consequently, the minister concludes, the troops should be  professional and ready to fight, and the manning level of the  reserve should not perform the predominant role.    Setting forth the concept of army organizational  development,  the defense minister highlighted the main tasks of the regular  troops: to efficiently and rapidly confront any possible threat  without additional mobilization measures. If necessary, to be  capable of additional manning to the level of wartime; to ensure  a high level of the training of the command and control bodies  and the personnel; and also of a militarily trained reserve  capable of performing operational assignments. The Ministry of  Defense is oriented toward the European average ratio of the  strength of the personnel and the population--0.6-0.8 percent  (0.23 percent with us). The concept defines the main function of  the armed forces as performance of the assignments of deterrence  against military provocations and aggression. The draft concept,  the speaker observed, should be modified in connection with the  creation of the Civil Defense and Emergencies Department.    Defense Minister Pavel Creanga termed "absurd and harmful"  General N. Petrica's proposals concerning the incorporation in  Ministry of Defense formations of the carabinieri forces, whose  assignments are totally different. Legislation prohibits the  enlistment of carabinieri forces for assignments that are not  within their province.    Pavel Creanga believes to be completely wrong Nicolae  Petrica's opinion concerning alternative service because it has  not been justified "from either the economic or moral  viewpoints." The Ministry of Defense has devised proposals for  the government which will help avoid wrongdoing in questions of  the organization and performance of alternative service.    The concept embodies a new principle altogether. The  numerical composition of the army and its structure cannot be  constant from year to year, they must correspond to the  military-political conditions in the region. Specialists have  calculated that the optimum strength of the regular army is  10,000.    Judging by the report, the intentions of the leadership of  the Ministry of Defense are serious. But the practical  implementation of the plans is being impeded by the absence of a  proper legislative base. Let us hope that the new parliament  will settle the arrears of its predecessor.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the Taba talks, in Cairo, by Sa'id  Mu'addi in the studio, from the "With the Events" program  -- live]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Good evening, and many happy  returns.    [Sha'th] Good evening sir, and many happy returns.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Did the Israeli-Palestinian  negotiations reach a stalemate after the failure of the Tunis  negotiations?    [Sha'th] In fact, the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron  is still casting dark shadows on the peace process. In fact,  overcoming this crisis requires much effort and a true sense of  responsibility toward the Palestinian people's security in the  occupied territories. What is required is not just a security  Council resolution, but measures to enable the Palestinian  people to enjoy true security, so the peace process can produce  the results we all planned for and which we were about to see  just two days before the massacre.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Do you believe Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin's visit to Washington will result in the resumption of  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the future?    [Sha'th] We are waiting to see the results of that visit. We  believe Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is the one who can decide  that Israel will solve the present problems. However, we will  wait to see the results of that visit.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Are the channels of communication  between the PLO leadership and Israeli officials still open, or  are they still closed?    [Sha'th] There was an Israeli delegation in Tunis a few days  ago to hold talks with the PLO leadership. Before that, there  was another delegation here in Cairo. I do not believe the  problem lies with the channels of communication. Such channels  of communication in our world and in this age are not a problem,  since the peace process is still going on. The problem lies in  the absence of a decision to solve the problems facing us.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the  PLO attaches great importance to the Security Council's  resolutions and noted that previous Security Council resolutions  were not effective.    [Sha'th] The UN resolutions issued during the Cold War were  frozen, due to differences between the big powers and their  allies. The situation now is different. We cannot accuse the  United Nations of bias toward certain sides. The United States  enjoys a strong influence in this regard. It is the side that  can put these resolutions into effect. Therefore, a Security  Council resolution, like the one that led to the repatriation of  the deportees, should be effective and should be implemented.  Otherwise, such resolutions are worthless. We want a  resolution to ensure true security for the Palestinian people,  at least until the Palestinian entity is established and the  Palestinian police are launched.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Thank you very much, and many  happy returns.    [Sha'th] You are welcome, and many happy returns.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / S Africa cuts interest rates The South African Reserve Bank, the central bank, yesterday announced a one percentage point cut in interest rates following a sharp decline in the inflation rate recently, Philip Gawith writes from Johannesburg. The rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index was 9.6 per cent in the 12 months to December - the first time inflation has fallen into single digits in 14 years. The rate at which the bank lends to the banking sector has been cut from 14 to 13 per cent and the prime lending rate is likely to fall by a similar margin to 16.25 per cent.</p>

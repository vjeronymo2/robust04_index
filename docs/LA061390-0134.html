			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COCAINE BABIES: BORN IN AWFUL FIX;  </P> <P> DRUGS: RESEARCHER TELLS AUDIENCE OF PEDIATRICIANS ABOUT DEFORMITIES AND WARNS  THAT 'THERE IS NO SAFE TIME' FOR USE DURING PREGNANCY.  </P> <P> "There is no safe time to use cocaine in pregnancy."  </P> <P> That was the message pediatric researcher Ira J. Chasnoff brought to 100 Orange  County pediatricians Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Describing his nationally known research on addicted mothers and their babies,  Chasnoff said cocaine use in pregnancy can cause not only low-weight,  premature, highly irritable babies, but also anatomical deformities -- among  them urinary and genital tract malformations, bowel perforations and tiny hands  with only two fingers.  </P> <P> The baby may have been normal, the Chicago researchers said, but a single hit  of cocaine may cause blood vessels in the mother and her fetus to constrict,  digits on the developing baby to hemorrhage and the baby to be born without  some of its fingers.  </P> <P> Chasnoff was invited to Orange County not just because local doctors were  interested in the issue. Rather Orange County has a growing problem of  drug-exposed babies too. County officials say more than 1,200 "drug babies"  were born here last year and many experts here believe the number is even  higher.  </P> <P> Before Chasnoff spoke, pediatricians from Fountain Valley and Los Alamitos said  they have seen a growing number of drug-exposed babies in their private  practices.  </P> <P> "There isn't a (hospital) nursery in the county where you don't have two to  three babies lying around whose mothers were on drugs," said Burton Willis, a  Fountain Valley pediatrician who is president-elect of the Orange County  Pediatric Society.  </P> <P> Chasnoff said his studies show that white, middle-class women who visit private  doctors are using drugs at about the same rate as black women who receive  prenatal care at public clinics.  </P> <P> He sounded one note of hope, however. Drug-exposed babies at age 2 have caught  up to normal babies in both weight and height, he said. Further, he emphasized,  "these babies are not retarded."  </P> <P> Some of them may have school problems, he said, but at this point studies have  not been completed on these children past age 2. Also, he said, rather than  being "doomed" because they were exposed to drugs before birth, the babies can  be helped by physicians to catch up to their peers.  </P></p>

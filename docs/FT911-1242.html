			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / US Money And Credit: Bonds face dual test of sentiment IS THE yield on long US government bonds ever going to drop through the 8 per cent barrier during the current economic cycle? The question is being asked with fresh force following last week's surprise easing by the Federal Reserve, which cut the discount rate to 5 1/2 and Fed funds to 5 3/4 . But while this brought rates cascading down at the short end of the maturity spectrum, the beneficial effect on the long end was short-lived: by the end of the week the yield on the 30-year Treasury had risen slightly - from 8.20 to 8.22 after traders were spooked by curious unemployment data. The yield curve, which charts the difference between short and long-term interest rates, is now steeper than it has been for years. Two tests of bond market sentiment will this week underline why: Today, the Treasury starts its quarterly refunding exercise with a record sale of Dollars 37bn of securities - Dollars 18.97bn of roll-over funds and Dollars 18.025bn of new money. Today's tranche is Dollars 13.5bn of three-year notes, Wednesday brings Dollars 11.75bn of 10-year notes and Thursday Dollars 11.75bn of 30-year bonds. The heavy volume of Treasury issues is set to continue to the end of the year - the government says it will need to borrow some Dollars 110bn to Dollars 115bn in the third quarter - with Wall Street expecting the Federal budget deficit to total between Dollars 240bn and Dollars 280bn. Companies' keenness to raise funds ahead of the government's large call for money has produced a near-record rush of corporate debt issues: nearly Dollars 6bn is believed to have hit the market last week. The great supply of government debt helps keep upward yield pressures on the long end - rates have to be kept attractive to encourage new buyers. The prospective firming of the dollar may stir additional foreign interest, but a tentative atmosphere ahead of the auction saw Treasuries little changed yesterday, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond marginally lower, at 8.212, in late trading. On Friday, the government will release its latest statistics on inflation - the April producer price indices - amid continuing bond market concern that excessive inflationary pressures may remain in the financial system. The PPI figures are expected to be unremarkable, with most economists expecting a rise of just 0.1 per cent on the month, or 0.2 per cent in the core rate. The market's nervousness over the outlook for inflation increased last Friday when the government announced a drop in the April civilian unemployment rate - from 6.8 per cent in March to 6.6 per cent. The figures, showing an unusually big increase in the number of self-employed and government workers, were dismissed as a possible aberration. Even so, figures for payroll employment - derived by a different method to the unemployment tally - did point to a slowing of the nation's economic decline, with the non-farm total dropping by 124,000 workers, compared with 241,000 in March. Those figures suggested to many economists that the US is approaching the bottom of the recessionary trough and in turn led some analysts to question whether the Fed was hasty with last week's easing. The Fed said its move was taken 'in the light of continuing weakness in economic activity, especially in the industrial and capital goods areas', and it also stressed 'evidence of abating inflationary pressures'. Certainly, a large number of indicators have recently been pointing to a marked slowdown in inflation, including the National Association of Purchasing Managers' price index, which has now dropped to its lowest reading since April 1982. A sustained cut in the rate of inflation would give the Fed more room to manoeuvre, should it feel further easing is necessary to kick start the economy - and the recent indicators have given no clear sign as to the timing or strength of any recovery. Wall Street is certainly not expecting any early rate cuts and few are forecasting anything more than another  1/4 off Fed funds in this interest rate cycle. Indeed, an economic recovery later in the year would shift attention to possible Fed tightening and rising yields. So if the long bond does dip below 8 per cent, it may not go very far for very long.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Last    1 week    4 wks  12-month   12-month                            Friday     ago      ago     High        Low Fed Funds (weekly average)  5.50     5.88     5.75    11.00       2.00 Three-month Treasury bills  5.62     5.76     5.86     7.94       5.54 Six-month Treasury bills    5.80     5.97     5.97     8.04       5.62 Three-month prime CDs       5.95     6.10     6.13     9.01       5.90 30-day Commercial Paper     5.85     5.95     6.05     8.28       5.85 90-day Commercial Paper     5.85     5.95     5.95     7.98       5.85  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Last     Change             1 week     4 wk.

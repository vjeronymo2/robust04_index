			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Swedish opposition expects victory With less than three weeks to go until Sweden's general election, the opposition Social Democratic party is set for a decisive victory over the reformist coalition led by the prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, according to latest opinion polls. A poll published yesterday in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet showed the Social Democrats strengthening their lead to 50.6 per cent compared to a similar poll in June, while the combined support for the four government parties slipped to 40 per cent from 40.8 per cent. Two other nationwide polls in the last week showed a similar gap. The worst for the Social Democrats, in Dagens Nyheter on Friday, showed a small gain for the coalition, led by Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party. But it still gave the Social Democrats 49.5 per cent support - enough to hold a majority in the Riksdag if repeated in the election on September 18. The striking pattern in all the major polls has been the stability of the Social Democratic lead since the spring, with the party consistently polling around 50 per cent or just above. This has defied the hopes of Mr Bildt, who expected a strong swing towards the government as the economy returned to growth after three years of recession. Instead, deepening concern over the perilous state of the public finances has created an atmosphere of economic crisis rather than recovery. The Social Democrats have come under great pressure from financial markets, forcing them 10 days ago to detail a programme of tax cuts and savings to attack the budget deficit. But the electorate at large has so far apparently not shared the lack of confidence in the party's economic policies shown by the markets. The growing expectation is that the Social Democrats - handed their worst defeat since the 1930s in the 1991 poll as the economy slid into recession - will bounce back into government, which they dominated for most of the past 50 years. Mr Bildt is now desperately attempting to win back the initiative by reminding voters of the Social Democrats' past failures, their commitment to an overblown public sector and their preference for tax increases. But most voters seem to be concerned to preserve rather than reform the cherished welfare state. Such is the confidence of Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democratic leader and former prime minister, that he is retreating to the mountains for several days this week to plan for government. So far he has avoided Mr Bildt's challenge to meet him in a face-to-face television debate, perhaps the best chance left for the articulate prime minister to save his job.</p>

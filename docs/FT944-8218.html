			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Zurich - Other markets Tomorrow brings the long awaited showdown between the directors of Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, and the maverick Zurich broker-fund manager Martin Ebner, writes Ian Rodger. A UBS extraordinary general meeting of shareholders starts at 2:30 pm in Zurich to consider the board's scheme to strip the registered shares, which have a par value one fifth of that on the bearers, of their extra voting power. The stated aim is to undermine Mr Ebner's challenge of their governance of the bank. BK Vision, an Ebner controlled investment fund which holds 18 per cent of the registered shares, has been trying to rally a majority of votes to force substantial changes to the UBS board and business strategy at the next annual meeting in April. The board's proposal calls for exchanging all existing shares into a new class of bearer shares with a par value of SFr10. The existing bearers would be exchanged at the rate of 10 for one, the registered at the rate of two for one. Uncertainty about the outcome, reflected in highly volatile trading of both classes of shares since the EGM was announced on September 29, is heightened by the fact that a two-thirds majority of shares represented at the meeting is needed to carry the motion. Both UBS chief executive Mr Robert Studer and Mr Ebner say they are confident of winning. Asked privately if they would admit it if they thought they would lose, both replied with a straight face, 'yes'. Wednesday brings 10-month sales figures from Nestle, whose shares have picked up in recent sessions after a period in the doldrums. Currency considerations remain paramount. The strength of the Swiss franc depressed first-half figures by about 6 1/2 per cent, and analysts say that it is likely to depress the 10-month outcome by about 8 per cent.</p>

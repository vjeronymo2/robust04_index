			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Utilities Shares in the water and electricity utilities may have simply been reacting badly to the polls yesterday. Or perhaps their marked underperformance was caused more by investors misreading Labour's manifesto. Labour's choice of the term 'public control' over the two industries was confusing, perhaps deliberately so. It confirms a retreat from full ownership, without carrying an obvious meaning. The broader commitments appear to offer little to consumers beyond what the regulators should already be providing. In the case of water, Labour has nothing to lose in making its intentions clear at once. It is inconceivable it could ever afford to take on the burden of the industry's huge capital spending. While there will be tighter regulation in future, that old threat should have been largely in the price. Judging by yesterday's 4 per cent fall in Anglian and Thames Water shares, the market has been less than efficient. As for Labour's view of electricity, it is complicated by an environmental policy which includes a pledge to stabilise and then speed up reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. It is hard to square that with smaller coal imports, the closure of nuclear stations and blocking of gas-fired stations. Until that contradiction is addressed, investors can only guess at the industry's eventual shape. That promises an uncertain ride for the shares.</p>

Kurochkin, PO ``Lyuminofor'';  UDC535.37+543.422.4]    [Abstract] The development of hybrid-cascade solid state  visualizers for near infra-red radiation (0.8-13 mkm) using  antistokes luminophores (ASL) provided a new impulse to the  research and development of these materials. The mechanism for  accumulating and transmitting energy by rare earth metal ions  and the fundamental properties of known ASL matrices activated  with rare earth metal ions determine the lower density limit of  power P[.sub]min[/] and its associated upper wavelength limit  _l_[.sub]max[/] of transformed infra-red radiation.  Visualizers and the luminophores used in them may be divided  into three groups, depending on intended use and design. The  simplest visualizer is intended for observations made with the  naked eye of relatively weak infra-red sources (light emitting  diodes, lasers), and it consists of an ordinary screen covered  with a layer of ASL within which the entire infra-red  transformation process takes place. Visualizers for ``weak''  fields (10[.sup]- 2[/] watt per cm[.sup]2[/]) are  capable of transforming IR-radiation of 1.1 mkm or greater into  visual, such as objects viewed in a dark moon-less night. The  spectral make up of this type of illumination is determined by  the transmission lines of water vapor, one of which takes place  in the 1.4-1.6 mkm range. These visualizers embody a  hybrid-cascade layout which includes a screen having an ASL and  a phototransformer. Here, the luminescent screen transforms the  1.4-1.6 lines into the shorter IR region of 0.8-1.1 mkm with the  phototransformer performing the dual functions of intensifying  and transforming the glow from the luminophore into illumination  on the exit screen. The most promising trend in the development  of antistokes infra-red visualizers with P[.sub]min[/] &lt;  10[.sup]-2[/] watt per cm[.sup]2[/] and _l_[.sub]max[/]  &gt;  1.1 mkm may be realized under the conditions of a quantum  counter in a parametric converter of the ``heterodyne'' type.  Its operation is based on the properties of several ASL to  increase the intensity of a spectral line in the presence of two  other radiations, one of which has a long wavelength and serves  as excitation source, while the other of another wavelength  serves as a signal. Results obtained provide a basis for  considering the second and third trends as the most promising  for visualizers of weak and ultra-weak infra-red radiation in  the 1-13 mkm range. Their realization requires the development  of new, non-traditional methods and devices for parametric  excitation, as well as the development of new classes of  antistokes luminophores.

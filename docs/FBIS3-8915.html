			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, March 16 (TANJUG) -- Clashes between the  forces of local Muslims and Croats are continuing in the central  and southern part of the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite the signed agreement on the creation  of a Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  military agreement between the two sides.    In central Bosnia-Herzegovina, the forces of local Croats,  Croatian Defense Council troops and Croatian regular army troops  opened on Wednesday sniper fire on the positions of Muslim  forces in the surroundings of Gornji Vakuf. In the valley of  the River Lasva Croatian forces are digging trenches and keep on  shifting the line of separation, Muslim Radio Sarajevo announced.    Over five thousand troops of the Croatian regular army are  still fighting in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although  the deadline fixed by the Security Council for their withdrawal  -- February 17 -- has long passed.    In the Mostar basin (southern Bosnia-Herzegovina) strong  explosions resounded on Tuesday, with the occasional use of  small arms and the air defense guns of Croatian and Muslim  forces -- the military sources of Bosnian Serbs said. Muslim  Radio Sarajevo reported that the Croatian Defense Council  continued on Wednesday attacks on Muslim positions.    Muslim military sources announced on Tuesday that Croatian  Defense Council units opened sniper fire on passers by on the  Mostar-Blagal road, so that representatives of the Spanish  batallion within UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] were forced to  intervene.    The military sources of Bosnian Serbs report that Croatian  Defense Council troops opened fire on Tuesday on the line of  separation in Mostar. In Blagaj, south of Mostar, which is  under Muslim control, two strong explosions were heard Tuesday  evening, and a Croatian helicopter opened fire in the  surroundings of Bijelo Polje north of Mostar Tuesday night.    Representatives of Bosnian Croats and Muslims signed in  Washington on March 1, under strong U.S. pressure, a preliminary  agreement on the formation of a federation of two peoples in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would later enter a confederation with  Croatia.    Washington's concept is to make possible, by a maneuver of a  dual state for Muslims, the continuation, even though partial,  of a unitary Bosnia, the extension of the territory under Muslim  control, an outlet to the sea for Muslims, and finally to create  a strong negotiating (and if possible a military) block against  Bosnian Serbs in the coming phase.</p>

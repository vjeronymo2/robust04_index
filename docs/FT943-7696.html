			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Management: Almost caught in the mouse trap - Ian Rodger asks whether Logitech can remain Swiss and independent in a fiercely competitive industry If there is one certainty for companies in the fast-changing personal computer industry, it is that no strategy will be successful for long. Logitech, which leads Microsoft by a short head as the world number one in mice for computers, with more than a third of the market, has in its short 13-year life changed course radically four times. It expects further shocks as a matter of course. 'We always think we have done enough, but we never have,' says Daniel Borel, the group's co-founder, chairman and chief executive. In the process of perpetual adjustment, the Swiss-based group has moved more and more of its activities to the US and East Asia, and thus become less and less Swiss. Its experience again revives the perennial question of whether any Europe-based group can stay the course in the rough and tumble of this global industry. Logitech was given its start in 1981 when two Italian electronic engineers, Giacomo Marini and Pierluigi Zappacosta, came together with Borel, a Swiss engineer. The three had met at Stanford University in the mid 1970s. Their initial view was that the mouse would be attractive only to specialised computer users, such as engineers, and would be sold directly to them. Volumes would be relatively small, so it would not make sense to manufacture it themselves. However, after winning a contract to develop a mouse for Hewlett-Packard, the US computer and electronics multinational, they changed their minds. They bet correctly that HP and other computer makers would become the big buyers of mice, including them in their computer kits alongside the keyboard. They also realised that these original equipment makers (OEMs) would only buy from a supplier which made its own mice, and preferably from one that was close at hand, so that quality could be checked and deliveries secured. Thus began the exodus from Switzerland. Logitech set up manufacturing in California in 1984 and within a year had 10 large OEM contracts and annual output of 300,000 units. Two years later, it began production in Taiwan for Asian OEMs (including the Asian plants of US suppliers, such as Apple) and in 1988 started a factory in Ireland aimed at European PC makers. By 1990, production in Switzerland had been halted. But margins on OEM business were thin, and the group soon saw that it also had to break into the fast-growing US retail market under its own brand if it was to generate adequate profits. It could not afford to set up its own distribution network, so it sold directly through the increasingly effective channel of PC magazine advertising. This helped Logitech build its sales to SFr124m (Pounds 60m) in 1988, and to become something of a mini-multinational, complete with a listing of its shares on the Swiss stock exchanges. Borel remained at group headquarters in Lausanne with responsibility for finance and product development, while Marini and Zappacosta directed worldwide marketing and software development from Silicon Valley in California. By then, the group's biggest concern was that the mouse was becoming a mature product, with little potential for further technical development. That meant it would become a commodity sold on very thin margins against increasingly stiff competition from low-cost, East Asian producers. In common with many other companies in this situation, Logitech began looking for opportunities to diversify, although with no illusions about the dangers. 'It is easy to make sub-products, but very difficult to find a second mouse,' Borel says. It rapidly evolved a diversification strategy. Although the company intended to keep close to areas it understood, the strategy has taken it into demanding new markets some of which have required extra skills. Logitech's mission, the directors decided, was to humanise the PC, to provide it with senses - not only the touch supplied by the mouse, but also, gradually, sight and hearing. A family of products called 'Senseware' would be developed. In 1988, the group acquired the licence to a hand-held scanner and has since developed a full line. More recently, digital still cameras have been developed. So have 'soundcards' (circuit boards); these are expected to become popular as the market for sophisticated home entertainment computer systems grows. Sales and profits maintained brisk double-digit growth up until 1991, suggesting the group was on the right track. However, a potentially fatal flaw emerged in its structure. The three main production centres outside Switzerland were building up their staff to become largely autonomous, each with product development, manufacturing and marketing activities. Initially, this process was endorsed by the directors because it gave the group a strong local image in each region, both with customers and with potential key employees. But the disadvantages of such a loose federalism - costly duplication of effort, diffused market intelligence and unco-ordinated R&amp;D spending  - soon came back to haunt Logitech. In 1992, a vicious PC price war broke out. Coincidentally, demand for Windows software, which requires the user to have a mouse, boomed. On the one hand, Logitech was faced with a dramatic increase in demand for its products, but on the other it was forced to slash its prices. 'It was fine to charge Dollars 120 (Pounds 77) for a mouse when the customer was paying Dollars 5,000 for his PC. But when PC prices went much lower, people expected to pay less for a mouse too,' says Rory Dooley, business unit director for pointing devices. Today, mice retail for around Dollars 20 in the US. Revenues in the six months to October 1992 sailed ahead a brisk 25 per cent, but cashflow slipped to a negligible SFr0.3m and the group suffered its first loss of SFr5.1m. With a reported equity base of only SFr90.2m and net debts of SFr111.6m a few months earlier, Logitech could not afford to sustain losses of this size for long. The immediate solution was obvious if painful. Production costs had to be lowered sharply again. With the factories in Taiwan and Ireland running well and a new China venture in the works, the high-cost California factory could be shut down. Marini, who was responsible for US operations, resigned in protest, but profitability was restored in the following six months and has been sustained ever since - though not without hiccups. This latest radical shake-up also meant jettisoning the assumption that production had to be located near the headquarters of the main PC manufacturers. Since the 1992 crisis, Borel has moved to Silicon Valley to control operations and keep a close eye on the all-important US market. Only the finance function and some high-end product engineering remain in Switzerland. The home country remains valuable as a source of top-quality engineers and as a test market because of the company's standing as the only significant Swiss player in the world computer industry. But of Logitech's 2,400 payroll, only 100 work in Switzerland. In an admission which speaks volumes for the pressures under which the company is working, Otto Kunkel, vice-president, finance, says an ambitious research programme has also been reined in because 'we cannot afford to look ahead 10 years, we are too small'. Profits recovered quickly, and the group managed to close the year to March 31 1993 with net income of SFr8.9m, down 57 per cent on the previous year. In its latest year to March 1994, net income more than tripled to SFr27.8m on sales up a handsome 17 per cent to SFr484.2m. But Logitech's recovery had soured in the first quarter of this year (the group's fourth fiscal quarter) when a fresh round of PC price cutting and a shift in sales patterns caught the directors by surprise and profits slumped. In an unusually blunt statement in May, the company explained why sales in its fourth quarter dropped 6.6 per cent and profits were below expectations. 'The introduction of new products at the end of the third quarter did not stir up customer demand as anticipated, while sales of the more traditional lines were slow.' Sales of PCs continued to grow at about 15 per cent in volume but zero in value, according to Kunkel. 'How do we cope,' he asks. Answer - yet another round of cost cutting. While finely priced OEM deals remain the backbone of the business, new models of mice have been designed to try to breathe new life into the flagging retail market - some cordless, some shaped for left-handers, some for use with portable computers. The main new product that did not stir up customer demand as expected in late 1993 was a low end sound attachment called Audioman. PC users have already moved on to high-quality soundcards, a market which is dominated by Creative Labouratories of the US. Logitech has just introduced a soundcard called SoundMan. With camera sales still tiny, the group's diversification strategy has certainly progressed slowly. Mice and other pointing devices still account for nearly 80 per cent of revenues. Only in scanners did it get off to a good start. They now account for close to a fifth of its sales and it claims a leading 45 per cent world share of hand-held models. But as one company official points out, a scanner remains a luxury option for most PC users. Another problem - not mentioned in the fourth-quarter statement - has been a significant shift in US PC marketing patterns which Logitech was slow to spot. More and more PCs are being sold in department and chain stores rather than in specialist shops, forcing the group to refocus its marketing efforts there. Is it all worth it? Borel looks weary and admits that, as a founder, he has found it 'emotionally draining' to deal with the many personnel problems arising from the past few years' upheavals. 'You realise that we grew initially on heart and soul. Now we bring in the professionals. They are cold and financial, and the two clans hate each other.' But he is still convinced the group is on the right track and is excited about the much heralded potential of the home computing market. 'We are dedicated to our original vision to humanise computing,' he says. 'We believe that Senseware's future markets will mature, evolve and flourish in parallel with computing technology itself because successful technology must be 'human-centric' no matter what its application,' he said in his latest annual statement. Apart from the sheer competitiveness of all Logitech's markets, he says the main problem is deciding when the time is right to push into new areas. 'It is so easy to expand in markets that are not yet ready.' Is Logitech determined to remain Swiss, European and independent? This is not an issue at the moment, but Borel does not rule out joining another group at some point. 'We are living through an important stage in the history of this industry. The important thing is to be part of the game.'</p>

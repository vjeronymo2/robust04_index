			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES POSTS $2.72 MILLION LOSS  </P> <P> Traditional Industries posted a $2.72-million loss for its fiscal year that  ended June 30, largely because of costs related to the company's settlement of  a dispute with the Federal Trade Commission.  </P> <P> The Agoura Hills concern, which sells photographic supplies directly to  consumers, earned $4.91 million the previous year.  </P> <P> Its revenue in fiscal 1989 jumped 32%, to $62.3 million from $47.1 million.  </P> <P> Separately, Traditional also said its bank lenders agreed to raise the  company's credit lines by about 25%, to $25 million. The additional credit  should enable Traditional to achieve a positive cash flow by June 30, the  company said.  </P> <P> Traditional is only now announcing its fiscal 1989 results because it took  several months to figure out how much the FTC settlement, announced last  summer, would cost the company. The cost totaled $2.7 million, which  Traditional recorded as a one-time, pretax charge against its earnings for the  fourth quarter of fiscal 1989, Traditional said.  </P> <P> The FTC had alleged, among other things, that certain Traditional sales  practices misled consumers about the services Traditional provides. In the  settlement, Traditional agreed to cancel contracts with some customers, which  contributed to the charge and the delay in tallying its fiscal 1989 results.  </P> <P> The rest of Traditional's fourth-quarter figures will not be available until  the company files its 10-K annual report with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, which Traditional expects to do within the next week.  </P></p>

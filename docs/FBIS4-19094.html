			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Frances Williams and Guy de Jonquieres: "Everyone </F> Wins in Uruguay Round"]    [Text] Marrakesh -- All countries will emerge winners from  the Uruguay Round trade liberalising accords, Mr Peter  Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade declared yesterday. Mr Sutherland said assertions  that some of the world's poorest countries would lose from the  accords were based on "a misstatement of the facts." He was  speaking on the eve of a four day meeting of ministers from more  than 120 countries which will end with a formal Uruguay Round  signing on Friday.    "The least developed countries are not losers but winners,"  he said. Above all, they would gain from strong multilateral  rules and disputes settlement. For small and economically  weaker countries, these rules were the only protection from the  "law of the jungle" where "might is right."    Mr Sutherland said ratification of the Uruguay Round was  still the subject of debate in some countries and legislative  approval by the leading trading powers must be completed in time  for the round to take effect by next January. However, the  round would not mean an end to international trade policy  disputes.    Japan is expected to call at this week's meeting for  unilateral trade weapons to be placed on the agenda of the World  Trade Organisation, planned to replace GATT. Tokyo fears that  the new international trade rules will not curb the growing use  of antidumping actions and U.S. threats of unilateral trade  sanctions.    The GATT secretariat, in an analysis published this morning,  estimates that market opening for agricultural and industrial  goods negotiated in the Uruguay Round could add $235 billion  (160.9 billion pounds) a year to world income by 2002. This  compares with estimates from the World Bank, the OECD and others  of $212-$274 billion.    These estimates do not include expected gains from  liberalisation of services trade or the boost to business  confidence and investment from improved trade rules.    According to GATT, industrial tariffs in developed countries  will fall from an average 6.3 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Some 43  per cent of their imports by value will enter duty free, against  20 per cent before the round began.    Virtually all their industrial tariffs will be "bound,"  giving exporters security that they will not be raised again.  Developing countries have agreed to bind tariff lines covering  59 per cent of the value of their imports, compared with 14 per  cent before the round began.    The GATT analysis notes that the least developed countries  will receive significantly lower tariff cuts on their exports  than others -- 25 per cent, compared with 37-38 per cent.    However, if textiles and clothing, and fish and fish  products, are removed from the calculation tariff concessions to  the poorest countries average 59 per cent compared with 44 per  cent for industrialised nations.    In addition, abolition of quota restrictions under the  Multi-Fibre Arrangement after 10 years could in effect more than  double the 22 per cent average tariff reduction in the textiles  and clothing sector, GATT points out.</p>

If, however, dividing lines were to  exist, it is understood--and this view is shared--that Poland  would find itself on the NATO side of the divide. Because the  United States firmly emphasizes that its security depends on our  security, it is in the interest of both sides, Poland and the  United States--and NATO--that Poland should become an active  partner in the Partnership for Peace.

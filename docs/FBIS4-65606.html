			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 19 (AFP) -- IAEA [International Atomic  Energy Agency] inspectors in North Korea to find out if that  country is making nuclear weapons, have visited an experimental  reactor and a radiochemical laboratory at the Yongbyon nuclear  complex and will continue their inspection Friday [20 May], an  IAEA spokesman said Thursday.    Hans-Friedrich Meyer would not comment on a report by THE  WASHINGTON POST that the reclusive Stalinist country had begun  removing spent fuel rods from the reactor at the Yongbyon  nuclear complex in defiance of international warnings not to do  so.    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) receives daily  reports from the inspectors, he said, adding that IAEA member  countries were kept informed "in confidence" about what was in  the reports.    He said the inspectors were tasked only with maintenance  work  consisting in verifying seals placed on the reactor and  replacing films and batteries in cameras monitoring the nuclear  site.    The United Nations and the United States have warned  Pyongyang not to remove the fuel rods before the IAEA inspectors  can check them to see if fissile material has been diverted to  make a nuclear weapon.    For this purpose they will also take samples in the  radiochemical lab.    Sources familiar with a preliminary report filed by the IAEA  team had told the POST that defueling at the Yongbyon reactor,  90 kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang, was in its early  stage, meaning that only a small portion of the estimated 8,000  plutonium- laden fuel rods had been removed.    North Korea's continued refusal to abide by the IAEA's non-  proliferation rules has led to international threats of UN  sanctions, which in turn prompted war threats from Pyongyang.    U.S. Defense Secretary, William Perry, said Wednesday that  his government faced "a very substantial near-term crisis" with  North Korea.</p>

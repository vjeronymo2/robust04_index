			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is not trying to avoid cooperation with the  UN, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, who  specializes in relations with the UN and other international  organizations, told Interfax. Lavrov is expected to leave for  New York as the Russia's permanent ambassador at the UN.    Lavrov said issues on peacemaking activities, including on  CIS territory, and on strengthening of the UN as an organization  capable of uniting efforts of all states and of helping them to  define the basis of the new system of international relations,  would be discussed during the visit of the UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali to Moscow (on April 1-5).    Lavrov did not rule out a discussion on reorganization of  the  UN Security Council and the UN in general. He stressed that the  issue was being considered by a specially established working  group which was discussing criteria for possible enlargement of  the UN Security Council. Possible candidacies were also  discussed, including Germany, Japan, India, Nigeria, Egypt,  Indonesia and other states. However, this does not mean that the  candidacies will become a full member of the UN Security  Council. Consensus was required to resolve the issue, primarily  in the regional groups.    Lavrov said enlargement of the UN Security Council must be  balanced not only from the point of view of the industrially  developed countries but also from the point of view of  geographical regions. He suggested that the parties concerned  would have to discuss this issue for a long time. There were  proposals to finish the work on the issue by the fiftieth  anniversary of the UN (1995). However, they were not accepted.  The anniversary was not the main criterion for the work.    Russia is prepared to consider the issue on limited  enlargement of the UN Security Council. However, the efficiency  of the Security Council must be preserved or even increased.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard seeks new drive on crime A NEW campaign to enlist support from the public in combating the crime wave was launched by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, in the Commons last night. Opening a debate on law and order, he said: 'I want to channel the public's energies in a constructive way to build a new, stronger and more effective alliance against crime.' Tory backbenchers joined with the minister in seeking to counter the impact made by Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, in his recent call for a crusade against crime. Mr Howard said he wanted to create an atmosphere in which criminals were 'frightened' and not members of the public. He also wanted to make local communities feel that 'we can act together to do something about crime'. Mr Howard promised: 'We will do that by taking a long-term approach to crime, by attacking it from every quarter'. However, the government may be facing embarrassment after the Tory candidate in the Christchurch by-election sought to outflank his Liberal Democrat rival by setting crime and capital punishment at the top of his agenda - even though the home secretary opposes hanging. Mr Robert Hayward yesterday angered Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, by launching a survey of public opinion in Christchurch on capital punishment. The Tory campaign team's high-risk strategy could succeed in diverting attention from disquiet over government policies. But Mr Hayward could embarrass ministers, most of whom are opposed to hanging. During the Commons debate yesterday Mr Howard, regarded as being on the Tory right wing, said he had previously supported capital punishment but was now opposed because of the initial failure of the appeals procedures in cases such as that of the six men wrongly convicted of the Birmingham pub bombings. No date has been set for the Christchurch by-election, caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley, the Conservative MP who had a 23,000 majority at the last general election. Yet later this month is still regarded as the most likely date.</p>

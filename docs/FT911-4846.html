			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Threat to form N Sea breakaway union LEADERS of unofficial industrial action in the North Sea threatened yesterday to establish a breakaway union unless existing unions created a new joint offshore body. The move came as the unions tried to negotiate a pay deal for construction workers. The Offshore Industry Liaison Committee called on existing unions to alter the way they represent offshore workers. The committee said moves towards a new union would be 'inescapable' if they refused. The dispute was provoked by negotiations between construction unions and the Offshore Contractors' Council (OCC) on a new recognition agreement covering 'hook-up' work on construction of rigs, but excluding the 'post hook-up' phase of maintenance of rigs. The OCC said after talks yesterday that there had been significant progress in some areas with a 'hook-up' agreement under negotiation. A joint panel was also being established to look at any outstanding grievances over men dismissed during the unofficial strikes. The talks came after unions failed to persuade enough offshore workers to register for a ballot on industrial action to force a single agreement covering all 20,000 workers in various offshore occupations. Mr Ronnie McDonald, chairman of the committee, said that unless the unions established a joint offshore section - empowered with a certificate of independence as a separate union and the freedom to decide its own policies  -moves towards a breakaway union were likely. He said that if unions refused to set up such a section, 'they will have declared unilaterally the North Sea a no-go area for them'. Offshore workers would then be likely to 'seek their own solutions' to the industrial relations process. Mr Jimmy Airlie, executive councillor of the AEU Engineering union, said after talks with employers that 'significant progress' had been made on reaching a recognition agreement for rig construction work. He said the agreement would be the most comprehensive deal ever to cover North Sea workers. Employers and unions also agreed to establish a joint panel to consider the cases of up to 460 workers who - unions claim - have been prevented from working in the North Sea after taking part in industrial action last year.</p>

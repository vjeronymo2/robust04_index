Shortly before his departure  for a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton and the highest  representatives of the Visegrad Four, we asked Michal Kovac for  his comment on the coming summit.    [Begin recording] [Kovac] We expect that President Clinton  will inform us about the conclusions and offer, and we are ready  to accept the offer within the framework of Partnership for  Peace. We pledge ourselves that we will take immediate action so  that we can conclude the relevant agreements. Naturally, this is  also an opportunity for us to inform the United States about our  endeavors here at home in the Slovak Republic to continue in the  process of strengthening the plurality system of democracy,  transformation, and economic reforms. As you know, at the same  time this will also provide an opportunity for bilateral talks  with representatives of the Visegrad Group. [end recording]    [Announcer] Other members of the delegation are Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar; Deputy Prime Ministers Jozef Prokes,  Sergej Kozlik, and Julius Toth; Jozef Moravcik, minister of  foreign affairs; Jan Ducky, minister of the economy; Irena  Belohorska, minister of health; and Imrich Andrejcak, minister  of defense. Ambassadors of the Slovak Republic to Prague and  Washington Ivan Mjartan and Branislav Lichardus are also in the  delegation.</p>

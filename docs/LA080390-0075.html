			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Delta Dawn?: Delta Burke has designs on leaving "Designing Women." Burke was  nominated for an Emmy for her performance as the vain Suzanne on the sitcom,  but says she has conflicting feelings about it.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of wonderful things about it but I have not wanted to be there  for some time now," she told the Orlando Sentinel. "It is not a good workplace,  not a good environment. It's so strange, being part of something that's so  wonderful and so awful at the same time." Burke praised her co-stars but was  coy when asked about producers Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason.  "I'm saving that for the book," she said. "The last two years have been very  hard. Personally, I lost all my self-esteem.' GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

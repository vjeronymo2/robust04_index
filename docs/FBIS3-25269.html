			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There has been a government reshuffle in Burundi  just two days after the previous government was appointed. The  opposition considers the new government to be based on a  national consensus. Nicolas Mayugi is the leader of UPRONA  [Party of National Unity and Progress]. He spoke to Monique Mas:    [Begin recording] [Mayugi] If every Burundian can now relate  to this government, it is largely because the last government  was perceived as the government of a party that had just won.  Today, the government is perceived as a government that brings  people together.    [Mas] Is it seen as such by the parties that lost the  elections?    [Mayugi] Yes, we are in a crisis, and we are trying to come  out of it. I think that we can return to concepts like winning  and losing later. Now, we need to rebuild our country and bring  back peace. Perhaps this is also why the political parties have  agreed to a political truce. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Turkey considers natural gas deal with Turkmenistan TURKEY IS considering a project to pipe natural gas from the impoverished Central Asian republic of Turkmenistan for domestic use and exports to Europe, reports Reuter from Ankara. Turkish businessmen voiced enthusiasm for the scheme. 'A gas pipeline is the most important project to improve our trade relations with Turkmenistan because it would create huge off-set possibilities,' said Mr Nihat Gokyigit, head of Tekfen Holding, a big engineering and contracting group. Turkish officials said there would be further talks about possible gas and oil pipelines at a summit meeting of ex-Soviet Moslem republics, Iran and Turkey in Ashkhabad, capital of Turkmenistan, on Sunday. Ankara and Tehran have been discussing a pipeline to export Iranian gas through Turkey for years, but have not gone ahead. Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, said in Ashkhabad last week that Turkmenistan had massive gas reserves. 'Its prosperity depends on producing and selling it.' He has offered Turkmenistan export credits worth Dollars 75m and soft loans for food purchases.</p>

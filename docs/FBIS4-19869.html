			<p>BFN     [Text] Several Western embassies have decided to evacuate  their nationals from Serbia and Montenegro (Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia) as a precaution against Serb positions in Gorazde  being bombed in the next few hours and the possibility of  reprisals. The United States, Great Britain, and France, whose  aircraft could take part directly in the bombing, have already  started the evacuation of Belgrade. As for the families of the  diplomatic staff and employees of the Spanish mission in  Belgrade -- a total of about 16 people -- only four of them have  decided to leave the country, following the advice of the  Spanish Government. As for the Spanish population of Serbia and  Montenegro -- according to diplomatic sources, about 50 people,  mostly the wives or children of Serbs -- they have said that  they do not feel threatened at present and are not considering  evacuation.</p>

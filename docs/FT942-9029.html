			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Scotch whisky producers take on Tokyo Five centuries after their first skirmish with the Scottish exchequer, Scotch whisky producers are still struggling with the tax man, but their opponent now is Japan's finance ministry. Mr Hugh Morison, director general of the Scotch Whisky Association, is in Tokyo to lobby against what whisky producers say is a discriminatory tax regime. Whisky, like other imported spirits such as bourbon and cognac, is taxed up to six times higher than shochu, a domestic drink made from sweet potato which controls about 67 per cent of the Japanese spirit market. 'This discrimination is in spite of a 1987 ruling that declared that Japan's liquor tax system contravened Gatt,' he says. 'The findings were accepted by the Japanese government in 1989, but little has changed since then.' Japan is the world's fourth largest Scotch whisky export market after the US, France and Spain. But imported spirits account for about 8 per cent of the Japanese market, compared with an average of 30 per cent in other industrialised democracies. 'This is a pretty blatant breach of a Gatt ruling by one of the world's main trading nations,' says Mr Morison. 'It's the worst case of discrimination in any of the Scotch export markets.' Japan argues that shochu is part of the national culture because it is made by small rural distilleries across Japan. But Scotch makers insist that more than half of all shochu is made by six large industrial groups involved in other activities such as pharmaceuticals. Japan says its taxation system is moving in the right direction. Since 1989, the difference between the tax on whisky and shochu koh, a down-market version, has fallen from a ratio of 1:16 to 1:5, and dropped to 1:4 under rules introduced on May 1. Scotch whisky sales have done particularly badly during Japan's worst post-war recession. Sales in Japan fell 22 per cent last year from Pounds 178m in 1992 to Pounds 139m, while volume dropped 13 per cent from 18.5m litres of pure alcohol to 16.2m litres. Mr Morison says the tax distortions have meant Japanese consumers switched to lower cost products such as shochu whose sales ended a five-year decline in 1992, rising 4.4 per cent, and 5.5 per cent in the first half of last year.</p>

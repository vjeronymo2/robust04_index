			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Lilley battles to avoid freezing out old faithful: The debate over fuel bill taxes THRIFTY pensioners are threatening to cause grey clouds for Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. Although they are a group much admired by the Tory party, which many of them support, they have brought dark days for Mr Lilley as he draws up plans for compensating people on low incomes for the impact of value added tax on heating bills. The government has already conceded that the normal arrangements for taking account of the inflationary impact of the VAT change will not be enough. The tax is due to be imposed on April 1 next year. Normally people on benefit would have to wait until the following April to receive any increase in payments. This time they will be compensated immediately the tax is introduced. The increases will be announced by Mr Lilley, probably on Budget day, November 30. Almost all the Pounds 500m or so likely to be made available will go to 5.3m people on income support, leaving little for those who just fail to qualify, because their savings or incomes are slightly too high. The government's social security advisory committee estimated that because people on low incomes tend to have higher heating bills, compensation should be at the level of Pounds 40 per person per year while VAT is levied at 8 per cent, and Pounds 90 when it rises to the full rate of 17.5 per cent from April 1995. Mr Lilley is expected to combine a general rise in income support with extra increases in premiums paid to special groups, such as the elderly or single parents, likely to be hit particularly hard by the rise in fuel bills. But his greatest difficulty remains. Ministers have not agreed a way of helping those people who fall just outside the income support safety net. An increase in the Pounds 10 Christmas bonus to pensioners would be neither targeted nor particularly effective. An extra increase in cold weather payments would apply only to people who are already on income support. Using eligibility for housing benefit or for council tax benefit as the criterion for extra cash, assistance would reach people who are on modest incomes just above the income support qualification. But local councils rather than central government administer these benefits, so unless claimants also qualify for income support, the DSS does not know who they are. Trying to use local council data to reach claimants not on income support would make administering such a scheme complex and costly. There is one social security payment which would reach all pensioners over 80 - the category which contains many of the poorer pensioners - and that is the age addition. This has been allowed to wither away for many years, however, and to raise its current 25p a week level now would merely be to draw attention to its derisory level. It is more likely to be abolished in the current spending round than it is to be increased. The most straightforward ways of providing help - either giving an extra increase in the basic retirement pension or increasing the number of people eligible for income support - are too expensive to be seriously considered, especially in the present political climate. Ministers have consistently argued that targeting social security benefits is the best way of using the available money to reach people in most need without wasting money on those who are well off. This means, inevitably, that there will be those who fall on the wrong side of the line that has to be drawn. The difficulty in this particular case is that those on the wrong side of the line include a group dear to Tory hearts - pensioners who have saved and made provision for their old age. They will be much in evidence at next month's Tory party conference, whatever motions are formally debated. No wonder Mr Lilley last week described his task as 'unenviable'.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sales surge 21% at Schering Schering, the Berlin-based drugs group, yesterday reported a 21 per cent sales surge in the first two months of this year and forecast earnings for the year would at least match last time's DM254m (Dollars 151m). The sharp rise in turnover, together with an executive's remarks that the profits forecast was made with 'typical understatement,' helped push the group's shares up DM16 to DM1,036 in Frankfurt. The group, a leading supplier of contraceptive pills, and which last year won US approval for Betaseron, the first effective treatment for multiple sclerosis, also announced a 1993 dividend of DM14.22, after DM13 last time. The pay-out includes the benefits of recent changes in corporate taxes, and with tax credits would yield a net DM20.31 a share - unchanged from last year - for shareholders liable for German taxes. Mr Klaus Pohle, finance director, said progress this year would depend on the impact of exchange rates and health reforms, while the withdrawal of tax concessions for companies based in Berlin would also affect results. Earnings from Betaseron would not make a significant contribution to profits, he added, blaming high development and launch costs. Sales of the new product had so far failed to match expectations. According to Mr Giuseppe Vita, group chairman, Betaseron added only DM7m to group turnover last year. It was taking longer than expected for health insurance companies to approve payment of potential patients' prescriptions. Estimates of annual treatment costs range between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 10,000. Although only 4,000 US patients were taking the drug at the end of last year, Mr Vita said he expected the number to climb to around 40,000 during 1994, bringing in sales of DM300m. Schering aims to start marketing the treatment in Europe, where it will be called Beneseron, in mid-1995. An application for approval will be sent to the Brussels authorities later this year.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Hong Kong to open telecom market HONG KONG is to liberalise the colony's telecommunications market, paving the way for at least a second domestic competitor to Hongkong Telecommunications, the local private monopoly, when its exclusive franchise expires in 1995. The government has reached agreement with Hongkong Telecom to change the method by which the local telephone company's prices are regulated, a move which will lead to prices rising more slowly than inflation. Local cellular telephone operators will also have easier and cheaper access to the international telephone call market. Hongkong Telecom is 58.5 per cent owned by Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK. Last week, it reported a 14 per cent growth in net earnings to HKDollars 5.67bn (Pounds 407m). The decision to allow more competition is in keeping with a tougher line that the government is taking against monopolies in the colony. This week, it cut the number of exclusive routes operated by China Motor Bus in response to consumer pressure. Mrs Elizabeth Bosher, acting-secretary for economic services, said the new arrangement represented a good deal for consumers in Hong Kong. The opening of the market after 1995 would enable competitors to set up competing networks to provide fixed-link voice telephone services, she said. Officials said the government had not yet determined whether to open the market to all-comers or to limit it to companies that meet specific requirements. However, they stressed that the government would not seek to pick winners. 'We do not want to take a stake in a new entrant's success,' one said. Mr Michael Gale, chief executive of Hongkong Telecom, said that the new pricing formula would encourage efficiency and innovation.</p>

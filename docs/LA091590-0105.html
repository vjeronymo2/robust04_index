			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BLUE JAYS PULL UNACCUSTOMED RALLY TO WIN, 8-7  </P> <P> One of the Toronto Blue Jays' biggest problems has been their inability to  rally in the last inning.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays scored three runs off Baltimore Oriole reliever Gregg Olson in  the ninth inning Friday night at Toronto for an 8-7 victory.  </P> <P> It was only the second time in 60 games Toronto has come from behind in its  final at-bat.  </P> <P> Rance Mulliniks singled home two runs to tie the score, and John Olerud singled  to win it and enable the Blue Jays to take a giant step in pursuit of the title  in the American League East.  </P> <P> "They (the Red Sox) must have looked up at the scoreboard, saw that we were  down two runs with Olson pitching and must have felt pretty good," said  Mulliniks, 7 for 16 as a pinch-hitter. "So they must have felt bad when they  saw we pulled it out."  </P> <P> Oriole Manager Frank Robinson was upset about the ball four call on Fred  McGriff on a 3-and-2 count preceding Mulliniks' hit. "That was the play,"  Robinson said. "Everyone but the umpire knew it was strike three."  </P> <P> Olson, who has had arm trouble recently, has 31 saves. This was his fifth  missed save opportunity.  </P> <P> With Boston losing, the Blue Jays are only three games behind with 17  remaining.  </P> <P> Toronto, with Jimmy Key pitching hitless ball, led, 3-0, after five innings.  </P> <P> But the Orioles scored six times in the sixth inning, four of the runs coming  on Sam Horn's pinch grand slam.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Boston 0 -- Sammy Sosa hit a two-run home run and Jack McDowell  (13-7) gave up only four hits in seven innings at Chicago. It was the second  victory in a row for the White Sox over Boston, which has lost eight of its  last 12.  </P> <P> The Red Sox found that reliever Jeff Reardon wasn't ready to pitch.  </P> <P> Reardon, in his first outing after back surgery Aug. 4, pitched only one-third  of an inning, giving up two runs and four hits.  </P> <P> Texas 2, Milwaukee 1 -- Nolan Ryan gave up four hits and a run and struck out  11 in eight innings and left with a 1-1 tie.  </P> <P> In the 10th inning, rookie Juan Gonzalez hit his fourth home run to win it for  relief pitcher Kenny Rogers (9-5).  </P> <P> Ryan extended his major league record to 14 seasons in which he has struck out  at least 200 batters.  </P> <P> New York 5, Detroit 2 -- Tim Leary (9-18) won in his bid to avoid 20 defeats,  but the big news for the Yankees was a hit by Don Mattingly.  </P> <P> Mattingly, out since July 24 with a back problem that has bothered him for two  years, lashed a pinch double to celebrate his return.  </P> <P> Cleveland 6, Kansas City 4 -- Sergio Valdez (4-5) gave up eight hits in 7 2/3  innings at Cleveland, but he held hot-hitting George Brett hitless as the  Indians won for the fifth time in six games.  </P> <P> Brett, who had climbed into a virtual tie for the batting lead, fell to .324,  going 0 for 4.

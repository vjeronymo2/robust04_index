			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yu Guanmiao (0205 7070 5379) and Wang Yulan </F> (3769 3768 5695)]    [Text] Brazzaville, 15 May (XINHUA) -- Granting an  interview to XINHUA on the eve of his departure for visit to  China, Congolese President Pascal Lissouba said China is a real  friend of Congo with very sincere friendship between the two  countries.    President Lissouba will begin his week-long state visit to  China on 19 May at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin --  his first visit to China. It has been learned that President  Lissouba will exchange views with Chinese leaders on  international and bilateral relations during his visit. He will  also tour other parts of China to better understand conditions  of its reform, opening up, and construction of a socialist  market economy.    Lissouba is an old friend known to the Chinese people. China  and Congo established diplomatic ties in 1964 when he was  premier of Congo.    Touching on friendly cooperative relations between China and  Congo in the past three decades, Lissouba praised such  cooperation as a model, saying "This kind of cooperation is what  Congo has been looking for." He maintained that China has been  consistent in fulfilling its obligations and has done a lot for  Congo. Lissouba said that he will express respect to the  Chinese people and their leaders during his forthcoming visit  and explore jointly with Chinese leaders new ways and means of  cooperation between the two countries.    On Congo's current economic situation, Lissouba said that,  due to poor management and inappropriate exploitation of state  resources, Congo is currently heavily indebted with its economy  on the brink of collapse. He said Congo, with its rich natural  resources, would like to further strengthen cooperation of  mutual benefit with China in better opening up and utilizing its  resources, particularly in promoting agricultural production.</p>

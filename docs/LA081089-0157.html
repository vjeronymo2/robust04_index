			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> HAZARDOUS-WASTE ROUNDUP  </P> <P> The City Council has set Oct. 14 as the date for a citywide hazardous-waste  roundup.  </P> <P> Although similar collections have been staged in other cities, this will be a  first for Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> The collection, scheduled to take place between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. at a parking  lot at 341 N. Foothill Road, is intended to help residents get rid of paints,  solvents, motor oil, pool chemicals and other household wastes that are not  supposed to go directly into landfills.  </P> <P> In other action, the City Council on Tuesday authorized the Chamber of Commerce  to hire an agent to license the city logo, which includes a picture of City  Hall, for commercial use in products and events.  </P> <P> Staffers also reported that a 24-hour hot line has been established for  residents to report graffiti. The city has hired a temporary worker to remove  graffiti from public areas.  </P> <P> Owners of private property owners are expected to clean up graffiti themselves,  according to a leaflet that will be distributed in residents' water bills.  </P></p>

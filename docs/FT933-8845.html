			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Rover returns to health in a sickly climate: BAe is free to sell its vehicle maker, but there are sound reasons for keeping it FROM TODAY British Aerospace is free to sell Rover Group, the former BL Cars and Land Rover business of which BAe was the surprise buyer, for Pounds 150m, five years ago. There has been much speculation that BAe would seek to unload Rover for a tidy profit as soon as the government's privatisation terms made it possible. Current valuation estimates of the business range around Pounds 500m. Yet there is no queue of prospective buyers. There is also no sign that BAe is even preparing to hang out the 'for sale' sign, with Rover on the verge of returning to trading profit and being the only carmaker boasting increased sales in depressed European Community markets. Volkswagen/Audi, whose dash for European market supremacy through acquisition once made it a favourite to snap up Rover, is too financially troubled. Ford almost certainly would have felt obliged to prevent a VW takeover. But it is making heavy losses of its own. 'The best result is that Rover remains the industrial equivalent of Belgium,' says Professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School's motor industry research centre, who is one of the leading analysts of the vehicle group's fortunes. Nor are other large players circling Rover with any apparent interest. Even Honda, with which Rover has a 20 per cent cross-shareholding, professes no desire for control, although it may consider a slightly increased shareholding. One reason is the depressed climate in which the European motor industry is operating. West European sales are down 17.7 per cent so far this year. Yet even if the climate were better, Ford's struggle to make its Pounds 1.6bn purchase of Jaguar pay, and General Motors' similar struggles with Saab, have made the industry wary. Vehicle companies struggling to make the grade can be deep financial pits and Rover in its various previous guises - as BL, British Leyland and BMC - has been among the deepest. Over nearly two decades, Pounds 3.5bn of British taxpayers' funds were poured into its operations before privatisation. The fundamental question now is whether the UK's climb out of its steepest post-war car sales slump and Rover's strong progress in continental Europe and North America are enough to provide it with a viable long-term future. As Prof Rhys and other motor industry analysts point out, Rover has had an embarrassing number of 'false dawns' in which supposedly attractive new model programmes have failed to live up to their promise and brief spurts into profitability have fallen back into loss and indebtedness. Rover has only recently begun reversing its prolonged market-share decline in the UK, from more than 40 per cent in the 1960s to 13 per cent to 14 per cent by the early 1990s. Prof Rhys says: 'That Rover has become a small player in the European industry has been perceived as it simply being a failed mass producer. But there is a growing perception that its relative smallness is now by choice, as a specialist manufacturer.' It is increasingly accepted that the serious push to take Rover's products up-market, started by former chairman Sir Graham Day and developed by his successor Mr George Simpson and colleagues such as managing director Mr John Towers, is working. The smaller 200/400 car range has re-established Rover as a serious competitor in this market segment. After a Pounds 200m investment to transform production facilities at Cowley, Oxford, the Rover 800 has become a market leader in the UK executive car sector. Comparisons of the recently launched Rover 600 with BMW provides further evidence that the strategy is working. The 600's Honda Accord counterpart is being built by Honda at Swindon. Production of Discovery and Range Rover models cannot keep pace with demand, and Rover expects to quadruple sales of these vehicles, to 16,000 units annually, in the US alone over the next two years. Cowley reflects the new flexibility in production processes and among the company's 33,000-strong workforce. The plant is able to build the ageing Montego and Maestro models for as long as demand at even a few thousand a year persists. Alongside that process, the MG RV8 sports car, one of a growing number of niche vehicles being brought to market by Rover's new special projects division, is being virtually assembled by hand. Mr Towers points out that everyone at Cowley, from managers to receptionists, is a standby member of assembly-line teams. Large productivity improvements - a claimed 18 per cent at Cowley so far this year - and the introduction of 'lean' distribution which has taken thousands of cars out of the supply pipeline, are also driving costs down. Mr Towers says Rover is close to its target of financial break even at 400,000 cars a year. Last year's production was only 405,000, however, and output is down marginally again this year. Analysts still expect Rover to achieve a trading profit of Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m this year due mainly to its rigorous cost-cutting. Yet with current debts of some Pounds 400m Rover would still be making a net loss. Next year recovery should lift profits to between Pounds 90m and Pounds 100m and Rover should move closer to its proclaimed ideal volume of about 500,000 vehicles a year. Analysts are asking whether, given the fiercely competitive state of markets, such a volume will be enough to provide adequate profitability while sustaining investments of more than Pounds 200m a year. Prof Rhys believes that Rover may have to lift output substantially beyond the 500,000 level. Between its Longbridge and Cowley plants Rover retains a theoretical capacity of nearly 1m units. To utilise capacity more effectively would require new models. Nevertheless Rover's management ranks maintain that sustained viability is no longer in doubt. Those ranks may well seek to stake their futures on that view. There is growing talk of a management buy-out proposal for next spring.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LOCATION AND MAIN ACTIVITIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LONGBRIDGE         Engines and gearboxes, Mini, Metro, Rover 200 and                    Honda Concerto production GAYDON             Product proving ground                    Advanced engineering                    Test facilities SWINDON            Rover bodies and pressings SOLIHULL           Land Rover Defender, Discovery and Range Rover                    production, engines and gearboxes BICKENHILL         Corporate headquarters COWLEY             Maestro, Montego, Rover 800, Rover 600 &amp; MG RV8                    vehicle production  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPANY PROFILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual sales revenue               Pounds 3.684bn Export sales reveue                Pounds 1.159bn Vehicles sold                             421,000 Vehicles produced                         405,000 Employees                                  33,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Biggest UK car producer            30% of all UK production Biggest UK car exporter            31% of all UK exports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

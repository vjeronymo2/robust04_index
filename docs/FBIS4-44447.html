			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zou Xiangqun (6760 0686 5028): "Words Written at </F> the Top---How Can the Government Manage Prices?"]    [Text]In engaging in the socialist market economy, it  is inevitable that the prices that were too rigidly controlled  under the former planned economic system be gradually freed up.  There is not the slightest doubt about this. But in freeing up  prices, will everything be fine and everywhere be peaceful? Do  governments in market economy countries no longer manage prices?  Obviously this is not the case. Since China's government still  must manage prices, how does it management them? To manage them  too much and too rigidly and return to the old system obviously  will not do. If they are managed too little and too laxly, large  price fluctuations will inevitably occur. This also is  unacceptable. How does the government manage prices under  socialist market economy conditions? This truly is a new  problem. This article by Comrade Zou Xiangqun, deputy secretary  of the State Planning Commission and deputy bureau head of the  former State Pricing Bureau, deserves to be read.    With the historically great progress in China's price  reform,  the traditional price managing system characterized by a high  degree of centralization and administrative methods alone, has  been essentially eliminated, and a new price managing system  framework is gradually being formed. Under these circumstances,  questions clearly confront us such as: Is price reform complete  or not; After prices are freed up will they be allowed to  drift;? and how are prices managed in a market economy? Whether  we can properly answer these questions in theory and promptly  resolve these questions in practice is directly related to  continuing price reform and to a certain extent affects the  sound development of the economy and the stability of society.    Freeing Up Prices Does Not Equate To Completing  Reform    In fifteen years of price reform, China has converted from  planned pricing mechanisms to socialist market pricing  mechanisms and has already made some decisive steps. The highly  centralized government fixed price system has been smashed and  the prices of the vast majority of commodities are formed by the  market. Since the end of 1992, the retail prices of only 5.9  percent of the commodities in society were set by the  government; the prices of 12.5 percent of the total agricultural  products sold by farmers were set by the government; and the  prices of 18.7 percent of capital goods sold by industrial  enterprises were set by the government. The comparative price  relations of major commodities have been fundamentally improved  and the price structure is constantly being rationalized. The  scissors of industrial and agricultural product prices is  greatly reduced. In 1992 the industrial products that farmers  could exchange the same amount of agricultural products for had  increased by 50.9 percent from 1978. The low price situation of  extraction and basic industries had clearly improved. The  domestic selling price of more than 95 percent of imported  commodities were directly related to international market prices  through the agency system. These all are historically great  achievements, creating important prerequisites for the formation  of socialist market pricing mechanisms.    But price reform is by no means complete. According to the  goals for the reform of the economic system determined by the  party's Fourteenth Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  Fourteenth Central Committee, the fundamental task of price  reform is to establish socialist market pricing mechanisms.  These pricing mechanisms are mainly formed by the market with  macroeconomic control by the government. The basic requirement  is that in the formation of prices the vast majority of  commodities enter the market. Because enterprises rely on market  supply and demand to determine prices, in pricing they can  adjust prices through supply and demand in an ordered market  atmosphere of unified open competition and prices lead to  rational distribution of resources. On top of price restraints,  the government can establish a complete and effective system to  control prices and using limited fixed prices as the mainstay  adopt price fixing activity that conforms to the standards of  the market economy and legal standards. Comparing the successes  already achieved with these reform goals, we should say that  there still is a considerable gap: 1) The market system still is  not sufficiently developed. The current market structure is  comparatively unitary. Development of the market for the  elements of production has just begun. The scale of the market  is still comparatively small, facilities are imperfect, trading  methods are backward, and market regulations are very unsound,  and regional blockades and division of markets still exist. With  prices formed in this kind of market, we cannot flexibly reflect  the overall supply and demand of society and the degree of  scarcity of resources and we cannot accurately transmit signals  for the orientation of resources. The December 1993 grain price  fluctuations occurred after China's grain production had had  successive years of bumper harvests and state reserves were  ample, and overall supply and demand were balanced. To a very  great extent this situation is directly related to the fact that  China's current market system is not sufficiently developed. 2)  Reform of internal enterprise operational mechanisms still is  incomplete. Although enterprises that have fixed prices as their  mainstay already have competition induced mechanisms, generally  speaking they still lack the restraining mechanisms of risks,  lack a complete internal price control system, and lack the  understanding, the experience, and the ability to make  scientific pricing decisions. The first half of last year,  certain large steel enterprises took advantage of the inflated  scale of investment and the great demand for building materials  and contended with one another to inflate prices and even  colluded to raise prices, causing steel prices to double.  Subsequently prices fell sharply and steel piled up in the  warehouses creating circulating difficulties for enterprise  production. This is just a typical example of the situation. 3)  A price control system still has not been established. After the  scope of prices under direct state control was greatly reduced,  an effective price control system and a complete set of prices  laws and regulations still were not established for the vast  majority of freed up commodity and service prices. Although the  state began to establish reserves for some commodities and  certain regions established price adjustment funds for a few  important varieties, generally speaking economic methods still  are very weak, legislation is relatively retarded, and controls  are lacking in strength, not very suited to the development of  the overall reform situation, and becoming a pronounced  contradiction in current reform. 4) The problem of the  unsuitable pricing system still has not been completely  resolved. The prices of a few basic products such as energy and  railroad transportation and infrastructure prices still are low,  which is disadvantageous to preferential distribution of  resources, and grain purchasing prices are not altogether  reasonable. The relative performance of grain production has  declined and the scissors differential of industrial and  agricultural products that had been reduced since reform, in  recent years has given indications of expanding, which is  disadvantageous to the stable growth of agricultural production.  All of these situations indicate that it still is necessary to  put forth a great deal of actual arduous effort to accomplish  price reform. We especially must continue to develop the market  system and establish a unified, free, competitive, and orderly  market system; and promote reform of internal enterprise  operating mechanisms. We should actively cultivate the market as  the mainstay; pay close attention to establishing a sound price  control system, and continue to smooth the price relations of  important commodities. Only if we do this can we establish  socialist market pricing mechanisms.    We Cannot Take a Hands Off Approach to Prices Under  Market Economy Conditions    An important characteristic of the market economy is using  economic benefits as a fundamental driving force and realizing  optimum distribution of resources through the market. This type  of economy has mechanisms to encourage competition and is  vigorous. It also is a legal system economy, limiting the  negative effects that spontaneity and blindness can produce on  the market. Socialist market pricing mechanisms also must fully  realize this important characteristic.    With the vast majority of commodity and service prices freed  up, since producers and businesses have obtained autonomy in  fixing prices, it has greatly aroused enthusiasm for production  and business and clearly promoted economic development, a  flourishing market, and improvements in people's lives. But at  the same time, in some regions, departments, and institutions,  certain chaotic phenomena have occurred such as: Exceeding  authority in establishing prices, arbitrarily collecting fees,  monopoly prices, seeking exorbitant profits, getting on the  bandwagon to raise prices, raising prices without authorization,  clambering to raise prices, demanding exorbitant prices,  cheating and gouging, and counterfeit and inferior goods.  Although the manifestations of these problems are somewhat  different in different regions and different sectors, their  danger cannot be overlooked. They disrupt the economic order and  affect the image of reform, damage the interests of the masses,  and to a certain extent promote overall inflation. According to  calculations, in the 13 percent total rise in the retail prices  of society in 1993, spontaneous price increases made up 6.8  percentage points. A significant portion of this was caused by  chaotic prices. These chaotic prices essentially are produced by  the disorderly activity of various special interests who, with  the pattern of interests drastically changing, pursue their own  benefits and do not care about the benefits of society. It is a  reflection of the spontaneity and blindness of the market  economy. To guard against and overcome the destructive effects  that this spontaneity and blindness can produce, the state must  control and manage economic activity and market prices.    Western market economy countries also do not take a hands  off  approach to prices. All major developed countries have  established different levels and different types of price  control structures, distinguishing the different situations for  commodities and services and have adopted separate direct  control, indirect control, and oversight and inspection  measures. Japan has established a unified national price control  structure with a price issue council structure to make price  decisions and a price administering structure with the Price  Bureau of the Economic Planning Agency at its core. France has a  National Competition Commission as the general bureau to check  on competition, consumption, and anti-fraud. Thailand has the  Fair Price and Monopoly Prevention Commission established by the  Ministry of Commerce for unified control of national prices. The  United States has not established a national unified price  control structure, but oversight and control of overall price  levels is maintained by the Labor Department of the federal  government; railroad freight prices are controlled by the  government's Interstate Commerce Commission; and consumer  interests and enterprise price oversight is undertaken by the  Consumer Bureau. In Germany national control of commodity prices  generally is the responsibility of state government economic  agencies.    The items with direct government control of prices by  various  countries are: Japan has such products as petroleum, coal,  railroads, air transport, public housing, land prices, rice,  cigarettes, and salt, approximately 18 percent of the products  in consumer price indices statistics. The United States has  public utilities such as, electric power, taxis, subways, cable  television, running water, gas, public housing rent, and museum  tickets, making up between 5 percent and 10 percent of citizens'  consumable expenditures. In France there are such things as  public transportation, post and telegraph, health care, spirits,  education, military industrial products, and agricultural  products, making up approximately 20 percent of commodities and  fees. In Germany there are such things as railroads,  pharmaceuticals, coal, agricultural products, lawyer, architect,  and notary fees, and legally stipulated insurance fees, making  up 22-26 percent of commodities and public utility fees.  Countries' governments have three forms of indirect price  controls. One is the use of monetary policy and financial policy  by adjusting the reserve discount rate, the interest rate, and  the use policy budget, adjusting government expenditures to  regulate overall supply and demand of society. The second is to  use industrial policy to support the development of key  industries. For example, the United States conducts a price  support and subsidy policy for agricultural products to protect  farmers' interests and the European Union and Japan also have a  considerable number of agricultural product subsidies. The third  is social intervention measures, intervening by means of price  oversight from a consumer commission or the public opinion of  society. Foreign price oversight and inspection also are very  serious. They have established special price oversight and  inspection forces, and some countries arm their inspectors and  when necessary they can search and serious law-breakers are  prosecuted. Throughout today's world there is not a country,  whether a developed country or a developing country, that  completely lets prices drift.    The Third Plenary Session of the party's Fourteenth Central  Committee, based on China's practical experience since reform  and opening up and consulting certain general practices of  Western countries, made some clear determinations regarding  establishing a macroeconomic control system. The plenary session  passed the Decision on Some Issues Regarding the Establishment  of a Socialist Market Economy System pointing out that  "establishing an improved macroeconomic control system with  indirect controls as the principle means will ensure the healthy  operation of the national economy" and "further conversion of  the operating mechanisms of state enterprises" and "establishing  a national unified free market system... is the basic framework  for a mutually related and mutually restraining, organic,  complete, and integral socialist market economy system. We must  establish corresponding legal systems and adopt feasible  measures centered on these important links to actively and  gradually totally advance reform and promote the development of  productive forces in society."    Establishing an Improved Price Control System is an  Urgent Task of Current Price Reform    In the new situation with the marketization of the Chinese  economy constantly increasing, in order to continue to promote  reform of the economic system, enhance and improve macroeconomic  controls, guard against dramatic price fluctuations, curb  excessive inflation, standardize market pricing , and achieve  equal competition, fair trade, and appropriate operations, we  must establish a complete and effective government control  system for prices. This new price control system should reflect  the demands of the market economy and controls should be focused  on maintaining an overall balance in the economy mainly by  macroeconomic controls and the object of controls should be the  entities and markets that determine prices mainly by indirect  controls. Control methods should use mainly economic means and  legal means augmented as necessary by administrative means.  Establishment of this kind of price control system should be a  gradual process of constantly enriching and improving the means  of control with the intensification of reform, strengthening  economic forces, and perfecting the legal system. It will  require a considerable period to be completed. We should base  ourselves on the current situation and take into consideration  the long-term, center on stable market prices and standard  pricing activities, and pay close attention to establishing  sound economic means and legal means to control prices. 1)  Establish a reserve system for important commodities such as  grain, cotton, and petroleum to prepare to engage in the market  to guarantee the needs of society when production and supply and  demand fluctuate. 2) Establish an adjustment fund for the prices  of grains and non-staple foods to be used to level prices when  large rises or large falls occur in the prices, and protect  production and protect consumption, and stabilize the economy,  and legalize the channels of sources and the orientation of uses  of the fund through legislative processes. 3) Sound pricing laws  and regulations to encourage competition and oppose monopolies;  protect legitimate profits and oppose windfall profits; protect  appropriate businesses and oppose cheating and gouging and  attack fake and inferior goods. Beginning in March of this year,  with the agreement of the State Council, the State Planning  Commission promulgated and implemented the Regulations for  Implementing Clearly Marked Prices for Goods and Services as an  important economic regulation to encourage fair market trading,  improve the transparency of pricing, and oppose deceptive  pricing. 4. Initiate price information services. Price  departments at every level should fully utilize current  information networks and in accordance with the needs of society  extensively collect, collate, and issue price information, and  in a timely fashion provide enterprises with the situation and  forecast trends on market supply and demand and prices for  various important commodities and in various different forms  such as engaging price advisors, special consultation, and  issuing publications, initiate price information services  leading enterprises to organize production and adjust business  orientation in accordance with market demands. 5) Enhance  enterprise policy direction and business training to help  enterprise administrative personnel master market business and  sales tactics and price decision skills, and improve their  professional qualities. 6) Conduct appropriate administrative  intervention for a few important commodities. For essential  capital goods and citizens' basic necessities that can easily  have price fluctuations, we should conduct necessary and  appropriate intervention distinguishing different situations. We  can respectively carry out price rise files, price rise  declarations, differential profit rate controls, and temporary  price limit measures. The recent State Council decision to  monitor the prices of twenty commodities and services that are  most closely associated with the lives of the masses is a new  move to stabilize people's lives and promote reform of the price  control system from key variety breakthroughs. It reflected the  principle of making indirect controls the mainstay and combining  economic means and appropriate administrative intervention to  control the frequency and extent of price rises and falls and  curb windfall profit activities, and it helps to keep overall  prices levels relatively stable. We should combine actual  conscientious implementation of various price monitoring  measures to better serve the overall situation of reform,  development, and stability.</p>

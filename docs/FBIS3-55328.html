Replying to reporters within the building of the Council of  the Federation, which held its first meeting here, Kostikov  noted that the sides would "negotiate comprehensively and  seriously" the relations between Russia and the United States.  He believes that the U.S. President will explain in greater  detail the American "partnership for peace" initiative. "Russia  has no reasons to keep aloof of this initiative," the press  secretary stressed. "It only remains to see to what extent its  implementation meets the national interests of Russia.    Kostikov described as sharp and prompt the Russian Foreign  Ministry's reaction to the unlawful actions of the Lithuanian  authorities against two Russian generals. He said that "at  present this reaction is adequate". "But the reaction of the  president and of Russia might be even tougher if such incidents  were to reoccur in the future, even very tough compared to world  precedents," the press secretary stated.</p>

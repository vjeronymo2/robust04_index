			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORY ON KEATING'S STAY IN COUNTY JAIL ILLUMINATING  </P> <P> The things you wouldn't know if you didn't read the Business section ("Keating  Got Star Treatment During Stay in County Jail," Oct. 20).  </P> <P> You wouldn't know that Charlie Keating's stay in the Los Angeles County Jail  was downright luxurious, compared to the accommodations offered lesser mortals,  despite his wife's tearful letter to the contrary.  </P> <P> I guess it all depends on what you're used to. As I remember, my last meal long  ago in the same jail was scrambled powdered eggs, if that is not a redundancy.  </P> <P> Overall, though, I would not trade places with Charlie. I was released  outright, eventually, after signing away my right to sue for false arrest.  </P> <P> My more militant friends were somewhat disappointed in me, but I was very tired  and very hungry. Caught a miserable cold, too. Ah, well, we are not all members  of "corporate America."  </P> <P> FRED SCIFERS, Downey  </P></p>

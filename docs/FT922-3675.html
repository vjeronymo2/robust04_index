			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Airbus turnover climbs 18% to DM5.1bn DEUTSCHE AIRBUS, one of the two biggest partners in the consortium that builds Airbus civil aircraft, saw turnover rise 18.3 per cent last year, to DM5.1bn (Dollars 3.2bn). Profits for 1991 were DM421m, compared with a 1990 loss of DM376m. Profits this year, however, would be lower than in 1991, warned Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, president, despite higher sales. He attributed the improvement mainly to higher deliveries of parts for Airbus and Netherlands aircraft company, Fokker, as well as cost-cutting. The company is retaining this year's profits to help rebuild equity capital and reserves. Mr Mehdorn said it had used international currency futures markets in an attempt to limit the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on its profits. Aircraft sold internationally are paid for in dollars and the Airbus programme accounts for 80 per cent of turnover. The company is 80 per cent-owned by Dasa, the aerospace division of Daimler-Benz. It has been trying to establish more Airbus production lines in Germany. It said final assembly of the new Airbus model, the A319, would 'strengthen the position of the German aeronautics industry in Europe'. Dasa will acquire the 20 per cent of Deutsche Airbus it does not own from the state-owned Reconstruction Loan Corp (KFW) in 1996.</p>

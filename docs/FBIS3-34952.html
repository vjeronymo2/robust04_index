It wished them all "every success in serving  the national cause in the context of their new options."  Meanwhile, Colonel Salih al-Habbuni, deputy commander in chief  of the "Libyan National Army" [LNA] (the NFSL's military arm),  and Lieutenant Colonel 'Abdallah Ahmad al-Shaykhi, that army's  chief of operations, have issued a statement criticizing LNA  Commander Colonel Khalifah Haftar, saying that he "has no right  to speak on behalf of the LNA" and that his statement was full  of "fabrications, prevarications, and false claims." They  stressed that the LNA "is a part of the NFSL's institutions."    The day before yesterday 15 NFSL members announced that they  were seceding from it. They included some leading members such  as Burayk Suwaysi, Col. Haftar, 'Abd-al-Majid al-Saghir, 'Umar  al-Fathali, and Yunis al-Fannush, and fund raisers such as  al-Hajj al-Sabir Majid and Husayn Sufraki. In a separate  detailed statement "in the name of the LNA's officers, warrant  officers, and soldiers," Haftar announced his withdrawal from  the NFSL and attacked its leadership "which has failed to rise  to the level of the challenge."    Al-Habbuni and al-Shaykhi issued a statement yesterday in  which they said: "The press carried (the day before yesterday)  a statement in the name of Col. Haftar on behalf of the LNA's  officers and soldiers making numerous claims and accusations  against the NFSL's leadership and in conclusion announcing his  withdrawal from the NFSL.... In view of the fabrications,  prevarications, and false allegations contained in that  statement, we have decided that it is our struggle duty as well  as our military and moral duty to disclose a number of things to  the public."    The statement added: "Col. Haftar has no right to speak on  behalf of the LNA which is one of the NFSL's institutions  founded by the joint will of all the officers, warrant officers,  soldiers, and fedayeen and by a decision of the NFSL's Permanent  Bureau on 21 June 1988."    It continued: "The characterizations and charges made by  Haftar against the NFSL and its leadership are unjust,  offensive, and unfounded.... By announcing his withdrawal from  the NFSL, Col. Haftar has lost his leadership status in the LNA  which represents the NFSL's armed forces and is one of its  institutions."    In conclusion, the statement emphasized "pride in the NFSL,  its role in the struggle, and its great and continuous efforts  in manifestation of the national will seeking to overthrow the  Libya regime and to replace it with a national, constitutional,  and democratic alternative..., and pride in being a part of it  and linked to its objectives, march, leadership, and legitimate  institutions."    It should be recalled that that those who split from the  NFSL  had issued two internal memoranda last August and November, the  first focusing on the need for internal reforms, criticizing the  internal and external methods of work, and calling for a  revision of the organizational frameworks. The second strongly  criticized NFSL Secretary General Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif for  claiming responsibility for the military mutiny which occurred  in Bani-Walid in Libya last October as a result of which, it  said, NFSL members at home were hunted down and arrested.    In December the NFSL's Permanent Bureau held a meeting  attended by some of those who announced their secession the day  before yesterday. It was agreed at that meeting that all the  observerations, criticisms, and differences would be referred to  the NFSL's National Council (the highest authority), which was  due to convene in a matter of months, but the continuation of  differences made it impossible to wait for that National  Council's meeting and has led to the present state of affairs.</p>

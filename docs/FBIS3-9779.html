ODS is the largest of the four coalition parties. The other  three are the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), the Civic  Democratic Alliance (ODA), and the Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL). Their chairmen met  on Monday to discuss the electoral laws, local and central  government reform, restitution and Jewish property issues.    Speaking on Czech Radio, Klaus said that the coalition  partners had different attitudes towards restitution and the  creation of parliament's second chamber, the Senate, the need  for which he said was "highly controversial." The third  problem, he said, was regional administrative arrangements.  "These opinions are truly different, and no amount of  communication can level them in any way," Klaus said.    The coalition would definitely find a compromise, he said.  However, everybody had to be aware that a compromise was not  "this or that smaller political party insisting that the problem  will be solved precisely the way it wants."</p>

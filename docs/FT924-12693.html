			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Poland's budget hit by rejection of pension cuts THE Polish parliament has rejected government plans to cut pensions in a blow to the cabinet's budget deficit reduction proposals before scheduled talks with the International Monetary Fund. The proposed pension cuts were designed to save 1,800bn zlotys (Pounds 74.3m) over the rest of this year and 23,000bn zlotys in 1993. They were central to the government's plans, agreed with the IMF, to keep the budget deficit within 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year and 5.5 per cent of GDP in 1993. The government's additional plans for a 3 per cent increase in turnover tax and a 6 per cent import surcharge to increase revenues by a further 23,000bn zlotys next year survived the preliminary vote in parliament. Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance minister, yesterday said that he would seek alternative cuts in housing, transport and agricultural spending to compensate for parliament's refusal to cut pensions. The spending cuts and higher taxes are part of a package discussed with the IMF which is hoping to sign a letter of intent with the Polish government by mid-November. Failure to cut spending on pensions will complicate talks with the Fund, but Mr Osiatynski signalled that the government would renew its attempt to rein in pensions growth next year. If successful, he said, the cost to the budget of the delay would only be 12,000bn zlotys. Agreement on a new 18 months' standby agreement with the IMF is essential if Poland is to press ahead with debt reduction talks with commercial banks to whom it owes Dollars 12.2bn (Pounds 7bn). It also needs an IMF agreement to be in place to receive a further 20 per cent reduction of western government debt in 1994 as part of the 50 per cent write-down in the Dollars 30bn official debt agreed last year. Meanwhile, the Central Statistical Office said that industrial output rose by 13.1 per cent in September compared with the same month last year and by 0.6 per over the first nine months of the year as a whole. The recovery of industrial output after two years of sharp decline was, however, accompanied by a renewed burst of inflation. Retail prices rose by 5.3 per cent in September compared with the previous month in one of the largest monthly increases for two years. The rise, fuelled mainly by mounting costs of food, brought prices to a level 34.1 per cent higher than the start of the year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Samih al-Sa'id, Asyut </F> Governor, by Sami Fahmi in Asyut; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]    Fahmi: What is the reason for the rising wave of  terrorism in Asyut?    Al-Sa'id: The tightening security fist in Asyut  and the tightening noose around the terrorists have led the  latter to resort to desperate terrorist operations. What is  happening in Asyut is similar to swatting a "wasp's nest," when  the wasps get irritated they will try anything. Everyone should  know that Asyut is now different than it used to be. The  Islamic groups do not hold activities in al-Rahmah Mosque, not  even weekly seminars. Extremist activities have been brought  under control. There are no longer marches like the ones that  were staged during the Night of Revelation or during the nights  that mark the first day of each Hegira month.    Fahmi: Does this mean that the security forces  start "the action?"    Al-Sa'id: The security organ is in control of the  situation. I do not know what you mean by the word "action."    Fahmi: I mean the security organ takes the  initiative by raiding the extremists and the terrorist moves are  merely a "reaction."    Al-Sa'id: What the terrorists are now doing is the  result of their bankruptcy.    Fahmi: How do you explain the calm in the  governorates neighboring Asyut (al-Minya, Suhaj) and the  inflamed situation in Asyut?    Al-Sa'id: There are historic factors to consider.  We cannot ignore the fact that the Islamic groups were first  formed in Asyut University in the late 1970's and this helped  them spread. There are also differences between the Islamic  groups. Some of the terrorist elements that are carrying out  terrorist acts in Asyut come from Suhaj, al-Wadi al-Jadid, and  al-Minya.    Fahmi: What helped the Islamic groups spread in  the 1970's, as you mentioned? Was there official support?    Al-Sa'id: I cannot answer because I was abroad at  the time.    Fahmi: Are the security organs, with their present  resources and power, capable of dealing with terrorism?    Al-Sa'id: The security forces are in control of  the situation all over the governorate. The security fist is  not concentrating on one area at the expense of another.  Security measures are being tightened everywhere. The security  organs are capable of handling this, but the support of the  people is necessary. The government is meeting the Interior  Ministry's demands within the limits of available resources.  [passage omitted]    Fahmi: Does the situation in Asyut require the  armed forces' help to safeguard the vital installations?    Al-Sa'id: The vital installations are secured  according to specific guidelines. There is the popular defense,  which plays a role in defending the installations. The military  counselor in the governorate leads the popular defense  operations in accordance with established plans and targets.    Fahmi: Some people are saying that armed forces'  intervention might be necessary to control the explosive  situation.    Al-Sa'id: It is my personal view that we will not  reach this point. I have great hopes for the popular action  that is confronting terrorism and the support being given to the  security forces in Asyut so that the situation will be decided  in favor of society's security and stability.

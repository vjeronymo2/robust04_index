			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (38): Wish you were here - Holiday club streamlines its mailshots WHO, these days, takes their time off in a holiday camp? Information technology staff of Holiday Club Pontins have started work on a system that will answer that question in exact detail, writes Claire Gooding. The survey's findings will rely not on popular mythology, but on the exact science offered by GB mailing, a postcode-based marketing database. Holiday Club Pontins - part of the Pounds 80m Scottish and Newcastle Leisure Division - runs clubs at 22 locations around the southern and north-western coast of the UK, plus outposts in Cork and Jersey. In the high season, its team of 400 staff can swell to more than 4,000. What is constant - according to marketing manager Pamela Knight - is the clientele: 'We do a great deal of long-term and repeat business. Our business is people; making sure they enjoy themselves is inherent in our company policy. Better service to our customers is a priority.' Part of this better service includes communicating with customers more effectively, in Ms Knight's words, 'making sure they get the information they require, at the time they require it, but not in duplicate.' A problem was that Pontins data contained and duplications and discrepancies that made it impossible to determine exactly who was who. Duplications were inevitable because of slightly differing occurrences of the same name at one address, sourced from holidays taken at different locations and times. Pontins sought a packaged solution that would work on the IBM AS400 computer  -which its information technology staff have used since 1987  - and found only one: GB Mailing. This product has enabled Pontins to make sense of its data with its technique of assigning a unique identification system, based on postcodes. GB Postcoder allocates the postcode to addresses, making sure that the mail qualifies for bulk postal discounts. The Addressplus facility even generates all the address details, bar house-number and addressee's name. Each system update, every six months or so, costs Pounds 1,000: the original price, at implementation in November 1991, was Pounds 11,495. Pontins uses the system only on its own data, drawn from past and current guests. The main benefits havebeen the improved accuracy of mailshots to the 750,000 names on the database, with the spin-off of telemarketing. Bookings over the phone are now much faster and easier for both Pontins and the customers.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: TRUMP'S DEBT, MARLA'S JEANS, ABC'S GOOD NEWS  </P> <P> THE HOT SKINNY free-floating over Atlantic City and the Isle of Manhattan has  it that Donald Trump went to his father, Fred, a man who is a success story in  his own right. Donald asked to borrow money for the current unpleasantness.  Papa Fred is said to have answered he'd lend on one condition -- Donald must  reconcile with Ivana!  </P> <P> Is this true? Well, it's what insiders say, though I wouldn't expect either  Trump the Elder or Trump the Younger to confirm it.  </P> <P> MARLA MAPLES shot her first commercial for No Excuses jeans in an idyllic  country setting Tuesday in Connecticut. She has decided she really wants to  make her life in New York and is now expressing an interest in a singing  career.  </P> <P> Can Marla sing? She says she can and that she inherited the talent from her  dear father.  </P> <P> THE CURRENT craze for big occasions is to make a video tribute for the subject  being honored by having best pals, family, and the famous or infamous say a few  words. The Donald Trump 44th birthday celebration in Atlantic City last weekend  was no exception and one who gave Donald a friendly needle was the  controversial comic Andrew Dice Clay.  </P> <P> Trump reportedly hopes to put Clay into one of his big entertainment rooms on  the Jersey shore. But some who were at the party, attended by Fred Trump,  skipped out of the room during Clay's diatribe. They said it was "Soooo  vulgar."  </P> <P> Fortunately, Donald's splendid mother, Mary, was not there; she is recovering  from a broken leg.  </P> <P> ABC won lots of nice publicity from its affiliates meeting last week in Los  Angeles, with dignified and welcome pronouncements, such as the fact that David  Brinkley is staying on. (Thank goodness!)  </P> <P> But what the network also garnered was lots of unexpected, unwanted,  undignified laughter from the affiliate honchos when they saw a sneak preview  of "Cop Rock." This is the new dramatic musical series from the gifted "L.A.  Law" and "Hill Street Blues" creator Steve Bochco. Actors actually break right  into song in the middle of this epic about cops. And those who have seen it,  can't believe what they saw -- and heard.  </P> <P> BEVERLY SILLS has a new job; she will write at least three articles a year for  McCall's dealing with her zest for life and her very interesting opinions. Yes,  she can write. too.  </P></p>

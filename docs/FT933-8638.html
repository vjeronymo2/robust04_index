			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Letter: The allegiance and faith that keep Belgian federalist state alive Sir, In his account of his recent visit to Belgium ('A king and his people: Belgium's late monarch was a rare symbol of national identity', August 11) Edward Mortimer gives ample space to the raving views of a Mr Sweron, an obscure schoolmaster who belongs to the far-right political spectrum and whose opinions do not in any way reflect those of the average Belgian citizen. Most Belgians reject separatism along ethnic or linguistic lines, a fact proven by recent opinion polls. Their dignified sorrow following the death of the king has demonstrated their profound allegiance to their country. It is this and their faith in our new federalist state which keeps Belgium alive, and not some obscure capitalistic conspiracy in Brussels as Mr Sweron would have it.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A meeting of Belarusian and U.S. officials at the  Defense Ministry level began in Minsk today. Delegations from  the two countries will discuss a number of acute problems facing  Belarus. These problems, first of all, concern difficulties  Belarus is encountering in dismantling military equipment and  the need to reclaim and return land that was cleared following  reductions in our own troops and the withdrawal of foreign ones.  According to our information, the U.S. delegation has come to  Minsk with a package of proposals which can be used to adopt  measures aimed at resolving the above-mentioned problems. The  results of the meeting will be made known in a week's time.</p>

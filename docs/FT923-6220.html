			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Oil export bribes for Russian managers RUSSIAN officials and oil managers have taken more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 50.2m) in bribes for irregular exports of the country's most precious natural resource in the first half of this year alone, anti-corruption officials said yesterday. Colonel Vyacheslav Soltaganov, head of the Interior Ministry's economic crime department, said new-style trading companies were paying bribes of Dollars 2 a tonne of oil to facilitate the unlicensed export of petroleum products. Such practices, which could affect about 10 per cent of Russia's oil exports, were particularly rampant in Tyumen, Russia's richest oil-producing area. Col Soltaganov said Rosnefteproduct, the biggest state oil-refining company, was under investigation for irregular sales to former Soviet republics which resulted in parts of Russia being starved of oil products. Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the government's anti-corruption commission, said small-scale rackets at individual petrol stations, usually the focus of public indignation, often diverted attention from swindles at higher levels. But a crackdown on one such case in the town of Surgut in Tyumen region helped uncover a case of local oil enterprise managers selling oil at half the fixed state price to 'commercial structures'. These new-style businesses in turn paid kickbacks to the managers, who were in effect working for them. Mr Gurtovoi also said that managers at Nizhnevartovskneftegaz, the biggest oil and gas enterprise in the Tyumen district of Nizhnevartovsk, were under investigation after 1.5m tonnes of oil were found to have been put aside for unofficial sales. These cases are only the tip of the iceberg of Russian oil corruption. A prime cause of the corruption is the continuation of controls on the domestic oil price to protect industry and agriculture. Officials said Russia's lack of proper borders with the former Soviet republics made smuggling difficult to police, with oil frequently being shipped across to the Baltic republics and then re-exported for hard currency. The Russian government's anti-corruption commission has been placed directly under Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, to free it from political pressures. Mr Gurtovoi said the commission, which would remain funded by the government, would find it easier, for instance, to investigate the Economics Ministry, under whose tutelage he has been under until now.</p>

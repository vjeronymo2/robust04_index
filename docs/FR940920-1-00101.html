			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Date of for submittal of permit modifications, if necessary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Date for ordering the pollution control device(s);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Date for delivery of the major components of the air pollution control device(s);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Date of initial site preparation for installing the pollution control device(s);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Date for commencing installation of the pollution control device(s);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Date of initial startup of the air pollution control device(s); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Date for the initial compliance test(s) of the air pollution control device(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The date associated with each of these incremental steps in a compliance schedule would be established on a site-specific basis, by the State air pollution control agency. Furthermore, submittal of the State plan would be required to include performance test results for dioxin/furan emissions for those MWC units with a compliance schedule longer than 1 year from the date of approval of the State plan. These tests results would be required to have been measured no earlier than 1990 and would be considered by a State in developing a facility's compliance schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the event no plan for implementing the emission guidelines is adopted, all MWC units covered by the guidelines would be required to be in compliance with the guidelines no later than the date 5 years after the date of promulgation of these guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of recent concern about dioxin/furan and Hg emissions, the proposed emission guidelines require State plans to include an accelerated compliance schedule for compliance with the emission limits for these two pollutants for one subset of MWC's. Under the accelerated schedule, existing MWC units for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after June 26, 1987 and that are located at large MWC plants would be required to be in compliance with the proposed dioxin/furan and Hg emission guidelines within 1 year following issuance of a revised construction or operation permit, if a permit modification is required, or within 1 year following approval of the State plan, if a permit modification is not required. On June 26, 1987, the EPA issued operational guidance to State and local agencies for best available control technology (BACT) determinations for permitting of both new and modified MWC's, pursuant to the new source review (NSR) provisions of the Act. This operational guidance has resulted in all new MWC's at large MWC plants permitted since June 26, 1987 being constructed with an SD/ESP or SD/FF control system. As discussed in section IV.F.1 of this preamble, control of dioxins/furans and Hg is based on the combination of an acid gas/PM control system and a carbon injection system. Since all MWC units at large MWC plants permitted since June 26, 1987 have been subject to NSR and are, therefore, already equipped with the appropriate acid gas/PM control devices for dioxin/furan and Hg control (i.e., SD/ESP or SD/FF), the EPA concluded that it would be reasonable to require that carbon injection be retrofitted to these MWC units according to an accelerated schedule in order to achieve additional dioxin/furan and Hg emission reductions as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, compliance with all operator training and certification guidelines would be required by 1 year after the date of promulgation of the emission guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All reports submitted under this rulemaking would also be required to be maintained as part of these records. All the information contained in these records would be made available to enforcement personnel upon request. All required records would be required to be maintained for 5 years following the date of such records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reporting and recordkeeping requirements in the proposed emission guidelines are necessary to inform enforcement personnel of the compliance status of existing MWC's. In addition, the records would provide the data and information necessary to ensure continued compliance of these MWC's with the emission guidelines. At the same time, these requirements have been structured so as not to impose an unreasonable burden on MWC owners or operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

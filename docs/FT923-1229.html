			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Greenwell Montagu absorbed in Hongkong Bank rationalisation JAMES CAPEL, the investment house owned by Hongkong Bank, is to absorb the private client stockbroking business of Greenwell Montagu Stockbrokers with the loss of up to 150 jobs. The move, to take effect next January, is part of the rationalisation following the merger of Hongkong Bank and Midland. Mr Bernard Asher, director of HSBC Holdings, said Greenwell's business was 'substantial in revenue terms but not enough to make it profitable.' Putting the two sides together would lead to 130-150 redundancies among Greenwell's current 220 staff, he said. The move will in effect mark the final demise of the once-proud name of Greenwell, one of London's top brokers before Big Bang. The new business will be known as 'James Capel, incorporating W Greenwell,' said Mr Asher - in practice relegating the Greenwell name from view. As part of the break-up of Greenwell, Smith Keen Cutler - a private client broking part of the group based in Birmingham - is to be sold to Allied Provincial, a stockbroker in which Capel owns 24 per cent. The smaller company and corporate finance teams of Smith Keen Cutler is to join Capel.</p>

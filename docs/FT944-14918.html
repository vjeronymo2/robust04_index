			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (2): Facing commercial reality - Robert Corzine finds British Gas in an aggressively confident mood Last month British Gas topped off a turbulent year by unveiling a much-delayed presentation on its strategy to the end of the decade and beyond. Gone, according Richard Giordano, chairman, was the old British Gas, a public utility whose 'mindset was driven first and foremost by the obligation to serve . . . at any cost if necessary'. In its place will come a new British Gas, a 'dynamic and commercially astute' company which will dramatically restructure its domestic businesses over the next few years. This should ensure sufficient cash flow to fund a big international expansion which will begin to pay off in the next century. Gone too, says Mr Giordano, will be a corporate culture determined to 'fight dogged regulatory battles to defend a proud past'. For British Gas's would-be competitors in the UK gas market, Mr Giordano's statement and similar comments from Cedric Brown, chief executive, offered a reassurance that Europe's 13th largest company would no longer stand in the way of the introduction of domestic competition. But the comments also contained an implied threat that British Gas would not idly stand by and see its domestic market share eroded, as has happened under regulatory pressure in the liberalised market for large commercial and industrial users. Last month's presentation also offered evidence that the 'strategic paralysis' that gripped British Gas in recent years as senior management fought pitched battles with its regulator, has receded, along with what Mr Giordano described as the 'regulatory fog'. The result is that the company has been confident enough to map out a coherent way forward. What is less clear, however, is how successful it will be in implementing such a radical realignment. There is little doubt that senior management is determined to overturn the corporate culture of a long-standing monopoly. A root-and-branch restructuring of the company means that 25,000 employees - a third of the workforce - will be made redundant over the next three years. Employee morale, aside from the handful of executives and managers who know they will have a job after the re-structuring, is low. Some employees say management has been surprised by the large number of highly-skilled individuals who intend to accept voluntary redundancy, rather than subject themselves to further uncertainty. For most of those who do undergo and survive the current programme of having to re-apply for their jobs, there will no longer be the prospect of a job for life in the highly hierarchical, command and control environment of the old British Gas. In the coming months thousands of employees, especially those in the public gas supply division that deals directly with the public, will undergo extensive training sessions to prepare them for a commercial environment. In addition, the five domestic divisions will be recruiting people with marketing experience outside the gas industry to help ensure that a commercial culture takes hold. Mr Brown was adamant at the strategy review that 'there are no sacred cows at British Gas'. The managing directors at each of the business units know they must 'transform' their companies to suit the new commercial realities, or face a fate that senior executives have not spelled out, but which industry observers say is the threat of divestment. Speculation is most intense about the future of the public gas supply, the unit which provides 18m households with gas and which will face the brunt of the competition once the domestic market is opened. Mike Alexander, PGS managing director, says he is preparing the division for an extended period of uncertainty. The intense competition his division is likely to encounter when the domestic market is fully opened in 1998 means PGS staff numbers, set to fall from 11,300 currently to 9,600 by 1996, may face even deeper cuts. The present Gas Act forbids British Gas from divesting the unit, but Mr Brown made it clear that month that if the company's competitors have the right to restructure their businesses, 'then so should we'. The outlook for other parts of the company is generally more upbeat. TransCo, the pipeline and storage division remains a regulated monopoly. It is the main repository of British Gas' technical skills and assets. It will also be the 'main cash generator in the short to medium term', according to Mr Brown. The exploration and production arm of the company has a steeply rising UK production profile that will support the growth of corporate cash flow to the year 2000. The UK operation will also help to underwrite the company's growing efforts to discover and develop mainly gas reserves in other countries. Many of the those upstream developments will be linked to downstream ventures in which British Gas intends to apply its UK skills and experience to gas distribution or gas-fired power generation schemes worldwide. Many of these will be in fast-growing developing economies, especially in Latin America and Asia, according to company executives. The company expects such international activities to be the main engine of growth in the early years of the next century. But as the company's top executives acknowledged last month, the success of the long-term strategy is dependent on the company being competitive and profitable in its fast-changing UK markets for the foreseeable future.</p>

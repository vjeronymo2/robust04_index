			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEIR GOLDEN MEMORIES ABOARD ROYAL SCOTSMAN  </P> <P> Gena Reisner's story, "Scotland By Train" (April 2), was most interesting,  especially (in mentioning) the Royal Scotsman. In celebration of our 50th  wedding anniversary, my wife and I took the six-day tour. Words cannot describe  the luxury of this train. We had a stateroom, including all private facilities.  The dining car was used by Earl Haig in World War I. The train includes  carriages from the late Victorian and Edwardian periods and is limited to 28  people. And side trips to such things as historic sites and castles not open to  the public are arranged. It is about $9,000 per couple for the six-day tour,  but everything is included. We consider the food the best of any train in the  world, and excellent wines are served. A red carpet is rolled out and you are  piped aboard the Royal Scotsman at Waverley Station in Edinburgh for either the  three- or six-day trip into the Scottish Highlands. For further information,  contact your travel agent or Abercrombie &amp; Kent International, 1420  Kensington Road, Oak Brook, Ill. 60521, (800) 323-7308.  </P> <P> THOMAS McQUATTIE  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

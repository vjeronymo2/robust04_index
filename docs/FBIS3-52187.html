At the meeting, Mr. Niyazov thanked the officials of the  Islamic Republic of Iran for their warm hospitality and  explained that the aim of his trip to Iran is to benefit from  our country's successful experiences and to find new ways for  expanding bilateral relations in a new era of cooperation  between the two countries.    The president of Turkmenistan emphasized the religious,  cultural, and historical features shared by the two countries  and noted that Iran is a country with an ancient history and  civilization. He said: Turkmenistan wishes to have wider  cultural links with the Islamic Republic of Iran. He expressed  the hope that Turkmenistan's cultural experts will use the  existing historical and cultural works in Iran's libraries and  educational centers to compile that country's history.    Mr. Niyazov said in connection with the Ashgabat meeting:  With the establishment of a climate of friendship and  understanding between neighboring and regional countries, the  growing trend of cooperation between Turkmenistan and the  Islamic Republic of Iran will also accelerate.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, for his part, referred to the  composition of Turkmenistan's high-ranking delegation and said  that this delegation's trip provides a good opportunity for  fulfilling the aims of widening relations between the two  countries.

The president pointed to the existence of land and sea  borders between the two countries in the Khorasan, Gilan, and  Mazendaran Provinces, adding: These provinces, which have  suitable natural and geographical features, can play a  fundamental role in the growth of trade and economic exchanges  between the two countries. He stressed the role of the joint  commission between the two countries in the development of  relations and cooperation and noted the need for the creation of  facilities in the area of transport and travel for the purposes  of exchanges of views and experiences between commercial and  economic experts of Iran and Turkmenistan.    The talks were also attended by the two countries' ministers  of foreign affairs, culture, commerce, post, telegraph and  telephone, transport, and agriculture, and a number of other  officials.

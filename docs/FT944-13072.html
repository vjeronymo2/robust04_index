			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Vox shareholder hurdle cleared Vox, the ailing German private television station, yesterday cleared another hurdle on its way to recovery when four state television authorities approved the channel's new shareholder structure. However, final approval rests with the remaining 12 state television authorities who still have not agreed to the new ownership. Vox, based in Cologne, was launched at the beginning of 1993 but failed to attract viewers because of an unattractive programme mix. The six original shareholders fell out and the channel went into liquidation on April 1. After months of negotiations with Bertelsmann, the German media group which has been the driving force behind Vox, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation took a 49.9 per cent stake in the station in early July. Bertelsmann holds 24.9 per cent and Canal Plus, the French station, holds a further 24.9 per cent.</p>

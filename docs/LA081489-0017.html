			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Imprisoned soul singer James Brown has lost the 20 days off he had earned for  good behavior after officials found $40,600 in cash and checks in his Columbia,  S.C., jail cell, authorities said. Inmates are allowed no more than $50 in the  prison. Corrections officials took $600 of the cash for the Inmate Welfare Fund  and the Internal Revenue Service has already spoken for the rest, saying it  will be applied to an $11-million lien against Brown. The soul singer is  serving a six-year term for assault and leading lawmen on a high-speed chase.  </P></p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC fishing off Canada suspended THE EUROPEAN Community, in an attempt to placate Canada, said yesterday it would suspend fishing in waters just outside Canadian territorial waters, reports Reuter from Brussels. Canada says EC fleets fishing in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland are partly to blame for a drastic depletion of its fish stocks. The European Commission said that it had 'decided to stop the main fishing activities of the EC fleet in the zone administered by the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation'.</p>

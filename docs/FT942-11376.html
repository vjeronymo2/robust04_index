			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Respite for dollar as markets wait for jobs data The US won some respite in its battle to defend the dollar yesterday as many investors took to the sidelines ahead of the release of important US April jobs data today. The dollar was firmer in quiet trading on the foreign exchanges, with some traders clearly chastened by Wednesday's concerted round of intervention by more than 15 central banks to back the ailing US currency. 'The market's clearly taking a pause to see what happens with the (jobs) numbers,' said Mr Steve Geovanis, head of foreign exchange trading at Merrill Lynch in New York. In late trading in New York, the dollar was up just over 1 pfennig against the D-Mark at DM1.6665 and nearly Y1 at Y102.835. Dealers said the market appeared to have established a temporary 'floor' for the currency at DM. 6550 and Y102.50. The consensus among observers was that while the intervention had succeeded in breaking the bearish dollar psychology, supportive policy measures in the form of lower German interest rates, higher US rates and market access measures in Japan, would be necessary to turn the dollar around. Traders said the Golden Week holiday in Japan - markets were closed from Tuesday to Thursday - had contributed to the success of the intervention as trading was thinner, making it less expensive for central banks to achieve their purpose. Today, the focus will be on the US employment report. Dealers think that there is a chance the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to support the US currency and prevent the economy from overheating if the figures show strong growth in jobs. Weak figures, however, could throw the dollar into renewed difficulties. US Treasury prices rose slightly yesterday, but gains were limited by concern about the weak dollar and another possible monetary policy tightening.

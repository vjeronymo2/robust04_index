			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Court rules on income plans RELATIVES of the victims of home income plans will be allowed to continue to claim compensation even after the death of a victim, the High Court ruled yesterday. Investment bond home income plans were sold in the late 1980s, mainly to elderly people as a way of releasing income from their homes. The schemes involved taking out a mortgage and investing in equity-linked bonds. The value of these bonds fell as the stock market performed poorly and mortgage rates increased. In cases where the risks of the schemes were not explained victims can receive compensation from the Investors Compensation Scheme to a maximum of Pounds 48,000. Barnett Sampson, the solicitors, which represents 450 home income plan cases, had sought a judicial review of the stipulation that a claim ceased when the victim died.</p>

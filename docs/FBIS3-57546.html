He recalled that Moscow had not agreed to sign such a treaty  before Georgia resolved its differences with South Ossetia and  Abkhazia by political means. Georgia, however, has not even  started an equal political dialog with those republics, Khugayev  thinks.    He believes that Russian support for an indivisible Georgia  "will give a free hand to chauvinist forces in Tbilisi." He did  not rule out the possibility that, once the treaty was signed,  Georgia would resume military pressure on South Ossetia and  Abkhazia.    Lyudvig Chibirov, head of the South Ossetian parliament who  also attended the interview, made it clear that the people of  the republic would hardly agree even to a confederation within  Georgia.</p>

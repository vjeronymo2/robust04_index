We helped them to  prepare the first groups, the first organizations, through  ecclesiastic movements and social pastoral activities, which  helped them to organize, to become aware, and to become capable  of reasoning in such a way as to identify and defend their  rights."    He denied the report circulating in political circles that  the Church contributed financially to the campesino march.  "Neither the CEP nor any diocese did this formally. I do not  know who disseminated this rumor. Some lay organizations of  some parishes or the campesino movements themselves may have  made contributions out of solidarity, which I believe is totally  normal. In addition, campesinos are sufficiently mature to  manage on their own," the bishop said.    He termed as "interesting" the solidarity that the  campesinos  received from other sectors. He added: "To a certain degree,  some solidarity was expressed by opportunists. After the  campesinos made the effort to gather in the interior and get to  Asuncion, they encountered here in the capital some political  and other groups that offered their solidarity. The power  groups had the possibility, and even the obligation, to seek  some kind of solution to this economic and social situation,  which is not new."    He indicated that seeking a solution does not depend only on  the president. "Congress and the judicial branch are also  responsible. We need an improved judicial system and more  guarantees in this sector. The drafting of budgets should also  be improved. In addition to the lack of appropriate payment for  products, there also a deficit in providing fundamental  requirements: Education, roads, schools, health, and  communications. All of these need resources from the budgets.  The institutions that deal with budgets say they do not have  the resources. A responsibility is to be found there."    "To support the campesinos also means relying on an  appropriate legislation to collect resources from the people who  have more, and other legislation to recover ill-gotten gains and  put them at the service of the common welfare. This could have  been done by the power groups, who could have begun this task  immediately so that the solidarity with the campesinos could  have been expressed with concrete facts to help them," he  concluded.</p>

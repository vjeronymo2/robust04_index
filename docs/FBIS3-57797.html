Atun  noted that every effort will be exerted for the government to be  successful within the framework of the protocol and that  effective work will be carried out for the happiness and  prosperity of the people. He stated that exposing  irregularities, which have caused concern among the political  parties and the people, will be one of the government's  priorities, adding that the new government will make sure that  the state serves the people in an effective and affectionate  manner. Atun said that they are determined to defend the Cyprus  cause in cooperation with Turkey and the interests of the people.

A consensus  will be required in the decision making process. The  characteristics of the two communities will be reflected in  every level of the joint administration, including the system of  a rotational presidency.    The protocol maintains that the coalition government  believes  it is beneficial for the leaders of the two communities to hold  contacts within the process of the intercommunal talks in a bid  to achieve intercommunal rapprochement and to increase mutual  trust. It adds that the president will continue his position as  negotiator.

The section under democratization notes that the 1976  election and referendum bill will be democratized. It adds that  the Bayrak Radio and Television [BRT] administration will also  be democratized and autonomy will be secured in line with the  BRT law, that the establishment of private radios and television  channels will be made possible and that the necessary  arrangements will be made to secure the sound and extensive  participation of civil servants in political life.

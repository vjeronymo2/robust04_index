			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] The constitutional reforms issue has promped a  dispute between different congressional factions. Members of  the opposition charge the issue of extending the deputies' term  prompted a delay in the adjournment of the congressional  sessions, but independent deputies claim the one has nothing to  do with the other.    [Begin unidentified independent deputy recording] The  adjournment of the congressional sessions, or a continuation of  the sessions during a special period, have absolutely nothing to  do with an extension of the deputies' term or their immediate  re-election. We were emphatic about this, and those of us who  participated in a political dialogue between Social Christians,  conservatives, and independents said we will never discuss a  transition period that may extend current deputies' term or lead  to their immediate re-election --nothing that might benefit  current individual deputies will be approved. [end recording]    The new majority seems to have scattered and constitutional  reforms have been abolished for the time being. If the special  period of sessions ends without discussing the reforms, they  will be discussed on another occasion, starting from the  beginning.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA April 27. -- Both Vietnam and Indonesia  share the same aspirations of creating Southeast Asia as a zone  of peace, freedom and neutrality, a region with a high rate of  growth and prosperity as well as a region that ensures the  well-being of every citizen, said President Suharto in his  speech at the banquet, he gave in Jakarta yesterday in honour of  President Le Duc Anh's official visit to Indonesia.    The Indonesian President continued: `It is precisely the  same  aspiration to create a peaceful and prosperous region that serve  as the bases of the struggle of the member-states of ASEAN. In  this context, we are highly appreciative of Vietnam's  participation as an observer and of its seriousness to establish  cooperation in many areas with ASEAN.    `Due to the our experience during more than a quarter of  century and to the strong solidarity among ASEAN member-states,  we have been able to preserve stability and security in  Southeast Asia, even though the pattern of international  relations is undergoing fundamental changes. ASEAN is trying  its best to stress on the importance of settling a dispute  through peaceful means. We can reduce the potential conflicts  in our region by continuing to hold discussion aimed at  enhancing mutual trust. Conversely, we have to see to it that  these different potentials can be used as beneficial assets for  our cooperation'...    President Suharto went on:    `I am sure the Vietnamese Government also sees the many  opportunities that can still be developed through a close  regional cooperation covering various aspects of the economic  development. In this spirit, I am highly encouraged by the  economic cooperation in various sectors that have been  established so far.    `However, I also believe that there are still many areas  that  we can work together. There are still opportunities available  in the trade relation and cooperation, capital investment,  financial services and other areas.    `The basis of our economies are complementary. Our two  respective governments attach great importance to the creation  of a healthy business climate. Enterpreneurs in both countries  are very eager to expand their economic scopes. All of this  convinces me that Vietnam and Indonesia can develop cooperation  as dependable and mutually beneficial economic partners.    `The future close relationship between our two countries is  further strengthened by the close bonds of friendship between  both Vietnamese and Indonesian officials. Such close  relationship and mutual trust are important in the efforts to  impartially settle a number of issues affecting the bilateral  relations between Vietnam and Indonesia.    `As neighbouring countries that share the same historical  affinities, I sincerely hope that we can conclude the ongoing  negotiation in a satisfactory manner, particularly on the issues  of the continental shelf boundary and repatriation of  non-refugees. I am convinced that based on the good-intentions  that have been demonstrated by both parties so far, we can  achieve a satisfactory result'.    In reply, President Le Duc Anh said that the Vietnamese  people had forever borne in mind the Indonesian people's  wholehearted support for their just struggle for national  reunification.    The Vietnamese leader continued:    `At present the Vietnamese and Indonesian people have common  desires to build Vietnam and Indonesia into prosperous  countries, and Southeast Asia a region of peace, stability and  cooperation. This is the firm basis to constantly consolidate  and develop the time-honoured friendship and cooperation between  the two countries, and made it become the everlasting friendship  as stated by President Ho Chi Minh 35 years ago when he visited  Indonesia'.    After hailing the great achievement recorded by the  Indonesian people in the past 25 years under the leadership of  President Suharto, President Anh said:    `In its capacity as president of the Non-aligned Movement,  indonesia has made positive contributions to a Southeast Asia of  peace and cooperation and to a stabler and more prosperous  world. Indonesia thereby, has an increasingly important role to  play in the region and the world. Vietnam strongly supports  Indonesia's positive activities, and stands side by side the  Indonesia for a long lasting peace and prosperity in the  region'. [sentence as received]    `We have always treasured and constantly strengthened the  relations of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation with  countries in the region on the basis of bilateral and  multilateral cooperation. We are satisfied at the fine  development of the Vietnam-ASEAN cooperation. As observer in  ASEAN, Vietnam is trying its best with support from all ASEAN  member countries to early become full member of the  organization. We hold that this conforms to the benefits of the  two parties and to peace, stability, cooperation and development  in the region'.    `I believe that my visit to Indonesia would contribute to  further promoting the friendship and all-sided cooperation  between the two countries in the interests of the two nations  and for the sake of peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity  in Southeast Asia and the world as a whole', he concluded.</p>

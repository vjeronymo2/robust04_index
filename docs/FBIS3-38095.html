			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] I will either not vote at all or vote against it,  because nobody has defined the subject of the voting, former  Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich told an RID  correspondent immediately after receiving his ballot for voting  on three chapters of the Belarusian draft constitution. The  point is that this is the wrong way to vote. It would be better  to vote on separate chapters, and even better on separate  articles. If the voting concerned separate articles, I would  approve about 20 of them, the ex-speaker added. Asked why he  did not join the statement signed by 40 deputies who refused to  participate in the voting, Stanislav Shushkevich responded that  he was simply not informed.</p>

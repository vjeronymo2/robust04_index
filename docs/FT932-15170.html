			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Caribbean goes shopping for citizens: Canute James sights Far Eastern businessmen looking for a haven A DISTANT ramification of the diplomatic skirmish between Britain and China over the future of Hong Kong is being felt on the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica, where citizenship is 'for sale'. Dominica has been casting its net throughout south-east Asia for the past year, in an effort to entice, with the offer of passports, new 'economic citizens' in exchange for investments. Businessmen from the Far Eastern British colony have been visiting. The prospective citizen pays the government USDollars 25,000, which goes into a trust fund, and makes an initial business investment of not less than Dollars 35,000 in a venture producing for export and employing Dominicans. The country is not alone in making an eastern Caribbean pitch for wealthy citizens. The government of St Kitts-Nevis plans to sell several hundred passports to residents of Hong Kong, who appear concerned about the future of the colony when it comes under Chinese control in 1997. St Kitts-Nevis officials say they will not grant more than 3,000 'economic citizenships' and that many of those who qualify would not live in the twin-island country, which has a population of 50,000 people. However, the phantom immigrants would have a haven in case of need. In the same region, the government of Antigua is studying a similar programme to attract investors from the Far East. An official said the administration favours issuing economic visas, as in Canada. To the west across the Caribbean, Jamaica has launched a programme to attract 'business migrants', to draw both their professional skills and their money. The programme was launched in Hong Kong but the Jamaican government says it is willing to consider applicants from any country. Jamaica has stipulated no minimum investment, but preference will be given to prospective migrants willing to commit no less than Dollars 100,000 in ventures creating local jobs. Indirect investors will also be favoured, if able to put Dollars 100,000 in a venture capital fund, in non-transferable government bonds for at least 10 years, or in approved private joint ventures. A successful applicant will receive resident status and a passport, and will be able to apply for Jamaican citizenship. There is, however, concern over the consequences of some of these programmes in the Caribbean's labour-surplus economies. There is little to prevent an investor shutting up shop on one island when his tax holiday - one of the many incentives - has expired and starting anew in a neighbouring country. Government spokesmen in Grenada say they have turned down requests for special citizenship for Hong Kong residents. Besides the extra strain of an influx of new citizens on a social and physical infrastructure already overstretched, their presence could affect external financing of island economies. Many eastern Caribbean governments have complained repeatedly and bitterly about the tendency of international financial institutions and aid agencies, applying per capita income criteria, to place their countries outside the category of those entitled to cheap loans. The presence of a few well-heeled economic citizens could push the island economies even further away from soft-money windows.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Merrill Lynch races to top spot - International The dramatic about-turn in sentiment in fixed-income markets this year from bull to bear has been accompanied by a changing of the guard among the top eurobond houses. The most notable development has been Merrill Lynch's charge up the league table from ninth position in mid-1993 to top position, capturing almost 10 per cent of the market on the way. According to data supplied by Euromoney Bondware, Merrill Lynch lead-managed the equivalent of Dollars 18.6bn worth of eurobonds from January to June, compared with Dollars 7.3bn at the same stage last year. In spite of difficult market conditions, total volume in the first half of this year only fell to Dollars 195bn from Dollars 210.6bn at the same stage last year. News last week that Italy had appointed Merrill as the global co-ordinator of its Dollars 4bn floating-rate note offering denominated in dollars, yen and D-Marks highlights the efforts the bank has made to expand the number of currencies in which it can underwrite offerings. For example, Merrill recently arranged a Pounds 200m offering of 10-year eurobonds for Austria, its first eurosterling mandate since becoming a market-maker in UK gilts earlier in the year. Changes in personnel have also contributed to the higher profile at J. P. Morgan, up five places to seventh, at SBC, up from 15th to ninth place, and at ABN-Amro, the Dutch bank, which has risen from 23rd to 16th position. Mr Jon Greenwood, who left Goldman Sachs in February to join ABN-Amro as head of syndicate and new issues, says the increased primary market business has come about as a result of the unification of the fixed-income, equity, derivatives and treasury departments into one group. The bank also wants to establish its reputation as a multi-currency house rather than as a domestic guilder operation. Mr Greenwood says the bank's target was to become one of the top dozen eurobond houses. Among the casualties in the first half were the German banks, with Deutsche Bank falling from first position to sixth, and Dresdner Bank, which has slid a staggering 13 places to 18th. Syndicate managers blame Dresdner's performance on its dependence on the D-Mark sector, which only accounted for 7.7 per cent of total volume in the six months, down from 14.6 per cent in the first half of 1993. Nomura, the powerful Japanese securities house, has dropped from sixth to 10th place, though over-dependence on the yen would be a poor excuse since the currency accounted for 13.5 per cent of the total volume, up from 9.9 per cent last year. Salomon Brothers has failed to build on the success of last year when its return to the top 10 confirmed its rehabilitation with borrowers and investors after the Treasury auction scandal of 1991. Its fall from seventh to 14th position reflects a certain degree of bad luck, since volatile market conditions scuppered mandates from Hungary and the Japanese Development Bank, while hopes of doing a deal for Turkey were blown by a deterioration in investor sentiment towards the country. However, some observers have interpreted Salomon's lower profile as a confirmation that, despite its recent efforts to promote itself as a long-term player, it is still a trading house at heart and therefore reluctant to pitch for business in a bear market. Syndicate managers are hopeful that the second half of the year will continue to produce the large mandates which have persisted despite the fall-out in the bond markets. Although several frequent borrowers, such as the Province of Ontario, are well ahead in their funding programmes, others are not yet in such an enviable position.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TOP EUROBOND LEAD MANAGERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      First half of 1994        First half of 1993 Manager        Dollarsbn  Rank  %   Issues Dollarsbn  Rank  %   Issues  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Merrill Lynch      18.60    1   9.54    80     7.31     9   3.47    32 Goldman Sachs      13.50    2   6.92    52    14.08     2   6.69    50 CSFB/Credit Suisse 12.56    3   6.44    44    10.32     4   4.90    42 UBS                 8.50    4   4.36    25     7.34     8   3.49    35 Morgan Stanley      8.47    5   4.34    52    10.33     3   4.90    37 Deutsche Bank       8.47    6   4.34    37    16.91     1   8.03    52 JP Morgan           7.70    7   3.95    31     6.62    12   3.14    32 Lehman Brothers     7.11    8   3.65    31     7.02    10   3.34    46 Swiss Bank Corp     6.28    9   3.22    31     5.15    15   2.45    23 Nomura              6.27    10  3.21    42     7.40     6   3.51    29 Industry totals   195.02       100.0  1042   210.62        100.0   965  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Full credit to book runner Source: Euromoney Bondware  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROBOND ISSUES BY CURRENCY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994*                 Total      No. of    1993*    Total     No. of Rank   Currency      raised      issues     Rank    raised    issues                    (Dollarsbn)                    (Dollarsbn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  1     USDollars       79.81      367         1      75.34      374  2     Yen             26.39      209         5      20.88       92  3     Sterling        20.49       88         3      25.20      119  4     FFr             17.78       62         4      22.24       83  5     D-Mark          14.94       56         2      30.83       82  6     CDollars         9.27       71         6      17.63       96  7     Lire             9.10       70         8       5.90       39  8     Guilder          6.90       39         7       6.31       27  9     Ecu              4.93       19         9       3.23        9 10     ADollars         2.84       36        10       2.05       24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *First six months Source: Euromoney Bondware  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

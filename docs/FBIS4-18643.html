			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In view of the latest conflicts  between industrialized and developing countries about  international trade advantages in the Third World, FRG Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany)  warned against undeserved forms of new protectionism. At the  Marrakesh meeting of the 121 GATT countries (from 12 to 15  April), he will call on the trading partners to solve these  problems in a discussion, which should be characterized by  mutual understanding, says a statement by Rexrodt, who is  currently in India, which was published in Bonn on Thursday [7  April].    The interrelations between trade and environment as well as  trade and labor or social standards are highly political fields  of negotiation, which are extremely sensitive for the developing  countries. The minister had already come out against social  dumping and against sanctions to have trade advantages of the  developing countries reduced, e.g. in the textile sector, which  they get because of their relatively low wages.    The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has called on  the Federal Government to follow the United States and agree to  the new World Trade Organization, WTO, the successor of GATT,  only if certain minimum standards for working people's rights  are agreed beforehand. SPD Deputy Hans Buettner stated: "Free  trade union work, the right to freely negotiable minimum wages,  as well as a minimum of labor protection are the precondition  for a fair exchange of goods and services."</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> BRUINS SWEEP PAST CAPITALS AND INTO FINALS, 3-2  </P> <P> Andy Moog and the Boston Bruin defense put the finishing touches on a four-game  sweep of the Washington Capitals Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The Bruins limited Washington to 14 shots at Moog, including only three in the  third period, as Boston advanced to the Stanley Cup finals for the second time  in three years with a 3-2 victory, completing a sweep of the Wales Conference  finals.  </P> <P> "Our defense was great and Moog was virtually flawless," Boston Coach Mike  Milbury said. "Washington didn't get any second or third chances."  </P> <P> "They were the better team," Washington Coach Terry Murray said. "I wish we had  played the way we did in the first two series, but there was no question that  they were better."  </P> <P> The Bruins, whose last postseason sweep occurred in 1979, will face the  Campbell Conference champion, either Edmonton or Chicago, in the finals. It  will be the Bruins' 17th trip to the championship round. Their last appearance  was in 1988, when they were swept by the Oilers. They won the last of their  five Stanley Cups in 1972.  </P> <P> After accepting the Prince of Wales Trophy, Boston captain Ray Bourque promised  this year would be different from 1988.  </P> <P> "We've got a better club this time," Bourque said. "We've got a lot more speed,  a great defense, and we're playing with a lot of confidence."  </P> <P> Boston took a 1-0 lead on John Carter's goal 53 seconds into the game, made it  2-0 on Cam Neely's power-play goal late in the period, then turned things over  to Moog and a defense that ended up allowing Washington three goals over the  final 202 minutes of the series.  </P> <P> "They're the team to beat," said Washington's Nick Kypreos after the Capitals,  making their first appearance in the Stanley Cup semifinals, were swept for the  first time in 13 playoff series.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] The Majles met in open session yesterday and the  deputies from Noshahr and Chalus, Hashtrud, Barkhar, Mimeh and  Tehran gave speeches. Likewise at this session more than 180  deputies condemned the siege of Gorazde by the Serbian criminals  and the deathly silence of the UN and some Western nations in  the face of these crimes. We direct the attention of our  esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  Farjollah Afrazideh, Deputy From Noshahr and Chalus </H5>   The Majles should spend half its time supervising the  implementation of laws.    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Afrazideh, deputy from Noshahr and Chalus.    [Passages omitted on criticism of UN and Russian role in  Bosnia.]    Afrazideh discussed the public's liking for the president of  the republic and the nation's reconstruction after the war and  the earthquake, which is not such an easy task. He said: In  these conditions of economic adjustment, only the capable hand  of the president of the republic can put the country in order.  The general public knows that inflation and high prices are not  just in countries, but throughout the world.    He then said: One thing which must not be forgotten,  however,  is that there is no correspondence between incomes and the cost  of living in our country. The wage-earning and low-income  classes in society are particularly severely beset, and their  living expenses are absolutely not being met. Even more  overwhelmed than these two groups are those who have no jobs  with which to meet their living expenses.    This is especially true in the municipality of Noshahr as a  result of the unpredictably harsh environmental conditions which  are completely unreasonable by any standard. There are not many  factories to employ all these people with high school diplomas  and less and with bachelor's degrees. They are unemployed, and  one of the big problems we deputies have is the many requests  from these young people for jobs. If some basic thinking is not  done to employ them, the country will be afflicted with  thousands of kinds of corruption and affliction.    Continuing, the deputy for Noshahr and Chalus said: One of  the nation's important problems is that the government has given  the flatterers a free hand so that anyone can suck the blood of  the poor and oppressed people to fill his pockets as much as he  wants and through any means. Not the least thing has been done  to control prices.    Up until the end of the year 1372 [20 March 1994] a kilogram  of sugar or sugar cubes was 70 tumans and a package of number 16  nails was 350 tumans. The people are asking us, how is it that  in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], with foreign  exchange rate fluctuations overnight the price of a kilogram of  sugar or sugar cubes increases to 140 tumans and a package of  No. 16 nails goes up to 1,100 tumans, yet there are thousands of  tons of sugar, sugar cubes and nails in the warehouses? Without  any trouble, their owners instantly added billions of rials to  their wealth and no one said a word to them.    He added: My recommendation is first of all that in cases  like this the president of the republic order the assets of  these profiteers and economic terrorists confiscated through the  judicial system, as an object lesson to others so that no one  will dare overcharge society's deprived and oppressed people  this way. Second, the government should use all its power to  control rates in some way so that goods will be sold at the same  price throughout the country. Right now, 50 stores will have 50  different prices on the same street.    He continued:    In short, one cannot run a country with sermons, advice and  `my dear, my dear.'    Continuing, the speaker condemned the cronyism, flattery,  superficiality, and hypocrisy that have become prevalent in our  society and also find receptive audiences. He said: The existing  situation must be conveyed to the hearing of officials.  Inappropriate optimism and saying that everything is good will  only tempt and deceive the officials and it will have dangerous  consequences.    He criticized the programs of the Vision of the Islamic  Republic and recommended that the programs feature scholars from  Qom Seminary like Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, Javadi-Amoli,  Makarom-Shirazi and other scholars, and, from the universities,  people like Dr. Javad Larijani and other great people as hosts,  and that basic and important religious questions and answers be  raised.    The deputy from Noshahr and Chalus said: Although the Fourth  Majles has taken positive steps in several areas, this is not  enough. In my view, instead of spending all this time on laws,  the Majles should spend half its time supervising the  implementation of laws and see how much waste, dissipation, and  embezzlement of the public treasury exists in the government  organizations.    In conclusion, the speaker called for laws that will solve  the important problems of society. As an example he mentioned  passing the "Where Did You Get It?" law so that those people can  be legally prosecuted who committed many crimes during the  revolution, through trickery, deception, and aligning themselves  with this or that faction, and their assets can be confiscated  in the interest of the deprived and the oppressed.  <H5>  Ghaffar Esma'il, Deputy From Hashtrud </H5>   The people expect the government to deal decisively with  violators and to precisely control prices.    The next speaker was Esma'il, deputy from Hashtrud. During  his speech he discussed the secret collusion by NATO officials.  He said: The fear of an independent Islamic nation in Europe has  led those in the Security Council and their NATO allies to stoop  to any disgrace. The situation has become so shameful that  peacekeepers were taken hostage by the Serbs and nothing changed.    He praised the consolidation of the ministries of industry  and expressed the hope that the existing malaise in the nation's  industry will end and that it will be the basic focal point for  alleviating the economic problems of the government and the  people. The exalted leader's 13-point publication must be the  focus of the Second Five-Year Plan. In must be considered in the  framework of statistics and figures, and a comprehensive plan  must be compiled using the experience of the First Five-Year  Plan and its strengths and weaknesses.    He added: Paying subsidies in the existing way is not just.  Those who are better off benefit that much more from the  subsidies on some goods, and the proper procedure should be the  opposite. Rural people are deprived of the subsidies given to  those living in the cities. The procedure adopted in the Second  Five-Year Plan must be such that the most deprived people in  society enjoy the most subsidies and those who are prosperous  will pay the real price of basic goods and the subsidies on  energy and fuel.    The deputy from Hashtrud emphasized: An unavoidable  necessity  is to review the method of collecting taxes and adopt proper  procedures for creating reliable sources of revenue for the  government and prevent inflated revenues. It is also necessary  to invest in the education and training sector in training  committed and skilled manpower, and developing education and  training centers in the agricultural sector, which are the main  focal points of economic development.    Despite the high added-value in the agricultural sector  compared to the other sectors and its vast resources, we still  do not market enough products in this sector for domestic  consumption. Yet the least investment of all the sectors is  required to create employment in this sector, because by  allocating to agriculture only 8 percent of all the nation's  infrastructure investment, it will account for about 24 percent  of the nation's gross revenues and 28 percent of its employment.    Continuing, Esma'ili said: The revolution people expect the  government to deal decisively with violators and the financially  corrupt, and to precisely control prices. I thank the president  of the republic for seeking to stabilize prices and for taking  steps in this area. The people and the Majles will clearly  support these measures.    I ask the economic council to expedite implementation of  pricing legislation. Clearly, one of the major factors in high  prices is the lack of conformity of supply to demand. For more  supply there must be more production and less consumption.    Continuing, he discussed the solution to high prices. He  said: To accomplish this there must be a proper public  consumption and distribution model, and there must be a culture  of work and a work ethic, which is one of the basic and crucial  principles of our dear leader's guidance. The culture of work  and economizing must be planted as a value in the hearts and  minds of each of the people like a fruitful sapling. The people  must understand its importance and its reward as something akin  to going to the war fronts. Instead of thinking about their  personal interests and earning incomes from brokerage and false  employment, which is one of the major factors in inflation, they  must think about national interests and work.    Esma'ili then emphasized the problem of unemployment in the  country. He said: In this sensitive time of manpower adjustment,  privatization, factory closures, and high inflation, and the  fact that our workers are seeking work in other countries, the  general interest of the country requires that Afghan workers be  returned to their own country so that in addition to not  creating numerous forms of corruption, they will not snatch the  few existing jobs from Iranian workers. In this situation with  high prices, Iranian workers must not be left with nowhere to  turn.    He then thanked the minister of agriculture for his visit to  the exalted leader's projects in Hashtrud, and he praised the  minister of energy's attention to providing water service to the  region, and he praised the chief of the Plan and Budget  Organization and the minister of roads and transportation for  creating the Hashtrud beltline road.  <H5>  Mohammad Reza Naseri-Dowlatabadi, Deputy From Barkhar And </H5> Mimeh    Is it in our interest, in the name of economic prosperity  and  without regard for the struggles of the people, that we should  impose the pressures of inflation and high prices on the  vulnerable classes?    The next preagenda speaker was Naseri-Dowlatabadi, deputy  from Barkhar and Mimeh. During his speech he said: Today  humanity is aligned against free thinking, especially that of  the Muslim nations. These international criminals are attacking  the Muslims of the world, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and Palestine. No clear position is taken against the racists,  and, despite the signing of the nongenocide treaty, genocide and  mass killings continue. This adds another black page to the  record of the world's lying monopolizing human rights  organizations. It is not clear how they will answer history for  the crimes at al-Khalil and Gorazde in Bosnia. Today the human  rights war is being waged against those who generally seek to  act independently in the world.    The speaker discussed the anniversary of the martyrdom of  Martyr Motahari and the arrival of Teacher Day, and he mentioned  the cultural invasion. He said: First of all, I am astonished  and dismayed that a nation with this cultural background is  unable to stand up against the enemy cultural invasion by using  the potent and effective tools that are embedded in the heart of  its Islamic culture. Why should a country be worried about a  cultural invasion that has this vast education and training and  higher education system, which embraces 20 million people? This  means that one in every three Iranians is directly involved with  education, teaching, and training.    In the same regard he added: Isn't it time for our  researchers to study and determine the reason for this bitter  truth that our education and training and higher education  officials and planners are unable to create the necessary  incentives for our elementary school children, high-school  adolescents, and university youth? If the educational  organizations do not move positively based on the psychological  needs of the young generation, we will move farther from our  goal.    Continuing, Naseri said: Is it in our interest, in the name  of economic prosperity and without regard for the capability of  the people to struggle, that we should impose the pressures of  inflation and high prices on society's vulnerable classes?    Continuing, he discussed Worker Week. He said: The necessary  leverage must be provided to support this class, and basic steps  must be taken to solve their problems. If this is not possible,  one must live simply, as they do, to increase their tolerance  for poverty.    The speaker discussed the exalted leader's New Year's  message. He said: A look at the government offices, which are a  government family of several million, and at the useful work  hours, puts us in a state of uncertainty and anxiety. We must  study what volume of personnel foreign offices and companies use  to produce several times more than what we produce. Don't hidden  unemployment, corruption and administrative bribery damage the  spirit of the revolution and threaten its future?    The deputy from Barkhar and Mimeh discussed the fact that  America's fate will be no different than that of the Soviet  Union. He discussed the water conference in Oman, attended by  the Zionist regime's experts. He said: Although the  aforementioned conference is apparently about water, its goals  are in line with imperialist efforts to establish peace between  the Arabs and Israel. Experts predict that an arms conference  will soon be held in Qatar, attended by Israel and several  Islamic nations. The existing situation shows that Israel, more  than ever since its inception, is coming closer to the world of  Islam and the borders of the Islamic heartland.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must therefore do the  necessary planning and adopt a systematic policy to thwart the  negative effects of this inauspicious alliance in the history of  the struggles of Muslim combatants.    Continuing, Naseri said: I recommend that in the matter of  eliminating social subsidies we seek the views of the people, to  make it possible for them better to participate in their own  destiny.    I also ask the respected president of the republic and the  Council of Ministers to provide the necessary tools to obtain  the views of the Majles in adhering to the principle of  economizing, which is the message of hope in the 1373 budget. It  is the duty of the Majles to use its legal resources to support  the government.    Some of the executive officials must avoid useless  extravagance and pointless gratuities from the public treasury,  using government resources and printing advertisements of  congratulation and condolence with the government's general  budget. The continuation of what has been happening in recent  years and the waste is a cause for serious concern. If the  important principle of economizing is observed by the government  leaders, the people will also be inclined to economize, for "the  people follow the religion of their rulers."    In conclusion he thanked the management in his electoral  precinct and the executive, military and police officials,  especially the office of the governor and the traffic control  forces in his electoral district for securing and watching the  exit and entry routes during the New Year's holidays. He issued  memos to the minister of power concerning the completion of the  Barkhar water canal project, to the minister of petroleum  concerning gas service, to the minister of agriculture  concerning agricultural self-sufficiency and to the minister of  the reconstruction crusade about rebuilding and asphalting the  Barkhar and Mimeh rural connective roads, and he asked that the  above problems be dealt with.  <H5>  Sa'id Raja'i-Khorasani, Deputy From Tehran </H5>   We should be trying to prevent waste and extravagance.    The final preagenda speaker was Raja'i Khorasani. In his  speech he offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of  His Holiness Imam Reza (peace be upon him), and he discussed the  regrettable situation in the city of Gorazde. He said: The  criminal West, on various pretexts, brought about the occupation  of Gorazde, and it really refused to use the military leverage  it had available, and we strongly condemn this inadequacy that  we see in the Western nations, especially in the Security  Council.    He added: We must not forget that in this regard the sins of  the Russians are no less than those of the Westerners and the  Americans. I remember when the Security Council's forces took  formal action against one or two Serbian tanks, the Russians  immediately expressed concern, asking why this was done without  their knowledge.    The deputy from Tehran then discussed the problem of high  prices in the country. He said: I must ask the officials not to  present pointless analyses about high prices. It is not quite  correct to say that the small percentage of our budget and  public treasury being used for subsidies is not reaching the  right people. Is this because a small percentage of our people  are quite wealthy and do not deserve these subsidies?    If we look at the masses of the people in our country, we  see  that everyone is suffering from the high prices, and these small  subsidies that are being given do not require all this debt  infliction. We should be trying to prevent waste and  extravagance. If the officials are telling the truth, let them  look at how economical the development projects have been that  were carried out. Weren't some of them carried out at two or  three times what they should have cost?    Dr. Raja'i-Khorasani then noted: If there is really a proper  policy in effect concerning self-sufficiency, it should be  pursued. We must give the good news as soon as possible that the  production line for these experimental models, which were built  have gone into operation. We must try to end our need as soon as  possible for items being purchased, for which some very  inadvisable things have been done.  <H5>  Legislation </H5>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the single-consultation Bill on the Government of  the Islamic Republic of Iran's Membership in the Islamic  Insurance Investments and Export Credits Company and the  Purchase of 5,000 Shares of the Aforementioned Company Valued at  5 Million Islamic Dinars, of which Article 1 was approved by the  deputies.    Article 1: The government is authorized to join the Islamic  Insurance Investments and Export Credits Company affiliated with  the Islamic Development Bank and to be a charter subscriber to  5,000 of its shares, valued at 1,000 dinars each, or $130  million, and to add to the company's future investments with the  approval of the Council of Ministers.    The second item on the agenda was the report from the second  consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs  Commission on the Bill Exempting Nursing Retirees From the Age  Requirements for Retirement Given in Note 1, Article 2 of the  National Retirement and Compulsory Service Law Regulations  Amendment Law, of which Article 1 was approved.    Article 1: Nursing Retirees, on the condition that they have  at least 20 years service in the aforementioned employment, are  exempt from the age requirements given in Note 1, Article 2, of  the National Retirement and Compulsory Service Law Regulations  Amendment Law, enacted 12/13/1368 [3 March 1990].    The third item on the agenda was the report from the Housing  and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill  Authorizing the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran To  Join the International Maritime Rescue Convention, and this bill  was approved by the Majles.    The next item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs  Commission concerning the Bill Amending Article 8 of the Iran  Handicraft Industries Organization Charter, the general form of  which was approved.    Based on Article 1 of this bill, the chief of the Plan and  Budget Organization and the minister of the reconstruction  crusade, respectively, are added to the general assembly of the  Iran Handicraft Industries Organization.    The final item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Bill Forming Rural Water and Sewage  Companies, continued consideration of which was postponed to the  next session.  <H5>  Letter From More Than 180 Majles Deputies Condemning the </H5> Siege of Gorazde by the Serbs    Once again one of the greatest human tragedies has taken  place in the heart of so-called civilized Europe, and oppressed  Gorazde in Bosnia and Herzegovina is burning in a ring of fire  and blood as the result of the crimes of the aggressor Serbs.  The oppressed cries for mercy from innocent children,  defenseless women and besieged men can be heard through the  vicious flames and Serbian crimes.    For two years the Serbs, armed to the teeth and with a clear  green light from the Unied Nations and criminal America, with  the support of the Russians and with the deathly silence and  implicit approval of most of the European governments, have  besieged this oppressed city. Periodically, using a heavy  arsenal of firepower and even chemical weapons, they have  flattened and bloodied its defenseless residents.    The United Nations, which claims to support peace and  security for this city, made a false claim of creating a safety  zone, giving the oppressed people of this city a false sense of  security, yet on the other hand it completely insists on  continuing the arms embargo against the oppressed Muslims of  Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the face of all these clear crimes by  the criminal Serbs and the clear violation of international  regulations, it has adopted an approving silence and it will not  even condemn these crimes verbally. With this encouragement, the  criminals have continued with their crimes.    The UN Security Council has opposed the proposal by Islamic  nations, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, that they join  the UN peace-keeping forces, and in practice they have given the  bloodthirsty Serbs a free hand to commit any kind of crime.    The tragedy in Gorazde is clear evidence of shame for the  United Nations and the Western governments claiming to support  human rights, and it is a blot of shame on the history of  humanity, which took place and in the proximity of the European  neighbors of Bosnia and Herzegovina.    We Majles deputies announce our regret at the occurrence of  such a human tragedy. We condemn the United Nations, the  secretary-general, and the governments supporting and  encouraging the Serbs for their approving silence in the face of  all these crimes. In obedience to the orders of the exalted  leader, we declare our full readiness to give any kind of aid  and assistance to the oppressed and defenseless people of  Gorazde in Bosnia and Herzegovina.    Signed by 180 deputies</p>

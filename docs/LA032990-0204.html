			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIZ CLAIBORNE TO OPEN STORE IN SOUTH COAST MALL  </P> <P> The Liz Claiborne label, already a common sight in local department stores, is  about to get its own home at the South Coast Plaza.  </P> <P> Mall officials said Wednesday that Liz Claiborne, a designer name most closely  associated with upscale women's wear, will open a store under its own name in  the mall this August.  </P> <P> The store will carry perfumes, shoes, accessories, and women's and men's  apparel.  </P> <P> Besides the main store, Liz Claiborne will also operate a smaller outlet at the  mall, called First Issue, featuring more casual women's wear.  </P> <P> The landing of Liz Claiborne is in keeping with mall's recently announced plan  to add more glitzy, Beverly Hills-type stores while weeding out smaller, less  profitable operations.  </P> <P> As part of its long-range plan, the mall is undergoing the most extensive  remodeling in its 23-year history.  </P> <P> The planned Liz Claiborne store is also a part of the trend among successful  designer labels to open their own outlets even as department stores in the same  shopping centers continue to offer their merchandise.  </P> <P> Under the most recent agreement, Liz Claiborne plans to open a  11,552-square-foot store under its own name on the mall's second floor between  Carrousel Court and the May Co. department store, said South Coast Plaza  spokeswoman Maura Eggan. The First Issue store will occupy 4,531 square feet.  </P> <P> The main outlet will be the 10th in a chain that started last April with the  opening of the first Liz Claiborne store in Novi, Mich., near Detroit, said  Deirdre Deutsch, director of the training and market development for Liz  Claiborne in New York.  </P></p>

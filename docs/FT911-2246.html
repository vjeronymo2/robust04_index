			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift held back by US offshoot NU-SWIFT, the fire protection and office services group, reported marginally lower profits of Pounds 31.17m for 1990. The outcome, which compared with taxable profits of Pounds 31.83m in 1989, came on turnover of Pounds 342.31m (Pounds 444.26m). About Pounds 99m of the fall was attributable to the disposal in February 1990 of its holding in Sicli, the French fire extinguisher company. As reported at the interim stage, net profit on the disposal was taken as a below-the-line credit of Pounds 115m; this generated interest receivable of Pounds 22m by the year-end. UK operations showed improved profits of Pounds 6.08m (Pounds 5.99m), but National Cleaning, the US offshoot, encountered 'difficult trading conditions' in the second half and contributed Pounds 6.36m (Pounds 8.88m). Favourable currency fluctuations, however, helped reduce financing costs of the operation to Pounds 5.44m (Pounds 6.36m). Nu-Swift currently holds a 27.7 per cent stake in London Securities, the property group, and investments taken out through the joint venture were expected to show both revenue and capital gains in the future, directors said. Earnings per 5p share emerged at 42.18p (36.85p) and a proposed final dividend of 10p lifts the total by 3p to 18p. The company's shares will move from the main market to the USM on May 7.</p>

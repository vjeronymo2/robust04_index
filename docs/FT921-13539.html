			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Appointments: Commercial Union takes on optimist and critic COMMERCIAL UNION is expected to confirm this week the appointment of Chris Pountain, Morgan Stanley's widely respected insurance analyst. Pountain, 38, who will take over the deputy group planning and corporate finance position, has a reputation for being very bearish about the prospects of the UK composite insurers. CU, arguably the most successful of the UK composites, is setting something of a trend with the appointment of another outsider to a key management post. Late last year Cees Schrauwers rejoined CU after a spell at Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, to take over as general manager for the com-pany's non-life business. Like Pountain, Schrauwers has been a critic of the UK insurance industry's sluggishness. CU has also appointed other insurance analysts: Peter Rice and Alan Clifton having joined the company from County NatWest and KitKat and Aitken respectively. Pountain, who joined Morgan Stanley from County NatWest in 1989, started his career at Scottish Widows.</p>

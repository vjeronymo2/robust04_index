			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SOPHISTICATED OBSERVERS CAN BE LED ASTRAY BY IRRELEVANT SIMILARITIES. IN FACT,  THE ABILITY TO REASON WELL BY ANALOGY MIGHT BE A RARE TALENT.;  </P> <P> ANALOGIES;  </P> <P> ILLUMINATING OR ILLUSIVE?  </P> <P> Learning how electricity works can be a challenge. One helpful trick is to use  an analogy: electricity flows through wires in much the same way that water  flows through pipes. Batteries and switches can be thought of as pumps and  valves. A good analogy allows people to see that a new problem resembles an old  one that has already been solved.  </P> <P> Cognitive psychologists, however, are finding that using analogies, or at least  using them well, is surprisingly difficult. Experiments reveal that good  analogies can be elusive and bad ones seductive.  </P> <P> Cornell University psychologist Thomas Gilovich has shown how poor analogies  can influence decisions. In one study in the Journal of Personality and Social  Psychology, Gilovich asked professional sportswriters to evaluate fictitious  college football players on the basis of short biographies. Players were rated  higher when they were described as coming from the same hometown as a famous  professional player.  </P> <P> This result shows that even sophisticated observers can be swayed by an  irrelevant similarity. The fact that a college player and a professional have a  common birthplace does not mean they are likely to be analogous in other areas,  such as football skill.  </P> <P> Gilovich, who is also in charge of graduate admissions for the  social/personality psychology program, thinks this kind of shallow analogizing  is a part of everyday life. In college admissions, he says, a certain applicant  might "remind you of someone who was a disaster or someone who was a terrific  star." Once the analogy is made, it will bias the candidate's rating even if  the analogy was based on irrelevancies such as accent or hair style.  </P> <P> No one is immune to unsound reasoning. Recent studies have shown that even  world leaders have been misguided by weak analogies. Deborah Larson, a UCLA  political scientist, has studied Harry Truman's relationship with Joseph  Stalin. At their August, 1945, Pottsdam meeting, Truman remarked to an aide,  "Stalin is as near like Tom Pendergast as any man I know." Pendergast was a  Missouri machine boss who helped get Truman elected to the Senate.  </P> <P> For some superficial reason -- maybe the way both Stalin and Pendergast would  pound their fists on a table -- Truman saw the two men as analogous. According  to Larson, Truman concluded that, like Pendergast, Stalin was a man one could  deal with, a man of his word. "It led Truman to believe," says Larson, "that  Stalin would hold free elections in Eastern Europe." U.S. foreign policy in  this case was shaped in part by a president's idiosyncratic and shallow  analogy.  </P> <P> While slipshod analogies are all too readily used, another line of research is  showing that good analogies can be almost impossible to spot. University of  Michigan psychologist Mary Gick and her colleague Keith Holyoak, now at UCLA,  asked people to solve the following problem:  </P> <P> Suppose you are a doctor treating a patient with an inoperable stomach tumor.  Although there is a kind of ray that will destroy the tumor, if it is intense  enough to do the job, it will also destroy the healthy surrounding tissue. At  lower intensities, the ray is harmless to all tissue, including the tumor. How  can the patient be saved?  </P> <P> Before seeing this radiation problem, some subjects read about a general who  wished to capture a dictator's fortress. Though the general had enough troops  to win, all roads leading to the fortress were mined. The mines would be  detonated by the weight of a large column of soldiers, but a small platoon  could pass safely. The general devised a simple plan. He divided his troops  into small groups and sent them to the heads of the roads that led to the  fortress. At a prearranged signal, the troops began to march. The army  converged on the stronghold and vanquished the dictator.  </P> <P> The doctor's quandary in the radiation problem is analogous to the problem  solved by the general. Once this is seen, the general's solution can be recast  in medical terms: A number of low-intensity rays could be aimed at the tumor  from different directions. These beams would damage no tissue except the tumor,  where their effect would add up.  </P> <P> When given a hint to use the general's solution, most people were able to solve  the radiation problem. But surprisingly, when no hint was given, only one  person in five used the analogy to solve the problem.  </P> <P> Outside the psychology laboratory -- where people people are not sensitized by  being part of an experiment -- analogies may be even harder to spot than that.  Two Temple University psychologists found that virtually no one notices the  analogy if unaware that the two problems are part of the same experiment.  </P> <P> So what does it take to get people to use a good analogy spontaneously?  Clobbering them over the head with it seems to do the trick, as Holyoak and  Richard Catambrone of the Georgia Institute of Technology have recently shown.  </P> <P> Subjects in their experiment first read two analogous problems and answered  questions about how the solutions were similar. Next, subjects solved a third  analogous problem using what they had learned from the first two. Finally, one  week later, a fourth analogous problem was given to the subjects, who were  unaware they were in the same experiment. Under these conditions, a large  majority of people were able to solve the problem.  </P> <P> One reason a good analogy can be so hard to discover, says Holyoak, is that  people rely on superficial details more than logical structure.  </P> <P> To support this notion, Holyoak and University of Michigan psychologist  Kyunghee Koh asked people to read a new problem and its solution: The broken  filament of a fragile glass light bulb is mended by several weak lasers aimed  from different directions. Afterward, people tried to solve the radiation  problem.  </P> <P> In contrast to the earlier experiment featuring the general's problem, most  people who read about the light bulb were able to make the analogical leap and  solve the radiation problem without being told to use the light bulb problem.  The reason, says Holyoak, is that the two problems are more similar at a  superficial level. Both involve kinds of rays and a delicate substance -- glass  or tissue -- that must be protected.  </P> <P> It would be comforting to think we could do better than Holyoak's and  Gilovich's subjects, or, for that matter, Harry Truman in his appraisal of  Stalin. One approach that might help, says political scientist Larson, is to  pay closer attention to the causes of events. For example, she argues that it  is inadequate merely to note that Nicaragua is analogous to Vietnam from the  U.S. point of view. To avoid errors, we must go one level deeper. "We lost  Vietnam for certain reasons," Larson says. "Do those reasons hold in  Nicaragua?"  </P> <P> Another political scientist, Yuen Foong Khong of Harvard University, is more  pessimistic. "We are beholden," he says, "to the things we are familiar with."  Khong, who argues that policy makers of the '60s were misled by a bad analogy  between Vietnam and Korea, says that one pitfall that might be avoidable is  getting stuck with the first analogy that happens to come to mind. To this end,  Khong suggests, "you might want to let a hundred analogies bloom. Take all  contesting analogies seriously and see what happens."  </P> <P> Still, there is no foolproof recipe for sound reasoning. In fact, the ability  to reason well by analogy might be a rare talent. William James, one of the  founders of psychology, might have had it right when he wrote a century ago: "A  native talent for perceiving analogies . . . (is) the leading fact in geniuses  of every order."  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (23): Why Japan is looking east - A new trend JAPAN'S MOST ambitious contractor and developer, Kumagai Gumi, is selling off European buildings as fast as buyers can be found, and the country's aggressive brokers are trimming their London staff. The portents are clear: the era of rapid Japanese expansion in Europe is over. Like the stock market surge in the late 1980s and the country's domestic capital spending boom, the Japanese expansion into international locales was propelled by low-cost capital and high-powered ambitions which distorted companies' expectations for return on their investment. The slump in stock prices, the slowing of the domestic economy and the general need for a restructuring of bloated financial and manufacturing companies have encouraged the Japanese to concentrate on their profitability at home and to be selective about extending their operations abroad. There is one exception, east Asia, which promises growth rates which Europe and the US cannot match. The Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan says that banks are reducing their overseas assets and branches, and reviewing their management structure. However, there is expansion in China and other fast-growing economies. Bank of Tokyo last month received approval from the Vietnamese government to open a representative office in Ho Chi Minh City. It will be the first of its kind to be opened by a Japanese bank, but certainly not the last. Japanese companies have targeted the country as a medium-term, low-cost site for component supply to manufacturing industry. In contrast, the Industrial Bank of Japan has cancelled plans to establish a broking subsidiary in the US, in spite of having made a formal application in March 1991. IBJ, which is expanding into the domestic securities business this year, found the US government's requirements for banks entering a new business unduly cumbersome. The contraction by financial institutions has been particularly noticeable among second-tier brokers and local banks, which developed ambitions beyond their means in the late 1980s. Okasan Securities has shut its Frankfurt office, Sanyo Securities has closed a Los Angeles operation and Dai-Ichi Securities has left Milan. Even the larger Japanese brokers are reviewing their exposure in Europe. Nomura Securities, the largest broker, cut its London staff by 35 late last year, and has closed three European offices. Nikko Securities has closed four overseas branches in the past year and may streamline further. But Nikko says that London remains an important financial centre. Similar sentiments are expressed by other Japanese institutions in spite of the recent Bishopsgate bombing. Though the offices of Tokai Bank were badly damaged by the blast, it still says that a presence in London is necessary. It has reviewed its security arrangements, as has Mitsubishi Bank, which says that terrorism in London is one reason to send fewer Japanese expatriate staff. Earnings are a more important influence than terrorism. Japanese companies have reported three successive years of falling profits and can no longer afford the prestige-inspired expansion characteristic of the late 1980s. With capital costs higher at home and a fourth year of falling profits looming, the emphasis of new investment is on maximising returns. Asia appears to provide the most fertile ground. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry found the average return on Japanese investment projects in Asia is 3 per cent, compared to 1 per cent in Europe and -0.1 per cent in the US. The differences are even more stark for the return on manufacturing investment, which is reckoned to be 5 per cent in Asia, 3 per cent in Europe, and -0.9 per cent in the US. Over the last two years, Asia's share of new investment has risen from 12.4 to 14.3 per cent, while the UK share fell from 12 to 8.6 per cent. The Japan External Trade Organisation believes that, in 10 years' time, it will be 'impossible' for manufacturers to produce their components at home, as the cost will be too high compared to that of other countries in the region with an increasing pool of skilled workers.</p>

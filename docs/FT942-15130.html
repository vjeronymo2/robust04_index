			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilts regain some gloss - Government bonds have had a rocky year. Sara Webb explains why Gilt investors have had a nasty shock, given the sharp fall in the UK government bond market so far this year. But private investors who own gilts should keep their cool, while those wondering how to obtain a relatively high income might again consider buying gilts now that yields have bounced back to such high levels. The shake-out in the gilt market in 1994 has taken many people by surprise. The decline in inflation during the 1990s paved the way for a gradual lowering of UK interest rates, prompting a rally in gilt prices and an accompanying decline in yields. By the end of 1993, yields had reached a low and many investors and analysts were wondering if scope remained for further cuts in the base rate or whether the rally was running out of steam. In fact, during the first quarter of 1994, the gilt market has tumbled for a variety of factors. John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, says: 'Bond markets were ready for a correction: based on fundamentals, gilts were looking expensive and there was an excessive degree of optimism in the market.' Second, the US Federal Reserve sent a shock wave through the world financial markets by raising short-term interest rates on February 4, and again on March 22. This action was meant as a pre-emptive strike against inflation as US economic growth gathered pace. But it led to a sharp sell-off in US Treasury bonds and in European government bond markets. A further reason was the fickle nature of many big investors who pulled out when things turned sour. The UK government's large borrowing programme required heavy gilt sales by the Bank of England last year. Instead of going into pension and insurance funds which, traditionally, take a longer-term view, Kendall says: 'A high proportion of those gilts went into loose hands, such as proprietary trading desks, banks, even some companies.' The effect on the gilt market has been devastating, with long-dated issues doing worst: 20-year stocks have lost about 10 per cent so far this year in capital and income combined, while 10-year stocks have lost about 7 per cent. So what should private investors do? If you own gilts already, and have seen a sharp fall in the value of your stocks, you should probably sit tight. Gilts are redeemed at par (100) so you will get back the face value of the bond at the maturity date. If you bought the bonds above par, though, you will incur a capital loss. And the problem is that losses on gilts cannot be used to offset capital gains elsewhere. The shake-out in the gilt market and the rise in yields could mean that this is a good time to buy stock and lock into high yields. 'Gilts look attractive now, since there should be a recovery in the market over the coming months', says Peter Tonkin, investment director at Towry Law Financial Planning. Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, adds: 'If you think the UK is going to see high economic growth and a pick-up in inflation, don't bother with gilts. But if you think inflation will be subdued or that economic growth will be sluggish, then gilt yields are implausibly high.' The March inflation figures, announced yesterday, confirm that inflation remains under control, with the underlying rate at its lowest for 25 years. Some bond analysts believe this should give the Bank of England room for another cut in the base rate. And the release of minutes from the February meeting between chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George indicate that the authorities were prepared to consider a rate cut if inflation stayed low and the recovery appeared weak. As for exactly when investors should enter the gilt market, the timing could prove difficult. Kendall says: 'It might be too soon to buy the market at the moment: yields are attractive, but they could well rise above these levels and this might not necessarily be the bottom of the market.' Kendall also feels it could be better to lock into 1996 maturities rather than very long-dated issues because of future political risk. But Briscoe points out that while short-dated gilts are less risky, 'if you really think inflation is under control and will continue to fall, then you will see better gains at the long end.'</p>

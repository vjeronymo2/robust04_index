			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: The Big Bang comes to Portugal - International Last week, 'Big Bang' came to Portugal, bringing the country's bond market into line with the rest of Europe and boosting its attractiveness to foreign investors. The long-awaited reforms are largely structural and unlikely to change investment flows overnight. But, coupled with Portugal's improving economic fundamentals of falling inflation and a declining budget deficit, they are likely to boost the market's allure in the medium term. 'These reforms are ambitious for one of Europe's smallest economies, but underline the government's commitment to raising liquidity in this market and increasing its attractiveness to overseas investors,' says Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International. Since Portugal joined Europe's exchange rate mechanism in April 1992, it has been working on a complete overhaul of its financial system, resulting in a raft of reforms, most of which took effect last Thursday. They include: Abolition of a 20 per cent withholding tax on non-resident holders of government debt. 'This was the most important reform - without it, the other measures would have been mere gimmicks,' says Mr Manuel Pinho, director general of the Portuguese Treasury. Creation of a screen-based, over-the-counter wholesale market in government bonds and a market-maker system. Retail bond transactions will continue to trade on the stock market. Legislation permitting short-selling and bond lending will soon be passed; this is expected to provide further liquidity and risk-management tools. The Bank of Portugal will engage in government bond repos to provide liquidity to the market. Stamp duty and stock market charges will be reduced; fees and stamp tax on Treasury bond repos have been eliminated. A new delivery-versus-payment settlement system is expected to reduce counterparty risk and ensure smoother settlement. Non-resident entities will be able to issue debt in the domestic market after giving four days' notice. A screen-based derivatives market, set up by the Oporto Stock Exchange is set to kick off early next year with the launch of futures on government bonds. Amid recent turbulence in international bond markets, Portugal has performed particularly badly. This is partly due to the fact that the higher-yielding, peripheral markets underperformed core markets during the sell-off. The slide was further exacerbated by the Portuguese market's lack of liquidity and the absence of efficient risk-management tools. Last, the rise in Portuguese short-term rates to bolster the flagging escudo has caused the yield curve to invert, creating the only negative curve in Europe. The resulting negative cost of carry makes it impossible for players to fund themselves at the short end of the curve and invest at the long end, and this has been weighing on the market. On Friday, Portuguese three-month money was trading around 13.6 per cent, well above the 11.15 per cent yield on the 10-year benchmark. The yield spread between Portugal and Spain has also widened sharply in recent weeks, especially at the short end. After yielding flat to Spanish bonds in March, Portuguese 10-year bonds now pay a premium of 65 basis points over Spain. The three-year spread is at 174 basis points over. However, 'even if Portugal offers a large yield pick-up over Spain, that's not attractive when you have a negative cost of carry', says Mr Steve Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais. 'They have to get short-term rates down.' The currency also remains a concern, despite officials' assurances that they are committed to a strong escudo. 'We will do everything necessary to support the escudo, and are willing to accept short-term costs to achieve longer-term benefits,' said Mr Pinho. However, some say the currency remains overvalued and may slip further - especially if short-term rates fall. 'Real short-term rates are almost 8 per cent - that's unsustainable in the long run,' says Ms Niffikeer, who expects the authorities to let the escudo drift down to around Es106 per D-Mark. On Friday it was trading at Es103.30. Currency worries, the negative yield curve, last week's replacement of the central bank governor and the lack of fresh supply in recent months may overshadow the market reforms, keeping investors at bay near-term. However, once international markets and the escudo stabilise, Portuguese bonds could stage a strong recovery, with the yield spread over Spain narrowing back towards zero, Mr Major predicts. Sentiment could be further lifted by good news on the inflation and budget deficit front. Consumer prices rose by 5.7 per cent in the year to May, down from 6 per cent in April, and are expected to fall further, averaging between 5 3/4 and 6 per cent this year after 6 1/2 per cent in 1993. After last year's setback, budget consolidation also appears to be back on track. In the first five months of the year, fiscal revenues have risen by 21.2 per cent over the same period last year - substantially higher than the 4.8 per cent increase in expenditures over the same period.</p>

Noting that the Korean people enjoy benefits of free medical  care under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and th dea leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, he said:    They do not know any payment for their medical treatment.    In Korea a large number of big hospitals have been built in  provinces, cities and counties.    Notably, the Pyongyang maternity hospital is a grand  modernly-equipped ome.    Women are granted maternity leaves when they receive all  benefits as when toey work.    Triplets and quadruplets are born at the maternity  oghospital.    Whenever triplets and quadruplets are born, Comrade Kim  Il-song sends valuable gifts to them and takes great care of  them so that they can grow healthily.    Such health policy is a superior one which can never be  found in any other countries of the world but in Korea where the  leader, the party and the masses are united in one mind.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by INFORM-KURANTY: "Kazan -- Capital of National </F> Socialism?"]    [Text] Quite unexpectedly, a new brown-hued Russian  National Socialist Workers Party [RNSWP] has been set up in  Kazan. Black-shirted toughs, however, have for a couple of  years now been part of the Volga political landscape. Those in  the know will remember that the present founding fathers of the  RNSWP wore the same uniforms during the ceremony to meet S.  Terekhov, who arrived in Kazan last year. Thirty activists of  the brown movement led by Mikhail Glukhov, an important local  figure of national socialism, have now come down to organize a  party on the basis of strict ideas of national revival. As a  matter of fact, these ideas are constantly drifting from  Barkashov to Terekhov and on to Zhirinovskiy: the revival of a  healthy nation, a strong dictatorial state of general  prosperity, control by the government apparatus over all the  main means of production.    Incidentally, Kazan "Glukhovites" (their leader, they  maintain, was running for the Duma not without a measure of  success) disprove the proposition about a unified red-and-brown  front because they parade as the most hardboiled  anti-communists. Will this be for long? Experience shows that  in minutes crucial and confused extremists' flanks start to draw  closer together.</p>

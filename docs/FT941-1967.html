			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Global expansion to cap it all: General Electric's fast-growing financial services offshoot is looking to Europe A French vehicle fleet management company, an Austrian consumer finance business, a Swedish computer leasing concern: piece by piece, GE Capital is stitching together one of Europe's broadest financial groups. All three acquisitions have been announced by the financial services subsidiary of General Electric, the US industrial giant, since last summer. GE Capital has also helped bail out GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing group, taken a stake in a Monaco-based ship management business, and acquired interests in other European financial sector concerns. Its involvement in businesses such as car sales financing, leasing lorry trailers and servicing other companies' mortgage portfolios has not made headline news. It tends to buy small, picking up Dollars 200m of assets here, Dollars 300m there. But if its record in the US is anything to go by, GE Capital's competitors in the European financial services industry have plenty to worry about. Last week's Dollars 2.2bn bid in the US for Kemper, a financial services group based in Chicago, threw a rare spotlight on the company's ambitions. If it succeeds in forcing Kemper to accept its unwanted advances, GE Capital will emerge as one of the biggest fund management groups in the US. GE Capital's track record in recent years is envied by rivals. While other industrial companies that ventured into financial services in the 1980s got their fingers burnt, GE has thrived. The assets in its main financing operations have doubled in the past four years, reaching Dollars 118bn at the end of last year. That does not include the assets of a specialist insurance operation and Kidder Peabody, the investment bank it owns. GE Capital is one of the most consistently profitable companies in the US financial sector. While the country's commercial banks were going through problems with real estate and leveraged buy-outs in 1990 and 1991, GE Capital barely flinched. The company was not totally immune from such difficulties but a policy of not lending for new construction  - which proved the riskiest form of real estate lending - kept it away from the worst effects of the late-1980s building boom. Its robust balance sheet also enabled it to shrug off the problems from leveraged lending. From 18 per cent in 1988, its post-tax return on capital edged down to 17 per cent in 1990, but has since climbed back steadily. Last year, it was 18.5 per cent. The result: while other financial businesses in the US shed assets, GE Capital has been buying. It has spent Dollars 2bn or more a year on acquisitions in each of the past three years, preferring to pick up businesses being discarded by others. Last year's haul included the assets of the credit card business of oil company Exxon, and the railcar leasing business of Chrysler. Real estate has become a particular focus of its acquisition policy. Apparently believing that it is buying at the bottom of the market, GE Capital has added to its mountain of property assets in recent months, taking advantage of the fact that banks and insurance companies are still cutting their involvement in the sector. In the past year GE Capital has bought Dollars 1bn of property from First Chicago bank and Dollars 1.1bn from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the government agency responsible for selling the assets of failed savings and loans institutions. It also took on Dollars 1.1bn of property when it bought two annuity companies last year, GNA and United Pacific Life. It is still buying property: GE Capital's latest target, Kemper, has Dollars 1.7bn of property on its books. Acquiring Kemper would also mark a renewed interest by GE Capital in the investment business. GE Capital's earlier involvement in the sector proved disappointing. Kidder Peabody was a loss-maker in the early-1990s, and was long rumoured to be one company that GE would have been happy to sell. But, helped by the buoyancy of financial markets, it made operating profits of Dollars 439m last year. Last year, GE Capital made its first forays into the retirement savings market, with the acquisition of an annuity business. It has also bought a small mutual funds business, with Dollars 7bn of assets. The acquisition of Kemper would build on this. Its Dollars 44bn of fund assets would put GE among the 10 biggest mutual fund businesses in the US. If Kemper's life insurance business, and GE's other fund management activities were added in, GE would control Dollars 150bn of investments. In Europe, GE Capital is at a much earlier stage of development. It made some sizeable acquisitions in the 1990s, including the credit card businesses of UK retailers Burton and House of Fraser and the vehicle fleet services business of Avis Europe. But the spate of smaller purchases in recent months indicates its intention to build on these interests. With the European financial sector under recessionary pressures, the US giant has been prowling for acquisitions: it is no coincidence that three of its recent buys, announced last month, were the vehicle finance, computer leasing and office equipment leasing companies of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the troubled Scandinavian bank. Europe is not the only focus of its interest, however: investments since last summer include an automobile financing company in Thailand and a vehicle fleet company in Canada. In its adventures outside the US, GE Capital has three factors in its favour: First, it has access to a cheap supply of the basic raw material that drives its business - cash. With a triple-A credit rating, GE Capital ranks among the best-regarded borrowers in the capital markets (unlike banks, it does not collect deposits to lend on to borrowers). The interest rate it paid on its outstanding short-term debt at the end of last year was 3.39 per cent, down from 3.57 per cent a year before. With short-term borrowings of Dollars 46bn, every hundredth of a percentage point counts. Ironically, the more successful GE Capital becomes, the more its triple-A rating could be at risk. The financial company relies on the backing of its parent for its top rating. As GE Capital's profits become more important to GE - last year they amounted to 40 per cent of the total - so the parent's own rating becomes less robust. 'At what point does the tail start wagging the dog?' asks Mr Ray Miller of Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency. 'That's something we're wrestling with now.' When it comes to buying financial assets, GE Capital's robust balance sheet makes it one of the first on most sellers' lists. It could turn out to be the only serious bidder for Kemper: while commercial banks have their sights set on the mutual fund industry, few are likely to have the stomach for Kemper's Dollars 1.5bn of under-performing real estate assets. A second advantage, often commented upon, is the fact that GE Capital is not a bank, and so does not suffer from the dead hand of banking regulation in the US. In reality, this is much exaggerated. Banks also carry out their credit card, leasing and consumer financing activities through non-bank subsidiaries. More significant is a third advantage: a management team with an unparalleled reputation and record in its industry. Under Mr Gary Wendt, its head for the past eight years, GE Capital has won a name for driving hard bargains as a purchaser and for a fanatical attention to costs. Mr Wendt is regarded in the industry as a close ally of Mr Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric. The financial services company shares the low-cost culture of the industrial group of which it is a part. Its use of technology to reduce processing costs and generate management information is also far in advance of the banking industry, bemoans an executive in one of the biggest US banks. 'They think differently from us. They approach things differently,' the executive says. It is a difference that European banks may be about to discover.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating profit (loss) dollarsm  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               1989     1990     1991     1992     1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Financing                     1152     1267     1327     1366     1727 Specialty insurance            361      457      501      641      770 Securities broker-dealers     (53)     (54)      119      300      439 All other                    (322)    (275)    (290)    (272)    (288) Total                         1138     1395     1657     2035     2648  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: GE Annual Report, 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY  </P> <P> Just for the record: In a recent column when I alluded to Nuremberg as an  example of a place where people were oppressed and abused, I didn't -- God  forbid! -- mean the defendants there. I was referring to the Nuremberg that was  the cradle of Nazism, the site of the obscene Nuremberg laws and the place for  Hitler's horror rallies and the place where his terrorist Brownshirts first  practiced the art of kicking, killing and torturing their fellow human beings,  so infamous it's the reason the war crime trials were put there in the first  place. Nuremberg was a symbol for terror long before it became a symbol for  retribution.  </P></p>

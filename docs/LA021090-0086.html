			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLCHILDREN SHOW VOLUMINOUS APPETITE IN 7-WEEK BINGE ON BOOKS  </P> <P> Maybe Johnny can't read. But Dylan can. So can James and Boyd.  </P> <P> So when the call went out in November, those three -- along with 800 or so of  their Carpenter Avenue School mates -- were ready to put their skills to work.  Their task: to read as much as they could in a seven-week "read-a-thon."  </P> <P> Squeezing a quarter or two out of mom and dad for every book they read, the  children at the Studio City school brought in more than $9,000. World Book, the  encyclopedia publishers, chipped in $6,000, bringing the total to $15,000.  </P> <P> That money was used to buy more books: 17 new 22-volume sets of encyclopedias.  Those new sets mean each of Carpenter's 27 classrooms has its own, something a  World Book official said no other school in the nation can claim.  </P> <P> The encyclopedia company runs similar "read-a-thons" at schools across the  country.  </P> <P> New encyclopedias may not be on every third-grader's top 10 list of nifty  stuff, but at an awards ceremony Friday, the kids at Carpenter seemed to take  pride in their sets. After all, they earned them.  </P> <P> "It is an incredible thing that you've done," Claude Swonger, district manager  for World Book, told the semicircle of schoolchildren who sat cross-legged on  the blacktop. "You were the ones who put your noses between the pages and  read."  </P> <P> And in the process, the children said they found that reading was kind of fun.  </P> <P> "I like stuff in space and in stars," said third-grader Boyd Cooper, whose  friends call him B.J. "My favorite planet is Saturn. I like to read about  Saturn."  </P> <P> As far as the encyclopedias went, Cooper said he could use them to look up  information about gems and coins, two things he's developed an interest in  lately.  </P> <P> The encyclopedias already have come in handy. Teacher Wendy Raksin said her  class looked up the entry on Braille after a question came up during a story  about how dogs help the blind.  </P> <P> Dylan Sculley, 9, finished off 10 books in seven weeks. Among his favorites was  a book detailing the process of milk production. You know, how milk is  pasteurized and "homogized" after it comes out of the cow.  </P> <P> His friend, 8-year-old James Duffey, said he read 16 books, most of them about  whales. But his reading skill was not what James wanted the world to know about  Friday.  </P> <P> "I eat parts of my shoe," he said, shoving a piece of white rubber into his  mouth.  </P></p>

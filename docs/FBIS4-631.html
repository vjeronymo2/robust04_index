			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] will continue to seek every possible path that  can lead our country to freedom. Within that context, the UNITA  team to the Lusaka peace talks yesterday went to the hotel where  the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party,  MPLA-PT, team is staying to discuss work-related issues.    No details have been made available concerning the meeting,  but diplomatic sources have described it as cordial and very  encouraging. That meeting of yesterday appears to have  surprised many and it took place without the presence of either  the mediators or the observers.    The Lusaka peace talks will continue until UNITA and the  MPLA-PT have reached an agreement. In Luanda yesterday, UN  Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye said no deadline had  been set for the talks. Asked to comment on whether four months  of negotiation was not excessive, Blondin Beye replied that in  view of the fact that the conflict had been going on for 18  years, four months should not be seen as a sign of despair.    Through Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, its spokesman in the  Zambian capital, UNITA has made it known that it will not leave  Lusaka without a peace accord.    Meanwhile, UN sources have disclosed that the UN special  representative in Angola could travel to the city of Huambo this  week to hold talks with the UNITA leadership. Attentive  observers believe that Blondin Beye must have received new  guidelines concerning methods to deal with the marathon Lusaka  peace talks.    An adviser to the UN special representative in Angola said  in  Lusaka yesterday that there was no danger of the talks  collapsing.</p>

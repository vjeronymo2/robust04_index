			<p>BFN     [Text] Shengyang, June 13 (XINHUA) -- China will pay more  attention to cracking down on major economic crimes in its  anti-corruption struggle.    Hou Zongbin, deputy secretary of the Central Commission for  Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, said this  during his inspection in northeast China's Liaoning Province on  June 6-13.    Hou pointed out that the party's struggle against economic  crimes is a serious political struggle and has no room for  compromise.    He urged all departments in charge of discipline inspection  and supervision to make as much headway as possible in dealing  with economic crimes within a short period of time.    He also asked all party leaders and members and government  officials to shoulder responsibility for the work while working  hard for reform and opening to the outside world.    The discipline inspection and supervision organs should  positively cooperate with judicial organs in the current  struggle, he said.    Economic crimes involving leaders above county level should  be dealt with resolutely, he stressed.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Marvin Mitchelson -- A headline Friday incorrectly stated that attorney Marvin  Mitchelson was absolved by a jury who heard a malpractice lawsuit filed against  him by Felicia Gordon. The jury found that Mitchelson failed to use ordinary  care and skill in handling her divorce case but it concluded that she was not  damaged by his actions. The jury also found that Mitchelson did not  intentionally or negligently inflict emotional distress on Gordon.  </P></p>

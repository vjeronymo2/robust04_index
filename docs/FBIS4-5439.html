			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "APEC and Indonesia's Bargaining Power"] </F>   [Text] It looks like the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) will be just a forum for consultations and exchanges of  information, experience, and ideas on economic activities in the  region. This was reflected in the ASEAN countries' economic  vision at the end of the APEC finance ministers meeting at  Kahala Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii 16 to 18 March. The APEC forum  was also attended by ASEAN finance ministers. Indonesian  Finance Minister Mari'e Muhammad told newsmen that ASEAN member  countries remain committed to strengthening their own formal  regional cooperation. He said that the ASEAN finance ministers  discussed not only issues concerning APEC, but also ASEAN's  financial needs.    However, developing countries like Indonesia had a stronger  bargaining power at the limited APEC forum. According to Dr.  Budiono, a member of the Indonesian delegation, Indonesia's and  Malaysia's views had a strong bearing at the APEC forum, but  their views are not likely to have any influence in  international forums such as GATT meetings.    The APEC finance ministers meeting in Honolulu, which was a  follow up to the summit held in Seattle in November 1993, was  actually an informal meeting for participants to exchange ideas  and information. A similar ministerial-level meeting will be  held in Indonesia this year.    One of the causes that led to the formation of APEC several  years ago was the doubt that the impasse in the Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade negotiations could be broken. Now that the  Uruguay Round has reached a successful conclusion, APEC hopes  that the agreements reached at the Uruguay Round of GATT trade  talks will be observed and implemented.    The APEC forum hopes that various kinds of protectionism  imposed on goods will be lessened, considering that the  international market is now moving towards trade liberalization  in line with the agreements concluded at the GATT talks. Any  form of protectionism imposed on Indonesian goods will increase  their production costs and this will in turn weaken their  competitiveness in the international market. Currently, almost  all countries are racing to step up the competitiveness of their  goods as a means of wooing foreign investment. For this, they  prefer to reduce complicated bureaucratic procedures because  they will turn away investors as well.    Indonesia could take advantage of the APEC finance ministers  forum so that the rules governing foreign investment in the  country will be observed by member countries. Even though it is  difficult to impose sanctions against the countries that violate  the rules, those belonging to APEC are still bound to respect  them.    The trade dispute between the United State and Japan and  their different economic interests also highlighted the APEC  forum in Hawaii. It is common knowledge that the two countries  contribute 80 percent of the total industrial waste found in  this region, while their export products dominate more than half  of the world trade.    In this regard, will the continued economic dispute between  the United States and Japan make APEC less significant?  Indonesia could have played a mediator's role at the recent  APEC forum. However, it appears that this is not going to be an  easy task because the two conflicting parties are still sticking  strongly to their stance on world trade and it is difficult to  help them reach a consensus.    It seems that we still need time before reaching regional  cooperation on the basis of a need for a coalition to renew the  trading system and promote multilateral economic cooperation in  the Asia-Pacific region. The term "Pacific Age" has long been  mentioned in articles and reports written by academics as an  attempt to show that the world center is shifting from the  Atlantic to the Asia- Pacific region.    However, in reality, attention to the implications of the  global economy, which is marked by increasingly stiff  competition and protectionism, has lessened the need to  institutionalize the APEC forum. Therefore, it is better to  take a more realistic approach to respecting the diversity of  the region.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VINCENT EVOKES MEMORY OF GIAMATTI;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: THE NEW COMMISSIONER GREETS OWNERS AND OUTLINES HIS PLANS FOR NEXT  YEAR.  </P> <P> Commissioner Fay Vincent, often evoking the memory of Bart Giamatti, outlined  his ideas for labor negotiations, expansion and player relations today in the  commissioner's annual winter meetings speech.  </P> <P> Vincent took over as commissioner when Giamatti died in September. He had been  deputy commissioner for six months.  </P> <P> "I often think of what I have had to enjoy and what Bart has not," Vincent  said. "He didn't get to his World Series, and he would have loved it. He didn't  get to make this state-of-the-game address, and I delight in thinking of what  he might have said."  </P> <P> Baseball's most pressing issue is labor negotiations. The agreement with the  players' association expires on Dec. 31.  </P> <P> The key issues are salary arbitration, potential changes in free agency and  revenue sharing.  </P> <P> "Labor negotiations must not become a morality problem, at least not in  baseball," Vincent said.  </P> <P> "This is a financial issue in which two sides must allocate a scarce resource.  Nobody wants a work stoppage. Being an optimist, I don't believe there will be  one."  </P> <P> Vincent also called for a structure that permits a small franchise to compete  with the larger markets.  </P> <P> A proposed revenue sharing plan would be used for this purpose.  </P> <P> Montreal owner Charles Bronfman, whose club lost pitchers Mark Langston, Bryn  Smith and Pascual Perez to free agency, said his team cannot compete with the  bigger TV markets.  </P> <P> Just weeks after being named commissioner, Vincent was faced with a major  crisis when an earthquake hit the Bay Area in the early evening of Oct. 17,  minutes before Game 3 of the World Series at Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> Vincent decided to delay the World Series until the area was ready and was  praised by government officials for his compassion.  </P> <P> "It was a season of high mountains and low valleys," Vincent said.  </P> <P> The game's lowest point was the ongoing investigation into allegations that  Cincinnati Manager Pete Rose bet on baseball.  </P> <P> The issue dominated Giamatti's short tenure as commissioner and led to Rose's  banishment from baseball a week before Giamatti's death.  </P> <P> "Bart's most remembered statement is 'Nobody is bigger than the game,' "  Vincent said. "I will follow that.  </P> <P> "We must realize that on and off the field, baseball is a game of rules."  </P> <P> Vincent said his plans for the game include an improved drug program,  expansion, fairness in hiring, and marketing of baseball in Europe.  </P> <P> "Within 90 days of a labor agreement, the National League will announce a  definite timetable for the addition of two teams to the National League," he  said.  </P> <P> "Bart brought me to baseball, and I am simply thrilled to be here," Vincent  said in concluding his 40-minute speech. "I view the challenges ahead with  confidence but with some real concern. Baseball is healthy but there is much to  be done to make it better."  </P></p>

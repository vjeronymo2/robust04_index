			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: BMW shares advance on rising sales and profits BMW's share price rose strongly yesterday after an upbeat statement from the company which said turnover was outstripping record levels reached in 1992, and fore-cast 'positive effects' on profits. Sales, excluding the recently-acquired Rover group, rose 8.5 per cent to DM23.8bn (Dollars 15.9bn) at nine months, BMW said. This was 1.5 per cent higher than in the comparable part of 1992, when the full year's sales hit DM31.2bn, it added. The company, which last year saw net earnings tumble to DM516m from DM726m in 1992, reported a 14 per cent recovery to DM290m on a sales increase of 7.4 per cent in the first half of the current year. The group's share price jumped DM18 in early Frankfurt trading yesterday and closed DM12, or 1.6 per cent, higher on the day. The company's statement suggested production bottlenecks experienced in the spring had been cleared, and forecast demand would be further increased by new variants on the successful 3-Series, due shortly. While car production rose 5 per cent in the nine months to the end of September, deliveries to customers increased 7 per cent overall to 434,000, with a 13 per cent surge in the last month of the reporting period. Analysts at the Bayerische Vereinsbank calculated that production in the third quarter was more than 8 per cent up on the year-earlier period, while deliveries had risen 10 per cent. According to earlier data, world sales of BMW marque models were up only 5 per cent in the first seven months of the year. Deliveries in Germany, up only 2 per cent in the period to the end of July, were up 4 per cent after nine months, according to yesterday's statement. Sales elsewhere in Europe were in line with the overall market growth of 5 per cent so far. However, while deliveries in the UK rose 24 per cent to 39,000, those in the important Italian and French markets were unchanged at 24,200 and 18,700 respectively. US sales, up 13 per cent after six months, were still 10 per cent ahead at the end of the latest reporting period. At 63,500 vehicles, the nine-month total was only marginally short of BMW's US sales in the whole of 1993. Sales in Japan rose 8 per cent to 20,600, while 41 per cent growth in other south-east Asian markets took deliveries there to 17,400.</p>

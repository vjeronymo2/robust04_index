			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / People: Oil men move to top of Lloyd's Register The traditional hold of shipowners in the running of Lloyd's Register, the world's oldest ship classification society, has been broken after more than 200 years. Patrick O'Ferrall (right), 58, the new chairman, and Tim Jones, 48, the deputy chairman, both hail from the oil industry. O'Ferrall joined the register in January 1991 after 32 years in the oil industry and has been acting chairman since the death of Sir Roderick MacLeod, a former managing director of Ben Line, in January. Jones, who has spent 23 years with BP, joined in February. Although O'Ferrall says that it will be 'business as usual', the appointment of two oil industry men with substantial international expertise suggests that Lloyd's Register, like the rest of the maritime industry, is being forced to adapt to increasingly competitive conditions. The decline in the profitability of the shipping industry and competition from rival ship classification societies has made life difficult for Lloyd's, which is committed to maintaining high technical standards of design. 'The days when a ship's captain saluted the Lloyd's surveyor at the top of the gang-plank are long since gone,' one master mariner said yesterday. Cost-conscious shipping companies are much more likely to question the surveyor's judgment or threaten to shift their fleet to another classification society. Lloyd's, a non-profit making organisation with 3,700 staff and more than 250 offices worldwide, is still the biggest in the world - classifying more than 8,500 vessels, or around 90m gross tonnage. However, its percentage of the world fleet has been slipping and it has been diversifying into other areas. O'Ferrall started with Iraq Petroleum in 1958 and joined Total CFP in 1974; he was responsible for co-ordinating the Pounds 1.5bn Alwyn North project. Tim Jones, a former director of BP Oil Europe, has also had considerable experience of large-scale project management. Although Lloyd's normal retirement age is 62, O'Ferrall says that he will serve a five-year term until June 1988.</p>

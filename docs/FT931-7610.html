			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Washington appoints aid co-ordinator THE Clinton administration yesterday appointed a new co-ordinator of US aid to the former Soviet Union, less than a week after the current co-ordinator said Russian President Boris Yeltsin's days in power were numbered, Reuter reports from Washington. The new co-ordinator is Mr Thomas Simons, the US ambassador to Poland, who will replace Mr Richard Armitage, a Bush appointee who is likely to stay in office until April or May. The administration has sought to distance itself from comments by Mr Armitage that he expected Mr Yeltsin to be ousted before his presidential term ends in 1996. When asked whether Mr Armitage's remarks had hastened Mr Simons' appointment, a State Department spokesman said the administration had been working for a month on appointing a new co-ordinator to work for Mr Strobe Talbott, President Bill Clinton's designated ambassador-at-large to the Commonwealth of Independent States. The spokesman said Mr Simons would take over from Mr Armitage 'as soon as he can wind up affairs in Poland'.</p>

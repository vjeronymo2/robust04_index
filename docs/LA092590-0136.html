			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: USE OF SMUGGLING PROFIT FOR DEFENSE FUND  OKD  </P> <P> A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled Monday that a former Drug Enforcement  Administration agent accused of drug trafficking could use $100,000 his  attorneys say he made smuggling gold and jewelry into the United States for his  defense fund.  </P> <P> The decision by U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. came after a defense  lawyer for Darnell Garcia, 43, of Rancho Palos Verdes said his client needed  the cash to pay his two lawyers and an investigator.  </P> <P> Garcia has more than $3 million in funds frozen in Luxembourg banks that  prosecutors charge were generated by drug trafficking. The $100,000 is part of  those funds and prosecutors say that it, too, came from drug trafficking.  </P> <P> Although Garcia isn't charged with jewelry smuggling, prosecutors opposed the  ruling. They declared the funds are illegal whether they come from narcotics  trafficking or smuggling.  </P> <P> Hatter set a new trial date for Oct. 23.  </P></p>

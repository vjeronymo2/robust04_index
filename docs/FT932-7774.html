			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Merchant Retail falls to Pounds 1.08m PRE-TAX profits of Merchant Retail Group fell by Pounds 640,000 to Pounds 1.08m in the year to March 27, although turnover increased from Pounds 170m to Pounds 186m. The results include property profits of Pounds 664,000 and a provision of Pounds 574,000 for the closure of Barnum's. Capital expenditure amounted to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 9m), but tighter controls on working capital had resulted in a reduction in bank borrowings to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 17.8m). A final dividend of 0.75p (nil) makes an unchanged total for the year of 1.1p. Although not fully covered by earnings of 0.84p (1.24p), the directors said the payment was appropriate as action had been taken to deal with the loss-making businesses and further cost reductions were being introduced. The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 16 1/2 p.</p>

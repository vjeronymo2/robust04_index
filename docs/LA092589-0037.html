			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two weeks after Hungary opened its border with Austria to East German refugees,  arrivals in West Germany reached nearly 20,000 with no apparent end in sight.  Austria reported more East Germans in transit from Hungary to West Germany. And  another 900 East Germans are occupying Bonn's embassies in Prague,  Czechoslovakia, and Warsaw, Poland, demanding passage to West Germany. The Bonn  government's earlier estimate that 100,000 East Germans could emigrate or  escape to West Germany this year was exceeded by mid-September, and officials  now say the exodus could reach as many as 200,000 by year's end.  </P></p>

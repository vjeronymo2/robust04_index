			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fund to buy Portuguese groups in Es24bn deal Espirito Santo Development Capital Investors (ESDCIL), a fund dominated by Mr George Soros, the international financier, is to purchase Portugal's leading packaging company and two Portuguese and French car battery producers in deals worth more than Es24bn (Dollars 147m). The fund has reached an agreement to buy 100 per cent of Colep, a metal and plastic packaging group with annual sales of Es14bn, for Es20bn-Es25bn. Colep leads the Portuguese market for aerosol and other cans and is also a contract filler and distributor of packaged goods. Colep is majority owned by Mr Ilidio de Pinho, a Portuguese entrepreneur. A US institutional investor holds about 25 per cent. ESDCIL said Mr de Pinho was selling to ensure management continuity after his only son died in a car accident. About 25 per cent of the cost of the purchase is to be met directly from the Es16.34bn closed-end fund. Investors in the fund will pay the remainder separately. Companies controlled by Mr Soros account for 50 per cent of the ESDCIL fund. The other main investors are Espirito Santo, the Portuguese financial group, and European, Middle Eastern and US institutions. In a separate deal, ESDCIL is to acquire 48 per cent of Autosil, a Portuguese family-owned car battery maker, by injecting about Es4bn in fresh capital. Autosil will use the funds to purchase 100 per cent of Steco, France's second automotive battery producer and third in sales, for FFr100m-FFr120m. Autosil registered sales of Es3.3bn in 1993, accounting for 30 per cent of the Portuguese market. Sales are forecast to rise to Es6bn in 1995 as a result of a contract to supply a new Ford-Volkswagen car plant in Portugal. Steco's 1993 sales were about FFr500m. ESDCIL said Autosil and Colep were both likely to be floated on the Lisbon stock market over the medium term.</p>

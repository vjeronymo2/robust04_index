			<p>BFN     [Text] The president's office has released details of a  letter sent to Silvio Berlusconi yesterday, in which President  Oscar Luigi Scalfaro draws the prime minister's attention to  certain problems "where a lack of a solution" could "cause  problems for the Italian Republic both inside and outside its  borders."    Scalfaro writes that it is about giving assurances: 1. that  there will be complete faithfulness to the alliances of our  foreign policy; 2. that the person in charge of the Interior  Ministry will not take up stances which are contrary to the  principles of national unity; and 3. that the principles of  social solidarity will be respected.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / BCCI may change Basle Concordat PROPOSALS to stamp out lax regulation of international banks, in the wake of last year's collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, are being debated by regulators from the world's 11 most powerful central banks. 'It is an attempt to freeze out lax central banks,' said one central banker. A draft document outlining tough new standards on inspection and supervision of banks is being discussed in Basle by the Bank for International Settlements committee on banking regulation. Banks with headquarters in any country which did not enforce the new standards would be banned from operating through branches in the main industrial countries, if the proposals are accepted. The hope is that this sanction would in turn oblige all central banks to adopt the new standards. The standards would insist that central banks have the resources and expertise to verify whether banks with headquarters in their countries are being run properly, taking account of the banks' offshore activities. 'Exactly how we monitor whether a central bank is enforcing those standards is going to cause a lot of controversy,' the central banker said. The standards, which will be debated for many months, would be an amendment to the Basle Concordat on international banking supervision, a non-legally binding agreement signed in 1983 by the Group of Ten leading industrial countries together with Switzerland. 'There is a general consensus that the Concordat needs hardening, as a response to BCCI,' the banker added. 'The proposals put before the committee are the starting point for a debate.' There have been criticisms that no central bank took proper responsibility for verifying the soundness of BCCI, which had operations all over the world. If the new proposals had been in effect, that responsibility would have fallen on Luxembourg, BCCI's home country. 'There is going to be plenty of argument about the new standards,' said a central banker.</p>

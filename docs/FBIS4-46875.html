			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alla Nosova: "Perhaps Metallurgists Are Not </F> Against Conversion to Joint Stock Company Status. The Only Thing  Is, Will the Present Board of Directors Own Enterprises if  Workers Can Only Buy 7 to 9 Percent of the Shares?"]    [Text] This question did not get much attention, because it  was slipped in near the end of Ukraine President L. Kravchuk's  meeting with the directors of the 14 biggest metallurgy  enterprises in the country. But it was shoved "under the  curtain" by the voices of numerous concerned people. And a  mechanism was proposed for ensuring that "90 percent of the  shares do not end up in the hands of outsiders." In response,  Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko promised that he had  arranged with the State Property Fund to reserve 30 to 40  percent of the shares for further buy-out. But the audience  hooted that bit of information down too. Clearly, people sensed  that the powerful directors' corps would like to become  enterprise owners almost automatically.    In general the meeting was planned to check up on previous  agreements on ways to revive the sector. From Minister A.  Holubchenko's report it was clear that the greatest worries are  the status of gas payments, trade with Russia and the other CIS  countries, and currency regulation; there was particular focus  on shortcomings in the buying and selling of currency for  tenders. Unquestionably, this meeting brought together old  directors, to be sure, but they were discussing how to solve the  problems that have arisen during the time of market reforms.  Right now, the metallurgy complex is 640 million dollars short  of enough to pay for gas. The proposal was made to change the  decision regarding compulsory sales of 50 percent of the  enterprises' hard currency earnings to the state, and to sell  only 25 percent. And 75 percent is enough to pay for gas and to  buy essential equipment.    A tough future is in store for metallurgical enterprises  which have already, essentially, halted production owing to  mutual indebtedness. Participants in the meeting also talked  about note settlements as a panacea for all economic ills. But  in fact they do not work. As yet, a mechanism for introducing  them is not fully in place. Mutual mistrust of these papers is  apparent both on the part of buyers and sellers. Whatever the  future may bring, notes will have to be introduced.    One cause of the slowdown in trade with Russia is that  sometimes that country sells its raw materials to our producers  at prices that are higher than world prices. The cost of raw  materials boosts the cost of products. This then is the root of  indicator prices whose use the directors called criminal. But  the objection can be made that sometimes they sell the same  product to Russia more cheaply than in Ukraine.    Some directors spoke in thinly veiled fashion about seceding  from their Industry Ministry. That question is one that has yet  to be discussed.    The only thing is, why are discussions about problems like  these held by the production council in the presence of the  President?</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Somalia provides key test of UN resolve: Other African states may need to be pulled from the debris of the Cold War THE United Nations decision to commit at least 4,200 blue berets and support staff to help restore order and distribute humanitarian relief in war-ravaged Somalia represents the most dangerous and extensive operation the UN has undertaken in black Africa. The move could also establish a precedent for the role of the UN in the post-Cold War era on a continent beset by crises, civil war and famine caused by ethnic conflicts. Not since the Katanga crisis in southern Zaire in the early 1960s has the UN sent armed troops to a conflict in Africa. And although last week's unanimous decision by the Security Council to dispatch a substantial force to Somalia was taken for ostensibly humanitarian reasons - relief workers are trying to alleviate starvation threatening 4.5m people - it is inevitable that the UN will be sucked into an even greater role in peacekeeping operations and forging a political settlement between the warring clan factions. Some observers even go as far as to say that given the complete collapse of government, law and order and civil society the UN will be forced to consider some form of trusteeship for Somalia before the process of nation rebuilding can begin. Behind the Security Council's decision lie a number of factors: international criticism that the UN has not done enough to prevent starvation in Somalia; guilt that the world is paying more attention to the 'rich man's war' in Yugoslavia and ignoring the plight of faraway, impoverished Africans; the interventionist bent of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general who has pushed harder than any other UN official for a fully fledged military intervention; the relatively recent opportunity created for armed intervention in Africa by the end of the east-west conflict; and a growing recognition that solving Africa's problems when the rot has set in so deeply is going to take a sustained international effort and significant resources. More importantly the decision also recognises a principle long argued by African relief experts themselves: that saving human lives must override the surreal claims to sovereignty made by African warlords, dictators and rebel leaders. For the past 18 months a group of African intellectuals has said that the world's acceptance of this humanitarian principle in Kurdistan last year, in the face of opposition from President Saddam Hussein should be extended to Africa. They say that a number of other African countries such as Sudan, Zaire, Angola, Mozambique and Liberia - all victims of the Cold War - either have disintegrated into ethnically-based civil war and famine or are in danger of doing so and therefore should be candidates for some kind of international intervention despite the opposition of their putative governments which make claims to sovereignty. The risks of not intervening now, they say, are that the situation will only deteriorate further until images of skeletal children dying from starvation, like those from Somalia, will become increasingly commonplace in the continent. 'The west has got to stop responding to Africa's crises on an emergency basis when it is too late to save hundreds of thousands of innocent women and children who give no legitimacy to the governments which claim to represent them,' Mr Abdul Mohamed, an expert on humanitarian relief in the Horn of Africa, said yesterday. 'We've got to get beyond the band aid mentality - rushing in when the alarm bells have almost stopped ringing because everybody is dead. We must work to create some longer term preventative solutions so the crises stop being endemic.' Somalia is a fitting place for the UN to start given that both Washington and Moscow, who played cold war politics by proxy in the Horn of Africa and built up a huge weapons stockpile, bear so much responsibility for the severe crisis now facing the devastated country. However, whether the UN intervention in Somalia will mark the beginning of a fundamentally new approach to intervention in Africa's disaster cases will depend on the success of an operation which is fraught with dangers. Last Friday, two unarmed UN military observers, part of an international team of 50, were shot and serious wounded by clan gunmen in the anarchic capital of Mogadishu. Several of Somalia's warlords, particularly General Mohamed Farar Aideed, leader of the coalition Somali National Alliance and Colonel Omar Jess, leader of the Somali Patriotic Movement which controls the area around the southern port of Kismayo, have threatened in the past that they will attack UN troops who enter the territories they hold without their permission. The prospect of shoot-outs between blue berets and marauding Somali gunmen, at least in the initial phase of the operation, is almost inevitable. Such a situation will call for determined action rather than faint hearts and it is unclear if the UN has the political will to risk the loss of lives of blue berets in an African basketcase with no economic or geopolitical importance. Furthermore, given that the numbers of troops will probably have to be increased significantly as the operation unfolds, the UN will have to make the decision about whether it is prepared to cover the extensive costs of such an operation. Already estimates suggest that the first six months of the military operation will cost at least Dollars 130m (Pounds 65.3m). Observers say that if that commitment is missing the UN intervention, on a short-term and limited basis, could cause more problems than it solves. However, if the commitment is there, Somalia could prove the testing ground for a positive UN role in contributing to resolving the crises which are afflicting the continent.</p>

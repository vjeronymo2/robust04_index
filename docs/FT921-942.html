			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Smith leads the way in Midlands - Peter Norman compares Norman Lamont with his Labour shadow JUST OVER two weeks ago Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, unveiled a Budget that cabinet colleagues thought would be a 'Budget for victory'. With only a fortnight of electioneering left, all the signs are that the issues of taxation and economic management are failing to benefit the Tories. Two days spent following Mr Lamont and Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, in the electorally important West Midlands showed that Labour was able to deploy its senior economic spokesman more effectively than was the local Conservative machine. Moreover, Mr Smith proved more adept at getting his message across than did the chancellor. Mr Lamont's visit to Birmingham on Monday to launch his party's campaign in the West Midlands was blighted by poor organisation and bungled photo-opportunities. But even if all had gone smoothly, the chancellor would have faced problems selling the government's economic record in a region with many marginal constituencies that have large numbers of skilled manual voters - the so-called C2s. The chancellor's tour of Birmingham gave the impression that local party organisers were primarily interested in keeping him away from the public. Two hurried photo-opportunities attracted only a handful of journalists and, more importantly, failed to illuminate party policies. A midday speech to businessmen was not televised. Mr Smith's trip took him to two training centres where the redundant are taught new skills - and he was in his element and was able in a rapid succession of interviews to relate what was going on around him to Labour's policies. Every paragraph had its sound bite, testifying to Mr Smith's skill as a communicator. But it was also apparent that, away from the high-earning south-east of England, his message was easier to sell than that of Mr Lamont. Mr Smith was able to capitalise on the anxieties unleashed by the second recession under a Tory government in Britain's manufacturing heartland. He linked Labour's plans for training to hopes for a better future. He wanted Britain to have 'the best-educated and trained workforce in Europe' and therefore 'the best economy'. According to the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, 51 per cent of West Midlands families should be better off with Labour's Budget plans while 13 per cent would lose. Mr Smith could therefore claim that his Budget would establish 'a fair tax and National Insurance system'. The state of the economy forced Mr Lamont on to the defensive. He had no encouraging economic statistics up his sleeve. The sole glimmer of hope was a forecast from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders that an extra 70,000 cars would be sold this year after his Budget package to help the car industry. These measures were somewhat grudgingly received. After his lunch with local businessmen he was asked why the government had not abolished the car tax instead of halving it, and why the charge had not been cut one or two years ago. But appearances are not everything. Suspicions of Labour run deep. Mr Smith's trip included a visit to Delcam Systems, a software manufacturer, which had put the message 'Welcome to John Smith' with Labour's red rose on the computer screens. But Mr Nigel Whalley, Delcam sales manager, who welcomed a beaming Mr Smith, was unhappy at the thought of a Labour election victory which 'would be bad for business'.</p>

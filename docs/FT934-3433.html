			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Swedish PM irritated by Brussels Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, yesterday accused Brussels of showing 'political insensitivity' in negotiations over Stockholm's application to join the European Union. But he said an accession agreement could be reached by the EU deadline of March 1 if several key issues were resolved at the next ministerial-level talks on December 21. In an interview with the FT, Mr Bildt raised the now celebrated case of snus (snuff). The EU is resisting a Swedish demand for a derogation from a EU ban on the orally-taken wet snuff that is widely popular in Sweden. 'The snuff issue is a detail in itself but it has become a symbol of Brussels' interference with the way of life of ordinary Swedes. There has been a degree of political insensitivity, especially on the part of the commission, that has not been to our advantage in the debate (about EU membership).' He said the issue was one of several 'crucial issues' which he wanted to 'sort out' at the December 21 meeting. The others cover differences in environmental standards, securing EU acceptance of Sweden's free trade agreements with the Baltic states and resolving EU demands that Sweden unwind its tight state monopoly on the production, importation and sale of alcohol. If they were resolved, talks would move on to the issues of regional policy, agriculture and budget contributions. 'These are all money related, and so are interlocked, and will probably be solved within the context of continuous negotiations. That should be feasible,' Mr Bildt said. The prime minister rejected suggestions that Sweden was starting to turn its back on Europe, an impression created by the rejection of the proposed merger between Volvo and France's Renault, opposition to the building of a road and rail bridge to Denmark and opinion polls showing majority opposition to joining the EU. He said the rejection of the Renault-Volvo merger was due not to Swedish nationalism but to what he described as the mistaken view that Volvo would subsequently suffer from interference by a 'nationalist French system'. Opposition to EU membership was no greater than anti-Union feeling in many member countries, he said. 'I am concerned (about Swedish opposition), but I am more concerned by general attitudes in Europe, not by any turning away from Europe in Sweden. 'Swedes are affected by the general shift of opinion caused by what is going on in Europe - the development of economies, unemployment, Yugoslavia and all that is associated with that. All these are seen as a failure of Europe.'</p>

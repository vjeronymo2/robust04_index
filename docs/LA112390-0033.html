			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JEWS FROM LOS ANGELES FIND FULFILLMENT, FRUSTRATION IN THEIR NEW LIVES IN  ISRAEL;  </P> <P> EMIGRES: THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THEIR NEW COUNTRY APPEALS TO MANY, BUT THE  PROSPECT OF ARMY SERVICE CAN BE TROUBLING.  </P> <P> They leave Los Angeles in response to an ancient imperative of Jewish life, a  powerful dream that promises them personal fulfillment as part of their  people's redemption. For that dream they leave behind friends, family and the  ease of life in America and "make aliyah," which in Hebrew literally translates  to ascent, but has come to mean immigration to Israel.  </P> <P> And then they must begin to grapple with the difficulties of Israeli life.  </P> <P> No one is certain how many Angelenos now live in Israel. The Los Angeles Jewish  Federation Council, whose Jerusalem office tries to keep in touch with them,  lists more than 1,000 households, but the actual number is surely higher; many  immigrants do not register with the federation or they drop out of contact with  it.  </P> <P> The majority of current immigrants are Orthodox Jews impelled by their belief  that it is a mitzvah, a spiritual obligation, to live in the Land of Israel.  "For a Jew, there is no other place to live," insisted Yehuda Richter, a Los  Angeles native who now makes his home in Elon Moreh on the West Bank.  </P> <P> Some immigrants are driven by a Zionist commitment to build the Jewish state.  Others are retirees who want to spend their last years in the Jewish homeland  or are simply Jews who want to make a significant change in their lives.  </P> <P> But the fact is, it's not easy. Los Angeles federation officials say that half  of all American immigrants will return to the United States within three years,  driven back by the difficulties of earning a living and of integrating  comfortably into Israeli society.  </P> <P> There is no typical Los Angeles-to-Israel emigre; they are a diverse lot. Here  are snapshots of a few, drawn from interviews conducted during a recent visit  to Israel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> David Kurz  </P> <P> In 1970, Kurz, a native of the San Fernando Valley, left graduate school in San  Diego, where he had been spending as much time working against the Vietnam War  as studying. Out of curiosity, he took a trip to Israel where, as a New Left  activist, he expected to find "horrible Israeli imperialists doing horrible  things to the Palestinians."  </P> <P> The truth, he said wryly, was "considerably more mixed," and to his surprise he  felt a sense of having come home. "I experienced this as the place I had the  most connection to, of any place on Earth," he said.  </P> <P> He returned to the United States to complete his graduate degree in social  work, got some experience in his field, then emigrated. Since then, says Kurz  -- a bearded, bearish man now fluent in Hebrew, married, and the father of two  young children -- he has never thought of coming back.  </P> <P> "Here's an opportunity to create," he said, "to build a society.  </P> <P> "Life in L.A. is a lot easier materially," he acknowledged. "But the quality of  life here in Israel is better. I can let my kids go out without fear of  violence. We have no pictures on milk cartons here in Israel asking us, 'Have  you seen this child?' We have no freeway shootings or drive-by shootings or  drug wars with automatic weapons."  </P> <P> As a parent, he worries about his children going into the army -- Israeli men  serve three years, women two. "We're not happy about it, of course," he said,  "but that's a part of life here, too. Part of the choice of helping to build  the society is also defending it."  </P> <P> The only thing he really misses, he said, is his extended family, all of whom  remain in the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Galia Kaspi  </P> <P> Kaspi -- her name was Gay as she was growing up on the Westside -- made aliyah  20 years ago, during the halcyon days following Israel's victory in the Six-Day  War. "I always felt the importance of Israel as a home where Jews could go,"  she said.  </P> <P> Just out of college then, she transformed herself into an Israeli moshavnik, a  farm girl, through tough physical labor, and she married an Israeli. Now a  single parent with two teen-age daughters in Tel Aviv, she must work two  teaching jobs to make ends meet. Her daughters also hold down jobs in order to  buy some of the things they need.  </P> <P> "Being a single parent is hard anywhere," Kaspi said. She, too, does not  consider returning to America.  </P> <P> Does she worry about the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf? "I worry about  it the way people in L.A. worry about the earthquake," she said. "What I really  worry about is my 17-year-old daughter going driving with a friend who just got  his driver's license two weeks ago -- that I worry about."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mark Feldman  </P> <P> Feldman grew up in Northridge, went to UCLA and emigrated to Israel in 1981.  There he started a travel agency, a business he knew nothing about, by hiring  two experts and learning from them. Although the agency is now  well-established, his income after taxes is $13,000 -- respectable in Israel  but far less than what a successful small businessman would make in the United  States. Even so, he said, he is not tempted to return.  </P> <P> "In Los Angeles, I could earn much more money," he said, "but it wouldn't  matter to the society or to me." He credits his agency's emphasis on  American-style customer service with having changed the travel business in  Jerusalem. "Israel is a place where you can still make a difference," he said.  </P> <P> But Feldman's business provides frequent reminders that, for many Americans,  the adjustment is a tough one.  </P> <P> "We sell a lot of one-way tickets back to the States," he said.  </P> <P> Joel and Cindy  </P> <P> Joel and Cindy -- they asked that their real names not be used -- are a young  Orthodox couple whose story is typical of those for whom aliyah fails. Both  lawyers, as immigrants they are now reaching the end of their third year, when  their special immigrant rights lapse and men become eligible for army duty.  </P> <P> A central problem is finances. With the money from the sale of their home in  Los Angeles, Joel and Cindy, who have three small children, bought a beautiful,  high-ceilinged apartment in Jerusalem for $280,000. But that choice was based  on their annual income in Los Angeles of $120,000.  </P> <P> In Israel, where they are completing their apprenticeship, they both work full  time for a combined income of less than $1,000 a month. Admission to the bar  would improve the financial picture, but not a lot, they say.  </P> <P> "My baby-sitter makes more than I do," Cindy said. She and Joel rely on help  from their parents to make it through each month.  </P> <P> In addition, their fulfillment as Jews, their core reason for making aliyah,  has not materialized. Joel says he is distressed by the relentless secularism  of Israeli society on one hand, and by what he calls the "unpleasantness" of  the religious Establishment on the other.  </P> <P> Cindy confesses that she often simply doesn't like Israelis. "In California,  you have the sense of people being nice," she said. She recalled a recent  incident in which shoppers in a Jerusalem store in which smoking was prohibited  rudely refused her request that they extinguish their cigarettes.  </P> <P> Some people who know them suggest that Joel and Cindy were betrayed by their  own expectations of the spiritual riches and professional opportunities that  life in Israel would offer.  </P> <P> "We came with a romantic notion," Cindy acknowledged.  </P> <P> They are considering returning to America, but they hesitate because, they say,  Israel is good for their children -- physically safe and emotionally warm, with  Judaism and Hebrew a natural part of their lives.  </P> <P> "Yeah, we're doing it for the children," Joel said wryly. "So they can be  Israelis -- and then they'll grow up and move to Los Angeles." (At least 50,000  Israelis have emigrated to Los Angeles in the last two decades.)The Wities  </P> <P> Another young Orthodox couple from Los Angeles, Dan and Penny Wities, are  taking a more cautious path by only "trying out life in Israel," they said.  They moved directly to a kibbutz with a population of about 500, not far from  the Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Complete adjustment to kibbutz life will take time. Even after a year, Dan and  Penny still sometimes feel outside the tight social network there. Moreover,  their ambition to work in their professions away from the kibbutz -- Dan is a  computer programmer, Penny an educator -- presents a dilemma to the kibbutz  leadership, which fears this choice will further hinder the couple's  integration and commitment.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Witieses say they have made a basically good adjustment.  "There may be problems," said Dan, a lifelong Zionist, "but there is no more  worthwhile goal than building the Jewish state."  </P> <P> But they retain some mixed feelings about making Israelis of their son, 8, and  daughter, 5.  </P> <P> For one thing, they worry about army service. "Very scary," Penny said. "I  might never forgive myself for moving here if my son got killed."  </P> <P> Dan, like David Kurz, is more philosophical, for himself as well as his son.  "You pay your dues. If you want a Jewish state, you have to serve in the army."  </P> <P> But right now, army service is far off, and the children are thriving -- fluent  in Hebrew, with a large peer group and an easy sense of being at home on on a  kibbutz that has fields, barns, factories and a wide variety of people and  activities.  </P> <P> Dan and Penny have separated themselves and their children from all the  familiar aspects of life in Los Angeles, 10,000 miles away, to create a strong  future for the Jewish people. Yet, as they watch their children become  seamlessly at home in Israel, pride is mixed with a sense of losing their  children to this new country.  </P> <P> If they remain, their children will become different from them -- Israelis, not  Americans. Dan and Penny, for example, speak an American-accented Hebrew that  will always mark them as immigrants. Five-year-old Adina, on the other hand, is  not only more comfortable in Hebrew but has now begun to speak English with a  noticeable Israeli accent.  </P> <P> Margolis, a free-lance journalist, is Los Angeles correspondent for the  Jerusalem Report, a new English-language weekly news magazine published in  Israel. He recently returned from a trip to Israel.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] says  it has demobilized and submitted more arms to the expanded  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group] under UN supervision, more than ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and AFL [Armed  Forces of Liberia] combined.    The NPFL commander in chief, Charles Gankay Taylor, says the  NPFL is the only faction under the Cotonou Peace Accord that has  submitted artillery pieces in furtherance of the disarmament  process. He said there are our detractors who continue to make  [word indistinct] action of the NPFL, saying even when we do  good, some say we didn't do good. Mr. Taylor said there is no  need for Liberians to continue killing each other and cautioned  those who desire the leadership of this country not to pursue  the electoral process. The NPFL leader said politicians are  delaying the peace process because they are afraid to go to  elections.    At the same time, the NPFL has demonstrated confidence in  the  ability of Liberian women to play a key role in the  reconstruction and development of Liberia. The leadership of  the NPFL in expressing support for greater involvement in  government and other key sectors in society for Liberian women,  said the NPFL, through its political wing, will continue to  ensure that Liberian women who have the potential are sent to  high offices in the new Liberia.    The assurance was given over the weekend by NPFL leader,  Charles Gankay Taylor, when he appointed Mrs. Dorothy  Musuleng-Cooper as the first woman minister to the post of  foreign affairs to the transitional government. The appointment  of Mrs. Cooper was greeted with an applause of acclamation  coinciding with formal pronouncement of the decision by the NPFL  to take its seat on the transitional government.</p>

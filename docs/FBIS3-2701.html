"Anyone who makes an investment in this field will gain the  land-use right in accordance with the measures concerning the  leasing of state land-use rights, and enjoy preferential  treatment," said a municipal official.    Shanghai has 35 million sq m [square meters] of dilapidated  housing and other old buildings where 1.46 million households,  about 60 percent of the total households in the city, take  shelter.    These edifices, which generally lack kitchen and toilet  facilities, account for one third of the total residential areas  in the metropolis.    "To enable all its residents to have a living space  averaging  10 sq m per capita by the end of this century, the municipal  government plans to raise funds through various channels to  speed up the transformation of the old urban districts," the  official said.    He noted that foreign business people are welcomed to join  in  the transformation in forms of joint ventures, co-operation or  with sole foreign investment.</p>

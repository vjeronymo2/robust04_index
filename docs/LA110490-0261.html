			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENTERTAINING;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA PARTIES -- PAST AND FUTURE;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD A LA CARTE;  </P> <P> IN FILMLAND'S GOLDEN AGE, THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESSFUL ENTERTAINING WAS LESS  DEPENDENT UPON WHAT WAS SERVED THAN ON WHO WAS SERVED.  </P> <P> A recipe for successful entertaining during the Golden Age of Hollywood: Take  one soupcon of food (almost anything would do). Add large splashes of alcohol.  Mix in good company. Serve with relish.  </P> <P> In the end, the recipe's success was less dependent upon what was served than  on who was served. Hollywood was short on sophistication about food and wine.  What it had was plenty of money -- and lots of style.  </P> <P> Consider screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, author of "Citizen Kane" and  Hollywood's most famous man who went to dinner. Hostesses could count on  Mankiewicz' sparkling wit to lend fame to the most ordinary dinner gathering.  Of Orson Welles he once remarked: "There but for the grace of God, goes God."  Of Charlie Chaplin: "If people don't sit at Chaplin's feet, he goes and stands  where they're sitting." Of a fellow screenwriter: "It ought to be against the  law for that guy to be alone with a typewriter."  </P> <P> One night, Mankiewicz was having dinner at the home of producer Arthur  Hornblow, who considered himself one of Hollywood's foremost gourmets. In the  midst of dinner, Mankiewicz began to turn green and all at once excused  himself. The company was aghast. When he returned a few minutes later, he was  looking better. Turning casually to his host he remarked, "Don't worry, Arthur.  The white wine came up with the fish."  </P> <P> Mankiewicz was as famous for his capacity for imbibition as he was for his wit.  Sam Goldwyn once lambasted Mankiewicz for his drinking and, to make his point,  thrust a script by a younger writer under the veteran's nose, announcing, "This  is what I mean by screen writing!" Mankiewicz read the new pages, looked up at  Goldwyn and responded, "He should drink."  </P> <P> Perhaps. But not at the Goldwyns. The Goldwyns were undeniably the premier  hosts of Hollywood. Director George Cukor called an invitation to Sam and  Frances Goldwyn's the "hardest ticket in town." And yet director Henry Koster  told a tale about a fabulous evening at the Goldwyns when they were celebrating  a new film. The best of everything was served. But shortly after his departure,  Koster realized his wife had left a glove behind. He dashed back, only to  discover the rich and powerful Goldwyn pouring the remains of undrunk glasses  of Lafite Rothschild back into a bottle.  </P> <P> Still, people clamored to go to the Goldwyns. Actress Katharine Hepburn recalls  that the Goldwyns traditionally sat across from one another in the middle of  the table, and their guests were placed around them. "You always knew where  your career stood," she says, "by where you sat."  </P> <P> San Simeon was another coveted dinner invitation -- and once again, the food  was beside the point. At William Randolph Hearst's fantastic castle, diners  were served in a vast room under a 400-year-old monastery ceiling. But amid the  elegant plates and sparkling silver there were ordinary bottles of catsup and  mustard.  </P> <P> Still, even when Hollywood ate hamburgers, it did it with style. One Hollywood  denizen told of dining at the Kirk Douglas' and being served burgers from  silver platters.  </P> <P> Mike Todd, producer husband of Elizabeth Taylor, once impressed guests by  having their steaks specially flown in from Kansas City -- an incredible  extravagance. He was going to barbecue them and invited his guests to come  inside until the fire was perfect. In the interim, a fox ate the steaks. Todd  sent out for Chinese food.  </P> <P> If you were actually going out to dinner in Hollywood, you went to one of  Hollywood's two and only favorite restaurants: Chasen's or Romanoff's. Anything  else was slumming. Mostly, though, you ate at home. Movie-star cookbooks from  the golden days are filled with fascinating recipes for such esoterica as  Buttermilk Griddle Cakes (Gary Cooper), Meat Loaf (Mae Clarke, who insisted  that "The beauty of a good meat loaf is that if there is any left it makes  delicious sandwiches . . .") and chicken broth (Irene Dunne, who pleaded with  her fans not to omit the nutmeg in the recipe. "It is just the touch of  flavoring that adds zest to the broth.").  </P> <P> Few stars, however, were as candid as Clara Bow. She offered a recipe for  Deviled Oysters on the Half Shell (see below left). And Bow gave due credit to  her cook; cooking the oysters herself, she said, was simply too much for her.  </P> <P> DEVILED OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL  </P> <P> 4 dozen shucked oysters, shells reserved  </P> <P> 3 spring onions, diced  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 1/2 cup milk  </P> <P> 1/4 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon dry mustard  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard  </P> <P> 1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> 2 mushroom caps  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon parsley  </P> <P> 1 egg yolk  </P> <P> Buttered cracker crumbs  </P> <P> Wash and chop oysters. Cook onions in butter three minutes, add flour and stir  well until blended; add milk and cream. Add mustards, Worcestershire sauce,  mushrooms and parsley. Stir in reserved oysters and 2-3 tablespoons of their  liquor. Heat and stir just until mixture thickens and begins to simmer, then  mix in egg yolk; place mixture in deep halves of oyster shells, cover with  buttered crumbs and bake at 400 degrees about 15 minutes. Makes 32.  </P></p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Soviet Union's prophet of doom: Ex-Gorbachev aide explains 'empty' policies of anti-crisis plan PROFESSOR Nikolai Petrakov, former economic adviser to President Mikhail Gorbachev, has emerged as the foremost public critic of the Soviet government's latest anti-crisis plan. His analysis savages the programme, describing it as an ill-thought-out series of measures without a political base. The leading Soviet economist, who quit his Kremlin job in January because of the government's disastrous economic policy, says in a critique of the new plan - completed on Monday and thus before the Gorbachev-Yeltsin accord was announced - that 'its phraseology is modern and progressive, while its content amounts to tough administrative measures'. On the one hand, the programme adopted by the Soviet parliament on Tuesday sets out essential principles for switching to a market economy: a cut in state spending, price liberalisation, privatisation and de-monopolisation. But on the whole, there is 'no clear mechanism' for the successful implementation of these measures, Prof Petrakov writes. Prof Petrakov's criticisms, though trenchant, are still taken seriously in the Kremlin - and some of them may yet modify the still-developing government plan. The suggestions yesterday that Mr Valentin Pavlov, the prime minister, was prepared to form some sort of coalition government, could also mean the adoption of some of the radicals' ideas. Although the recent joint declaration between President Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin may help provide the political support Prof Petrakov cited as a prerequisite for necessary reform, the programme still suffers from a number of contradictions. While calling for 'emergency budgets' to tackle runaway spending, the government plan does not spell out areas where cuts can be made, apart from calling for a moratorium on new spending. The 13-page analysis by Prof Petrakov says an inventory of traditional expenditure would offer a real chance of 'finding reserves' for budget cuts. He and other proponents of radical economic reform have consistently singled out the military-industrial complex as an important source of inflation because of the money printed to support it. 'Without a sharp decrease and redistribution of resources devoted to the military industrial complex, structural readjustment and anti-inflationary measures are in general impossible,' says Prof Petrakov. He believes that this sector accounts for at least 15-18 per cent of GNP, compared to the official figure of 6.4 per cent. As for the government's plan to liberalise prices by October 1992, he said this would cause galloping inflation in the absence of resolute measures to break up and privatise state monopolies and overcome severe shortages. To deal with shortages, the government proposes tax incentives for enterprises to produce more food and consumer goods, as well as the privatisation of two-thirds of small businesses by the end of next year. While proclaiming the need to take medium and large-scale enterprises out of state hands (without a specific time-scale), Prof Petrakov says the state is leaving itself ample room to interfere, both with the running of enterprises, and their privatisation. He says that new bodies foreseen to handle privatisation must be made completely independent of the government.</p>

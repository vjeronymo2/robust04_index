			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / French delay debate on Maastricht pact THE FRENCH government yesterday postponed debate in the national assembly on constitutional amendments required for ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, yielded to opposition demands for more time and sent the bill back to committee. The debate, which had been set to end on Thursday, will now resume next Tuesday. Opening yesterday's session, Mr Beregovoy called for a 'great movement of national agreement'. Amid catcalls from right-wing Gaullist members, he promised the government would be receptive to detailed amendments and said the assembly would in future be fully consulted throughout the transition towards economic and monetary union, scheduled towards the end of this decade. But he made clear that there could be no question of renegotiating the Maastricht treaty, warning that if parliament seemed likely to obstruct the necessary constitutional revisions the president would put the revisions before the electorate in a referendum. 'If there is any risk that the reform might be buried,' he said, 'we shall go to a referendum. I should regret it; but if a referendum is necessary, neither the president nor the government fears the result of an appeal to the people'. Mr Beregovoy rejected opposition arguments that the single European currency would mean the abandonment of French independence. On the contrary, he said, the Emu system would strengthen French influence over economic policy. Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, followed the prime minister at the rostrum of the National Assembly, with a strong plea for a more politically united Europe.</p>

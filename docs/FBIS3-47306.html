			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "45 Years of Growth and Victory of the LPA"] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] To continue punishing the  enemy, in May 1962 the Lao People's Army [LPA] started the  battle to liberate Louang Namtha and destroyed 10 enemy  battalions. After this they went on to new victories. The LPA  maintained its control of the situation and attacked the enemy  fiercely at many points. In addition they resolutely beat back  the large enemy offensive in the area of Phou Soung and the  junction at Sala Phou Khoun 27 times, liberated Kasi District,  Vang Viang District, Hinheup and other places and forced the  American imperialists and the opposing side to sign the Geneva  Treaty of 1962 for Laos and agree to the formation of the  coalition government of the three factions which reunited Laos  for the second time.    In addition to supporting and using the rightist forces, the  American intelligence department created a special force (the  Vang Pao force). This was the second force under the direct  command of the Americans. Its purpose was to carry out the long  term policy of dividing the nation and destroying the  revolution. They built this force up from 5,000 to 30,000 and  gradually used this force to attack and seize liberated areas.  They used this force to seize Pha Thi in an insane attack. This  was a position in a liberated area of ours.    After they were painfully defeated at Pha Thi and other  places, they hoped to redeem themselves from these defeats. The  American imperialists assembled 50 battalions of special forces  including many Thai battalions. With major support from American  forces and the engagement of every type of aircraft including  strategic B-52's, they started Operation "Kou Kiat" [redeem  honor] in August 1969, an insane attack against the liberated  areas of the Plain of Jars and Xieng Khouang. After they had  advanced their forces, they put into effect the policy of the  three eliminations which was very brutal.    In order to punish the enemy, at the beginning of December  1970 the LPA and patriotic, neutralist forces fiercely attacked  the special forces of Vang Pao. They destroyed all the major  positions of the enemy so that the special forces of Vang Pao  were not able to further defend the reactionary Thai forces in  the center. The YMT 21 of the special forces of Vang Pao was  seriously hurt, and then their YMT 23 was wiped out completely.  This caused the three Thai battalions on Phou Keng to be cut  off. That same month the flank of the LPA south of the Plain of  Jars attacked the Thai forces in Ban Ton Village and wiped out  four battalions. By attacking along with the other flank in the  West, the LPA was able to attack the two battalions of the  special forces of Vang Pao at Meuang Soui and shatter them. At  the same time we wiped out the Thai reactionary forces located  at Phou Keng completely.    With this storm of attacks by the patriotic armed forces, we  caused the enemy to lose spirit. In just 3 days of fierce  coordinated attacks from every direction and flank, our LPA  liberated the Plain of Jars and Meuang Soui and completely took  back the area the enemy had seized. They drove the enemy back to  its bases at Sam Thong, Long Cheng, Sala Phou Khoun and Kasi.  They had eliminated and weakened more than 20 enemy battalions.  Of these 10 were Thai reactionary battalions.    Because of their incorrigible love of war, the American  imperialists started the Lam Son 719 operation at the beginning  of 1971. They used more 20,000 soldiers of the Saigon puppet  regime supported by American aircraft and artillery. But the  army and people of Savannakhet working with the liberation army  from the South of Vietnam resolutely defeated them in the battle  called "Lam Son 719" along highway 9. Their forces were  shattered during 44 days and nights. This was a heavy blow for  the "Nixon" doctrine that Indochinese should be used to fight  Indochinese. [passage omitted]</p>

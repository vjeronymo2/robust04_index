			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Conference brings two-track CIS THE COMMONWEALTH of Independent States yesterday embarked on a two-tiered future, with only seven of its 10 states agreeing on a charter for closer political and economic integration. Ukraine, Moldova and Turkmenistan refused to sign the long-discussed charter to create a defence alliance, an economic co-ordination committee and an interstate court. However, all 10 participants at yesterday's summit in the Belorussian capital of Minsk signed a declaration that any state would be free to sign up to the charter in future. Moreover, an interstate bank, seen as crucial for reviving collapsing interstate trade, was also endorsed by all 10. It is to establish a badly needed clearing system and provides for the possibility of co-ordinating credit and monetary policy among the republics that continue to use the rouble. The leaders also agreed to set up a common framework for the securities being issued by republics as part of moves to a market economy. Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belorussian leader and summit host, told a news conference: 'I must disappoint those who were predicting the end of the Commonwealth. We have seen things eye-to-eye as never before.' Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev said the signatories of the charter were 'the Commonwealth integrators', thus acknowledging two different kinds of Commonwealth membership had emerged. But President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, which has been the most recalcitrant Commonwealth member, said the states now respected each other's right to be different: 'There are some questions which can only be decided in the Commonwealth but others must be left to bilateral relations. Today's meeting has shown we have begun to respect each other.' Russian President Boris Yeltsin said: 'We understand we cannot live without each other even though Russia is better protected. Russia cannot live without Tajikistan, Ukraine or any other republic.' The meeting's clearest failure was a rejection of a Russian proposal to take over nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. The next meeting of CIS leaders is to be held in Armenia on April 13.</p>

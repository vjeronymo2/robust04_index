			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / GDP exceeds estimates THE ECONOMY expanded faster in the second quarter than initially estimated partly as a result of people saving less, government figures showed yesterday. However, the platform for recovery still appears to be fragile. Pre-tax personal incomes between April and June showed their first quarterly fall for 27 years, partly because of low wage increases, a fall in social security benefits and weaker investment income linked to lower interest rates. Another sign of economic weakness was an unexpectedly large fall of 3.5 per cent in the second quarter in manufacturing investment, after several quarters in which capital spending by this sector had appeared to be on a slow upward trend. Second-quarter gross domestic product grew 0.6 per cent in real, inflation-adjusted terms compared with the January-to-March period. The seasonally adjusted figure was higher than the 0.5 per cent estimate first published by the Central Statistical Office. In the year to the second quarter, the economy expanded 2 per cent. Excluding North Sea oil and gas extraction, GDP was up 0.5 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, a year-on-year increase of 1.7 per cent. The savings ratio - personal savings as a percentage of personal disposable income - fell from a revised 11.8 per cent in the first quarter to 10.1 per cent in the second quarter. This was the biggest quarterly decline in the ratio since early 1986. The ratio reflects changes in savings behaviour by individuals as well as non-profitmaking bodies such as charities and universities. The fall came after a long period in which people saved more, inhibiting strong growth in consumer spending. In 1991 and 1992, the savings ratio stayed high at 10.1 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively. In spite of an increase in dividend payments, pre-tax personal income fell 0.4 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, measured in current prices. Total personal disposable income - income less taxes - fell 1 per cent in current prices in the quarter and 1.6 per cent in inflation-adjusted terms. This was the biggest fall since early 1985. Yesterday's revised figures show five successive quarters of growth in the onshore economy since the recession officially ended in the second quarter last year. Statisticians now say the recession lasted seven quarters, not eight as previously thought, making it about the same length as the 1979-81 economic decline. The CSO data also highlights: Consumer spending rose 0.4 per cent in real terms in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, for a 1.6 per cent rise on the corresponding period last year. Output of the financial and business services industry expanded in the April-June period by a quarterly 1.1 per cent and by 3.5 per cent on a year earlier. The comparable figures for all service industries were 0.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively. The second-quarter gross domestic product deflator, indicating general inflationary pressures throughout the economy, was recorded as zero. This is the lowest figure for a quarterly deflator since 1986 and illustrates the low price pressures partly related to a fall in export prices linked to sterling's devaluation. Companies' receipts in the second quarter were Pounds 1.4bn higher than spending, the second consecutive quarterly surplus.</p>

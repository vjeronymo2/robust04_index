			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> unidentified correspondent; Peres speaking in English fading  into Hungarian translation; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] A definitive settlement of the  Palestinian-Israeli conflict cannot be expected by tomorrow; but  it can now be expected. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres,  with whom I recorded a brief interview, is himself visibly  confident.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Mr. Peres, do you think  that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] will be able to prevent  the agreement?    [Peres] They might try to prevent the agreement coming into  being but I do not think they will succeed. The majority of  Palestinians, just as the majority of Israelis, too, want peace.  Consequently, the decision is not in Hamas' hands. They murder  people and they would like to annihilate the peace process  itself by murdering people, but I do not think they will get far  with this.    [Correspondent] How do you see the future of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement after the postponement of the  first deadline for the Israeli military withdrawal?    [Peres] It was not a postponement. You know, the parties  concerned agreed in Oslo that they would allow one month after  the signing for informal meetings; they allowed another two  months for the agreement to be translated, so that every tiny  detail could be clarified. But it turned out that the time at  our disposal was extremely short. We are unable to settle all  necessary matters in two months. Now we have to clarify just  how much time we still need.    [Correspondent] Finally, how do you see the possibility of  Syria's involvement?    [Peres] Well, we would like the Syrians to be involved in  the  settlement efforts, since we would like to put a full-stop to  the old conflicts in the region and we would like to build a new  Middle East for the future. Naturally, we need new partners for  this, partners with whom we can work together. At present,  Syria is not showing too much flexibility [hajlekonysag]. But  it is also a fact that at the time of the latest visit by U.S.  State Secretary Warren Christopher, Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad indicated with certain gestures that Syria does not wish  to be left out of the negotiations.</p>

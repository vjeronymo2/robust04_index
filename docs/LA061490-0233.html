BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DOMESTIC ADVERTISING DROP SEEN  </P> <P> Domestic advertising spending is expected to total $130.4 billion this year,  off slightly from initial projections in the face of weakening local  advertising budgets, a prominent forecaster said today.  </P> <P> Robert J. Coen, who heads the forecasting unit at the advertising agency  McCann-Erickson, said in his semiannual report that domestic advertising will  rise 5.3% this year, down from the 6.2% gain he estimated in December.  </P> <P> In newspapers, ad revenue was off 1.3% in the first quarter as a 2.7% gain in  retail advertising was unable to offset a 6.4% decline in classified spending.  </P> <P> Local TV ad spending by car dealers slumped 21% in the first quarter, while  bank and department store ad expenditures were off 14% and 13% respectively.  </P></p>

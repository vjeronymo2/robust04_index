			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- A lingering row within the  governing coalition on Thursday [14 April] continued the  stalemate in talks over future policies and the choice of a  successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Leaders of three of the seven coalition parties met Thursday  evening and agreed not to endorse a package of proposals adopted  at an earlier meeting of the coalition's decision-making caucus  made up of secretaries general, coalition officials said.    The three parties are the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the  largest coalition contingent, and its two allies -- the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and new party Sakigake  [Harbinger].    At the gathering of the coalition executives, which Sakigake  boycotted, they shared the view that the eight-month-old  alliance might collapse if its components reject the agreement,  the officials said.    The agreement calls on all top leaders of coalition parties  to decide by themselves to convene a meeting to discuss the  makeup of a new coalition government and the selection of a  candidate to replace Hosokawa, the officials said.    It also included an accord to resume talks on policy matters  toward establishment of the next administration and an appeal  for Sakigake, a tiny component of the ruling union, to return to  the negotiating table, they said.    Sakigake, led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura,  convened a general meeting Thursday evening of all its 15 House  of Representatives members, who unanimously agreed to reject the  coalition accord on the reopening of policy talks, party  officials said.    Sakigake has contended that top party leaders, and not the  secretaries general-level representatives, should contemplate a  combination of political parties that would comprise the new  coalition government and find a successor to Hosokawa.    It is widely believed the party's stance is intended to  prevent the coalition's main strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary  general of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), and his ally,  Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, from dominating  policy-making on the choice of a new premier.    Under the Hosokawa administration, the personal rivalry  between Ozawa and Takemura flared up many times over such key  policy issues as political reform, the partial opening of  Japan's rice market, and Hosokawa's abortive attempts to impose  a new value-added tax called the "National Welfare Tax" and  reshuffle the cabinet.    In a three-way meeting Thursday morning, SDP Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama, DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake's  Takemura agreed that a forum of all coalition heads should seek  a breakthrough in the selection process.    The three parties earlier called for a meeting of the  coalition leaders, but Shinseito, Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan  New Party (JNP) rejected the appeal.    Following rejection of the package by the three coalition  heads and Sakigake, the deputy chiefs met twice and agreed to  allow the SDP and the DSP to take their time to fine-tune  opinions within the parties, coalition officials said.    The coalition executives will gather again on Friday  afternoon, the officials said.</p>

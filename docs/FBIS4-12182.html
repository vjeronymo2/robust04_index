			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus April 5, IRNA -- Visiting Vice Speaker of  Iran's Parliament (Majlis) Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Ruhani told a  group of Iraqi dissidents here Tuesday that Iran felt itself  obliged to support Iraqi Muslims.    He further expressed Iran's concern for the fate of the  Iraqi  Muslims and said the Iraqi nation would surely come to master  its own destiny in a near future.    Ruhani, also the secretary of the supreme National Security  Council, commented that the arrogant world employed all in its  might to hinder the victory of the Islamic revolution and  liberation of the Iraqi nation.    He urged the Iraqi opposition to have solidarity to get the  best from the present conditions and play a more active role in  the international circles.</p>

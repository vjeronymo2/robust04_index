			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / France ready to seize chance of interest rate cut THE Bank of France will seize the opportunity to cut interest rates following yesterday's move by the Bundesbank, according to economists and currency analysts in Paris. The intervention rate, which sets the floor for money market interest rates, is expected to be cut today or early next week by between a quarter and a half of a percentage point from its present level of 6.75 per cent. The intervention rate has remained unchanged since the summer's European currency crisis despite pressure on the government of Mr Edouard Balladur to reduce borrowing costs to stimulate France's recession-hit economy. 'They are sure to move now,' said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. He said that the only question was the size of the cut in the intervention rate. The cautious approach of the French monetary authorities to interest rate cuts and the recent weakness of the French franc against the D-Mark, however, suggest an initial cut of a quarter of a percentage point rather than a larger reduction. The Paris stock market responded enthusiastically to the Bundesbank rate cut. The CAC-40 index rose by almost 2 per cent to 2,189. The prospects for reduced interest rates were also enhanced yesterday by statistics from the Bank of France which showed the net deficit in foreign exchange reserves had narrowed from FFr65.3bn (Pounds 7.6bn) to FFr55.8bn in the week to October 14. The need for the central bank to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves, which were exhausted in the unsuccessful defence of the franc's ERM parity with the D-Mark, has been one of the principal reasons behind the financial authorities' commitment to a stable franc and the cautious approach to interest rate cuts.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Police probe British Gas land project Greater Manchester Police are investigating a land development by British Gas. The force has been called in by a government agency which wants the company torepay Pounds 4.4m of public grants. Central Manchester Development Corporation, an agency of the Department of the Environment, agreed a Pounds 5.4m citygrant to British Gas for the redevelopment of a 7.5-acre site near the city centre. The grant was based on estimated costs of Pounds 17.8m, but the actual figure was only about Pounds 12m. Of the Pounds 5.4m total grant, to be paid in stages, Pounds 4.4m had been handed over before the corporation realised what had happened. The redevelopment involved a 110,000 sq ft office block to house the BritishCouncil, which relocated from London to Manchester last year, creating 650 jobsin the city. British Gas yesterday confirmed police were investigating. Ms Dru Vesty, director of British Gas Land Investments, said: 'We are offering them every facility.' The police were brought in because the development corporation is obliged to use independent means to find out whether or not the law has been broken. A civil action against British Gas is also likely if there is no agreement over the return of the money. At the heart of the dispute is the means by which the government funds inner city regeneration projects. Public money is supposed to be used only to reduce the risk of losses to a level where the private sector can afford a development. If, for example, a derelict site would be worth only Pounds 16m after redevelopment, but the work would cost Pounds 20m, a city grant from the government of Pounds 4m would be used to bridge the gap. This works out at a four-to-one ratio between private and public sector funding. But if the cost of the same project worked out at Pounds 18m, the grant would be only Pounds 2m. In practice, the ratio between developed value and grant has to be at least two-to-one, but is rarely allowed above nine-to-one, as this is considered a reasonable threshold for the private sector to carry all the risk. In this instance, the development was estimated to be worth about Pounds 12.4m after completion, which would qualify for a Pounds 5.4m government contribution towards estimated costs of Pounds 17.8m, an acceptable ratio of 3.3-to-one. Because the costs actually worked out at less than the developed value, the project would not havequalified at all had initial estimates been more accurate. One argument now is likely to centre on whether British Gas believed it was entitled to government grants worth a third of the costs of the project, whatever they were. A secondary issue will be whether the development corporation shouldhave spotted the discrepancy between estimated and actual costs sooner. One defence that civil servants may advance is they did not expect to have to supervise a large quoted public company as closely as they would a privately owned developer.</p>

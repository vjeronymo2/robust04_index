			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: Slow revolution at La Scala - Andrew Clark reviews 'Rigoletto' and 'Elektra' and finds Riccardo Muti hard at work trying to change corrupt 19th century traditions While Milan's investigating magistrates have led the drive to clean up Italian public life, Riccardo Muti has been campaigning to rid La Scala of corrupt performing practices. As music director of his country's leading opera house, Muti is finding that traditions in 19th century repertoire are as ingrained as corruption in politics. Change requires a minor revolution. The operas of Verdi's middle period form the crux of the battle - works which course through La Scala's blood, arousing intense audience passions. No one anticipates the high notes at the end of an aria more eagerly than the Milanese; none is more ready to applaud the final flourish. Taking his cue from recent Verdi scholarship (which Italian theatres have been notoriously slow to acknowledge), Muti has been reminding his compatriots that most of these display notes were not written by the composer. He also argues that to interrupt with frequent bursts of applause is to misunderstand Verdi's quest for dramma in musica. Muti fired his first tentative shot four years ago when he performed La traviata without the traditional cuts. But the educative process has only taken wing in the past month with Rigoletto - the first time this popular work has been performed at La Scala for 23 years. The display notes were dropped. The performance followed the New Critical Edition to the letter. And to propagate his ideas before the premiere, Muti held a televised masterclass at the Milan Conservatory, during which he quoted Verdi's letters, gave musical illustrations and explained why he did not want interruptions for applause. The fact that the first-night audience respected Muti's wishes is a measure of his authority. At later performances (I attended the fourth), the loggionisti were quick to silence any spontaneous applause. Muti wants other Italian theatres to follow suit, and he will take his own campaign a stage further in 1996 with Il trovatore. It may not please 'the lovers of vocal mania', to use Muti's words, but it should lead to a 'less veristic, more civilised' style of Verdi singing, one which accords with the current emphasis on historical performance. My initial reaction to Rigoletto was to regret the absence of those very practices which lend a unique sense of theatre to Verdi performances at La Scala. Nevertheless, the potential for a Rigoletto of clean dramatic sweep was there. The fact that it did not materialise was due to other factors. Two Wagnerian-length intervals sabotaged the evening's flow: one half-hour break after the first act should be enough. And if Muti wants dramma in musica rather than melodramma, he needs a more imaginative, less pictorial staging. The period settings of Ezio Frigerio and Franca Squarciapino were Zeffirellian in scale - a gold baroque interior at the start, stained-glass windows for the second act and a brick facade for the finale, which had the Duke waltzing along what looked like the top floor of a derelict warehouse. The producer, Gilbert Deflo, told the story clearly but all too conventionally. The singing was good if unexceptional. Roberto Alagna was the handsome young Duke, throwing off his top notes with ease but delivering his love song to Gilda in an unremitting forte, essaying a nice trill at the end of 'Parmi veder' but scarcely caressing the words. There was little sign of Bellinian grace, Gigli-like charm - or the swagger of a natural libertine. Hobbling around like a club-footed Punch, Leo Nucci's Rigoletto captured the public poison and private soul of the court jester, but the vocal acting lacked distinction. The young Hungarian soprano Andrea Rost made an ideal Gilda - innocent, pretty and musical, with a silvery voice reminiscent of Reri Grist. Dimitri Kavrakos was the innocuous Sparafucile, Mariana Pentcheva an unsubtle Maddalena. Despite some breathless accompaniments, Muti's conducting bristled with grandezza and tenderness. The other late-season production has been Elektra. La Scala always used to import its Strauss from Germany, making sure Wolfgang Sawallisch was available to guarantee the musical quality. This time it entrusted a new staging to Italians. Giuseppe Sinopoli conducted - lumpily, sluggishly. Luca Ronconi and his designers, Gae Aulenti and Giovanna Buzzi, seemed unsure what to do with the piece. Mycenae had the trappings of a modern abattoir. Chrysothemis and Klytemnestra wore bare-breasted feather gowns. Elektra was reduced to a war of the bitches. Hanna Schwarz's Klytemnestra made every word count, but was too svelte and noble for the guilt-ridden queen. As Chrysothemis, Sabine Hass shrieked round the stage like a hysterical bird. Gabriele Schnaut's Elektra was tame and prosaic. The whole performance lacked tension, menace and momentum.</p>

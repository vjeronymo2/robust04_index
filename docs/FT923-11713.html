			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index collapses through 2,400 UNSETTLING reports on the domestic economy left the London stock market vulnerable yesterday to the widespread setback across European bourses which followed Tokyo's fall to a six-year low. Although selling pressure remained moderate, the UK market collapsed through the FT-SE 2,400 mark, finishing 27.7 down at 2,387.9, its lowest closing level since April 3, when the stock market was gearing itself for the UK general election. Equities opened weaker, and soon moved lower following a poor start by the September futures contract on the Footsie. In addition to the bad news from Tokyo, shares had to face continued softness in sterling. Throughout the session, the Footsie September future provided a depressing lead, slipping to 2,384 at one stage and failing to hold a rally in later dealings. Worries about the UK housing market deepened after the building societies disclosed a heavy annualised fall in mortgage commitments. The reaction on the German stock market to the latest domestic money supply data revived fears that the key Lombard rate might be raised, forcing UK rates to follow suit. At mid-morning, statistics showing a 0.2 per cent dip in UK retail sales and a current account deficit on trade of Pounds 722m in June were taken as remains depressed. Unsubstantiated reports that the UK government was about to announce swingeing cuts in public spending completed the mood of gloom. At the day's low, just after the trade figures announcement, the Footsie sank to 2,376.8, down 38.8. There were substantial losses in shares across the range of the market, with many building and construction stocks suffering afresh. There was little support behind the closing rally in share prices, which most traders believed reflected little more than bear-closing operations by traders wanting stock to meet earlier selling commitments. The argument that UK stocks offer good value was repeated, albeit desparingly, by equity strategists. However, some comfort was drawn from the modest level of turnover; Seaq volume of 428.1m shares compared with Tuesday's 421.5m, which was worth only Pounds 864.1m in terms of customer business. Traders also pointed out that London's fall of 1.1 per cent was only about a half of the losses suffered yesterday on the French and German equity markets. Suggestions that the UK government might be about to introduce heavy reductions in public spending found a ready reception in a market where fund managers are said to be depressed by 'a feeling of helplessness, as if the government cannot do anything about this recession'. There were very few exceptions to the general gloom. British Airways lost the gain of the previous day as the stock market reassessed the implications of the deal with USAir. ICI, with trading figures due shortly, gave ground again, and Reuters weakened sharply as Wall Street opened the new session with a 26 Dow points fall in early trading.</p>

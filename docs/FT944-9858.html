			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Media Futures: It's advertising, Jim - but not as we know it / How juicy will new media opportunities be for ad agencies? Michael Thompson-Noel finds out What will advertising look like in the digital, video, interactive, online, multimedia superfuture? Will it differ greatly from the steam-age advertising in present-day media: newspapers, magazines, television, radio, cinema and posters? How juicy will it be? Try this: We are watching the Olympic Games of 2004. The picture fades. Up comes a message. View our commercial and we'll give you a Kentucky Fried Chicken Family Feast at half price every Friday night for a month, it says. (Advertisers have to be polite in 2004 because there is a gadget on our PC-TV that zaps into oblivion any rude or junk messages we do not wish to see). We are hungry. So we push the OK button on our PC-TV and view the commercial. Somewhere far away, KFC's computer smoothes into action. On to our screen comes a picture of Arry the Aroma, holding a plate of chicken and fries. Next, we see footage of Arry wafting along our street. Up to our very house. His finger on our doorbell. A most seductive fellow. 'Hi, Mike,' he says. (The computer is all-knowing). 'You appreciate better than anyone in your street that KFC's the greatest taste there is. What can I offer you tonight?' In this scenario we have invited an advertiser to talk to us. He is enjoying a one-to-one relationship with us, something on which advertisers in the superfuture will set tremendous store. For companies of all kinds, it could mean life or death. This trip to the Olympics of 2004 was conjured up recently by Patrick Collister, executive creative director at the Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising agency in London, for an O&amp;M conference about 'new' media. It illustrates how senior creative people in ad agencies are anticipating the superfuture. According to Collister: 'Brand values are going to be increasingly important as we journey down the superhighway. And in supporting those brands, creativity will be increasingly at a premium.' Until now, he says, advertisers and their audiences have had a straightforward relationship. If you watch my commercials, says an advertiser, I will pay for your TV programmes. But this relationship is about to change. Advertisers are establishing what they call a dialogue with consumers. Instead of soliciting responses, they may well find themselves responding to solicitations. This is called collaborative advertising. And various things may happen. Advertisers who irritate their customers with witless and aggressive messages may find themselves expunged - booted out of the home. Conversely, advertising that is friendly and engaging and which espouses relevant brand values will be worth its weight in diamonds. Collister's imaginative journey to the 2004 Olympics is not far-fetched. Yet the most interesting feature of the way the advertising business is preparing for the superfuture is not the boldness of its conference-going seers, but its caution and its caginess. It is not lathering itself to bits but sitting relatively still and spending little money. It is waiting and it is watching, like a fat spider in a softly shimmering web. There are reasons for this watchfulness. First, people in advertising agencies are specialists in communications. They know a lot about media evolution. Second, they know that the superfuture will not be technology-led but consumer-led. So they are not, primarily, watching the technology. They are watching the consumer, monitoring his likes and dislikes. And consumers, at least in Britain, are at present 'massively luke-warm' on new media, in the words of Rhona Tridgell, client service director at O&amp;M. Many adults are technophobic. They don't want technologies to converge. They want them held apart. 'Consumers will only take a real interest in new media,' says Tridgell, 'when it is useful, affordable, user-friendly and time-saving.' Third, they are experts in hype. They produce it and they can spot it. This means they can attempt to identify which technology and media companies are trying to position themselves in the marketplace with an over-use of chutzpah. Fourth, advertising in the steam-age media is booming. In Britain, advertising expenditure this year is expected to top Pounds 10bn - in real terms, an 8.4 per cent gain on 1993, with further sharp growth expected next year. All main media sectors are sharing the boom. With so much steam-age revenue about, agencies are battling to boost their share. Their caginess towards the superfuture is easily understandable. But things are starting to stir. At Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Britain's biggest agency, Moray MacLennan, joint managing director, has set up a group to study the media future. 'This task force will comprise three or four top people from each of our 25 European offices,' says MacLennan. 'Typically they will be: the media director, a technology expert, a creative brain and a strategic planner. Their job will be to educate, investigate - and recommend action. We want them to start making things happen for our clients. 'In our view the superhighway, in all its predicted glory, is quite a long way away in terms of how it will affect our clients. But as new media develop, we want to be on top of them. Will they be different in kind to existing media, or will they require an adaptation of existing advertising techniques? The latter is the view we have settled on. 'What will consumers do with the new media? We want to understand what consumers want and how much they'll pay. Do they want interactivity more than straight choice? We believe there will not be a replacement for mass-market TV. It's a bit like saying that photography was going to be the death of painting, or TV the death of cinema. 'Yet agencies will have to adapt from being a cottage industry to a high-tech one. So far, technology has not been central to agencies' business. In future they'll have to be very careful not to be left behind.' What will become much harder, says MacLennan, is the job of media planning. Media specialists, who plan advertising campaigns and book the space and time, will have to become highly creative planners in the fragmented superfuture, rather than just schedulers. This is echoed, naturally, by Mark Craze, chief executive at TMD Carat, Britain's second largest media-buying firm. This year he expects to buy Pounds 300m worth of advertising space and time on behalf of clients that include Abbey National, Cadbury, Nissan and American Express. He says that companies like his have already coped with 'massive change and growth' in the steam-age media. Since 1980, UK advertising outlets have grown in all directions. In addition to terrestrial TV, there are now 25 English-speaking cable/satellite TV channels. In the same period the number of local radio stations (there are three national ones) has grown from 27 to 140; newspapers, from 1,583 to 1,957; consumer magazines, 1,527 to 2,429; business and professional publications, 2,629 to 5,377; and cinema screens, 1,576 to 1,895. Recently, TMD Carat hired Blackett Ditchburn, formerly corporate communications manager at Prudential Corporation, to study new-media opportunities. 'As media have become more interesting and complex,' says Craze, 'so clients have shown increasing interest in the media side. And there has been greater fusion of marketing skills. Blackett's appointment is meant to insure that we are forward-looking. At present, consumers are fairly passive. That will change, though we are probably talking five years-plus. We need to be ahead of our clients, to make sure we have the answers to their questions when they pose them. We have to be prepared.' A man who is really ahead is Daniel Bobroff, a 29-year-old former big-agency employee who in mid-1990 hocked all his assets, lived on a shoestring and ran up an unofficial Pounds 2,000 bank overdraft so as to found Microtime Media. Bobroff says his company pioneered interactive advertising in Britain, and that it is at the forefront of new-media brand promotion. He says he has produced more than 70 pieces of interactive advertising for clients such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Co, adidas and Midland Bank, and that this year he will handle Pounds 1m worth of clients' expenditure - not bad, but tiny by big-agency standards. Much of Bobroff's work has involved placing commercial messages within the running time of educational and leisure software, especially video-games, a clutch of which have reached No 1 in the UK computer games charts. 'Finding the right software titles is essential,' he says. 'They have to be right for the brand and for the marketing brief.' Bobroff, a smooth talker, was given his first computer at the age of nine or 10. It is possible that he is doing nothing that a hot-shot steam-age agency couldn't do by Monday week if it threw a few thousand pounds at it and diverted some key staff from the daily grind. On the other hand, Bobroff may have slipped the pack and launched himself into the superfuture. He can count on one thing: people in steam-age advertising agencies are watching his every twitch.</p>

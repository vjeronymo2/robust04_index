			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mykhaylo Horyn, Ukraine's Republican Party </F> leader, by Ihor Pasichnyy; place and date not given: "Our State  Must Become a Therapist of Imperial Moods"]    [Text]    [Pasichnyy] Mr. Mykhaylo, today's visit by U.S. President  Bill Clinton to Kiev, the $12 billion promised by him for  assistance to Ukraine.... Does this indicate a change in the  attitude toward our state on the part of the world's "mighty"?    [Horyn] It must be admitted that quite a number of Ukrainian  politicians have been counting upon comprehensive support for  Ukraine on the part of Western democratic states that will be  happy to help us. We needed time for our society to become  convinced that a Ukrainian state, about which dozens of  generations dreamed and for which millions of patriots died, can  only be built by our own efforts. It is only possible to create  a favorable political climate in Ukraine when it stands on its  own two feet concerning the economy and defense, and when it  manages to convince its neighbors and the entire democratic  world that it will ensure stability inside the state and will  thereby promote stability in the region and in the world. In  that case, it would be political short-sighted to ignore us and  not to establish mutually advantageous relations with us.    As regards the policy of the United States and some European  states, it has undergone a certain evolution in a direction  favorable for us. Earlier, there were calls for us to return to  the "bosom" of the empire, and the new leader Bill Clinton tried  to talk to us through ultimata. Their policy with regard to the  states of the former USSR, with the exception of the Baltic  countries, was pro-Russian. This, in turn, stimulated leading  Russian state figures to pursue a tough policy with regard to  Ukraine. There even were territorial claims. It must be  pointed out that this was always encouraged by the unprincipled  policy pursued by our government and president.    [Pasichnyy] After all, we remember quite well George Bush's  visit and his speech at the Ukrainian Parliament in which he  openly called upon us to return to the empire. Or the present  position of President Clinton, a position that is openly  coercive....    [Horyn] They expected that the young state would yield to  such powerful pressure.... However, our parliament had enough  common sense to state: We will not fully disarm ourselves,  because we do not possess guarantees for Ukraine's security as  an independent state in what concerns its borders and  territorial integrity.    The refusal immediately to give up nuclear weapons was an  extremely clever step on the part of the Ukrainian external  policy, as it drew the attention of the entire civilized world  to Ukraine. The world started thinking: What sort of state is  Ukraine, why does it refuse to give up its nuclear weapons, how  does it motivate its position, and to what logic do its  politicians adhere. There arose a problem of imperial threat on  the part of Russia, and our northeastern neighbor acquired the  image of an aggressor. The Western mass media steadily spread  this idea and, as a result, in recent months, there appeared a  change for the better in the attitude toward Ukraine. We became  an object of a thoughtful U.S. policy, and, finally, Washington  realized that the giant state in the center of Europe required a  proper attitude toward itself. This does not mean that today's  U.S. policy has become pro-Ukrainian. However, we have not freed  ourselves from pressure on the part of the United States.  Clinton's planned trip to Moscow is quite telling. However,  now Clinton demands that we dismantle our nuclear weapons in  exchange for compensation. It will depend upon our president  whether he will manage to convince Clinton that the best  security guarantee for Ukraine would be to retain those 46  strategic missiles until all nuclear states disarm. However, it  must be admitted that we are no longer being totally ignored.    [Pasichnyy] I agree with you, but I want to remark that  Clinton arrived in Kiev in order to offer us assistance in  dollars. However, he does not want to guarantee our security.  We cannot count upon assistance from the United States or NATO  in the case of Russian encroachments....    [Horyn] Recently, I had a conversation with a German deputy  defense minister, who stated that they are not interested in the  existence of a strong Ukraine. Such frankness was nothing new  for me. Back in Soviet [prison] camps, Levko Lukyanenko  [Ukraine's Republican Party leader] and I foresaw such a turn of  events.    Well, this high-ranking German official explained his idea  in  approximately this way. Ukraine is presently in a state of  crisis. We do not have enough food. However, some 10 years will  pass, and our state will finally be standing on its own two  feet. It will be a competitor on European agricultural markets.  At the same time, traditional exporters, such as Germany and  France, will find themselves in a difficult situation....    I replied to those arguments by saying that had Ukraine  remained within the empire, the entire Europe would have been  compelled to spend huge amounts of money on armaments in order  to insure themselves against the imperial threat. Europe would  have trembled before the Moscow empire as it did after World War  II.    Ukraine is not only a dream of the people and the form of  their survival. Ukraine is a factor of stability, peace, and  de- imperialization in Europe. Ukraine must become a therapist  of the imperial moods that prevail among the Russian people.  The recent elections in Russia are disturbing.    [Pasichnyy] After all, the consequences of the recent  elections in Russia have again placed before the world a threat  of direct invasion from Moscow. Chauvinism is still alive, and  it has now acquired features of communo-fascism....    [Horyn] Yes, they showed that it is not only the ruling  circles in the Kremlin that are infected with the virus of  imperialism. Many Russians display deep nostalgia for the  empire, because its very existence raised our neighbors in their  own eyes.    The results of the elections in Russia have also contributed  to a change in orientations in the West's attitude toward  Ukraine. Instead of diktat, we see a striving for a dialogue.    [Pasichnyy] Pan Mykhaylo, you, as chairman of Ukraine's  Republican Party, are a candidate for deputy of the Supreme  Council at the coming elections. What is the attitude of the  Republicans toward Ukraine's nuclear status?    [Horyn] We believe that the very fact of nuclear missiles in  Ukraine is a guarantee for us and a warning for all of our  neighbors that they should refrain from playing with fire. We  are not opponents of disarmament and we are not against  dismantling those missiles whose service life has expired.  However, in our opinion, 46 missiles must be left and  dismantled only after all nuclear powers make identical steps.    One more thing. Russia, after it received from us a large  number of medium-range missiles, has not to this day paid us for  the nuclear fuel -- this sum constitutes several billions of  U.S. dollars.    I, for example, do not agree that, while dismantling the  nuclear warheads, we should also be compelled to dismantle the  missiles themselves. They are our separate property -- they  were built at our factories. We will be able to use them to  protect ourselves from territorial encroachments by aggressors.    I hope that the president will not hasten to sign the  necessary documents that would fully disarm Ukraine. It would  be an irreparable blunder.</p>

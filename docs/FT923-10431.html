			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / A fortress under siege: Structural barriers facing foreign companies in the Japanese market are lifting, but slowly Every second Friday of the month, the top officials of the 29 biggest companies in the Mitsubishi industrial grouping drive in their limousines to a Mitsubishi-owned block in central Tokyo for a meeting of the Friday Club. 'It's a bit like a social club,' says Mr Minoru Makihara, the president of Mitsubishi Corporation, one of Japan's biggest trading companies and one of the regular participants. 'We talk about things in general or maybe listen to a guest speaker.' But for many American and European executives and trade officials, the Friday Club is more than a social gathering. It is a symbol of all they claim is unfair about Japanese business. These critics say Japanese companies freely exploit open markets in the US and Europe, while hiding at home behind veils of restrictive practices. They contend collusive threads tie companies with bankers, customers, suppliers and the government, and these threads hamper foreign companies. The ties are particularly strong inside Mitsubishi and other keiretsu - the industrial groupings which account for about 20 per cent of Japan's output. Japanese businessmen reply that competition and not collusion has made life tough for foreigners. They say that if Japanese business practices are different from those in the west, they are not necessarily unfair. It may mean they are superior. The debate about Japan's economic structure is becoming more intense because of a huge rise in the country's trade surplus. After shrinking in the late 1980s, the surplus soared 50 per cent last year to Dollars 78bn and stands at a record Dollars 49bn in the first half this year. The arguments concern far more than the nitty-gritty of trade disputes. Japan is the first non-western nation with which the US and Europe have had to share world economic leadership. While many commercial institutions have been borrowed from the west, the way they operate is often different. Above all, Japan has developed close co-operative relationships between government and business - without having stifled the forces of competition. The combination has served Japan well in its economic expansion, but has created an economy which is particularly difficult for newcomers, including foreigners, to enter. Western trade officials concede Tokyo has done much to dismantle the formal protection with which it surrounded its industries in the early postwar years. With the exception of agriculture, few activities are now off-limits to foreigners. But foreign access to the Japanese economy is still hampered by the habits of mind, such as Japan-first attitudes, which grew up behind the barriers. These persist even in government. Although Miti, the powerful ministry of trade and industry, has redirected its efforts from promoting exports to boosting imports, in other agencies there is still a bias in favour of domestic companies. It is particularly strong in high technology industries, where Japanese groups feel vulnerable to western rivals. For example, the public procurement of computers has been used to support local manufacturers. According to industry data, foreign companies had a 41 per cent share of the computers sold to the Japanese private sector by mid-1991, but only 10 per cent of the sales to the public sector. During President George Bush's visit to Tokyo earlier this year, Japan promised the US it would revise procurement rules. But it can take years for such pledges to have an effect. The 1986 US-Japan Semiconductor Agreement set a target of 20 per cent for the foreign share of the Japanese microchip market. Six years on, the figure is still only about 15 per cent. The protectionist past has also left a deep impression on private industry. From the early days of Japan's industrialisation in the 19th century, the government encouraged favoured corporations, giving them low-cost loans and other privileges. Smaller companies clustered around the giants. As Japan staggered through post-war reconstruction and the sweeping economic changes generated during the years of rapid growth, companies learnt the advantages of long-term relationships. The result is the close links which characterise Japanese commerce. Foreign claims that keiretsu discriminate against foreigners are supported by a study by the Brookings Institute, a Washington think tank. Comparing keiretsu buying patterns with those of non-keiretsu Japanese companies, Mr Robert Lawrence, a leading US economist, found that keiretsu were less likely to buy foreign goods. Similarly, the OECD has found Japanese companies are less willing than western groups to trade with foreign companies in the same industry. According to an OECD report on Japan, intra-industry trade accounts for just 33 per cent of Japanese foreign trade, compared with 60 per cent for the US. The legacy of protectionism also colours consumers' attitudes. Although central Tokyo is increasingly cosmopolitan, in large areas of Japan there is a deep-rooted belief in the virtues of buying Japanese. In a survey last year, Jetro, the government's trade promotion agency, found one third of Japanese would buy Japanese-made goods in preference to imports. Moreover, even if these prejudices and the other effects of past protectionism fade away, leading Japanese companies will still enjoy long-lasting advantages - for example, ownership of the best land and of distribution networks - acquired during the years of protection. Newcomers cannot rely on the law to break anti-competitive arrangements, largely because Japan lacks a strong tradition of equality before the law. Disputes tend to be settled by negotiation, which favours the strong and well-connected party over the weak. Nevertheless, in spite of the legacy of protectionism, competition flourishes in Japan. Japanese businessmen are right to assert their domestic markets are among the world's most competitive, particularly in industries in which Japan is strong - including motors, electronics, steel and machine tools. The genius of the Japanese authorities has been to influence market forces without killing them. Few markets were ever completely closed to outsiders. Even 20 years ago newcomers could enter an important industry such as cars - as Chrysler Motor of the US did through investing in Mitsubishi Motors. The result of competition is that today, while the US has only three indigenous car makers, Japan has nine. It also has 10 large electronics groups and no less than 115 companies producing machine tools. Competition has made these industries formidable international competitors. Their biggest achievements came from inter-company rivalry. For example, the motor industry's low-cost manufacturing techniques - known as lean production  - were pioneered in the 1950s by Toyota as a way of reducing costs to undercut competitors. The challenge facing foreign companies is to find a way through the maze of collusion and competition. Those that do often find barriers which once blocked them now operate in their favour, repelling other newcomers. But many underestimate the time required. Mr William Best, managing director of the Tokyo office of AT Kearney, the US management consultancy, says: 'There are only 20-25 western companies with sales of more than Dollars 1bn in Japan. They are mostly doing extremely well here. But many other companies are going nowhere.' There is no single route to success. Partnerships with Japanese groups have paid off for many companies - especially in industries with close links among Japanese companies. For example, while some US motor parts makers have publicly berated Japanese manufacturers for failing to buy their products, Robert Bosch, the German engineering company, has quietly developed links inside keiretsu groupings. It is a shareholder in Nippon Denso, a component maker and a Toyota affiliate, and in Japan Electronic Control Systems, a company tied to Nissan, and has a joint venture with Mitsubishi Electrical, a member of the Mitsubishi keiretsu. Other companies, particularly in consumer markets, have tried partnerships with Japanese companies only to abandon them later in favour of independence. BMW, the German car maker, greatly increased sales after choosing this course and building its own sales network. But even BMW and other successful 'independents' say it is essential to imitate the Japanese in establishing close long-term relationships with local suppliers and customers. Foreign companies have sometimes called on their governments to demand market-opening measures. These efforts have secured the abolition of many formal trade barriers, ranging from bans on foreign investment in strategic industries to discriminatory duties on foreign alcohol. But attempts by foreign governments to ease informal restrictions have usually proved frustrating, as in the 1986 semiconductor agreement. Progress in increasing foreigners' market share has been so slow that the issue has once more developed into a trade dispute. Structural change is glacial because there is little domestic pressure for greater economic openness. Japanese consumers, who might benefit from lower prices if more foreign companies were active in Japan, generally do not complain. For their part, Japanese companies are often loath to abandon long-term domestic links. A European machine tool maker says: 'In the US you can get business by bidding 10 per cent less than a local supplier. In Japan, 20 per cent is sometimes not enough.' But this is not to say foreign companies' efforts are doomed. Japan's imports nearly doubled in 1986-91. Foreign businessmen in Tokyo believe they could double again over the next decade. The Japanese government last month adopted a five-year economic plan which emphasises improving the consumers' lot - including giving them more choice by promoting imports. Japanese politicians, too, are aware that export-led, import-blocking expansion is a thing of the past. As Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, says: 'In many ways we have enjoyed very good economic conditions in the past. But it is impossible to continue behaving in the same way in the future.' However, he adds: 'Japanese people have not really got out of their old ways of living and thinking. Change will require a great deal of effort.'</p>

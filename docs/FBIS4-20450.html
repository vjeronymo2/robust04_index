Thirty-one cases each were  allocated randomly into the IFN group and control group. Another  24 cases each for IFN and control groups were studied by  double-blind method. All the patients were treated within 5 days  of the illness. The results showed that subsidence of symptoms  and signs resulted from viremia, restoration of renal function  and platelet count were much faster, and complications much less  in the IFN treated group. In both the randomized and  double-blind studies, the number of cases that skip both the  hypotension and oliguria phases were significantly more in the  IFN group than that in the control (87.1 percent and 62.5  percent vs. 51.9 percent and 29.2 percent, p &lt; 0.05). The  results suggest that Hu IFN-_a_ therapy administered before the  5th day of EHF may shorten the duration of illness, alleviate  the damage of organs, and improve the cure rate.</p>

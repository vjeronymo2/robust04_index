			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OLD TOWN IRVINE IS BRAND NEW;  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS STAKING THEIR $20-MILLION RESTORATION ON NOSTALGIA AND A LITTLE  SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE  </P> <P> Over in the corner of the Knowlwood restaurant at Old Town Irvine, there are  some odd marks burned into a wooden wall.  </P> <P> When this was a blacksmith's shop, those marks were the brands of the ranches  hereabouts. The blacksmith used them for reference when making new branding  irons.  </P> <P> The shop was at the center of Irvine, when the city was a small farming  community at the turn of the century. The railroad depot was here, near where  the tracks met Sand Canyon Avenue; so was a school, a silo for the tons of lima  beans harvested each year, a general store, a bunkhouse for the ranch's cowboys  and later the first Ford dealership in Orange County.  </P> <P> Now, most of the lima bean fields are covered with streets and pastel-colored  subdivisions, low-slung industrial buildings and boxy office towers of tinted  glass: A city of 98,000 that did most of its growing in just the last 20 years.  </P> <P> And the buildings of Old Town, once ramshackle and derelict, have been spruced  up to entice the yuppies of Irvine, the Marines from the nearby El Toro air  station and passers-by on the adjacent Santa Ana Freeway.  </P> <P> Old Town is probably the largest restoration project in Orange County, a  $20-million gamble that is too new to tell whether it will succeed. Will people  want to stay at a hotel made from a concrete grain silo? Can the nearby  corrugated metal warehouse find the right mix of tenants to keep shoppers  coming back? Those are the sort of questions that pester Robert B. Smith.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Talk With Tenants  </P> <P> On a recent weekday afternoon, Smith wheeled his Jaguar into the parking lot of  La Quinta Inn at Old Town and got out to talk to his tenants.  </P> <P> Smith, 43, is one of the general partners behind Old Town. He has a doctorate  in psychology and teaches at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa when he's not  developing small real estate projects. Old Town is his largest project.  </P> <P> Calling each tenant by name, Smith stops for a fresh-squeezed orange juice at  the Orange Inn Cafe &amp; Market and for a shooter of tequila at Tia Juana's  Long Bar &amp; Mexican Cafe -- "Longest Bar in Orange County" -- where a  well-dressed, after-work crowd is just trooping in.  </P> <P> "We tried not to have chains in here," said Smith as he shows a guest around  Tia Juana's enormous, 9,000-square-foot restaurant.  </P> <P> "We had a chance to make deals with people like Denny's, but we wanted our  tenants to have a uniqueness."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Split Personality  </P> <P> Still, Old Town seems to have a touch of retailing's version of the split  personality. At the far end of the 6.5-acre project is Knowlwood, basically a  fast-food joint, and at the other end is a snazzy, expensive wine shop called  Sirus Cellars where customers can find unusual vintages and can store their  purchase in their own rented wine cellar.  </P> <P> The idea is to delicately balance the mix of stores and restaurants to appeal  to the widest spectrum of customers, from the Marines at the nearby air base to  Irvine professionals to older people from the Leisure World retirement  community down the freeway, said Tim Sloat, a broker for Scher-Voit Commercial  Brokerage Co., who is leasing the project. Yet the stores have to be unique  enough to keep people coming back.  </P> <P> And since there's room for only a few more stores or restaurants at Old Town,  the choices had better be right, Sloat said. Bad choices could take the other  retailers down with them.  </P> <P> "The decision was to provide as wide a range of retailers as possible,  excluding the typical neighborhood shopping center tenants like dry cleaners,  frozen yogurt places and chain pizza operations," Sloat explained.  </P> <P> "We also had to be careful not to run the risk of having a cheap imitation of  Knott's Berry Farm, in which case people would laugh at us."  </P> <P> There is actually a glut of store space in most of Orange County, but not in  Irvine or, for that matter, in the whole southern half of the county. The south  county is growing so fast -- that's where all the undeveloped land is -- that  there are still plenty of customers. In the northern half of the county, where  population growth is slower, video stores, pizza shops and convenience stores  have multiplied so rapidly that they're stealing each other's customers.  </P> <P> So even though two-thirds of the retailers who want to move into Old Town  probably aren't suitable, Sloat says, there are still plenty left to choose  from.  </P> <P> Monthly rental rates are about average for Irvine, from $1.75 to $2.50 per  square foot, plus the tenant's share of property taxes, insurance and  maintenance. And so are the amounts of money Old Town grants tenants to  decorate their stores, say other real estate brokers with experience in the  Irvine market.  </P> <P> While the restored buildings are fairly snazzy, one thing that keeps rents down  is the fact that Old Town really isn't centrally located in Irvine -- it's on  the eastern end -- and it isn't really on the way to anywhere in that part of  the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Top Producer in Chain  </P> <P> Still, Knowlwood -- one of a small, family-owned chain of five stores -- is the  top producer in the chain, employees say. It's now doing $100,000 a month.  Knowlwood is one of the older burger stores in the county.  </P> <P> Tia Juana's, which just opened last fall, took in $7,000 one recent Friday  night and hopes to do up to $200,000 a month this year, says Dan Neyenhuis, a  casually dressed veteran of the restaurant industry who is one of the owners.  His partners also own an interest in the Crazy Horse Steak House, a successful  country and Western venue in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The Orange Inn -- now doing business in what was once the Ford dealership's  building -- is a historic eatery once located on Coast Highway near Corona del  Mar. It was forced to move by the Irvine Co.'s plans to develop the coastal  hills as a resort. The inn is still searching for its market, Smith says, but  altogether the restaurants are doing quite well.  </P> <P> Though the project still has a way to go, it is a far cry from 1984, when the  buildings were tumbling down and the prospects for restoration seemed nil.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moves to Save General Store  </P> <P> In fact, one of them -- the old general store, now rehabilitated and soon to be  leased by a gift shop -- was squarely in the way of an Irvine Co. project to  widen Sand Canyon Avenue.  </P> <P> The city of Irvine asked the company -- which was started by the Irvine family  and is now the largest private landholder in the county -- if there were some  way that the old store could be saved.  </P> <P> The company contacted James W. (Walkie) Ray, president of J. Ray Construction  Co. in Irvine, who had worked with the Irvine Co. before. Ray brought in Smith,  the psychologist, whom he had met in the early 1970s when they were both young  professionals living on the same street in Costa Mesa. Since then, Smith has  been Ray's partner in several small developments.  </P> <P> The builder and the psychologist walked around the weedy area looking at the  broken-down buildings -- the blacksmith's shop was so ramshackle that a Santa  Ana wind might have blown it down if its big front doors hadn't always been  open -- and decided that they might as well have a go at the lima bean silo,  the corrugated metal warehouse -- the whole thing. Smith had read about a grain  silo in Ohio that had been converted to a hotel. Why not go for it?  </P> <P> The two talked the Irvine Co. into becoming a partner in return for kicking in  the 6.5 acres. The company won a guarantee of $1 million off the top if Old  Town is sold and 25% of the project. That is essentially a subsidy of the  project, since 6.5 acres on the freeway could be worth a lot more if you were  building office towers there, for instance.  </P> <P> Smith, Ray, brother Michael D. Ray -- executive vice president of the family  construction company -- and a Pasadena tax lawyer named Bernice Anglea were the  general partners, owning 50%. Anglea was familiar with the tax breaks generated  by restoring the historic buildings and putting them on the National Register  of Historic Places. And she also helped sell most of the 30 limited partners,  who put up $2.5 million that got the project started in return for the other  25% of the project and most of the tax breaks. The limited partners could not  have been enticed -- and the vital $2.5 million raised -- without the tax  advantages, the general partners say.  </P> <P> After recouping their original $400,000 investment from the limited partners,  the four general partners have not had to put anything but their time and  expertise into the deal, not even a dime. But they do have to cover any losses  if the project doesn't work. That's a typical structure for such a deal. But  the problems you can run into rehabilitating old buildings are anything but  typical, and there have been a couple of scary moments for the partners.  </P> <P> "There were more twists and turns than the Ortega Highway," Michael Ray said.  </P> <P> The 40-year-old lima bean silo, left over from a time when Orange County  produced more lima beans than anywhere in the world, had 32, six-sided concrete  chambers for storing beans. In order to turn the chambers into motel rooms,  construction crews would have to cut through 6 inches of concrete to create  doors and windows. When Ray's construction company -- as general contractor --  put the work out to bid in 1985, the lowest bid came back 20% over what Ray had  budgeted, or about $1 million.  </P> <P> "We had to close the deal on the land in a few days, but we were over budget  for this huge amount," Michael Ray said. "All along, the Irvine Co. had two  options: They could believe in us or they could terminate the project. They  believed in us."  </P> <P> The partnership eventually solved the problem by raising more money and cutting  some construction costs. The Texas-based motel chain -- which has a separate  deal with the partnership -- wanted desperately to be in Irvine, desperately  enough to run a motel where many of the rooms have rounded sides with walls of  rough gray concrete. The rooms are furnished with rough-hewn wooden furniture  and iron-railed beds in a Western motif.  </P> <P> The motel -- three stories, 148 rooms -- is about 65% occupied on the average,  Smith said, or at about the break-even point after a year.  </P> <P> In the warehouse -- which now shelters Tia Juana -- the roof and sides had to  be removed so the builder could add structural reinforcements. The cost was a  staggering $70 a square foot, or "about what you could build a first-class,  high-rise office building for in Orange County," Michael Ray noted.  </P> <P> In fact, much of the risk in rehabilitating old buildings comes from  uncertainty about how much it is going to cost, Smith said. "You start tapping  into old walls like these," he said, pointing to the silo, "and you don't have  any idea what you're going to find."  </P> <P> Between those kind of problems and the fact that there simply aren't that many  old buildings in relatively youthful Orange County -- just celebrating its  Centennial this year -- it is not likely that there will be many more of these  big restoration projects.  </P> <P> But at least these buildings were saved, and they're likely to stay that way  for a long time. In return for additional tax breaks, the partnership granted  the city of Irvine control over the building's facades. That essentially means  the buildings are protected and won't be replaced by office buildings or  shopping malls anytime soon.  </P> <P> "Just because they're on the National Register of Historic Places doesn't  necessarily protect them from being torn down," Smith said. "But since we gave  the facades to Irvine, you can't even paint them without city approval."  </P></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / People: Reshuffle at BTR Nylex Geoffrey Vincent, finance director of BTR's important Australian operation, has resigned little more than a year after he took up the post. He is being replaced by Andrew Sellman who has been with the BTR Nylex group for more than a decade. The resignation of Vincent is part of a boardroom reshuffle at BTR Nylex which is 62 per cent owned by BTR and ranks among Australia's top half dozen companies. Kathleen O'Donovan, who took over as finance director of the UK parent last year, is joining the Australian company's board and Peter Robinson, chief executive of the packaging and building products group, has been promoted to the new position of chief operating officer of BTR Nylex. It was unclear why Vincent had resigned but London analysts did not think that his departure indicated any change in the underlying performance of BTR Nylex, which has defied the recession better than many local companies. It currently contributes over a quarter of BTR profits. One analyst said that appointing a chief operating officer at BTR Nylex mirrored what BTR itself had already done. Although BTR prides itself on having one of the flattest management structures of any large company, it felt last year that the growth of its business made it necessary to have a chief operating officer and it appointed Bob Faircloth to the position.</p>

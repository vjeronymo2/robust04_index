			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Tasty tidings of confits and joy - In the second of two articles, Philippa Davenport details weekend breaks in France where the finer points of foie gras are featured In Britain, one roast duck and four diners may cause the carver to panic. In foie gras country, almost every part of a duck is eaten. The fattened liver is, of course, the prize but the rest of the bird is used as the basis of many satisfying meals. The fat is rendered to become a cooking medium as fundamental to Gascony as butter is to Normandy and olive oil to Provence. Legs, wings and giblets go to make confits. The neck skin is stuffed. Trimmings may be baked, shredded and potted as rillettes. The carcass, with scraps clinging to it, may be roasted or grilled for irresistible snacks. As for magret of duck - the huge and tender meaty breast - this, too, can be made into confits, although that generally is considered a pity. Better to relish it fresh, fried or grilled like a juicy steak. Confits are a uniquely south-western French way of preserving meat, which elsewhere is salted, smoked or dried, But this region devised the far simpler idea of slow-cooking meat, submerged in its rendered fat, until its tenderness allows a straw to pierce it. For storage, it is then sealed under a layer of fat. The very best confits, they say, are cooked over an open fire so the meat absorbs the wood smoke. Few things are more reassuring to anyone keen on comfort food than a store cupboard filled with jars or tins of duck or goose confit. Because it is so versatile, it is the ultimate convenience food. Just take the preserved joints out of the jar or tin, let most of the fat run from them and dry-fry for five-10 minutes on each side. For frazzled skin, slip the pieces of meat into a hot oven on a baking tray for about 15 minutes, skin side down at first, then skin side up. Confit made with neck, heart and gizzards is fashionable served warm en salade. Meaty joints are more likely to be served with hot vegetables. The smartest choice is probably pommes sarladaise (with truffles). A circle of potatoes fried with a sprig of rosemary is also good; so, too, is a sprinkling of finely-chopped garlic and parsley with a few cepes or a pool of lentils, or braised red cabbage with roast chestnuts and pickled prunes. Jeanne Strang's glorious guide to life and food in south-west France, Goose Fat and Garlic, describes the preserving processes in vivid detail. And it was Strang who started the ball rolling for me when I packed up my apron and went in search of the mini-holiday breaks known popularly in Perigord, Gers and the Landes as Weekends Foie Gras (although, in fact, they cover far more than foie gras). The choices available are many and varied but all aim to combine relaxation, good eating and learning. Below are details of just four that might be of special interest to FT readers. Unless indicated otherwise, they run from Friday afternoon to Sunday after lunch. Duck is the bird on which you will be working and some knowledge of French is highly desirable when attending courses with Mesdames Sarran and Gracia (essential when telephoning them). To ensure personal attention, the numbers accepted on each course rarely exceed eight. Prices are based on sharing a double room with private bathroom and include the cost of all meals and tuition along with one duck, which you take home as preserves; you are charged for extra ducks which, if required, should be ordered when placing your booking. Except in the case of Gourmet Espionnage, you must pay for your own travel: I travelled fly-drive Gatwick to Bordeaux. Pierrette Sarran, Auberge du Bergerayre, St Martin d'Armagnac, 32110 Nogaro. Tel. 6209 0872; fax 6209 0974. Sarran is the doyenne of this business: small, wiry, passionate, highly organized and always on the go. And while her establishment might still be a ferme-auberge in spirit, her dining room is that of a classy restaurant. This is serious cooking. There are 14 bedrooms and a swimming pool. She has no fixed dates for foie gras weekends but can probably make available one or several of the following if enough people are interested; February 18-20, 25-27; March 4-6, 11-13, 18-20 and 25-27. Prices: From Ffr1,550 a head. Partners who do not want to join the classes pay full pension prices only: Ffr660-860 for the two days. Extra ducks are charged at Ffr350 each. Marie-Claude Gracia, Auberge a la Belle Gasconne, Poudenas, 47170 Mezin. Tel. 5365 7158; fax 5365 8739. This is a chic establishment: the hotel of which Gracia is both chef and owner has a Michelin star. The converted mill house has just seven bedrooms and is sited dramatically on a bank of the river Gelise at the foot of a hilltop village with steep, narrow streets. Weekends, which are billed as 'Weekend cuisine passion en Gascogne,' begin with 'acceuil, installation, verre de l'amitie et diner autour d'un poule au pot' on Friday evening. The guests do not don their aprons until Saturday. The schedule also manages to find time for a quick visit to nearby Nerac and, on Sunday morning, a recipe demonstration by Gracia and/or a visit to Mezin's market. Dates, prices and further details on application. Denise Garnier, Falgayras, Auradou, 47140 Penne d'Agenais. Tel. 5341 3403; fax 5341 4754. New Zealand-born Garnier and her French husband have been farming and preserving ducks for 11 years and, in addition to the usual range of foie gras, confits and pates, they produce exquisite cured duck breasts, jambons de magrets seches. The programme here is the only one I found where the livers of the freshly-killed ducks are dealt with, while still warm, before the confits; apparently, the resulting foie gras is much more satisfactory. The Garniers do not run a ferme-auberge and have just one studio cottage available for a visiting couple; other course participants are accommodated at L'Air du Temps, a small restaurant with rooms in the nearby medieval village of Penne-d'Agenais. It is here that lunch and dinner will be served to everyone throughout the weekend. Prices: Ffr1,700 a head for the weekend. In addition to the preserves made from one duck, guests will take away a pair of jambons de magrets seches. Extra ducks are charged at Ffr300 each and there is a limit of three for each participant. Dates: Provisionally, these are January 7-9, 14-16, 21-23, 28-30, and February 4-6. Some dates in March and early April may also be possible. Gourmet Espionnage is the brainchild of Caroline Yuill of Oak Cottage, Thorndon, near Eye, Suffolk 1P23 7JJ. Tel/fax: 0379-71 234. Yuill specialises in personalised package deals, tailoring itineraries according to the wishes of groups of eight or more (eight is her minimum number). She makes all the arrangements and generally acts as guide and translator throughout. Her trips to France are designed for a minimum of four days but she prefers seven so that the pace can be that of a relaxed holiday. A foie gras week, she suggests, ought to include hands-on experience at making foie gras and confits in the farmhouse kitchen of a small duck producer she knows, and learning to cook dishes using both confits and fresh duck. The party might also like to visit a local wine producer, an artisan cheesemaker and go to markets. The accommodation she suggests is a small, family-run hotel near Orthez, halfway betwen Pau and Dax. She particularly recommends spring and Easter for visiting this area. Her prices begin at Pounds 697 (inclusive of everything, including travel) a person for seven days.</p>

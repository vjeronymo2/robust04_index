			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Guidi Swims Against the Tide"] </F>   [Excerpt] Rome -- Europe is preparing to close immigration  gates even further, but the Italian family and social affairs  minister [Antonio Guidi] is speaking of broadening the criteria  used to consider immigrants. While, in Luxembourg, the Twelve's  ministers were deciding to tighten the screws, Minister Antonio  Guidi was in fact in Casal di Principe (Caserta province)  attending a meeting organized by the CNEL [National Council for  Economy and Labor] on non-Community immigration into the south.  Here, in one of the areas with the highest proportion of  immigrants, the minister announced his intention to deal with  legal and illegal immigrants into Italy.    For Guidi the problem is a general one, namely, how to  safeguard the rights of immigrants "whether regular or  irregular." Irregular immigrants, the minister remarked, also  "generate wealth, because they work and produce an income: They  must therefore have the same rights and the same duties.  Immigrants from outside the Community must be safeguarded as  people and, as such, considered centers of rights and duties."    Guidi recalled that "organized crime is the connective  tissue  for the exploitation of immigrants from outside the Community."  This situation had to be considered more closely and seen as  part of "the broader problem area of safeguarding immigrants'  rights." According to the minister, priority measures must  include providing health care for all immigrants, although he  warned against demagogy: "I want to implement a gradual policy,  but one which will mark a turn for the better. This is a  serious problem, and we cannot perform miracles."    In Caserta province, up to 20,000 foreign workers throng to  take part in the fruit and tomato harvest every summer. Guidi  stated that his own presence in the area indicated the  government's "concern and commitment." Initially, the minister  will propose setting up a "working group" with regional and  local government representatives "in order to verify how the  funds earmarked for aid and counseling centers were used  throughout the country."

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: GBL will not block Dutch bid for BBL GROUPE Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), the Belgian holding company, said yesterday it would not block the purchase of a 6.72 per cent stake in Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) by Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance group. ING announced a week ago it wanted to buy the stake from Unipar and SBH Investments of Italy as a first step towards a full BFr63.6bn (Dollars 2.07bn) bid for BBL, Belgium's second largest bank. Mr Jacques Thierry, BBL's chairman, yesterday voiced the strong support of the bank's management for a deal. In addition, Banque Internationale a Luxembourg (BIL) - which owns 5.7 per cent of BBL - has indicated it is likely to sell out if ING makes an offer. GBL owns a direct stake in BBL of 13 per cent and indirectly controls a further 11 per cent. The group is also head of a BBL shareholder syndicate. However, it told the bank's directors yesterday that it would not exercise its priority right to buy the Italian stake. Nevertheless, GBL directors indicated that the suggested offer price of BFr3,600 is too low and GBL delegates on the BBL board could still oppose the offer.</p>

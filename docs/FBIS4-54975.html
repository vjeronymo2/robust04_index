			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] Speaking to Radio Kragujevac on 3 April,  leaders of four parties represented in the Serbian Assembly,  including President Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party of  Serbia, unanimously agreed that "the political integration of  the former Yugoslav community is impossible, but the  establishment of economic, agricultural, transportation,  cultural, and other relations is not only possible but, in fact,  indispensable." This was reported in the Belgrade daily BORBA of  4 April, together with excerpts of the party leaders'  statements, in an article titled "Renewal of Yugoslavia  Impossible."    Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party, is cited  as observing that the regions that formerly constituted the  state of Yugoslavia should strive to establish the "firmest  links possible" as long as each of the areas retains its  independence "in the political and every other sense."    Vuk Draskovic, leader of Serbian Renewal Movement, points  out  that "there is no such thing as the reintegration of Yugoslavia;  this gossip is spread by those opposition parties whose power  was based on hatred, war, killing, and refugees." He adds,  however, that economic, transportation, and cultural links must  be established "on the territory that was once Yugoslavia,"  noting that it does not make sense to travel to Sarajevo through  Frankfurt.    Vojislav Kostunica, president of the Democratic Party of  Serbia, stresses that "there are both contemporary and  historical factors making it impossible to create a new Yugoslav  state community."    Borislav Jovic, vice president of the Socialist Party of  Serbia, points out that the Serbs were the only nation  interested in preserving Yugoslavia before the war, but now,  after the war, they are against it. The Serbian people's  opposition, according to Jovic, was demonstrated during the last  elections because "the parties that talk about a new Yugoslavia  did not gain a single seat in the republic's parliament." Jovic  further stresses that the Serbs are for a "reduced" Yugoslavia,  but not for Yugoslavia as it was in the past. He also agrees  that the Serbs should establish economic, commercial,  ecological, and cultural relations with their neighbors on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia.</p>

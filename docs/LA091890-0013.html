			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S SPEECH ON U.S. GOALS IN MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> After weighing everything -- the pros and cons -- I'm convinced that the  popular consensus is for massive U.S. military action in the Persian Gulf.  George Bush should not wait any longer.  </P> <P> I don't think anybody will question if the U.S. goes ahead and takes out Saddam  Hussein. The man is cancer and should be removed before it spreads. Of course  lives will be lost, including our own troops. But that's the price for being  the symbol of democracy and protector of the weak.  </P> <P> The embargo is good only in principle. It will take too long to be effective.  In the meantime, the clock is ticking towards recession and hard times.  </P> <P> Two things will happen if the President does not act now: He can kiss his  reelection goodby and Hussein will remain the crazy goon of the Arab world.  </P> <P> ORLY CANDARI  </P> <P> Rialto  </P></p>

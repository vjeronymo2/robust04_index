			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As under the current rule, all credit unions accepting nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares will be required to have a plan for the use of such deposits. The plan must describe how nonmember accounts will be used to serve the credit union's membership, e.g., by providing loans to its members or through increased earnings. The credit union must submit the plan to the regional director, prior to receiving nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent, for NCUA's information and monitoring. However, under the change, NCUA approval will not be required unless the aggregate amount exceeds both 20 percent of shares and $1.5 million. Three commenters objected to the production of a written plan by credit unions with nonmember deposits exceeding 20 percent of total shares but less than $1.5 million. They believe the requirement for a written plan in such circumstances generates needless paperwork. These commenters suggest a written plan should only be required in connection with a waiver request. The Board disagrees. Although the requirement for a written plan may disproportionately affect small credit unions, the plan is a necessary component to the successful management of nonmember deposits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended that in addition to the written plan, the credit union should also provide details on how the credit union plans to be completely self sustaining with regard to member deposits. This commenter believes that these credit unions need to eventually become independent from all public unit and nonmember deposits. While this is a worthy goal for all credit unions, it fails to recognize the reality that many low-income credit unions will have long term needs for, and legitimate uses of, nonmember funds. The Board declines to adopt this recommendation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended in those cases where a waiver is required, that the rule specify that the business plan must be approved by NCUA before the waiver is granted. This is implicit in the waiver decision. The regional director will only grant a waiver if the business plan is acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> D. Request for Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Board requests comment on whether periodic reporting on the sources and uses of nonmember shares, in excess of 20 percent of total shares, should be established. The Board considered a monthly or quarterly reporting requirement or alternatively, revisions to the NCUA Call Report (NCUA Form 5300), to gather additional information on sources and uses of nonmember funds. Five commenters objected to the suggestion that credit unions submit monthly or quarterly reports on the use of nonmember deposits. These commenters believe a new reporting requirement would be contrary to the intent of the higher dollar limit and would increase regulatory burden on small credit unions. Two of these commenters suggested the regional director exercise oversight of troubled credit unions as appropriate. One commenter supported the use of quarterly periodic reporting on the sources and uses of nonmember deposits in excess of 20 percent. This commenter believes such a requirement will give NCUA the ability to determine whether or not a credit union is adhering to its written plan as well as protect the NCUSIF. Three commenters supported a revision of the Call Report to gather additional information on nonmember accounts but two of these commenters objected to reporting on the sources and uses of nonmember deposits. The Board agrees that increased reporting may be burdensome to small credit unions and therefore will not require any additional reporting. However, NCUA will allot more time for additional on-site examiner review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board also specifically requested comment on the length of an approved waiver in those cases where a waiver request and approval are still required. The regulation currently states in &sect;701.32(b)(2) that the waiver request will normally be for a two year period. Three commenters believe that the current two year period is appropriate. One commenter stated that the regional director should have full discretion to set the length of the waiver. Two commenters stated that the length of the waiver should be open-ended but could be terminated at any time by the regional director. Three commenters suggested the waiver period should be for three years. Two of these commenter stated the wavier should be routinely renewed unless a credit union seeks a waiver for an expanded amount or an examiner determines that a renewal of the waiver would present safety and soundness concerns. One commenter suggested that the waiver should be granted for five years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board believes the current language provides the regional director with sufficient discretion to approve waivers for shorter or longer periods, especially since the number of waivers should decrease with the adoption of these amendments. Furthermore, the Board is not inclined to permit an automatic renewal of the waiver. An automatic renewal would make the timeframe meaningless and may tend to actually promote a continuing dependence on nonmember deposits. Therefore the Board is not making any changes to the length of the waiver. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters stated that the nonmember limitations should not be applied to any funds received in connection with the proposed new federal community Development Banking and Financial Institutions program or enterprise zone grants. The Board will consider such action if and when such legislation is established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has adopted the proposed amendments in final with only a minor technical change. Language has been added to &sect;701.32(b)(2) to clarify that a copy of the credit union's plan must be forwarded to the Regional Director. The Board believes that the final amendments remove burdens on small credit unions as well as provide them with greater flexibility in the maintenance of nonmember deposits without significantly increasing the risk to the NCUSIF. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has also made a technical change to &sect;741.6(a), which references the limitation on nonmember deposits. The change is made to conform this section to the amendments in &sect;701.32. The change deletes the term ``20%''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

In an interview with a UNIAN  correspondent, Moshe Shahal, minister of police, energy, and  infrastructure, noted: "With regard to our state's participation  in the structure of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation meeting  [ChES] on the basis of an associate member as Ivan Plyushch,  speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, had proposed during a visit  to Israel, Tel Aviv believes in such interaction, and considers  that real grounds exist for fruitful regional cooperation in the  Black Sea basin. [no closing quotation mark as received]    Israel took part in the last ChES that was held in December  in Sofia. As competent persons from Ukraine's Foreign Economic  Relations Ministry added, the foundation of the ChES  international community is still in an organizational stage of  being founded, and participation in it by new members, apart  from the 11 real members (Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, Greece,  Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Albania, Georgia, Armenia, Romania,  Moldova) in particular, of Poland and Israel, is highly  probable. At the end of January a consultative meeting is  planned between the Ukrainian and Turkish side, possibly with  the participation of other states that will ascertain this and  other prospects for continuing cooperation in the region.    According to preliminary information from Ukraine's Foreign  Affairs Ministry, the Ukrainian initiative on creating a coastal  trade zone will be put on the agenda. At the moment, this is  being discussed by the appropriate structures of the ChES member  countries.</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Arts: When marketing triumphed over musical endeavour - Andrew Clements bewails the state of London concerts during 1991 The recession bit harder into London's concert life in 1991 than anyone could have predicted. The closure of the Wigmore Hall in July for a year's refurbishment should have created extra dates to be slotted in elsewhere, yet promoters seemed only too eager to scale down their activities. Dark nights peppered the schedules of all the major halls, and though the major London orchestras dutifully offered their standard numbers of dates and roster of conductors, as often as not they were interspersed with concerts brazenly labelled 'classics for pleasure', 'classical pops', or 'arias from the great operas'. It was as if the only reliable way to ensure decent-sized audiences lay in eliminating anything unfamiliar or demanding from the programmes, and giving the punters exactly what they knew they liked. Never had the denominator of the musical fare put before London's concert-goers sunk so low, or been so obviously driven by marketing rather than artistic forces. To a musical culture ruled more and more by the banalities of the major record companies and their packaging ethic the bicentenary of Mozart's death must truly have seemed like a divine gift; for one year at least concert promoters could be spared the chore of devising a new thematic slant or concocting enterprising single programmes. When in doubt play Mozart: anything would do, and did. After 1991 no one will be able to leaf through the pages of Kochel's catalogue and wonder whether pieces such as Il sogno di Scipione K126 or La Betulia liberate K116 were worth reviving; there were more chances to hear such works this year than in all of the previous half century. The South Bank's own Mozart celebration during August was an honourable exception to the indiscriminate chronologies of so many of its counterparts. By concentrating on period-instrument performances, and inviting the world's best specialists to give them, it offered a serious chance to assess the state of authenticity, and to measure the distance travelled in what is certainly the most important shift in our perceptions of Mozart and how his work should be interpreted, since the bicentenary of his birth 35 years ago. Apart from the Mozart binge, the South Bank scaled down its thematic planning in 1991 for reasons one suspects were as much financial as artistic; small-scale celebrations devoted to Elliott Carter early in the year and to post-war Italian music during the autumn were the most significant offerings. The Barbican celebrated Prokofiev's centenary with a festival presided over by Rostropovich, and used the capacious umbrella of the Japan Festival (generally more worthwhile for dance and the theatre, one feels, than for its music) to provide a weekend of Takemitsu. The BBC turned its annual week at the Barbican into a showcase of Henze in the year of his 65th birthday; for 1992, though, the corporation will forsake living composers for a three-day festival of the 56-years-dead Alban Berg. In what has been with few reservations the dullest year in two decades for music in London, there were times when it was all too tempting to switch attention to Birmingham, where Simon Rattle and the CBSO had already won the trust and respect of their audience in a way that the London orchestras could only dimly imagine, and which for several seasons now has enabled them consistently to offer imaginative, varied and wonderfully realised programmes. This year too, Rattle and his orchestra at last got their new concert hall, leaving the treacherous acoustic of the Town Hall for Symphony Hall's wonderfully rounded ambience; within the first few concerts it was clear that this was by a long way the finest auditorium in the British Isles. Return visits have failed to reveal any blemishes and suggest that the hall measures up to the best in Europe, evoking comparisons with the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Musikverein in Vienna, and also that the CBSO itself is rapidly moving into the class of the orchestras that are based in those venues. Birmingham also has its own new-music ensemble, the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, which continues to make modest yet steady progress. In general, though, it was not a good year to be selling new music. The falling-away of audiences could not have come at a worst time for the London Sinfonietta, still trying to rediscover its direction and identity after the death in 1989 of its artistic director Michael Vyner; there were occasions during the year when it seemed only a shadow of its former self, though the three concerts with which it celebrated Henze's birthday in December gradually brought a return to something like its old ebullience. The greatest loss to London's new music, though, was the demise of the Almeida Festival, allowed to wither away without any great attempts to resuscitate it by the artistic management of the Almeida Theatre itself or the arts-funding bodies that had previously supported it. Nothing really could fill the gap, and the range of living composers heard in the capital was correspondingly narrowed. The Huddersfield Festival, though, offered its usual varied menu and the Royal Opera brought forth the year's most significant new work with the premiere at Covent Garden of Birtwistle's Gawain. Most pieces would pale beside that, and with the exception of John Casken's rhapsodically lyrical Cello Concerto, unveiled at the Lichfield Festival, and Tippett's Byzantium, given its British premiere at the Proms, it's hard to settle upon anything of enduring worth introduced by a British composer during 1991. Certainly none of the Proms commissions passed muster in a season at the Albert Hall of generally high performing standards and decent audiences, as impervious as ever to the chill financial winds biting elsewhere. Perhaps it is appropriate that at the end of 1991 one should be left with two utterly contrasted memories of concert life in London during the year, each in its own way deeply disquieting. The first is of a BBCSO concert at the Festival Hall early in the autumn, for which the audience gathered together would have been hard pressed to fill the front stalls; the programme of Haydn, Xenakis and de Falla was neither good nor bad, just average, but certainly not, in marketing terms, sexy. The second image is one of the Barbican foyer on the eve of Mozart's death day. The concert was to be a sold-out performance of the Mozart Requiem. It was one of several in London that night, and decently rather than spectacularly cast. Yet the queue for returns stretched across the foyer and into the road outside. It was as if everyone wanted to be in on the act, to join in some sacremental rite. The graven image just happened to be Mozart; the real idol was hype and the triumph that of marketing over artistic endeavour.</p>

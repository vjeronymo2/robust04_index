			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Fashion chief questioned on insider trading claim Mr Pierre Berge, chairman of Yves-Saint-Laurent, the famous French fashion house, and a close friend of President Francois Mitterrand, yesterday was questioned by a Paris court over allegations of insider dealing in Saint-Laurent's shares. The questioning follows a legal coup for Saint-Laurent earlier this month when it won FFr2m (Pounds 230,000) in damages by successfully suing Ralph Lauren, a leading New York fashion designer, for copying one of its designs. However, the same court slapped a FFr500,000 fine on Mr Berge for making defamatory remarks about Ralph Lauren in the US press. Yesterday's case was the latest instalment in an investigation into suspected insider trading in Yves Saint-Laurent's shares during the summer of 1992.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Sport: Play like a woman - Golf / John Hopkins offers some advice to male golfers A FEW years ago Laura Davies was playing in a pro-am in Palm Springs, California. The members of her team were all men and she worked hard to help them judge distances, select clubs and read putts. There was a lot of laughter and lively conversation from the group who were nearly all English. The main aim of Davies's team was to combine well and win one of the handsome prizes that were on offer. It soon became clear, however, that there was another competition going on. It was the battle of the sexes. The aim in this competition was to outdrive Laura. One player became almost a caricature of the type I shall christen 'The Man whose Masculinity is at Stake'. His eyes bulged with concentration. He gripped the club so tightly that the muscles in his forearms stood out. He stopped at nothing to do the ball a mischief. It was hopelessly one-sided. Davies, the biggest hitter ever in women's golf, once drove a ball 340 yards and regularly drives 260 yards. Few men can compete with her in this department and, frankly, it is pointless to try. But that is not to say there is nothing to be gained from watching women's professional golf. The opposite is the case. Most men amateurs can learn far more from watching a women professional golfer than from her male equivalent because the game of the average player has much more in common with that of women professionals than with that of Seve Ballesteros. So the text for this morning is this: why can't a man be more like a woman? Women professional golfers are prey to the same self-doubts that plague men. You do not like fast downhill putts? Neither do they. You find long bunker shots hard? So do they. Worried about shanking the occasional chip? So are they. Men are reluctant to admire or learn from anything that is not male. They dress in their Nick Faldo shirts, with their Ballesteros rainsuit in their bags, tee up their two-piece high compression ball and stand on the first tee of a monthly medal hoping they won't make a complete hash of things. Faldo does not have the same fears and nor does Ian Woosnam. But many women professionals do. 'I know that when I am playing a downhill chip from a bare lie I am saying to myself: 'Keep your head still. Don't make a fool of yourself,'' says Kitrina Douglas, a member of Europe's Solheim Cup team which is competing against the Americans at Dalmahoy, Edinburgh, this weekend. A golfing partner of my father's remarked, tongue in cheek, last week: 'I like watching the women play golf because I like to see their figures and look at their legs but what I really like to watch is the rhythm with which they play golf.' This is the most obvious area in which men can learn from the women. Women have to acquire good rhythm because that is more than half the secret of hitting the ball any distance. This lesson was brought home to me when I played in a pro-am with Douglas. Bad weather restricted us to nine holes but this was long enough for her to demonstrate the repetitive rhythm of her swing and her remarkable accuracy. After about six holes of watching this, a funny thing happened to me. I started swinging more slowly, too. And sure enough, I hit the ball better and further. Another area where men can improve is in their attention to the short game. Men practice their long game, if they practice at all. Women do not ignore this department but they do not concentrate on it at the expense of their short game. 'When men practice they practice hitting their drives as far as they can' says Davies. 'They think they miss a lot of full shots. But if they think about it I reckon that nine times out of ten if they miss the green they do not get up and down. They need to work on their short games. All amateurs are let down by their short game.' Helen Wadsworth is in her second season as a professional on the European tour and already she has noticed some characteristics among the men who play with her in pro-ams. The first is their tendency to underclub and to talk about their own game. The second is their inability to accept advice. Bertie Wooster was once moved to remark: 'Women, the way I looked at it, simply couldn't do . . . what a crew] What a crew] I mean to say, what a crew]' I beg to differ. Women are there to be learned from, however hard it is for the male ego to accept this. If you do not believe me then go to Dalmahoy today or tomorrow and see for yourself. You will be all the better for it. And your golf will improve, too.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL BY FIRE;  </P> <P> IN DESERT HEAT OF '81, LEONARD-HEARNS I BURNED INTO HISTORY  </P> <P> Wednesday, Sept. 16, 1981, was a hot night here, but there were 25,000 people  in a parking lot stadium in the Nevada desert. Two young boxers were about to  engage one another for 14 memorable rounds in a contest that still stands, in  the minds of many of those who were there, as the fight of the '80s.  </P> <P> It was a night when courage, skill and endurance were at center stage. But most  of all, it was a night of savagery, a night when two immensely talented young  boxers, each in his prime, fought with an intensity that an entire generation  of boxing followers will never forget.  </P> <P> It was Leonard-Hearns. Seven years nine months later, we have Leonard-Hearns II  here Monday night.  </P> <P> This time, only the site, Caesars Palace, is the same. Sugar Ray Leonard, a 3-1  favorite Monday, is 33 now. Thomas Hearns is 30. That night in 1981, Leonard  was 25 and Hearns was 22.  </P> <P> Neither is the athlete he was eight years ago, but that won't matter when they  pick up their paychecks.  </P> <P> On Sept. 16, 1981, Leonard earned about $10 million when he stopped Hearns in  the 14th round. Hearns made about $5 million in a fight that brought in about  $50 million. This one is expected to bring in $70 million to $80 million.  </P> <P> Leonard will make at least $13 million, Hearns $11 million.  </P> <P> When asked about their 1981 fight, both fighters agree that what happened that  night won't have a bearing on what happens Monday. It was a long time ago.  </P> <P> Ah, but the memories remain. This one isn't lost in time's mists. It remains  vivid, alive.  </P> <P> Like other great boxing events of the 1980s -- Leonard-Marvin Hagler,  Hearns-Hagler, Evander Holyfield-Michael Dokes -- this one had ebb, flow,  explosiveness, elation and heartbreak.  </P> <P> Both were welterweights that night. Both owned pieces of the world  championship. Hearns (32-0) had never been beaten. Leonard (30-1) had lost only  to Roberto Duran, a defeat he had avenged in 1980.  </P> <P> Leonard was a 7-5 favorite when they entered the ring, both wearing white  robes, to the booming strains of the "Rocky" theme. Leonard weighed 146 pounds,  Hearns a whippet-like 145. Monday, they will be in the low 160s.  </P> <P> During the ring introductions, someone looked at a thermometer. It was 97  degrees.  </P> <P> In the first round, Leonard wheeled around the ring laterally, throwing an  occasional jab at Hearns, who stalked Leonard, flat-footed.  </P> <P> The second round was the same, and it was clear that Leonard was acutely  conscious of Hearns' vaunted right hand, which Hearns kept cocked. Early in the  third, Hearns began throwing right-hand bombs, and the crowd came to its feet,  roaring.  </P> <P> But he missed with them, as he would all night. One shot hit Leonard on the  shoulder. Another grazed the top of his head. Leonard ducked under one on the  ropes, escaping the punch, and his momentum nearly toppled Hearns over the top  rope.  </P> <P> Possibly, that exchange at least slightly lessened Leonard's fear of Hearns'  right, because at the end of the round he was throwing big rights himself. He  went after Hearns, wide open, seemingly daring him to hit him.  </P> <P> Twenty-five seconds into the fourth, Hearns connected. A straight right rocked  Leonard at center ring but only for a second. Leonard was clear-headed quickly.  </P> <P> After five rounds, Hearns seemed to be ahead on most cards, and chants of  "Tom-mee! Tom-mee!" went up.  </P> <P> Then came the sixth. If Leonard-Hearns I is still the fight of the '80s, then  Round 6 of of that bout is at least the second-best round of the '80s, slightly  behind Round 1 of Hearns-Hagler.  </P> <P> Ten seconds into the round, Leonard cracked Hearns on the jaw with a sneaky  right hand. With a minute left, Leonard badly hurt Hearns, on the ropes, with a  left uppercut to the jaw. But just as it seemed that the Hitman had had it, he  lashed out at Leonard and hurt him with a left hand. With the roar of the  excited crowd rolling across the desert, Leonard staggered Hearns with a short,  hard right.  </P> <P> Hearns was hurt and on the ropes when the round ended.  </P> <P> Leonard came out for the seventh and led with a thumping left hook to Hearns'  ribs, and the blow momentarily froze Hearns. He bent over and tried to hang on.  His legs were wobbly, and it suddenly seemed as if the sixth had eaten up  Hearns.  </P> <P> Midway through the eighth, Leonard caught Hearns in a neutral corner and hurt  him with a long right. Leonard seemed to be in complete command of a rapidly  failing opponent. But Hearns came out for the ninth surprisingly fresh and went  up on his toes. He became a dancer instead of a stalker, and for four rounds  Leonard couldn't catch him. And Leonard had a problem -- his left eye was  rapidly swelling shut.  </P> <P> Hearns landed some long, powerful jabs and padded a narrow point lead he had  held at the end of nine.  </P> <P> Amazingly, Hearns had survived. There he was, in Rounds 9 through 12, in cruise  control, piling up points. The Hitman was coming down the stretch, in charge.  </P> <P> "Tom-mee! Tom-mee!"  </P> <P> Then, in a twinkling, it all changed.  </P> <P> In the 13th, a desperate Leonard caught Hearns with a right. Hearns lashed back  with a right of his own, but Leonard shook it off and charged Hearns. With  seconds left in the round, Hearns was helplessly sprawled on the ropes, and  referee Davey Pearl had started a count over him at the bell.  </P> <P> In the 14th, Leonard hurt Hearns with a hard right, low on the left side of  Hearns' ribs. The conclusion swiftly arrived. Hearns was taking a horrible  beating and had collapsed into the ropes when Pearl, with 1:45 left in the  14th, waved Leonard off.  </P> <P> "He took a lot of blows to the head," Pearl said later. "He couldn't defend  himself. . . . If I think he's going to get seriously hurt, I'm going to stop  it. He didn't argue when I stopped it."  </P> <P> For Leonard, it was a great victory and an undisputed welterweight  championship.  </P> <P> For Hearns, it meant heartbreak. After 13 rounds, every judge had had him ahead  on points, by margins of four, three and two points.  </P></p>

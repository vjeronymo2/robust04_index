			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: Profits at Esab decline sharply ESAB, the world's leading welding equipment producer, saw first-half profits slump 66 per cent to SKr23m (Dollars 2.9m) because of a weaker performance from its European and Brazilian operations. Income in the second half is expected to be similar, resulting in a full-year profit well below last year's SKr160m. Sales rose to SKr3.38bn in the first half from SKr3.32bn, and orders expanded to SKr3.53bn from SKr3.42bn. However, both figures were flattered by the depreciation of the Swedish krona. On an underlying basis, sales were 7 per cent lower and orders were down 4 per cent. The group said it was encouraged by evidence of an improving trend in some markets. It said the Nordic and UK markets had begun to stabilise, while the decline in central and southern Europe was slowing. It also pointed to a 'cautious recovery' in the US, a more stable Brazilian market, and 'a moderate rate of growth' in south-east Asia, except for Singapore. The group has continued to expand its market position, particularly in eastern Europe and Russia. In the first half, it acquired 70 per cent of the Czech Republic's leading welding company, Zelezarny-Vamberk. In Russia it set up a jointly-owned company with Zapsibgaspromostroi (part of the Gasprom group) to produce covered electrodes with Esab technology and equipment. Euroc, the Swedish building materials group, boosted first-half profits after financial items and minority shares, to SKr95m from SKr10m in the same 1992 period. It also predicted its full-year result would be better than last year's SKr145m. The group said cost-cutting and lower financial costs had helped offset the impact of reduced building activity in Sweden and Finland, and increased price competition. The company is not expecting an upturn in European construction activity until 1995. In the meantime, investment in new construction in its main markets, Sweden and Finland, is expected to fall 20 per cent this year and 15 per cent in 1994.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pacific Enterprises sale to net Dollars 275m PACIFIC Enterprises, the US utility group, has completed the sale of all of its retailing operations, which comprise its Thrifty Corp unit and Big 5 Sporting Goods chain, to investment groups led by Leonard Green &amp; Partners, AP-DJ reports. The company said the sale of Thrifty and Big 5 would result in net proceeds, together with related tax benefits, of about Dollars 275m. Thrifty and Big 5 have combined revenues of about Dollars 3bn. Leonard Green &amp; Partners is an investment firm based in Los Angeles that specialises in management buy-outs. In addition to the sale proceeds, which are to be used to pay down Pacific Enterprises' debt, the company said it received warrants that will allow it to participate in future increases in the value of certain of the retailing operations. Pacific Enterprise said the sale of the retailing operations was part of a strategic plan to refocus on its core utility business. The restructuring calls for the removal from non-utility businesses and refocusing on Southern California Gas, a natural gas distributor. Pacific Enterprises said its next priority was to quit the oil and gas exploration and production business.</p>

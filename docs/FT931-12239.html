			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sudden pressure on franc THE DOLLAR, the French franc and sterling all recovered ground against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday afternoon after a sudden surge of tension inside the European exchange rate mechanism earlier in the day, writes James Blitz. A strong wave of selling of the Irish punt raised fears that the ERM might be destabilised by another devaluation, and this triggered pressure on the French franc in the early morning. The French currency fell by more than a centime against the D-Mark in the first hours of London trading, bottoming out at FFr3.3950. Three-month French cash was quoted at between 12 3/4 and 13 1/4 per cent, nearly a full point above its level on Wednesday night. Sterling also came under pressure, falling as low as DM2.38 against the German currency by midday, nearly 2 pfennigs under its close on Wednesday. The Irish punt continued to trade below its ERM floors against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder, in the wake of the UK's 100 basis-point cut in base rates on Tuesday. Several factors triggered a recovery in the afternoon. The first was an annualised 3.8 per cent rise in fourth-quarter GDP in the US, compared to 3.4 per cent in the third quarter. The figure took the shine off the D-Mark, pushing the dollar up to a London close of DM1.5855, a full pfennig above its low of the day. In New York it finished at DM1.5860. President Bill Clinton helped the dollar bulls by saying before a meeting yesterday with the Federal Reserve chairman that growing redundancies at major corporations were increasingly troubling. This encouraged the theory that he will introduce a fiscal boost to the economy, possibly compensated by higher interest rates. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, eased tensions by saying in Brussels that he hoped German inflation would be at 3 per cent this year. This was seen by some analysts as a more emollient stance on inflation, although a 3 per cent target for the end of 1993 has already been given by Bundesbank council members. Both events helped the French franc to recover to FFr3.385 by the European close. Sterling rallied to a close of DM2.4050, up  3/4 pfennig on the day. Against the dollar it was firmer at Dollars 1.5165, while in New York it ended at Dollars 1.5155. The Irish punt was still below its floors against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder after ERM trading officially closed at 4pm yesterday. Mr Avinash Persaud of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London said the punt's 20 per cent overvaluation against the D-Mark was unsustainable. But Ireland's resistance to devaluation may be helped by EC redevelopment grants amounting to Pounds 270m this year. 'This allows Irish exporters to enjoy a dual exchange rate structure, helping them endure cuts in profit margins,' he added.</p>

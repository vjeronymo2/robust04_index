Dinkins today named Houston Police Commissioner Lee Brown  as his new police commissioner after he takes office New Year's Day.  </P> <P> Brown will replace Acting Police Commissioner Richard Condon, who was named by  Mayor Edward I.

"Of all of the finalists, he seems to be the absolute best in the  country. I think that the Police Department will recognize Lee Brown for who he  is and what he is. He is a true professional."  </P> <P> Brown, 51, a native of Wewoka, Okla., became Houston police chief in 1982, the  first black to hold the job.

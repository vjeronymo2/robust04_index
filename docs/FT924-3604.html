			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Management: Following in Eskimo footsteps - Health Check Old wives' tales used to claim that eating fish was good for your brain. That has never been proved, but medical research over the last decade suggests that fish does help to reduce cholesterol levels. Eskimos, who eat enormous amounts of marine mammal blubber and fatty cold water fish have markedly low levels of damaging cholesterol. Indeed, compared with other races, Eskimos have a higher level of cardio-protective HDL-cholesterol (the so-called good cholesterol). So what is the effect of eating fish? The cardio-protective substances contained in many cold-water fish are unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, the most common of which are eicosapentoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) which increase the levels of cardio-protective HDL cholesterol. Another potentially beneficial effect of these fish oils is that as they become incorporated into capillary cell membranes, they help the red blood cells flow more easily in the tiny vessels. Moreover, there is preliminary evidence that omega-3 fatty acids may lower blood pressure and reduce inflammatory reactions. The highest concentrations of EPA and DHA are found in all seafoods and particularly in cold-water fish. Atlantic mackerel, Pacific salmon and Albacore tuna have the highest levels. The added oil in a can of fish is likely to be vegetable oil and not omega-3 fatty acid. However, draining the oil - a good idea because the added vegetable oil doubles the calorie load - does remove 15-25 per cent of precious omega-3 fatty acids because these are oil soluble. Although there are many fish oil supplements on the market, their long-term safety record is not known. So the best bet at present is to eat fish at least three times a week, remembering that the greater the amount of dark flesh on the fish, the greater the fat and the omega-3 fatty acid content.

Chinese scientists are stepping up research into and  manufacturing of large-capacity and long-life telecommunications  and broadcasting satellites, versatile meteorological satellites  and multi-purpose satellites.    Among them, the "Dongfanghong No. 3" telecommunications  satellite and "Fengyun No. 2" meteorological satellite will soon  go into operation.    The "Dongfanghong No.3" is equipped with 24 transponders and  has a designed life of eight years. That means that the  satellite will serve beyond the year 2000.    The "Fengyun No. 2" is the first earth-synchronous remote  meteorological satellite made in China.    Research into the technology of making navigation  satellites,  disaster-forecasting satellites and satellite telecommunications  systems for the finance industry is now under way.    The country, now ranking among the most advanced in the  world  in the field, is also making efforts to improve and upgrade its  "Long March" carrier rocket series so as to meet different needs  of both domestic and overseas customers.    Its "Long March-2B" heavy-thrust cluster carrier rocket now  has a capacity of 4.8 tons and can lift objects to an  earth-synchronous orbit. Its low-orbit carrying capacity is  about 12 tons.    The "Long March-1B" carrier rocket has raised its lift-off  capacity greatly, and the "Long March-3A" carrier rocket has  increased its carrying capacity for earth-synchronous orbit to  2.5 tons.    The rapid progress in satellite technology has boosted the  country's endeavors in telecommunications, broadcasting,  education, meteorology, natural resources exploration, ocean  utilization, map drawing, navigation, transportation, marine  rescue and environmental supervision.    With the aid of satellite technology, the country will build  a nationwide mobile telecommunications system, data information  system, accounting and taxation system, and salary-payment  system.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Yezhkov: "Special Services `Listened' in </F> on Property Fund: Preliminary Investigation in `Fishkov Case'  Complete"]    [Text] On 5 February the deadline expired for a  four-month investigation in the case of Aleksandr Fishkov,  deputy general director of the Petersburg Property Fund. The day  before, the investigation presented formal charges in the final  wording to the accused and his attorney, and made available to  them four volumes of the criminal investigation. Fishkov is  currently being charged under three articles:  172-a--"Negligence;" 88-1--"Illegal foreign currency  operations;" and the recently introduced 170-1--"Abuse of  official position."    Let us recall that Aleksandr Fishkov, who was responsible  for  conducting voucher auctions in the Property Fund, was arrested  on 7 October of last year during an interrogation at the GUVD  [City Administration of Internal Affairs] administration for  combating economic crimes. The cause for initiating criminal  proceedings was the discovery that the fund was short 13,500  privatization vouchers. Property fund employees in positions of  responsibility were unable to explain how such a quantity of  vouchers had disappeared from the fund; whether they had been  canceled or not; and, generally, whether these vouchers had  physically existed or had only been recorded in documents.    Soon after Fishkov's arrest, however, privatization vouchers  and this official's activities in the fund quickly ceased being  the main subject of his interrogations. Most of all, law  enforcement organs were interested in a dacha in Repino  settlement, purchased with Fishkov's parents' money. The  prosecution insists that Aleksandr Fishkov paid for the dacha in  cash in foreign currency and hence violated existing legislation.    The Oktyabrskiy Rayon People's Court twice declined the  defense attorney's petition to change the measure to secure the  appearance of the accused to a pledge not to leave town--in  October last year and January this year. In both instances the  court cited as the main argument for its ruling the presence in  the charges of the "grave" Article 88 and Fishkov's high  position before his arrest.    Since the completion of the preliminary investigation is the  time to summarize the initial results, one cannot fail to note  the investigation time frame, which set a record by current  standards. These days not every criminal case involving petty  theft can be squeezed into four months. As to sensational  cases--of which there have been quite a few lately--they drag  on, as a rule, for more than a year. The "grave" Article 88  permitted them to extend the investigation in Fishkov's case for  up to a year and a half. Moreover, even the city procurator  could authorize a six-month investigation term, without having  to go Moscow for permission. Nevertheless, the investigator  asked for only four months, got it with no problem,  and--completed it on time.    The official explanation for such unprecedented vigor is  obvious: The investigator chooses the time frame at his  discretion. Keeping in mind, however, that the accused  languishes in jail, it is in the interests of operative  services, as a rule, to drag it out. The "client" is right  there; you can work with him at an unhurried pace. The longer he  stays there, the worse his psychological state of mind and the  greater the chance of obtaining new interesting information from  him.    The only explanation of the "Fishkov phenomenon" worth  looking at is in the area of political considerations. The  criminal case against Fishkov occurred at the time of another  round of radical changes in the disposition of forces on the  political scene. What was topical four months ago may possibly  produce completely the reverse effect today, or lose  significance altogether.    Before the October armed clash the opposing forces actively  looked for compromising materials on each other. Suffice it to  recall the Yakubovskiy theme that was a permanent fixture in  newspapers. The special services turned to Fishkov, too--already  under arrest--in search of this kind of compromising material.  They were interested, among other things, in one of the most  active people on Chubays' team--Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy  chairman of the State Committee for the Administration of State  Property.    Another discovery that came out of the "Fishkov case" was  the  fact that the office and home telephones of the property fund's  top officials had been wiretapped. Authorization issued by the  supervising procurator is dated March of last year. Fishkov was  among the persons whose telephones had been tapped.    There was, for instance, a recording of Fishkov's  conversation with Aleksandr Kokh, former deputy chairman of the  committee for the administration of city property. In response  to Fishkov's justified argument that the property fund was not  prepared to conduct privatization auctions and his proposal not  to rush it, the interlocutor assures him that everything would  be fine and insists on keeping up the pace of privatization.  Several weeks later Fishkov would be sitting in a preliminary  investigative detention facility on charges of negligence.    An important circumstance that draws one's attention is that  if we agree with the prosecution's position, Fishkov's "criminal  actions" began at the earliest in the summer of last year. In  particular, the payment in foreign currency for the dacha in  Repino--assuming it did indeed take place--happened in June, and  the loss of the vouchers--in September. At the same time, the  special services had by then been authorized several months  earlier to listen in to property fund employees' telephone  conversations. Let us point out that they have to present  sufficient cause in order to have wiretaps authorized. In other  words, if a certain person is under suspicion and this suspicion  has grounds, the procurator has the right to authorize covert  surveillance, including wiretaps. It is not known what kind of  sufficient cause the special services had with respect to the  property fund almost a year ago.    Wiretaps on Fishkov's telephones also brings up at least two  more questions. If we assume that the disappearance of the  vouchers from the property fund was a result of someone's  machinations, a regular wiretap on telephone conversations  should easily have produced an answer as to where and how the  privatization vouchers had disappeared. However, to our best  knowledge, the investigation does not have an answer to this  question. In addition, according to the investigation's version,  the transfer of foreign currency as payment for the dacha was  done in Fishkov's office at the property fund. The subject of  transferring such a large amount of money would inevitably have  cropped up in private conversations. However, wiretap materials  do not confirm this fact in any way, and the entire case against  Fishkov under Article 88--"foreign currency dealings"--is built  only on the testimony of the other participant in the deal--the  seller of the dacha.    In an article entitled "The Roulette Wheel Stopped on Black"  (NEVSKOYE VREMYA 8 December of last year) on the subject of the  "Fishkov case" we looked in great detail into the circumstances  related to the charges against Fishkov on "foreign currency  dealings." The first item that raised questions then was why the  charge of violating foreign currency operations had been brought  only against Fishkov, since the law envisages the responsibility  of both participants in a foreign currency deal. Moreover, the  investigation has in its possession a document showing that Mr.  K.--the dacha seller--was loaning foreign currency out with  interest, that is, not only conducting foreign currency deals  but also making a profit from them. No charges have been brought  against Mr. K., however; moreover, he was not even asked to sign  a pledge not to leave town.    At that time we advanced the hypothesis that Mr. K., who was  planning to move permanently to America, would definitely leave  Russia without waiting for Fishkov trial. Two weeks later, in  December of last year, the main witness in the Fishkov case, Mr.  K., indeed moved to America permanently, and there is  practically no chance of getting him to appear at the upcoming  trial. Most likely the court will not hear the first-hand  testimony of this man and will have to make a ruling on this  part of the charges exclusively on the basis of the preliminary  investigation materials.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Osterhofen (DPA) -- Franz Schoenhuber, chairman of  the right-wing extremist Republikaner, has predicted that the  Christian Social Union [CSU] will decline to a 20-percent party.  "This is the day of change and the greatest day in the history  of the Republikaner," Schoenhuber stated at his party's Ash  Wednesday rally in front of an audience of -- according to  police estimates -- about 6,500 people in a beer tent on the  outskirts of Osterhofen, Lower Bavaria. The end of the  traditional parties is near. "I have been chosen by fate to  help the German people," Schoenhuber said. On Wednesday the  hour of the CSU's decline tolled in Passau [where the CSU is  holding its Ash Wednesday rally]. The rise of the Republikaner  cannot be stopped anymore, Schoenhuber stated.    Schoenhuber accused Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central  Council of Jews, of fanning anti-Semitism in the FRG. There is  no collective guilt for the crimes of the Nazi period. "Today's  Germany is not guilty. Our only crime in world history was that  we lost two world wars," Schoenhuber said.</p>

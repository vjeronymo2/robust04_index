			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Satisfaction gained from service: Three former public servants recall their attitudes to remuneration SIR Michael Palliser, former head of the Diplomatic Service, is blunt about the attractions of pay for the civil servant. 'You do not go into the public services if you want to make a lot of money,' he said. Sir Michael resisted the lure of the City 40 years ago and enjoyed a distinguished career. 'I decided to stay in the foreign service and I have never regretted it,' he explained. 'Money played a part in some leaving, but my impression was that it was only one of several reasons in most cases. The money did not affect the calibre of civil servants.' After his retirement, Sir Michael became chairman of Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank. For General Sir Hugh Beach, Army pay was not a significant factor in planning a career. 'It never crossed my mind that someone in ICI should or should not be earning three times as much as me.' Sir Hugh saw active service in France in 1944, rose to deputy commander-in-chief, UK land forces, and was director of the Council for Arms Control until three years ago. As a young officer, he says, businessmen were described as 'boxwallahs', a derogatory term for hawkers in India. Salaries were not mentioned in polite company. 'One's chief satisfaction was moving steadily up the ladder,' says Sir Hugh. 'And the gilt on the gingerbread was the occasional gong. We just wanted a comfortable life.' Sir Frederick Lawton, 80, who retired in 1986 after 11 years as a High Court judge and 14 years in the Court of Appeal, said money was not a decisive factor for most barristers in accepting appointment to the High Court bench. Like most successful barristers who become judges he took 'a very substantial drop in income' when he was appointed. It would have been 'totally unrealistic to have expected judges' salaries to match my income at the Bar.' Sir Frederick said that for him and for most barristers becoming a judge was a natural career progression. The motive for accepting an appointment was 'a continuing desire to be involved in the administration of justice.' Reporting by Daniel Green, Robert Rice, and Michael Smith.</p>

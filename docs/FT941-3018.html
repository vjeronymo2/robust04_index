			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Doctors in Sweden fight PM's cure-all Pressures building over two years of reform and spending cuts in Sweden's health service, a central pillar of the country's famous welfare system, have come to a head this month in the form of a rare strike by doctors. Thousands of non-urgent operations have already been postponed in hospitals around the country because of two successive two-and-a-half day stoppages by surgeons and doctors in a dispute over weekend and night-duty pay rates and the implementation of a new liberal system governing family doctors. With no sign of a breakthrough in negotiations, the Swedish Medical Association, whose 24,000 members represent 95 per cent of the country's doctors, has dug in its heels, calling out 2,600 of its members for a third round of selective strikes next week. The dispute springs directly from efforts by the right-centre government of the prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, which came to power in late 1991, to both liberalise the monolithic health service and squeeze savings out of a system which until recently put Sweden among the highest spenders on health as a proportion of GNP within the OECD. The current row revolves around a reform which for the first time gives Swedes the right to choose their individual family doctor and which gives doctors the right to set up private practices independent of the local authorities. A further change, due to take effect next month, will also allow specialist doctors to set up privately for the first time. Neither step amounts on its own to a splintering of the system. So far fewer than 1,000 doctors have opted to go private, while the majority are apparently content to remain within the governance of the local health authorities. The reforms are part of a general thrust by the Bildt government to introduce greater competition into the system - a move fiercely resisted by the opposition Social Democratic party, the architect of Sweden's welfare edifice. If Mr Bildt should win the general election in September (which the polls suggest is unlikely) he would like to move on to allowing the establishment of private hospitals in Sweden outside local authority control. The medical association, ironically, is in principle in favour of greater freedoms for its members. But it is objecting to a proposal that family doctors who are chosen by fewer than 1,000 patients should be fired by the local authorities, regardless of their length of service. The second dispute is about proposals by the local authorities - who negotiate centrally with the medical association - to cut higher weekend and night-duty pay rates for doctors to compensate for health spending cuts. According to the association of county councils, overall health service spending has been cut by SKr5bn (Pounds 425m) in each of the last two years, bringing annual spending down to SKr116bn, or about 7.5 per cent of GNP, one of the lowest levels in the OECD. Further cuts this year are set to take up to another 4 per cent out of spending. Up to 25 per cent of surgical beds have been closed and some 30,000 jobs have been cut from the health service workforce, which is now down to around 400,0000, or one tenth of the country's workforce. Other savings have been achieved through widespread contracting out of services such as catering and laundry. Mr Bildt's government says the changes have made the system more efficient, but doctors appear to be facing surprisingly little public criticism of their strike action, which has not affected emergency services.</p>

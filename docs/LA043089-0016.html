			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' CHOICE  </P> <P> TRIPMASTER MONKEY His Fake Book by Maxine Hong Kingston (Alfred A. Knopf:  $19.95; 339 pp.)  </P> <P> "Kingston's first novel is fantastic, an eminent brush with a wild romancer.  The Monkey King is the paramount metaphor in these stories; the simian moves  are comic transformations."  </P> <P>  -- Gerald Vizenor  </P> <P> </P> <P> FIRST FATHER, FIRST DAUGHTER A Memoir by Maureen Reagan (Little, Brown: $19.95;  415 pp.)  </P> <P> "A tale of perseverance. If personal growth is one of the fairest measures of  people, this book convinced me that Maureen Reagan deserves more credit than  she often gets." -- Keith Love  </P></p>

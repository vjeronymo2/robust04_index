			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris down as French analysts revise forecasts Yesterday's batch of US economic statistics did little to influence bourses; performance seemed to benefit from the public going to the polls, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS took profits ahead of the weekend, after four days of impressive gains, and the CAC-40 index shed 22.66 or 1.2 per cent to 1,933.02. The weakness of the US dollar later in the day also had an impact on performance during the afternoon but, in spite of yesterday's descent, the market managed a 4 per cent gain on the week. According to a survey of 16 French equity research organisations, analysts recently moved to revise their forecasts for 1995 company earnings. Forecasts have been revised down for 24 of the companies in the CAC-40 index, with 12 being revised up and four unchanged. Alcatel-Alsthom, one of the market's largest stocks in terms of market capitalisation, was trimmed back heavily following its poor interim results at the end of last month. The consensus forecast was for 1995 earnings per share of FFr46.30 compared with a previous estimate of FFr53.60 and the shares closed down FFr3.70 yesterday at FFr474.30. Eurotunnel, which is not a CAC-40 constituent, again featured as one of the session's worst performers as investors took the view that first-half results due out on Monday would be disappointing. The shares lost 7.5 per cent, or FFr1.55 to FFr19.00, bringing their loss since last Friday to 9.5 per cent. Analysts said that they would not be surprised if the group had to make a further cash call on banks and shareholders early in the new year. FRANKFURT tried to curb its enthusiasm but the market expectation that the ruling conservative/liberal coalition would secure a 20 or 30 seats' majority in tomorrow's general elections, combined with yesterday afternoon's neutral batch of US economic data, let its underlying bullishness rise to the surface at the end of the day. The session rise of 23.10 to 2,105.73, leaving the Dax index up 7.4 per cent on the week, did not quite incorporate Thursday's post-bourse gains and, for a while, it looked as if German equities would go no higher until the election was decided. Turnover fell from DM8bn to DM6.4bn. However, it was impossible to restrain Allianz, the insurer, a proxy for the German market and a beta stock, in that it tends to outperform on the downgrade, and on the upgrade: yesterday it rose another DM34 to DM2,397 after hours, helping the Ibis-indicated Dax climb to 2,118.52 by the end of the afternoon. ZURICH was easier on profit-taking after recent gains. The SMI index declined 8.0 to 2,585.3, but was still 3.6 per cent ahead over the week. Activity continued to centre on the banking sector. UBS bearers picked up another SFr26 to SFr1,258, with the bank again a buyer of its own stock, as the battle with BK Vision over a new share structure continued. UBS registered picked up SFr6 to SFr310, with BK Bank, which controls BK Vision, said to be an active buyer. Among the insurers, Winterthur declined SFr20 to SFr630 and Zurich Insurance shed SFr15 to SFr1,190. In pharmaceuticals, Roche certificates declined SFr40 to SFr5,900 ahead of Monday's release of nine-month sales figures, forecast to rise between 3 and 5 per cent in Swiss franc terms and around 8 to 10 per cent in local currencies. AMSTERDAM made a modest gain following the US data, although a weakening dollar later in the afternoon pulled a number of currency-sensitive stocks lower. The AEX index rose 0.85 to 408.16 for a week's rise of 3.7 per cent. Oce-van der Grinten, the photocopier manufacturer, initially dipped on profit-taking following the publication of third-quarter profits which showed a gain of 40 per cent, at the top end of analysts' expectations. But after touching a session low of Fl 74.30, the shares recovered to close unchanged at Fl 76.50. MILAN saw a quiet end to the October account, with many banks closed by the day's general strike. The Comit index registered a rise of 4.22 to 634.54, up 0.7 per cent over the week, but the real time Mibtel index lost 101 on the day to 10,119. Telecom Italia, which said it was seeking a co-operation accord with a foreign telecommunications operator within the next few months, lost L76 to L4,149. MADRID saw weakness in domestic bonds where the December future was off 48 basis points at 88.05 by late afternoon. The general index fell 1.68 to 301.50, leaving it 3.4 per cent ahead on the week. One of the day's best performers was Cortefiel, Spain's second largest specialist clothing retailer, which unveiled plans to expand in Germany yesterday, and which has been courting analysts in recent days. The shares rose Pta230, or 5.9 per cent to Pta4,130. HELSINKI rose ahead of Sunday's advisory referendum on Finland's EU membership, the Hex index putting on 48.4, or 2.5 per cent at 1,961.3, up 7.1 per cent on the week.

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Management: Betrayed, unloved and angry It did not promise to be a great night out. The venue was Wembley Conference Centre, London, and the occasion was the annual employees' evening for one of Britain's biggest companies. Local staff had been invited to bring a guest for a Q and A session with the company's board, hosted by a well-known media personality. Afterwards, there was to be a prize draw, a buffet and drinks. My first response to the occasion was incredulity. How could the management be so out of touch to expect workers and their dates to give up an evening to hear company propaganda, eat a sausage roll and drink a glass of nasty white wine? As I sat in the half-empty hall listening to a deafening disco beat and waiting for the top team to file on to the stage, I felt my doubts confirmed. In the event the evening was grim, but not in the kitsch, pointless way I had bargained for. Instead of the usual queries about broken coffee machines or dirty windows, there followed a barrage of hostile questions. Employees of this would-be world-class company complained about their job insecurity, their lack of prospects and about planned changes to their hours. They ridiculed the company's new-fangled mission statement with its fine words about mutual respect. The graduate employees, the rank and file and the middle managers spoke with one voice: they felt betrayed, put-upon, unloved and angry. Even some of the spouses had their say. One who worked in the civil service said that at least her employer recognised there was no point in talking about customer care unless the staff were also cared for. With each successive sally came louder cheers from the crowd. The panel, equipped with all the media training money can buy, ducked and weaved. They talked of external pressures, about the need to be competitive, about going through a hard patch. Their answers were long and tangential, as if trying to postpone the next onslaught. But all to no avail. The crowd continued to hustle. What a public relations disaster, I started to think. An employee who began the evening faintly resentful would surely have ended it mutinous, having everyone else's grievances to add to their own. Yet I left with a different conclusion. It is not easy for senior management of big companies to communicate with its employees. They cannot hope to meet people informally, and company magazines and videos are a one-sided way of keeping in touch. You have to give this unhappy management some credit for being brave enough to face the workers directly. One only hopes they were shaken enough by the experience to ask themselves why motivation is so low, rather than heave a sigh of relief that they have a full year before having to go through that ordeal again. The real message from the evening was not about the virtues or otherwise of employee meetings. It was that big companies such as this one, which have done well by their customers and their shareholders, have been neglecting their employees. Half have lost their jobs and the rest are left desperately demoralised. Dealing humanely with the ones who go is the easy part. Dealing with those that remain is a more serious problem than an annual invitation to Wembley can hope to solve. The other day I heard a perfectly sensible person saying that she needed half an hour's 'face time' with a colleague. Half an hour's what? Surely she did not mean the two of them needed to reapply their make-up? It turned out she simply wanted to talk to her colleague in person. It cannot be long before speaking on the telephone is known as 'ear and mouth time'. 'Face time' apart, I detect a degree of imagination creeping into the latest management speak. Michael Johnson, author of Business Buzzwords, has sent me some brand new examples, a few of which are almost useful. One such is 'brains on sticks', which refers to all those MBAs and wet-behind-the-ears management consultants who have read the books but do not know how to comport themselves when faced with a seasoned business person. Another nice one is 'Achilles mouth' - the tendency to say things better left unsaid. This trait is becoming rarer as managers get more uniform; it is therefore sad to see one of the finest Achilles mouths on record, Roland Shaw (who once described me as a semi-literate, ill-informed hack), retiring this week as chairman of Premier Consolidated Oilfields. But my favourite concept is that of the Pavarotti manager, who is so booked up that he can't see you for years ahead. Robert Horton used to be a case in point. When chairman of BP he told me one November that he did not have a free spot in his diary until June. In his new incarnation at Railtrack he is having to be a bit more spontaneous - the Pavarotti manager would not cut much ice with Jimmy Knapp.</p>

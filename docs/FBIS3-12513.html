			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 2 Mar (INA)--The newspaper BABIL asserts  that the UN Security Council [UNSC] resolutions on Somalia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina are flagrant evidence of the deteriorating  credibility and role of the United Nations. They are testimony  to the immense U.S. domination of the UNSC's operating  mechanisms and decisionmaking process.    In an article published today, the paper adds: The U.S.  moves to obstruct the passage of a resolution condemning the  Zionist entity and authorizing the deployment of international  observers in the occupied Arab territories to protect the  Palestinians show the immense U.S. domination of the world body  and the UNSC, and demonstrate the urgent need to restore balance  to the UNSC-- something impossible to achieve as long as the  UNSC remains hostage to U.S. wishes.    BABIL goes on to say: The U.S. treatment of the UNSC is a  clear message to all those who expect the "cosponsors of the  conference" to find a solution to the Palestinian people's  ordeal. For the judge is the very culprit, whose hands are  stained with the blood of our people in both Iraq and Palestine.    BABIL recalls the rapidity with which the UNSC passed its  anti-Iraq resolutions in August 1990, when it passed three  resolutions in a single week. Together, these resolutions  contained 18 paragraphs, the implementation of which is  mandatory.    The paper concludes by saying: This is how the United States  handled the Iraq issue and pushed the UNSC to pass a series of  unfair resolutions in an unprecedented manner.</p>

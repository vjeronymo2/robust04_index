			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Longing for an economic miracle: It will be a hard climb, but many remain sure of the future As hundreds of thousands of South Africans gathered a few days ago to give thanks for the political miracle that led to the establishment of their country's first democratic government, that same government was coming to realise how difficult achieving a similar economic miracle was going to be. While Peace Day marchers nationwide sang the country's two national anthems, the release of worse-than-expected inflation figures caused bond yields to soar over 17 per cent, effectively ending the possibility of any further interest rate cuts. In response, economists downgraded growth estimates for the year to between 2-2.5 per cent from the previously-expected 3-4 per cent. All this puts further pressure on President Nelson Mandela and his African National Congress-led goverment. With nearly half the potential workforce unemployed and 7m people out of 40m without proper homes, they desperately want to provide tangible evidence of the fall of apartheid to their constituents in the form of jobs and housing. But they are constrained by the need to maintain economic credibility in the eyes of the global financial community so as to attract new foreign loans and investment to the country. In his June budget, Mr Derek Keys, outgoing finance minister, restricted the allocation to the government's centrepiece Reconstruction and Development Programme to only R2.5bn (Pounds 696m), to keep to his commitment of lowering the budget deficit. Despite this, as signalled by last week's collapse in bonds, the markets still believe a degree of overspending is inevitable, given the wide range of demands on state resources, particularly as the new network of local and regional governments is established during the year. But, damaging though this might be, the biggest problems faced by the South African economy are structural and not susceptible to short-term monetary or fiscal panaceas. A legacy of economic problems from the previous government (at least before Mr Keys was appointed two years ago) has left the new administration with a very limited set of policy options. During the 1980s, growth stagnated but government spending rose relentlessly. In consequence, the budget deficit rose from next to nothing to more than 8 per cent of Gross Domestic Product in 1992. Although that figure has now been brought below 7 per cent, and is budgeted at 6.6 per cent for 1994-5, government spending still takes up an exorbitant 21 per cent of GDP, well above international norms. Given the high personal tax levels already in place, the only viable way of reducing this is through real cuts in government spending and a willingness to jettison controversial policies such as the maintenance of high tariffs for a largely uncompetitive manufacturing industry. In delivering his annual report last month, Mr Chris Stals, Reserve Bank Governor, pulled no punches in driving home this point. He emphasised that unless deep-seated problems such as excessive protectionism, high labour costs, widespread labour unrest and persistently high inflationary expectations were tackled immediately, the longer-term growth potential of the economy would be seriously damaged. Formidable though these obstacles might be, the outlook is not one of unrelieved gloom. Inflation may be on the rise again, but even its current 8.2 per cent is well down on the 15-16 per cent reached only a few years ago; overall inflation for the year is expected to remain in single digits. While the wave of labour unrest may be damaging, total strike action remains below levels seen as recently as 1991. Many analysts believe this year's disputes are artificially exacerbated by the heightened expectations resulting from the election and the inexperience of a new wave of labour leaders. Next year's wage talks are expected to be markedly calmer. Even more encouragingly, the government is publicly committed to a strategy of pursuing export-led growth and reducing protection for industry in line with the new Gatt arrangements. In recent weeks, Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, has warned manufacturers the goverment intends to reduce protection even below Gatt-required levels in some over-protected industries such as textiles and the motor industry. Fixed investment and private savings have both turned around after years of decline and are rising, while business confidence is at a five-year high. Exports, in both commodities and manufactured goods, have been expanding steadily. Foreign reserves remain at pitifully low levels, barely able to cover five weeks' imports, but indications are that the huge capital outflows which bled South Africa over the past few years have now largely ceased. With total foreign currency-denominated debt at only Dollars 16.7bn (Pounds 11.1bn) and interest payments accounting for just 7 per cent of exports in 1993, South Africa has some scope for new borrowing. While foreign investment has so far been largely restricted to shorter-term investments in the bond and equity markets, deterred in part by the maintenance of the country's two-tier currency, many foreigners remain remarkably sanguine about the country's prospects. 'I've been very impressed with the sophistication of the infrastructure and the quality of the people,' notes Mr Steve Walsh, chief executive officer of the US-based group Pillsbury International, which has just embarked on a R152m joint venture with the South African food-processor Foodcorp. 'I think this country has a lot of potential,' he says. The problems are immense, and the country is far from being able to achieve the Asian 'tiger'-type growth rates it so desperately desires, but the fact remains that South Africa's overall economic outlook is better than for decades. As a report on the country to be released this week by the Union Bank of Switzerland concludes: 'South Africa has the main ingredients required to place the country firmly on the high road to development.' It will be a long hard climb, but South Africans will be hoping that soon, national celebrations of the country's economic success will be held to complement this year's political ones.</p>

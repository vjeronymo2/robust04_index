			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Mahathir attacks UK over Bosnia A TWO-DAY visit to Malaysia by Mr John Major, the prime minister, was jarred last night when Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his Malaysian counterpart, accused Britain of standing by while Bosnian Moslems were 'wiped out'. Mr Major was clearly surprised by Dr Mahathir's attack, which soured the atmosphere at a ceremonial banquet in Kuala Lumpur, the first official function of the visit. The Malaysian prime minister appealed to Britain to influence the European Community to put an end to 'ethnic cleansing' before Bosnia was 'forever cemented in history as the blackest catastrophe of the modern world'. Taking hurried notes of Dr Mahathir's comments, Mr Major inserted a long passage defending Britain's Bosnian role into his planned speech on Commonwealth friendship. He said he felt 'as strongly as anyone else about the wickedness and intolerance we see daily in Bosnia,' and claimed that British action had saved hundreds of thousands of Bosnian lives. The impact of Dr Mahathir's speech was, however, blunted by his reputation as a frequent critic of Britain's role as a former colonial power. Observers also suggested that Dr Mahathir was keen to demonstrate his concerns about Bosnia to Malaysia's Moslem majority and to Moslem leaders elsewhere. He said Malaysia's 'hearts cry out to the tragedy of an entire race being wiped out in total disregard for even elementary decency', and warned that 'we cannot accept that it is right and just and democratic to sit by and watch while such brutish acts are committed'. Dr Mahathir said he understood Britain's concerns for the safety of its peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and the continuation of humanitarian aid. But he said the European powers had repeatedly backed down from the threat of air strikes after the threats had been 'arrogantly ignored' by Serb forces. He called for 'resolute and credible action' against the Serbs, and told Mr Major that European inaction risked igniting a widespread Balkan war. 'You are sending the wrong signals to certain countries east of Yugoslavia - countries with a past history of violent acquisition of other people's territories.' Dr Mahathir was visited recently by Lady Thatcher, Mr Major's predecessor, who has also called for stronger European action against the Bosnian Serbs. Ironically, Lady Thatcher was at the centre of the last row with Malaysia in the early 1980s, when Dr Mahathir launched a 'Buy British Last' campaign in protest against British policies on trade.

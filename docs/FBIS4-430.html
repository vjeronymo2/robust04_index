			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpts] Kigali, 12 Apr (AFP)--Rwanda's interim prime  minister said his government was ready to comply with  eight-month-old peace accords to end the ethnic warfare in the  country provided there was no "cheating." "We see no reason to  start negotiations from scratch," despite the fighting between  government forces and rebels from the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF), Prime Minister Jean Kambanda told AFP late Monday [11  April]. "We want a truce that would allow us to open overall  negotiations on a ceasefire, then political negotiations," he  said.    The RPF has refused to recognize the interim government  which  it says has only members opposed to the rebels. Rebel  reinforcements Monday were reported to have advanced to the  outskirts of the city amid fresh fighting in the capital as UN  commanders tried to secure a truce between the two sides.    Kambanda said he saw no problem with provisions in the peace  accord signed last August in Arusha, Tanzania, that gave the RPF  five ministers and 11 deputies, saying he felt divisions among  political parties and "individual initiatives" of certain  leaders had prevented implementation of the accord. [passage  omitted]    Kambanda, a member of the main opposition group the  Democratic Republican Movement, said certain political leaders,  including ministers, had "tried to keep out members of their own  parties in favor of the RPF" in talks on the transition  government. "People's frustrations built up, and exploded in  the rage triggered by the death of the head of state," he said.    Kambanda said one of the obstacles to a truce to end the  latest bloodletting was the RPF's demand to negotiate directly  with the Army and not with the interim government.    The interim government, most of whose members are staying in  a hotel in the capital Kigali, also has "questions" about how  the 600 RPF troops who arrived in Kigali obtained heavy weapons,  he said. Kambanda said they were only to be armed under treaty  provisions with light weapons for their mission to ensure  protection of RPF leaders in the capital. One member of the  government said the RPF Monday destroyed an Army tank "with a  rocket they were not supposed to have."    Some Hutu politicians have viewed Belgium as pro-Tutsi, but  Kambanda has refused to join in their accusations that the UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda -- which includes Ghanaians and  Bangladeshi troops along with the Belgians -- did not correctly  monitor RPF troops or that Belgium supplied the rebels with  arms. [passage omitted]    Kambanda would not confirm reports that Habyarimana's plane  was shot down, but he said he had "just learned" that Rwandan  Army troops prevented UN soldiers from examining the plane and  he would "negotiate with the Army to resolve this problem."</p>

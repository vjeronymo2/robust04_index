They also  examined ways of increasing the powers of the prime minister, traditionally a  Sunni Muslim, Lebanese sources said. Sixty-two of Parliament's 73 surviving  deputies have been meeting in Taif since Saturday in a session removed from  Lebanon because of a battle that began in March between Christians and a Muslim  alliance led by Syrian troops.  </P></p>

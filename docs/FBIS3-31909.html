			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera; </F> date, place not given--recorded]    [Text] All members of the National Armed Forces [FAN] as  well as all Venezuelans know perfectly well that the president  has the power to appoint ministers. The defense minister is no  exception. There are no other requirements other than to be a  Venezuelan citizen, more than 30 years of age, and a lay person  [seglar]. Therefore, in theory, a civilian, a retired military  member, or an active military member could hold the post. There  are no requirements of rank for the post of defense minister.    When General Lopez Contreras became president, he appointed  Colonel Isaias Medina Angarita as war and navy minister, as the  position was called back then, despite the fact there were very  important Armed Forces generals in active service, such as Gen.  Manuel Moran, Gen. (Antonio Chalvo Cardona), and Gen. David  Lopez Enriquez.    In this case, I have decided to appoint a division general  who has more than enough merits for the post and who currently  is second in the Army's hierarchy. The Constitution empowers  the president, as FAN commander in chief, to carry out this  delicate task. This task is so important that it is one of the  two posts the president, according to the Constitution, can  directly appoint without the need to have the minister confirm  the appointment.    This is perfectly clear, simple, and is a tradition that  dates back in our democracy. During each constitutional period,  the president appointed the defense minister and the top  military command. When President Romulo Betancourt handed over  the Presidency to fellow party member Dr. Raul Leoni, Dr. Leoni  did not confirm Gen. Antonio Briceno Linares, who was  Betancourt's defense minister and who still had two years of  service before retiring; instead, he appointed Gen. Ramon  Florencio Gomez.    When I took over as president after Dr. Leoni, I did not  confirm Dr. Gomez, who still had a few more months of service  before retiring. Instead, I appointed Gen. Martin Garcia  Villazmil as defense minister. When my period in office ended  and Mr. Carlos Andres Perez took office, he did not keep or  confirm Gen. (Gustavo Pardo Davila), who still had some time  before retirement; instead, he appointed Gen. Homero Leal Torres.    This tradition was broken when President Luis Herrera  Campins  took office, who confirmed Gen. Paredes Bello to the ministry.  Something similar happened in the following years; nevertheless,  when President Perez again became president, he made his own  military appointments.    I want to refer to the statements by Vice Admiral Radamez  Munoz Leon regarding my decision, statements that are improper  for an active member of the military. I must reject the  statement that I have humiliated the minister and members of the  High Command. I do not know how this can be termed humiliation  when I have invited them to my home, courteously telling them I  had decided--after meditating the situation of the country and  Armed Forces--to appoint a new defense minister and a new  military High Command. I added that I wanted to give them my  full recognition as a Venezuelan and as a participant in the  electoral process for the services rendered to the country  regarding this electoral process and in defense of the  democratic institution.    I have told them they were entitled to announce this  decision  to reporters if they felt they should, or if they preferred they  could say they had gone to my house to tender their respective  positions. This is what the defense minister termed as childish,  a totally unjustified remark. I do not want to refer to the  minister's other remarks, except one which I consider important.  One cannot speak of a rift within the Armed Forces simply  because seven generals--of whom five are retiring in four months  because they have been in service for a long time, the two  others, in one year and four months-- will request, as President  Velasquez told me they had requested, their retirement. There  is no rift within the Armed Forces. There simply is a decision,  perfectly regular within the armed institutes.    Furthermore, I am convinced the adopted decision strengthens  the Armed Forces' unity. I have absolute confidence the Armed  Forces are aware of their role within the Constitution and the  laws, which is to abide by and firmly support the president's  decisions when exercising the powers vested upon him by the  Constitution.</p>

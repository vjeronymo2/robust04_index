			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / East Germany faces big rise in unemployment THE German government is bracing itself for a dramatic increase in east German unemployment in July, when several hundred thousand public servants will lose their jobs and the one year ban on redundancies in the engineering industry ends. Mr Thomas Geitz, an official at the BDA, one of the main employers' organisations, said that the engineering industry agreement had been reluctantly respected but employers were hoping to shed many workers in July. IG Metall, the industry union, is seeking talks to extend the agreement. Many engineering workers in east Germany are on government supported short-time working so the effect of ending the no-redundancies agreement will be to transfer many short-time workers (currently about 2m) to the unemployed total (now about 1m). Most of the several hundred thousand public servants who have been suspended on 70 per cent of their pay since the end of last year will also lose their jobs in July. The public servants worked for organs of the former communist state which have now been dissolved. Yesterday the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe ruled that the suspension of the workers had not been unconstitutional, except in the case of pregnant women whose suspension contravened their job security arrangements. Early signs of upswing in the east German economy were detected yesterday by two economic research institutes, the IFO in Munich and the DIW in west Berlin. The IFO business confidence report said that in February the business climate had improved for the first time since August last year. DIW said incomes in east Germany rose by a fifth from the middle of 1989 to the end of 1990, reaching about 60 per cent of the west German level.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN PACIFIST PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> Jennifer Jean Casolo, the first American ever formally accused of aiding the  leftist Salvadoran guerrillas, pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges of terrorism  and possession of war weapons.  </P> <P> Speaking to reporters after 10 days in a cold jail cell, the tiny,  irrepressible pacifist said she is determined to test a justice system in which  she has little faith.  </P> <P> "It's time to put our innocence before the courts," she shouted from the back  seat of a police pickup truck that had driven her to a military court  arraignment.  </P> <P> "I can't say I have faith in any system to find me innocent, but I believe my  innocence will shine through," she added.  </P> <P> Casolo, a 28-year-old church worker from Thomaston, Conn., was arrested with  two Salvadorans staying at her home when it was raided by the National Police  the night of Nov. 25.  </P> <P> The police said they dug up more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades and  explosives from her back patio during the raid, which came amid an urban  guerrilla offensive by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.  </P> <P> "They say they found arms in my house," Casolo said. "We don't know where they  came from. They showed me the arms, but I don't know if they really found them  in my house."  </P> <P> Guillermo Romero Hernandez, a slight, elderly judge in a rumpled brown suit,  read the charges during a four-hour, 50-minute closed hearing in his small,  concrete-block office in San Salvador's tribunal complex.  </P> <P> Casolo sat facing him across a desk. Her Salvadoran lawyer, Salvador Ibarra,  stood behind her.  </P> <P> A U.S. Embassy consular officer and three American church officials who  traveled here last week to visit her waited in the judge's outer chambers.  </P> <P> During a long interrogation, she gave her own recollection of the night of her  arrest but declined to answer many of the judge's questions on the grounds that  she had not been allowed to consult her attorney in advance.  </P> <P> The judge has 72 hours to decide whether the charges merit a trial.  </P> <P> Casolo had worked here for five years for Christian Education Seminars, a  Texas-based ecumenical religious group that organized visits for U.S. Congress  members, church workers and other prominent Americans to El Salvador.  </P> <P> Because her tours offered interviews across the political spectrum, fellow  religious workers said they suspected that Casolo was framed in an effort to  discredit all church people and foreigners critical of the U.S.-backed  right-wing government.  </P> <P> Casolo arrived at the courtroom without handcuffs, seated between two female  prisoners in the police truck. One was Guadalupe Lopez, a Roman Catholic church  activist arrested with her.  </P> <P> In front of them was a larger army truck with a score of manacled male  prisoners, including Jose Federico Vasquez, the other person seized in her  house.  </P> <P> A hefty policewoman with a G-3 rifle and her face covered with a black bandanna  led Casolo, who is barely 5 feet tall, by the elbow into the judge's chambers.  </P> <P> Casolo had been held until the hearing in a cell at National Police  headquarters, with as many as five other women. Afterward she was transferred  to Ilopango Women's Prison, a place she had taken visiting delegations and  interviewed prisoners.  </P> <P> "I guess I'll be on the other side," she said, looking serene and clutching a  Bible as she left court.  </P> <P> To reporters, Casolo described long, difficult interrogations by her captors,  who forced her to sleep, shivering, on a cardboard slab on the concrete floor,  and to wear the same clothes five days in a row. She said that she and Lopez  eventually came to terms with their jailers by "speaking of God" with them at  every possible moment.  </P> <P> "It was really tough," she said. "I felt that the police were really trying to  get at the heart of me. But I discovered a strength around me. I just felt that  I could share love with those who had me captive. And I think they shared love  back with me. It was an absolutely life-changing experience.  </P> <P> "We weren't trying to convert them but just sharing the spirit of God," she  explained. "We said to them, 'Look, God is in you and God is in those who are  being interrogated.' "  </P> <P> The few people allowed to visit Casolo in jail so far have confirmed her  evangelical role there. They said she was in good spirits and has shared food  they brought for her with fellow inmates.  </P> <P> Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark, Casolo's American legal adviser, was  present Saturday when she baptized a male prisoner at the prisoner's request.  The day before, he watched her comforting a woman who appeared to have been  tortured.  </P> <P> "She is under great strain, but her primary concern is for others," Clark said.  "I was a bit overwhelmed by the character and quality of her clear insight into  what she's about and what her task is in Christian ministry."  </P> <P> Casolo's legal situation is far murkier.  </P> <P> Asked after the hearing where her case stood, she said: "I think there are a  lot of papers involved in this and that my person is the least."  </P> <P> El Salvador has been under a state of siege since a week before her arrest, and  new, tougher criminal legislation is in the works. The charges against her  normally carry a penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment, but the judge has said  the new laws might apply retroactively.  </P> <P> "There is confusion over what law will be applied," Ibarra said after  consulting a range of legal experts.  </P> <P> Clark, who arrived here last week at the behest of Casolo's family and church  organization, cannot legally represent her in court. He hired Ibarra to  accompany her at Tuesday's hearing and at later stages of the process, if she  accepts him.  </P> <P> Ibarra is a celebrated defense attorney in a legal system dominated by fear of  the armed forces. As attorney for the Lutheran Church's legal aid office, he  showed up at National Guard headquarters last month to ask about 12 Lutheran  missionaries seized in a raid on a church. He was arrested on the spot and held  nine days without charge.  </P> <P> In 1983, Ibarra was arrested and tortured after resigning his defense of a  national guardsman on trial for the 1980 murders of four American churchwomen.  He said he quit because guard officers were covering up evidence that the  killers acted on superior orders.  </P> <P> Casolo has shaped her own legal fate by refusing to accept the idea of a quick  hearing and expulsion from El Salvador. She has also told Clark that she is  reluctant to accept a Salvadoran lawyer out of fear that the case might  jeopardize his safety.  </P> <P> "As a lawyer, I would just say to Casolo, 'Let's go home, if we can,' Clark  said. "But she won't do that. She's very small but she does her own thinking.  It may sound funny, but she loves the people. She doesn't want to go home. Her  heart is here."  </P> <P> Paraphrasing the Bible, Casolo explained why she could never cut a deal to go  free and leave the country.  </P> <P> "I was reading this morning about when Paul the apostle was in jail and they  beat him. . . . He was praying and singing at night, which is what we did every  night, and so the jailkeeper let him come to his house. The next day the king  said, 'Let them go, I believe in their god.' And Paul said, 'You beat us and  you humiliated us and now you want to let us go quietly. No, let us go  publicly.' "  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy has taken a similar position in favor of a trial. Ambassador  William Walker is said to be reluctant to intervene to seek her release on the  ground that it would undermine his efforts to build faith in the judicial  system.  </P> <P> Casolo's defenders are angry that some U.S. officials have prejudged her in  public and private remarks indicating they believe she is guilty.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, however, Casolo said she believes she is being treated "better than  any other prisoner" because "the whole United States government is behind me."  </P> <P> Asked about her prospects for a fair trial, she said:  </P> <P> "What do you think? Talk to all the prisoners. Are any of us going to get a  fair trial? Where did they get the evidence against us? How did they get the  evidence against us?"  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / US Congress draft legislation faces logjam Powerful industry lobbies in the US, from banks to telephone companies, are anxiously waiting for Congress to return to Washington next week, in order to see which of a wide array of bills will make their way through the legislative mill before members go home again for the elections on November 8. A broad legislative agenda has been held up by the cumbersome wrangling over healthcare reform legislation, which in turn was slowed down, before Congress broke for a summer recess two weeks ago, by partisan bickering over the crime bill. The crime bill has now been passed, and aides in Congress are now assuming that healthcare reform, if passed at all, will be a more modest package of incremental measures than the monumental overhaul originally proposed by President Bill Clinton. But the health debate is still likely to take much of the time remaining to Congress, and it is still not clear which other bills will reach the calendar for final votes. Perhaps the closest to passage is the inter-state banking bill, which would allow banks for the first time to open branches freely outside their home states. Once inter-state branching had broken free of a long row over whether banks could sell insurance, it seemed to have a clear run. But the conference to reconcile the versions passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate has become embroiled in a battle of Texan egos, with Senator Phil Gramm objecting to a minor provision included by Congressman Henry Gonzalez. Telecommunications reform has further to go before passage. The House has passed a bill setting out the timetable and conditions for the Bell regional telephone companies to expand from local telephone service, to which they are now limited by a court anti-trust order, into long-distance, cable television and telephone equipment manufacturing. A similar bill has been drafted by the Senate commerce committee but has not reached the Senate floor. Rancorous battles are expected there over issues such as restrictions on the Bells' entry to the cable market. One potential deal-breaker is a requirement that, if the Bells enter manufacturing, they do so in the US and use mostly US-made components, a measure which, the administration has warned, would conflict with the US obligations under Gatt. Reform of the Superfund law on the clean-up of hazardous waste sites also faces several hurdles before passage. Everyone agrees that reform is needed, but much disagreement remains over whether the specific changes proposed, would be effective. which are intended to reduce the amount of litigation over who should pay for clean-ups, would make things better or worse. While the House Ways and Means committee reached a compromise last month over a crucial tax on insurers to pay for past clean-ups, the Senate finance committee has yet to tackle the issue. Also pending are bills to reform campaign finance laws, overhaul the 1872 law on mining in government lands in the West, and revisions to the Clean Water Act. In addition, ten of the 13 appropriations bills, which in theory must be completed before September 30 if the government departments they cover are not to lose their spending power, have still to be wrapped up.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR OK OF U.S. PEACE TALKS PLAN TOLD;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: ISRAELI TV SAYS ACCEPTANCE OF BAKER'S FORMULA ON PALESTINIAN  DELEGATION COULD KEEP LABOR IN COALITION.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has agreed to a compromise American formula for  selecting a Palestinian panel to preliminary peace talks, Israeli Television  reported Saturday night.  </P> <P> Acceptance by Shamir and his rightist Likud Party could revive the stalled  peace process and forestall a threat by the Labor Party, Likud's coalition  partner, to bolt the unity government.  </P> <P> "Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will give a positive response to the American  question on the composition of the Palestinian delegation, senior Likud and  Labor sources said this evening," the television report said.  </P> <P> The report was broadcast as Shamir and his loyal Cabinet ministers were  discussing the deadlock at the prime minister's home. There was no immediate  confirmation from the Likud leadership.  </P> <P> "They (Israeli Television) must know more than we do," declared Avi Pazner,  Shamir's spokesman. "I don't understand on what they base their report."  </P> <P> "We will see tomorrow (today)," when Shamir is scheduled to meet with Labor  Party leaders, Pazner said.  </P> <P> Israeli Army Radio, in a later broadcast, also said Shamir would propose  acceptance of the American formula, a move bitterly opposed by the right wing  of his party. The opponents, led by former Industry and Commerce Minister Ariel  Sharon, reject any peace talks with Palestinians. Sharon's supporters in the  Cabinet boycotted the Saturday night talks.  </P> <P> The television report said Shamir's acceptance would be conditional on a pledge  by the Labor Party to withdraw its threat to leave the coalition if the  stalemate on the peace talks were not broken. "We have to make our national  choice," Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said Friday, reasserting a Wednesday  deadline for a decision.  </P> <P> According to the report, the embattled prime minister agreed to accept a  delegation to preliminary peace talks of Palestinians registered as residents  of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under the formula proposed by  Secretary of State James A. Baker III, that wording could include Palestinians  who had been deported from the occupied territories and those who keep an  apartment or office in East Jerusalem in addition to their home in the  territories.  </P> <P> But according to the television report, Shamir is accepting only the general  wording "registered as residents," which may deflect some of the anticipated  opposition from the Likud right wing, Jewish settlers in the occupied  territories and other groups opposed to the peace process.  </P> <P> The Palestinian delegation would be selected at a proposed Washington meeting  of Baker, Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister  Esmat Abdel Meguid. The Egyptians would front for Yasser Arafat's Palestine  Liberation Organization, with which the Israelis refuse to deal directly.  Israel would retain the right to reject any Palestinian candidate, the  television report said.  </P> <P> Selection of the delegation would be the first step in a long process toward  achieving a peace plan put forward by Shamir last April. The delegation would  work out with the Israelis the procedures for a later election of Palestinian  representatives. Talks between that group and the Israelis would determine the  future status of the occupied territories.  </P> <P> There have been no official talks between Israelis and Palestinians for more  than 20 years, since Israel conquered the occupied territories in the 1967  Arab-Israeli War.  </P> <P> Today's meeting of the so-called Forum of Four -- Shamir and Arens for Likud  and Deputy Prime Minister Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin for Labor --  will set the stage for a full Cabinet meeting on the peace talks issue  Wednesday. If the American formula is accepted by the Cabinet, Baker is  expected to issue invitations for the Washington meeting, putting the peace  process back on the rails.  </P> <P> The PLO has insisted, among other things, that the Palestinian delegation  include representatives from East Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel after  the 1967 war. That issue has become the most explosive on the tortuous path to  the talks. Israeli rightists insist that including East Jerusalem Palestinians  in the delegation would raise questions about the legitimacy of the annexation.  </P> <P> Another longstanding PLO demand calls for the establishment of a Palestinian  state in the occupied territories, opposed by politicians in both Likud and  Labor.  </P> <P> The television report made no mention of the agenda of the proposed Washington  talks, beyond selection of the Palestinian delegation. The PLO has called for  an open-ended discussion of all issues once the Palestinian representatives are  chosen and sit down with their Israeli counterparts in what would be the first  meeting of the opposing sides on the confrontation that has racked the Middle  East for decades.  </P> <P> President Bush, asked about the report from Israel, said, "We have been working  on this for eight months."  </P> <P> Speaking at a news conference in California after his summit meeting with  Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Bush said he had no details, but "I hope  it's true and I hope we can move forward."  </P> <P> Asked whether progress had actually been made, he said, "Well, there has over  the months. But just like the real world, you take two steps forward and take  one step back. I hope we're going to go forward now."  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Gerstenzang, in Palm Springs, contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

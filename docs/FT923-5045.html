			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Names offered risk-spread plan ONE OF the largest agencies at Lloyd's of London is to introduce a scheme allowing Names, the individuals whose assets support underwriting at the insurance market, to spread their underwriting risks more widely. The scheme, which is being introduced by Sedgwick Lloyd's Underwriting Agents, is similar to the members' agency pooling arrangements or MAPAs, the introduction of which was recommended by the Rowland task force earlier this year. Like an MAPA, the Sedgwick Standard Programme will allow Names to support a larger number of syndicates, reducing their exposure to syndicates that perform particularly badly. Mr Julian Crispin, the chairman of the agency, said the Sedgwick scheme, which fits within the current regulatory framework at Lloyd's, 'should help Names avoid peaks and troughs in their underwriting'. It was particularly suitable for Names wanting to take a 'defensive attitude to their underwriting'. Demand from Names for a way to spread risks has increased after recent losses have been concentrated among a small minority of Names, for example in the catastrophe reinsurance market. The authorities at Lloyd's have agreed to introduce MAPAs but are still discussing the fiscal and regulatory implications with regulators. Mr Crispin said it could take between two and three years to introduce MAPAs  -the Rowland task force recommended that they be in place for the 1993 underwriting year. Mr Crispin said as many as 600 Names whose affairs the agency currently managed had expressed interest, and 200 Names had already agreed to underwrite through the scheme in 1993. On average Names underwriting at Lloyd's through conventional methods would participate on between 10 and 15 syndicates. Those participating through the programme will have a share in the 41 syndicates with which Sedgwick places most of its business. Each unit of the Sedgwick Standard Programme will comprise 41 syndicates with a total capacity of Pounds 50,000. most Names would normally subscribe for more than one unit. Other agencies could make similar initiatives as the market seeks to persuade the 22,300 Names underwriting in 1992 to continue their membership of Lloyd's. Lloyd's said last week that 686 Names had resigned so far this year. The number of open years at Lloyd's has nearly doubled in the last 12 months.</p>

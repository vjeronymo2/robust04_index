			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zheng Yu (6774 3842): "Abulaiti Abudurexiti </F> Stresses Strengthening the Construction of Infrastructures and  Basic Industries"]    [Text] "To enhance the staying power of Xinjiang's economic  development and to promote rapid and efficient economic growth,  it is necessary to strengthen the construction of  infrastructures and basic industries." This is what Abulaiti  Abudurexiti, chairman of the Xinjiang autonomous regional  government, pointed out at a regional work meeting on  construction on 31 March.    After reviewing Xinjiang's capital construction last year,  Abulaiti Abudurexiti pointed out: This year, while undertaking  investment restructuring measures, our region will further  expand key constructions and increase investment in a large  group of key construction projects such as the second Lanxin  railway line; the Xian-Lanzhou-Urumqi optical cable; the  Duzishan ethylene project; the Urumqi airport expansion project;  and the Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan high-quality road. At a stage  when we have achieved overall progress and key breakthroughs in  reform, the construction front must also actively implement  reform measures in capital construction management systems as  well as bring into full play the role of market mechanisms. For  new construction projects, we must fully implement open-bidding  and owners' responsibility systems. It is necessary to  establish and improve the evaluation report system for  construction projects as well as to strengthen the management of  project contracting. The construction industry must actively  explore the international construction market. Not only should  the industry open up the markets of surrounding countries and  Central Asia but also those of the East Asia, Southeast Asia,  and other countries and regions. It is necessary to win more  contracts for foreign construction projects and labor  cooperation to spur exports of building materials and mechanical  equipment.    Speaking on the specific issue of urban construction,  Abulaiti Abudurexiti stressed: Currently, the primary task is  to strengthen urban planning management. The wider we open up  and the more vigorously we develop the economy, the tighter  control on urban planning management should be exercised in  accordance with the law. On the other hand, in urban planning  management, we should strive to streamline our work and raise  efficiency by reducing unnecessary jobs. Economic development  zones, cooperation zones, and various ports must effectively  tackle infrastructure construction. We should not place hopes on  foreign investors to develop the region for us but rather should  create conditions to attract their investment.</p>

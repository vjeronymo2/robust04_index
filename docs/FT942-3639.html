			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Mortgage arrears 'down 25%' The number of households in arrears with their mortgages has fallen by almost a quarter in the past year, says a report published today. The annual survey, by Roof Briefing, a newsletter published by the housing magazine Roof, is the most extensive and up-to-date survey of mortgage debt. It shows that the number of households with mortgage arrears of two months or more fell to 613,300 in the year to March 31 from 800,150. One in 17 householders is behind with mortgage payments compared with one in 13 a year ago. The survey includes for the first time a breakdown of the figures on arrears and repossessions by type of lender. Banks, insurers and building societies all have similar levels of arrears, at about 5 per cent of loans. But the centralised lenders that entered the market in the 1980s have average arrears levels of more than 15 per cent. There is a similar picture for repossessions, with centralised lenders repossessing almost 2.5 per cent of their homes last year, five times the average level of the other lenders. These averages conceal wide variations between individual lenders. The level of arrears for building societies ranges from 2.8 per cent of loans to 12.6 per cent. One centralised lender has arrears on more than 22 per cent of loans. The biggest fall is in short-term arrears, indicating that fewer homeowners are getting into difficulties with their mortgages. The number of households two months behind with payments has fallen 32 per cent from 198,000 to 135,840. The author, Ms Janet Ford of Loughborough University, says repossessions probably account for most of the 15 per cent reduction in arrears of more than 12 months, as well as a proportion of the fall in arrears between six and 12 months. Most lenders start repossession proceedings when arrears reach six months, with the process usually completed six months later. The big fall in short-term arrears suggests, however, that fewer borrowers are getting into debt. Ms Ford says one reason for this is the greater care lenders are taking to ensure that borrowers can afford their loans. Another is the 'marked improvement in many lenders' management and control of early arrears'. She says homes are more affordable, with low interest rates and lower house prices.  ------------------------------------------------------           SHORT-TERM LATE PAYERS FALL SHARPLY  ------------------------------------------------------ Period in arrears           Mar 31 '94    Mar 31 '93  ------------------------------------------------------ 2 months                      135,840       198,000 3-5 months                    191,590       242,050 6-12 months                   152,060       203,360 Over 12 months                133,810       156,740 Total arrears                 613,300       800,150 Number of mortgages        10,137,000     9,920,000 Repossessions                  48,660        60,500  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

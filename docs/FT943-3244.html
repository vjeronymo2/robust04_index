			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / DSS considers issuing 'smart cards' to claimants The Department of Social Security is considering the introduction of a 'smart card' rather than a less sophisticated 'swipe card' in its pilot scheme next year for identifying social security claimants. A smart card contains a microchip capable of storing a range of data, which could include criminal records and previous social security claims abuse. The DSS had been thought to favour a simpler swipe card with a magnetic stripe or watermark which, linked to a pin number, proves identity but little else. The department now appears to have suspended talks with Thorn Secure Systems, part of Thorn-EMI, on the introduction of such cards. A number of government ministers have dismissed the idea of a compulsory national identity card. The concept is unpopular in Britain, although ID cards are widely used throughout Europe. However ministers have not ruled out some form of card for social security claimants at the 22,000 post offices and benefit offices throughout Britain. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has declined to rule out the introduction of smart cards for claimants. A smart card could also carry driving licence data. Under current plans a new driving licence bearing the holder's photograph is to be introduced in 1996. The prime minister, said in a speech last week: 'Anything that could check crime and cut fraud must be worth a look.' The social security budget is put at Pounds 80bn. The cost of fraud is officially put at Pounds 5bn a year but could be as high as Pounds 10bn.</p>

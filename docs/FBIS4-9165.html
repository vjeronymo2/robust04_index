			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Karol Malcuzynski under the "Points of View" </F> rubric: "An Unavoidable Conflict"]    [Text] It is only a question of time before another  conflict breaks out between the coalition and the president.  And that is not because the coalition is left-wing but, rather,  because it is strong.    I do not agree with the atmosphere of relief and the sense  of  success associated with the agreement between the coalition and  the president, and with the alleged overcoming of the crisis.  The conflict will return, and its impact will be double what it  has been up to now, creating a danger for the principles of the  state's functioning.    The president gave us another portion of his political ideas  and intentions, which are quite disturbing. The contents of  this wave of conflicting ideas and incoherent statements are  harmful and insulting, given that they were voiced by the head  of state.    What did Lech Walesa offer us?    First, that he will adopt a constitution outside of  parliament (even though this is nonsense), that he will  personally dissolve parliament, and that he will undertake  measures that are outside the law. Lech Walesa has made a  decision that possible amendments to the Small Constitution  amount to attempts to bring down the political regime, and  everyone is supposed to hold his breath. Walesa wants to build  some mystical force that will destroy the current arrangement,  and he also thinks that people who say he destabilizes the state  should be brought to justice. In a normal country, such views  would mean the end of a political career. Public opinion would  completely destroy such a politician.    Well, I am going to take a chance and say this: Lech Walesa,  not just over the past several weeks but throughout the majority  of his term of office, has not only been destabilizing the state  but has also been trying to blow it up. Under the pretext of  maintaining some abstract kind of balance, he destructs every  arrangement that is not to his liking, while ignoring the  disastrous, long-term effects of his policies for Poland. He  incites and initiates conflicts among parties and different  groups that have managed to gain even the slightest balance. He  demoralizes part of society by coming up with unrealistic ideas  and promises, and he sets in motion some forces that he is not  capable of controlling later on.    All of this is done with just one purpose in mind: to gain  and maintain for himself the widest possible powers not subject  to anybody's control (the president makes the impression that  only he, perhaps with the aid of the Holiest Virgin, is capable  of ruling the country). It is only a question of time before a  very major conflict between the coalition and the president will  take place, and it is not because the coalition is left-wing.  Even if it were right-wing or centrist, the situation would be  the same. The reason the conflict will occur is because of the  strength of the coalition, which not only can implement its  policies without the president's permission and without his  ideas but is also a direct threat to Walesa because it may come  up with its own, strong candidate for the next president, and,  in this way, it can take away from Walesa what he has been  taking for granted up to now--that he will rule Poland for  another five years.    The coalition, by making threats to implement changes in the  Small Constitution, is trying to limit the president's powers  because, in reality, these powers paralyze the state's  functioning. It is not an attempt to change the political  system because the system itself has not been defined. In  reality, the Small Constitution is a compromise solution--some  say it is a rotten compromise, which the president imposed on  the previous weak parliament and weak government in order to  widen his powers. The Constitution is a provisional document  that regulates the system until a regular constitution is  adopted through the usual procedure. The Constitution is not a  dogma. One can make amendments through lawful procedures in  such a provisional document. Walesa himself thinks the Small  Constitution is imperfect, and he wants to amend it, but the  only direction of changes he wants is to widen his own powers  and, in effect, to establish a purely presidential system that  he would like. In that sense, we should be grateful to  President Walesa for having himself led to a loss of face by a  system he wants to introduce.    I also think President Walesa has been demonstrating some  very disturbing states of mind. He is convinced about his  mission and about not making any mistakes. It is not hard to  believe the latter because sometimes he pronounces completely  contradictory views or forecasts on a given day, and one of them  is bound to come true in the end.    Walesa sometimes comes through as a mixture of Nikodem Dyzma  and the gardener from Kosinski's novel Wystarczy Byc  [Being There]. Many people will be bitter over such a  statement, and for many reasons. He is such a terrible  disappointment to all of us. Many of us voted for the man.  "Historically speaking," Walesa deserved that. But was there  an alternative? Did the majority of Walesa's voters not think  that that they were choosing the lesser evil?    In his good times, Walesa was famous for his sayings. In one  of them, he compared people he was getting rid of to horses one  selects, depending on the task. He would say: "You are a race  horse and you are good, but right now we need draught horses,"  or "Right now we are crossing the great water, and we are  looking for horses that can swim well and not those that jump  over hedges and obstacles."    Lech Walesa used to be good and he used to win. But we have  a different type of race now. The style of executing the  presidency by Lech Walesa has exhausted itself, and he should  resign--whether at the end of the term or before is up to him.  By leaving on his own, he will spare us the view of a fall and  probably also of humiliation.</p>

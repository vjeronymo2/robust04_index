			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] [Excerpts] Startling new HIV statistics discovered  last month have prompted the director of the Phnom Penh Pasteur  Institute to call for a massive nationwide AIDS education  campaign.    The number of HIV positive cases diagnosed in Cambodia last  month nearly tripled the previous month with the victims tending  to be male and with an average age of 26.    Dr. Kruy Sunlay's Pasteur Institute found nearly 8 percent  of  patients seeking treatment for sexually transmitted diseases  (STD) at the institute in September tested positive for HIV,  while about 2 percent of blood donors at the National Blood  Transfusion Center have been testing positive every month since  January of this year -- 85 percent of donors are males aged 18  to 40.    In total, 132 Cambodians were tested positive for HIV in  September -- more than one a day. In the eight months from  January until the end of August, a total of 82 people were found  to be HIV positive. To date more than 200 people have tested  HIV positive in Cambodia, but Health Ministry officials say WHO  estimates put the real figure at between 1,000 to 2,000.    "I think this is the second killing fields in Cambodia, but  it will be in another ten years," Dr. Kruy said grimly referring  to the time it would take victims to develop full blown AIDS.    "The problem now is we have no funds for HIV testing," she  added.    Last months' victims ranged in age from 18 to 32. The 20 STD  patients included two women -- 18 and 20 years old, while most  of the men were in their twenties.    "I think the Ministry of Health realizes how big the problem  is, but they don't have any funds," Dr. Kruy said.    "The important problem is not only diagnosis in the  laboratory but health education on TV, radio, and in newspapers."    "There's not enough information given to the population,  they  need more," she said.    "I hope the new government will do something about this  problem. I think it's outside my responsibility, but I know  they have no funds."    Dr. Kruy called for an AIDS education program to be  introduced into high schools and universities around the country.    "After peace has come, I heard the object of the government  is developing the country, the economics sector, but the most  important thing is that the country has good health. For  example, with AIDS we might have in ten years we wouldn't be  able to develop the country."    Mr. Lars Meyner, head of the national blood transfusion  program of the International Committee of the Red Cross echoed  Dr. Kruy's call for more education and claimed popular ignorance  could see Cambodia slide into a situation like Thailand where  AIDS is reaching epidemic proportions.    "Many young men here as we know have the first sexual  experience with a commercial sex worker and because of this it  is a big risk as serious or probably even more serious than in  Thailand," Mr. Meyner said.    "In Thailand the prostitutes are using condoms, here they  don't have that awareness. If you asked the majority of the  male population in Thailand they know what a condom is, here  they don't."    With HIV on the increase Mr. Meyner is concerned about the  possibility of infected blood being used in transfusions.    "Of course our first objective here is to give safe blood to  the patients, with a high number of HIV positives we can never  guarantee HIV free blood -- there is a window period of two to  three months from when a patient contracts the disease to when  it shows up in the antibody blood test."    Mr. Meyner added that HIV would easily spread in this  country  through needle sharing -- a practice of many small provincial  hospitals and pharmacies.    "If you go to the local pharmacy at the market and he gives  you an injection he uses the same needle for very many people  and that's one way it's spreading here," he said.    "I think maybe there is still no real understanding among  the  general population of exactly what AIDS is and what the  consequences are if you get AIDS, it seems like the message has  not gone out."    The first HIV positive case was diagnosed in Cambodia in  June  1991, such tests were not previously available here so it's  impossible to tell when the first Cambodian contracted the  disease. Several patients are already showing signs of AIDS  related complaints.    [passage omitted] She adds that the lack of visible symptoms  in HIV positive patients contributes to the population's  ignorance and refusal to acknowledge HIV is a problem in  Cambodia.    Most of Cambodia's victims are young men and many of them  married, but few wives continue to stay with their husbands  after hearing they are HIV positive. Most of Cambodia's HIV  cases are believed to have been transmitted through heterosexual  sex.    It seems culturally acceptable for Cambodian men to visit  brothels and locals estimate up to 95 percent of Cambodian males  would visit a prostitute at least once in their life time.    Dr. Kruy is not alone in her fear of an AIDS epidemic  gripping Cambodia. The World Health Organization and several  foreign non-government organizations have recognized the problem  and started to take steps to combat it.    Although more than 100 Cambodian HIV victims had been  identified in 1991 and 1992, none of them were informed of their  status as no counseling service was available, until February of  this year. The decision not to inform victims before this time  was made jointly by WHO and the then Phnom Penh government.    But earlier this year ten Cambodians were trained to do  pre-test and post- test counseling and HIV victims began to be  informed of their disease.    "There are only a few cases in the provinces. If we can stop  the spread in Phnom Penh, we won't have a problem like  Thailand," Dr. Kruy said.    Dr. Mam Bun Heng, chairman of the National AIDS Committee,  said the new government had put AIDS control on the high  priority list, but funds and real commitment from the community  were lacking.    "We are trying now to get more money. We have produced a  five-year comprehensive plan, but we need money -- $7.5  million," he said.    "And we need a commitment from all sectors, education,  administration, religion, and the economic sector... not only to  talk but to develop the program."    He said the first plan of the program was to educate high  risk groups like prostitutes and STD victims.    "The problem is information and education and how to spread  it to the public," Dr. Mam Bun Heng said.</p>

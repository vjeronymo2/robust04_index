Each region in southern Italy will have its  science park and Campania will have two. Another two science  parks will be established in the Lazio and Marche regions. In  the coming months, work will begin on the construction of a  total of 10 new parks that will join the two already in  existence at Tecnopolis in Bari, and at Val Basento in  Basilicata. The map of research centers in the central southern  regions has been drawn up by the Ministry of Scientific  Research, which has been assigned the task of enacting the  interministerial agreement signed with the Ministry for Southern  Italy and the Budget in 1990. Under the agreement 1.1 trillion  lire will be spent on scientific parks in southern Italy.    The commission of experts at the ministry has chosen 10 of  the 31 proposed projects for science parks that were presented  in July 1992 plus two proposals that concern the development of  initiatives already in existence. A plan per region, not only  for those that are late developers, which come under the first  goal, but also for areas of industrial decline such as Lazio and  Marche, which come under the second goal.    "The decision to give each region its own structure may be a  valid one," says Gianfranco Dioguardi, president of the science  park Tecnopolis Novus Ortus in Puglia, "but I think it is  necessary to have a sort of regulating plan. In short, when  faced with the formation of so many parks, it is necessary to  single out complementary areas of activity and create forms of  coordination. It would be a serious error if, instead of making  use of synergies, competition was to arise between the science  poles." He added: "The job of coordinating scientific and  research activities could be entrusted to one of the parks. We  will have young structures and other more consolidated  structures that could be the driving force."    Meanwhile the ministry has invited the bodies whose proposed  projects have been selected to partly revise their plans, to  correct them on the basis of precise guidelines, and to return  them in the form of outline projects by 31 December. The rules  to be followed were clear: To direct efforts toward applied  research or toward the transfer of technologies to small and  medium-sized companies and to establish close links with local  businesses. And the restrictions were just as categoric: There  will be no funding for basic research or for the purchase of  machinery since other laws already provide incentives for this,  or for the construction of megastructures. "We want to avoid  funding more concrete," explains Giuseppe D'Addona, general  manager of the science and technology department at the  ministry, "instead we need to create links between the research  structures that are already in existence and intensify  relationships with companies."    The bodies whose proposals were selected have already  delivered the outline projects, which have been revised and  corrected as requested, to the ministry for its approval. In  other words, the ministry will allocate the funding to carry out  the plans. The ministry has undertaken to start the program  during the first three months of this year. This means that  after a long wait, the coming months will probably be decisive  for the go-ahead to the parks.    APSTI (Association of Italian Science and Technology Parks)  Secretary General Bruno Bottiglieri has said: "It is the  ministry's turn. We have waited a long time, now is the moment  to make up for lost time. But to tell the truth, the commission  of experts that was set up by minister Colombo is finally  working well and fast."    Meanwhile however, financial resources have become thinner.  Of the 1.1 trillion lire that were initially planned for, only  600 billion lire remain, the amount that should have been  appropriated by the Ministry of Scientific Research under the  1990 interministerial agreement, while funding for southern  Italy has fallen through. In fact, the Ministry of Scientific  Research has also had to work to identify the sources from which  to draw the necessary resources: The first 300 billion will be  salvaged from the fund for applied research under Articles 10  and 3 of Law 46/1982, articles that have not been exploited to  date. The first norm provides for the realization of research  contracts based on projects submitted by companies, public  bodies, and the public administration that will be stipulated by  the IMI (Italian Institute for Financing Real and Personal  Property). The other norm, Article 3, entrusts the Ministry of  Scientific Research with the preparation of programs for the  transfer of know-how and technologies to small and medium-sized  industries.    In recent years there has been a growing interest in science  parks all over Italy. Technology poles in all the other regions  have been added to the science towns, Tecnopolis and the  Lingotto, that have now become part of history. Today APSTI has  17 members (see table), many of which have been established  during the last three years and some of which are not yet  operational. "If the agreement between the three ministries has  been a driving force for the South," added Bottiglieri, "in the  North the knowledge of the fact that parks are an efficient  instrument for creating innovation, and perhaps the only really  valid one, has undoubtedly become more diffused over recent  years."       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |All The Science Parks                                                      |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Park              |Location          |Year Established  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Area Science Park |Trieste           |1982              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Tecnopolis        |Bari              |1984              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Lingotto Pole     |Turin             |1984              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Science Park RAI  |Milan 2           |1992              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Milano-Bicocca Po-|Milan             |1986              |  |                  |le                |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Emilia Romagna Pa-|Bologna           |1990              |  |                  |rk                |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Genoa Park        |West of Genoa     |1989              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Umbria Food, Agri-|Todi (Perugia)    |1989              |  |                  |culture Park      |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Sardinia Park     |Cagliari, Alghero,|1991              |  |                  |                  | Nuoro, Oristano  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Piacenza Pole     |East Piacenza     |1990              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Naples Metropolit-|Naples            |1992              |  |                  |an Area Park      |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Parma Park, Innov-|Parma             |1991              |  |                  |ation Center      |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Agripolis Park    |Legnaro (Padua)   |1984              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Pro.ge.Tec.       |Naples            |1992              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Multipolar Park,  |Padua, Venice, Ve-|1992              |  |                  |Venice Region     |rona              |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |SPI               |Rome              |1984              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Calabria Park     |Cosenza, Crotone, |1993              |  |                  |                  |Reggio Calabria,  |                  |  |                  |                  |Catanzaro, Vibo V-|                  |  |                  |                  |alentia           |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Source: APSTI)                                                            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

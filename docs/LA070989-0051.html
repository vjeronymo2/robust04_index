			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / PAUL R. KRUGMAN: THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR MUST FALL  </P> <P> As of late last week, the dollar was trading for about 140 Japanese yen. This  was at least 20 yen too high, and anyone buying dollar-denominated assets at  that price was making a big mistake.  </P> <P> The basic point is very simple: There is no sensible long-term forecast for the  dollar that can justify its current value. That means that everyone who is  willing to buy or hold dollars is either failing to take a long view or betting  that he can get out before the dollar comes down too far. At some point, the  bubble on which the dollar is floating will come into obvious conflict with  reality, and everyone will try to get out at once -- and the result will be a  dollar crash.  </P> <P> To understand this argument, it is important to realize that anyone who decides  to put his money into one or another currency is implicitly making a forecast  about the future exchange rate. For example, suppose that the one-year interest  rate in Japan is 5%, while in the United States it is 8%. Then anyone who has  the choice of putting money into either country, and who chooses to put it in  the United States, is in effect betting that the dollar will not decline by  more than 3 percentage points over the next year. (Similarly, putting money in  Japan is in effect a bet that the dollar will decline more than 3 percentage  points).  </P> <P> What forecasts are the markets implicitly making now? Never mind the short-term  forecasts: Nobody knows what may happen over the course of three months, or  even a year. But over a decade, economic constraints begin to apply. It becomes  necessary that the forecast made by the market imply feasible paths for the  balance of payments, foreign debt and so on. So let's look at fairly long-term  bonds -- specifically, government bonds due in mid-1998. Looking at the  financial page, we discover that in Japan such bonds yield about 5%, while in  the United States they yield about 8%. That is, the market is implicitly  forecasting that over the next nine years the dollar will decline against the  yen no more than roughly 8% minus 5%, or 3% per year.  </P> <P> Is this possible? No, for at least three reasons.  </P> <P> The United States has higher inflation than does Japan, so it has to have a  steadily falling dollar just to keep the real exchange rate constant. The  United States would need a substantially lower dollar even now just to  stabilize its growing foreign debt, and the steady erosion of what is left of  U.S. technological superiority requires a dollar that declines over time to  compensate.  </P> <P> On the inflation issue, the underlying inflation rate in the United States is  about 5%, while in Japan it is more like 1%. This alone means that if the  dollar were to decline as slowly as the market apparently expects, the United  States would become steadily less competitive on costs and prices as time went  by.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, almost all estimates suggest that the dollar needs to fall  substantially if the United States is not to have an explosive growth of  foreign debt. Major international agencies such as the International Monetary  Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were  forecasting widening U.S. deficits after next year even before the recent  run-up in the value of the dollar.  </P> <P> A recent study by William Cline at the Institute of International Economics,  using middle-of-the-road numbers, estimated that simply to slow the rate of  growth of U.S. foreign debt to a sustainable rate -- not to stop its growth,  which would be much harder -- the yen would have to rise 28% from its late-1987  level in real terms, implying a dollar-yen rate in current prices of not much  more than 100. The longer that decline is delayed, the more the dollar must  drop, because of the growing burden of foreign debt. So the prospect is that  sooner or later the dollar must fall very sharply in real terms. Yet the  financial markets seem to believe that it actually can rise.  </P> <P> Finally, when looking at the dollar-yen rate it is impossible to avoid the  broader issues of competitiveness. Who can look at recent experiences without  being amazed and somewhat depressed by the ability of Japanese firms to hold  onto their market share and by the timidity and conservatism of U.S. firms  despite an unprecedentedly weak dollar? In 1980, we thought that U.S. firms  could be competitive with an exchange rate that, at 1989 prices, would have  been about 190 yen. In 1989, the Japanese obviously felt quite comfortable at  130 yen. What do you think the competitive rate will be in 1998?  </P> <P> Not everyone agrees with this diagnosis, of course. Let me mention two excuses  commonly made for the strength of the dollar and explain why they won't wash.  </P> <P> The first excuse is that of purchasing power parity. Look how cheap everything  is in America compared to Japan, say the advocates of this view; surely this  must mean that the dollar is undervalued against the yen and must rise.  </P> <P> The problem is that in order to pay its way in the world, a country must pay  its way on world markets, not impress visiting business people with what a  bargain it is. That is, the sign of an undervalued dollar would be a convincing  demonstration that firms considered the United States a highly attractive place  to produce for world markets, not just to visit. And the plain fact is that  this is not happening on a large scale. The export boom of 1987-88 has slowed,  and if there is a rush to export new products from the United States, it is  happening very quietly.  </P> <P> The other excuse offered for the strong dollar is that its position as a key  currency somehow means that the usual rules do not apply to the United States.  The cheap answer is that the dollar's special role may not last long: The yen  and especially the European Currency Unit (ECU) are rapidly coming to play  comparable roles. But in any case, the point is nonsense. If a Saudi  businessman prefers to have a London bank account whose value is indexed to the  dollar rather than the pound, this does not add to U.S. purchasing power in any  significant way -- and yet that is all that the special role of the dollar  really amounts to.  </P> <P> There are other excuses -- blame it all on the Recruit Co. scandal, or the  power of the Greens, or Tiananmen Square. All of them fail under scrutiny. The  simple fact is that the current level of the dollar is the result of a market  that has lost its anchor in reality, in which nobody takes a view more than a  few months ahead.  </P> <P> None of this says that the dollar must crash tomorrow, or even this year. But  crash it must, sooner or later. My own image of the exchange market is that of  one of those cartoon characters who steps off the edge of a cliff and manages  to walk on air for five or six steps before noticing that there is no ground  underneath; it's only when he realizes that he is suspended in mid-air that he  plummets. It's the same with the exchange rate: One of these days the market  will notice that there is nothing real supporting the dollar, and down it will  fall.  </P></p>

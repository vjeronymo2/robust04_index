			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Activity slows in run-up to May Day break BOURSES weremostly easier yesterday as activity slowed before the May Day holiday. Paris rose, but trading was thin, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS achieved a 1.3 per cent rise, but turnover was light, easing from Friday's FFr2bn to about FFr1.3bn - with much of that accounted for by futures and options-related trading before the expiry of contracts today. One dealer said that investors seemed to be running out of solid reasons to buy. The CAC 40 index rose 22.68 to 1,797.35, ending below its day's high of 1,801.62. Michelin picked up anotherFFr2.80 to FFr94.40, with 653,300 shares changing hands; the stock continued tobenefit from Friday's brokers' comments. Elsewhere in the motor sector, Peugeotgained FFr12 to FFr571 on 138,550 shares. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez addedFFr10 to FFr578. The group has said it will increase its stake in Alfred McAlpine, the UK construction company, to 12 per cent from 6 per cent. Axa Midigained FFr23 to FFr1,076. The insurer, which announced a rise in net profits inline with expectations on Friday, is one of the few blue chips still looking fairly cheap, said a dealer. FRANKFURT ended lower after early buying failed to attract follow-through orders. Institutional activity was minimal and dealers expected trading to remain quiet this week. Early on, the DAX index hit a day and year's high of 1,638.20, before closing 3.53 lower at 1,620.28, the day's low. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 4.32 to 690.28, a 1991 high. Volume fell to DM5.9bn from DM6.8bn. Dealers were comforted that the recent strength in the German market had not triggered widespread profit-taking, and were cautiously optimistic that the DAX could break through 1,640 in the next month. They noted that London brokers were increasing their weightings for the German market, which had lagged behind other European bourses, and that corporate results were coming in at the higher end of expectations. Remarks by a German finance ministry official that rates could fall later this year lifted the banking sector. Deutsche ended DM2.50 up at DM649.50, Dresdner roseDM4 to DM374 and Commerzbank put on DM3.80 to DM262.50. Among second-liners, Henkel preference shares rose DM6 to DM591 against the market, although dealers could not pinpoint reasons for the rise. MILAN fell as political andeconomic concerns kept investors away. Volume remained thin, estimated at around Friday's L111bn, after last Thursday's Liberation Day holiday and before this Wednesday's May Day break. The MIB general index fell 16 or 1.4 per cent to 1,120; the Comit index was not available. Among the industrials, Fiat fell L60 to L5,185. Shares linked to the Mondadori group bucked the trend on hopes of an early end to the battle for the publisher. L'Espresso jumped to L21,000from L19,600. Cir, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, eased L45 to L2,550at the official close but rebounded to L2,620 after hours. Olivetti, which plunged last week on its 1990 results, fell L85 to L3,620 but then recovered to L3,700. STOCKHOLM fell for the fourth day. The Affarsvarlden General index dropped 9.3 to 1,051.9 in meagre volume of SKr187m, down from SKr222m. The bourse will close from midday today until Thursday. Ericsson accounted for SKr32m of the turnover, as its free Bs fell SKr3 to SKr195. OSLO was lifted byFriday's cut in the Central Bank's key interest rate. The all-share index rose 5.20 to 481.56 in low turnover of NKr214m. MADRID recouped part of its early loss, but turnover was thin at about Pta10bn after Friday's Pta11.8bn. The general index closed 0.36 down at 276.47, after finishing pit trading at 275.76. Iberduero, which said that it would raise its 1990 dividend by 9.3 per cent, rose Pta5 to Pta709. ZURICH marked time, with the Credit Suisse index down 0.3 at 550.8. Chemicals were mostly higher: Sandoz registered shares rose SFr50 to SFr11,550, but its bearers fell SFr50 to SFr11,800. The group forecast a good year in spite of lower first quarter sales. AMSTERDAM rose initially on the stronger dollar but closed mixed before the national holiday today. The CBS tendency index ended 0.1 down at 95.5. ATHENS fell 3 per cent, the generalindex losing 35.62 to 1,153.37.</p>

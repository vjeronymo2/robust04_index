The Sacramento County coroner's office identified the last of seven  corpses as that of Betty Mae Palmer, 80, who apparently went to Sacramento from  the Redding area in 1986. Officers said that they did not know when when was  last seen alive but that she moved into the Victorian house sometime in 1986.  Coroner's spokesman Bob Bowers said the body was identified through comparisons  of medical X-rays. Puente has been charged with murdering another tenant,  Alvaro (Bert) Montoya.  </P></p>

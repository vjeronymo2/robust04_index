			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Selective rendition" of Moscow Committee on Environmental </F> Protection and Natural Resources report, by Ye. Subbotina:  "Moskompriroda Is Watching Attentively"]    [Text] Moskompriroda [Moscow Committee on  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources] specialists have  prepared a review of the environmental protection activities of  enterprises and other facilities. The review was compiled from  the results of state oversight activities in 1993. MOSKOVSKAYA  PRAVDA found it expedient to publish a selective rendition of  this work. Of course, many facts registered by Moskompriroda are  alarming and a cause for health concerns. All of us would rather  see a smog-free capital city; the reality today, however, is  that Moscow is an industrial giant saturated to capacity with  industrial and automotive transportation enterprises, warehouse  zones, and transportation arteries. There are 62 large  industrial zones on city territory inside the beltway.  Automobiles are the main contributors to environmental  pollution. The number of cars in Moscow is growing annually;  200,000 cars were added in 1993. As of 1 January last year there  were more than 1 million cars in the city. The increasing number  of cars is a direct route to increased discharge of harmful  substances into the atmosphere.    The finding of Moskompriroda specialists is that  environmental pollution in Moscow remains high.  <H5>  What We Breath </H5>   In 1993 the Moscow State Inspection for Protection of the  Atmosphere conducted 1,120 checks at industrial and automotive  transportation enterprises in the city. It uncovered 10,166  violations. Industry and power generation discharged 230,718  tonnes of pollutants. Of this discharge, 90 percent comprise  solid substances and nitrogen, carbons, and hydrocarbon oxides.  Analysis of the state of atmospheric air shows that the higher  than average level of pollution is created by discharges of  nitrogen, ammonia, benzene, phenol, and hydrocarbon dioxides.    Motor vehicles are serious air polluters. Moskompriroda  conducted inspections of automotive transportation enterprises;  twice--in May and September--it conducted Operation Clean Air.  It inspected 520 enterprises, including the AMO ZIL [Imeni  Lenina Auto Works] and AZLK plant [Imeni Leninskogo Komsomola  Auto Works]. It registered 856 violations. Thousands of cars  were checked by instruments, and one out of five did not meet  standards.    More than 71,000 cars were checked for exhaust toxicity in  the course of Operation Clean Air. The number of cars that did  not meet state standards amounted to 14.7 percent. This is  unquestionably a large number, although we can console ourselves  with the fact that in 1992 the same indicator measured 17.7  percent. To a large extent the reduction has been achieved as a  result of automotive enterprises beginning to actively equip  themselves with gas analysis apparatus.    The total discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere in  1993  (industry and automotive transport) amounted to more than 1  million tonnes.    A special issue are foundries within city limits. On 1  February 1990, a decision was adopted on 56 priority steps aimed  at reducing the discharge of hazardous substances from foundries  at the city's 53 enterprises. As of 1 January of this year, 53  points of the program have been implemented; it includes  reconstruction and liquidation of foundries, construction of gas  scrubbers, and reduction of the production volume by reducing  deliveries to other regions. Two points have not been  implemented: the metal household goods plant No. 6 has not been  shut down (Southwestern district) and the foundry of the  Stekloagregat plant (Southern district) has not undergone  reconstruction. By now foundry discharges into the atmosphere  have been cut by 9,924 tonnes, which is 83 percent of that  envisaged in the full program.  <H5>  The Water We Drink </H5>   In 1993 the Moscow City Inspection for the Protection of  Water Resources conducted 1,029 checks at 947 facilities. Among  them are 456 industrial and automotive transportation  enterprises, Mosvodokanal, and Mosvodostok.    It was established that the city's aeration stations, which  dump insufficiently purified waste into the Moscow River, and  dumping from construction sites and residential areas remain the  main sources of pollution of Moscow reservoirs. Moskompriroda  inspectors uncovered 396 violations of water protection  legislation. The violators were fined a total of 18,935 million  rubles [R].    The inspectors found that of 252 operating industrial waste  purification systems, almost half (!) were ineffective or out of  order. In 1992, 60 percent of systems were noted as out of  order. Overall, the situation remains unsatisfactory.    It is good to see that 84 of the total number of inspected  enterprises have 149 circulating water cycle system functioning,  and 19 enterprises have 24 systems using recycled water.    Among the violators of water protection legislation were the  NPO [scientific-industrial association] Kauchuk, the First Watch  Factory, the AP [joint-stock enterprise[ Meridian, the oil and  lubricant plant, the Dynamo plant, the Danilovo cab  manufacturing plant, and others.    Overall there has been a reduction in the discharge of  metals, petroleum products, and suspended particles, which is a  result of cutbacks in production as well as of  water-purification systems being installed at industrial  facilities.    Analysis of aeration stations' operations for past year  leads  to the following conclusions: The Kuryanov, Lyubertsy, and  Zelenograd stations and the Lyublino shop for comprehensive  water purification dump liquid waste that does not meet standard  requirements, which pollutes rivers. The reasons for  unsatisfactory operations of the stations is delay in bringing  on line reserve capacities and overload of currently operating  capacities.    A serious strain on the environment comes from Galvanic  production, which essentially dumps heavy metal salts. The  Government of Moscow's program, which envisages liquidation and  reconstruction of galvanic production, is being implemented too  slowly.    More dirt is brought by snow, which is dumped into the  Moscow  River--snow carries into the water petroleum products,  chlorides, and suspended particles.    The city's main river is still not in good health. The  segments of the Moscow River within the city limits that are in  the worst shape are still the sites where waste water is being  dumped from city aeration stations. In 1993, 11 tributaries of  the Moscow River were checked. The negative effect of 10 of them  is negligible; only Yauza has a perceptible role in pollution of  the Moscow River.    The most polluted rivers are Yauza, Filka, Presnya, and  Kotlovka, where specific pollution is detected: petroleum  products--from 3 to 94 (!) MAL [maximum allowable level]; and  heavy metal salts, especially copper, iron, and zinc--up to 37  MAL.  <H5>  The Soil We Walk On </H5>   As of 1 January 1994 there were 102 unauthorized dump sites  in Moscow with a total area of 280 hectares and consisting  mostly of solid household and industrial waste and construction  trash. The largest dump sites are located at Verkhniye Polya  Street (30 hectares), Brateyevo (15 hectares), and Anreyevskiy  Ravine (10 hectares). Over the past year 17 dump sites with a  total area of 17 hectares have been removed.    Moskompriroda has registered a multitude of violations with  respect to land use: unauthorized seizure of land; unauthorized  construction; failure to fulfill obligations to conduct an  environmental impact study; violations of environmental  requirements in storing industrial and household waste.    The legality of construction of 63 parking lots and garages  was checked. The greatest number of violations were registered  in the Southwestern (12), Southern (9), and Northeastern (5)  districts. The action with respect to violations included 60  removal orders, 25 decrees on suspension of work, and 101  protocols on initiation of administrative court proceedings in  an amount of R18 million.    Over the past year measures of economic coercion in an  amount  of R134 million were taken against violators of environmental  protection legislation. Damage compensation fines amounted to  R120 million.</p>

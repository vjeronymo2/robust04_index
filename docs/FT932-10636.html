			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Matif to launch five-year French bond futures THE MATIF, the French futures exchange, plans to launch a futures contract based on three to five-year French government bonds. The contract will start trading on June 17. The introduction of this latest French interest rate contract means that dealers can now trade the whole of the French yield curve in the futures market. The Matif already lists a three-month Pibor interest rate contract, a seven to 10-year bond contract, and a 15 to 30-year bond contract. However, the 30-year contract, launched on January 28, is hardly traded: average daily volume in April was just 184 contracts, compared with 134,000 in the 10-year 'notionnel' contract. 'The five-year contract will have the same fate as the 30-year,' warned one government bond trader. An active forward market already exists in when-issued five-year BTANs, which are sold at regular monthly auctions. According to some traders, this assumes the function of a futures contract. However, a Matif official said the new contract had been designed to offer something different: it is based on three- to five-year BTANs and OATs with total outstandings of FF231.48bn. There has been growing trading interest in the shorter end of the yield curve across a range of markets. In the last few months, two new five-year contracts - a German government bond (BOBL) contract on Liffe in London and an Italian government bond (BTP) contract on Italy's Mif - have been launched. However, a previous attempt to develop a five-year French bond contract proved a failure. In 1988, the Matif launched a five-year contract jointly with another exchange, which never took off, and was killed the following year. The Conseil du Marche a Terme has approved the latest launch.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by (Beijing) Lu Yusha (7627 6276 2619): "Large </F> Group of State-Owned Enterprises Authorized for Sales: A  Difficult Financial Issue of Tax Assignment System -- China's  Financial Red Ink Reportedly Will Likely Increase This Year"]    [Text] After the tax assignment system goes into effect in  China this year, how the relationship between the Center and the  regions will evolve remains to be examined. On the one hand,  both sides have issues in contention and each wants to maintain  the largest share of benefits; but on the other hand, compromise  is indicated as they are both in the same boat. Therefore, even  after the tax assignment system goes into effect, the Central  Government has unceasingly carried out a campaign of persuasion  in the interiors to facilitate administration of the tax  assignment and other new systems.  <H5>  20.5 Billion Yuan Check To Cover the Red Ink </H5>   A high-ranking State Council official poured out his  grievances when he said: "Why do we institute the tax assignment  system? Because developed countries all do it, Japan, the U.S.,  Britain and France all have such a system in effect. We do it  because the national treasury will not be able to function  without it. The 20.5 billion deficits reported in the PEOPLE'S  DAILY is a hard number. From January through October last year,  provincial revenue receipts increased 18 percent, but the  Central Government's only 0.03 percent, and this is the actual  situation. The 20.5 billion deficits in the national treasury  were only met by a check written in that amount, but this year  we can no longer resort to using this method."    Without holding back, he continued: "This year, China's  fiscal deficits will likely increase greatly. With the tax  assignment system in effect and other additional income  receipts, the Central Government's treasury anticipated some  revenue increase but [instead] had to spend 18 billion yuan in  enterprise subsidies without which state-owned enterprises  cannot survive. And adding to the 20 some billion yuan deficits  this year is another hard number, and that is the increase in  workers salaries and wages. With a wage increase of 85 yuan per  capita per month, it comes to over 20 billion yuan for the  country as a whole. And this figure has not included the part on  wages in this year's civil service reform which, if implemented  in the fourth quarter, will add another 7.5 billion yuan of  national expenditures."    This kind of fiscal situation is really like "the cleverest  housewife can't cook a meal without rice." Even worse, concerned  government departments have begun discussing publicly civil  service and wages reforms, and while the Central Government  originally wanted to postpone implementing this plan, deferment  now appears impossible. And that is another large sum of  expenditures.  <H5>  Provinces Taking Advantage To Extort From Central </H5> Government    The above-quoted official continued: After the tax  assignment  went into effect, local governments continued to operate by the  former system of transmitting parts of the taxes revenues  collected to the Center and keeping the rest in the region and,  because of this, their burden has not increased while the Center  has to bear the deficits. Furthermore, many provinces and cities  have asked whether that part of the former system which allowed  tax revenues collected one year to be transmitted in a different  year was abolished, for this was another opportunity to extort  an amount from the Center. But the Central Government, hoping to  maintain "successful cooperation" with the regions, has  tentatively indicated that it "may be abolished," since the  amounts transmitted by all provinces add up to only some 2  billion yuan which cannot solve the Center's problems. But the  Central Government is firmly insisting that the required  increased amount this year must be transmitted, and leaving the  question of how to modify which part of the former system to be  considered at year's end. In summary, the Central Government  wants henceforth to increase its revenue intake, to coordinate  among rich and poor [provinces] and, at the appropriate time, to  allow regional authorities to retain more revenues in order to  stabilize relationship with the regions.    And there is more, the Central Government has indicated that  "henceforth, aside from the nationally coordinated key projects,  regional authorities can also plan and develop their own  projects without having to coordinate every project with the  Central Government." This amounts to meeting two objectives in  one move, namely, decentralizing authority and lessening local  burdens.  <H5>  Government Selling Shares in State-Owned Enterprises </H5>   As the Central Government decentralizes its authority,  regional governments take the opportunity to see what they can  do vis-a-vis the production authority of state-owned  enterprises. Those who make investments in China should not  overlook the fact that this year, a large group of state-owned  enterprises and shares in other such enterprises are up for  sales or transfer of (from government to people, and from  domestic investment to joint or foreign-funded investments).  Although the state-owned enterprises whose shares are available  for purchase are not the large mainline enterprises, but from  the standpoint of further intensification of economic changes in  China, this is a step with significant meaning.    According to sources in the foreign businessmen circle,  overseas investors with large amounts of venture capital today  are watching closely for investment opportunities in China and  are prepared, at any time, to buy shares in mainland enterprises  including state-owned, collective and even sole-proprietor  enterprises. At the same time, among the state-owned enterprises  with assets in trillions of yuan, many are also searching for  new partners to invest in their business. Therefore, this year  is the time that both buyers and sellers are looking for; even  if the government may not with great fanfare offer shares of  state-owned enterprises for purchase, the momentum can no longer  be stopped.  <H5>  State-Owned Enterprises Developing Toward </H5> "Privatization"    A State Planning Commission official revealed that of the  several trillion yuan worth of state-owned enterprise assets,  only a very small number of shares have gone to private  investors. Therefore, any trend toward "privatization" in  state-owned enterprises is just beginning to unfold.    China's State Economic and Trade Commission Chairman Wang  Zhongyu [3769 1813 4416], speaking of selling shares in  state-owned enterprises, described it in 10 characters, "reform,  market, efficiency, technological reform, management." But he  nevertheless put enterprise restructuring in first place.    He said: "Reform is focused on two aspects, one is  enterprise  reform, the other is reform in the area of circulation. At the  heart of the latter reform is the establishment of market  mechanism. Enterprise reform has several major aspects: First,  "rules and regulations" should continue to be implemented, and  self management authority put into effect; second, reform should  have a major effect on the structure of the organization. Within  an organizational structure, reform should concentrate in areas  of rents and leases, sales and auctions, transfer and merger,  and on establishing policies and regulations governing these  areas. Third is separation of the support system. Fourth is  selection and disposition of surplus personnel. The crux is to  invigorate operations of enterprises."    According to different news sources from various mainland  provinces and cities, provincial and local authorities in fact  are privately or publicly making detailed inventories of  state-owned enterprises located in their areas to see which ones  cannot be touched, which ones may offer stocks for sale, and  even which ones may be bought and resold. All localities, noting  demands of the Central Government that "state-owned enterprises  operate by market forces," anticipates that shortly after the  end of this year, there will be a rash of state-owned  enterprises seeking partnership with outside investors.  <H5>  Striving To Seek Export and Agricultural Markets </H5>   When Wang Zhongyu talked about other reforms, he touched on  the subject of market reform, saying "that enterprises should  concentrate on opening two kinds of market, export markets and  rural markets. The problem of not finding export markets is due  to lack of understanding of international market. Enterprises  should, therefore, vigorously seek to open up international  market to increase exports. China's rural market is quite large,  but in the last few years, income increase of peasants has  slowed and their purchasing power declined correspondingly. Once  rural markets are opened up, sales will pick up quickly."    With respect to reform in technology, Wang Zhongyu said that  in the latter part of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," China needs  to set its sight higher and take larger steps toward reform in  technology, and we must restructure existing enterprises before  we can raise the levels of industrial craftsmanship, facilities  and product quality. China is researching into whether it can  restructure 300 key enterprises, and in 3-5 years raise their  level of production, grade of products and thereby the overall  production quantity. In fact, at present 100 state- owned  enterprises are carrying out restructuring on a trial basis from  ownership and structure to concrete operations, seeking to make  fundamental changes.  <H5>  Pattern of a "Three-Part" System of Enterprises </H5>   As the above-mentioned reforms intensify, the ratios of the  different types of enterprises and of their production values  will also undergo major changes. Based on projections of  relevant government departments in China, by the year 2000, the  production values of all enterprises will show a "three-part"  pattern. In terms of the total industrial production value, it  is estimated that one-quarter will be from state-owned  enterprises, one-half from collectively owned enterprises, and  one-quarter from privately owned enterprises; in terms of the  total commercial retail sales value, one-third will be from  state-owned enterprises, one-sixth from collectively owned  enterprises, and one-half from privately owned enterprises.    According to projections, by the year 2000, the industrial  production value of state-owned enterprises, as a proportion of  the total industrial production value, will drop to 27.2  percent, which is the inevitable result of the rapid decline  beginning in the 1980s and continuing through the 1990s.    On the opposite side of the picture, the total industrial  production values of collective, rural and private enterprises  will continue to rise. By the year 2000, the proportions [of  total production values] of these three types of enterprises  will increase 47.7 percent, 13.4 percent and 11.7 percent  respectively, as compared to increases of 34 percent, 48.1  percent and 65.9 percent in 1990. At the same time, the total  commercial retail sales of these three types of enterprises, as  a proportion of the all commercial retail sales, are also  clearly rising, with sales by privately owned enterprises  increasing by more than 47.1 percent.</p>

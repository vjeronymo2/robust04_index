			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Board pledges confidence in Lopez: Quentin Peel reports on the German car maker's action to stem losses THE supervisory board of Volkswagen yesterday pledged its 'unconditional confidence' in Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, its new production and purchasing director, and denounced the campaign by General Motors, his former employer, to 'discredit' him. 'The supervisory board emphatically rejects the accusation that Mr Lopez and seven colleagues broke their obligations of secrecy to their former employers at Opel and General Motors,' Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the board, told the annual shareholders' meeting. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chief executive, said that the way in which GM had attempted 'to discredit not only the blameless reputation of Mr Lopez and his colleagues, but also the image of the whole VW concern was incomprehensible'. He revealed that the seven former GM employees who followed Mr Lopez to VW had started legal action against the US motor manufacturer. They were demanding that GM refrain from any action affecting their working relationship with VW and that it retract its allegations. That action was supported by both VW and Mr Lopez. Mr Liesen, responding to rumours that Mr Lopez is earning more than Dollars 5m a year, said his salary amounted to 'less than one third of this sum'. He said Mr Lopez was 'of high intelligence and unusually great creativity, who shows ways in which the European automobile industry can survive competition with Japanese and other producers. This is an ambition of historic importance.'</p>

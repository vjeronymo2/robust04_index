			<p>BFN     [Text] The planned working visit this weekend to Moscow by  Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto has been cancelled at  the request of Russian authorities. According to the Foreign  Ministry in Helsinki, Russian officials requested that the visit  be shifted to a later unspecified time because it conflicted  with the visit to Moscow by the president of Latvia. A new date  is being sought for planned talks between the Finnish and  Russian foreign ministers.</p>

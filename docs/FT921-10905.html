			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan's second-rank brokers feel the squeeze - Securities houses are being hard hit by the ailing Tokyo stock market, which has entered its third year of weakness WHEN travelling on the 'Bullet Train', executives at National Securities, a medium-sized Japanese brokerage, do not take the first class car any more. 'We're telling everybody to bear through the hard times,' says Mr Kikuo Noguchi, senior managing director at National, an affiliate of Matsushita Electric Industrial, the electronics group. Japanese securities houses are being hard hit by the ailing Tokyo stock market, which has entered its third year of weakness. Faltering trading volume has led to sharply lower stockbroking commissions, hurting the small and medium-sized brokers which are dependent on broking fees. Mr Robert Zielinski, financial analyst at Jardine Fleming, a Hong Kong-based brokerage, assesses that losses at some of the medium-sized brokers could total as much as Y40bn.( Dollars 325m) Due to the dominance of the Big Four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - in corporate business, such as underwriting and stockbroking for institutional investors, the remaining 260 second and third-tier brokers have come to rely heavily on brokerage commissions from individual investors. According to Mr Zielinski, the daily average volume needs to be between 500m to 700m shares for second and third-tier brokers to be profitable. The daily volume for the first half to September last year averaged 326.2m shares, and prospects for a recovery in the second half remain bleak, with daily activity falling to a ten-year low at 217.5m shares in January. The smaller brokers have started to turn to larger houses for support. Last year, Daiwa Securities sent its executive managing director to Imagawa Securities in Osaka to revitalise its management. Yamaichi Securities group took Yamagen Securities, a small Osaka-based broker, under its wing by increasing its stake to 56 per cent. 'A lot of customers have lost faith in us because of last year's stock scandals,' says Mr Noguchi. About 80 per cent of National's revenue comes from its retail business, and it saw income plunge 32.3 per cent and pre-tax earnings fall into the red in the interim period to September last year. Mr Noguchi says that National has started a 'Peoples Capital Stock' campaign in order to revive individuals' interest. He admits that only one client in a hundred is willing to hear about stock investments, but says they will try to convince clients that, in the long term, stocks are still attractive investments. 'It's the smaller brokers' responsibility to try to revive investor confidence among individuals,' says Mr Noguchi. The market volatility which has been blamed on futures related trading is not helping smaller brokers' efforts to to encourage individual investors to return to the market. 'Our salesmen claim that they cannot recommend stocks to clients when prices are being manipulated by dealers,' says Mr Noguchi. The medium-sized brokers are seeing profits squeezed because they are unable to reduce heavy costs. During the stock market boom of the late 1980s, medium-sized houses invested heavily in computer networks and increased overheads to maintain competitiveness. Since costs on capital investments are fixed, and staff cuts are not normal practice in Japan, the brokers have resorted to cutting expenses such as advertising and entertainment. At National, entertainment costs have been reduced by 25 per cent, while all advertising has been cancelled. Personnel moves and branch closures have also been another cost-reduction measure. Last year, a total of seven branches at five medium-sized brokerages were closed. 'We're trying to weather the storm as quietly as possible,' says Mr Hiroshi Endo, senior managing director at Mito Securities, another medium-sized brokerage listed on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Mr Endo says although closure of branches were currently being discussed, decisions have yet to be made. Mito, however, says it has an edge on other brokers due to its strong ties with its clientele in the area to the north of Tokyo. 'In the late 1980s, the larger brokers tried to break into our turf, but the market slump has put a stop to their expansion,' says Mr Endo. Mr Endo says that Mito will concentrate on rebuilding ties with customers in the region. Meanwhile, financial deregulation, under which barriers between banking, securities, and insurance industries are expected to be eased next year, poses a serious threat to the survival of some of the second and third-tier brokers. The Ministry of Finance also wants to liberalise fixed-rate commissions on stockbroking. The lack of price competition among securities houses due to the current fixed-rate commission system has been blamed as the leading cause for brokers compensating favoured clients for their losses on equity holdings. The securities industry's bitter protest has managed to delay implementation of the ministry's plan to deregulate broking fees. However, the present market slump and expectations of increased competition are adding pressure on the securities industry, especially medium-sized houses, to rationalise. Mito recently announced that it would absorb Kojima Securities, a small brokerage based in Yokohama, south of Tokyo. Mr Endo says that since Mito and Kojima have maintained close ties, it only made sense that Kojima, with only one branch, should merge with Mito. Mr Noguchi, at National, says that meetings with other brokerage officials lack the previous hostile atmosphere. 'I guess you try to be nicer to others in the industry if there is a possibility that you might be working with them in the near future,' he adds.</p>

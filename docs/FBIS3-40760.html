			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Bin-Muhammad Sha'ban, deputy petroleum </F> minister, by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani; place and date not given]    [Text] Muscat--The deputy petroleum minister in Oman and  chairman of the Board of Directors of the Oman Oil Development  Company, Salim Bin-Muhammad Sha'ban, said that the tour now  being undertaken by Petroleum and Minerals Minister Sa'id  Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari is intended to persuade non-OPEC producers  to respond positively to the initiative undertaken by the Gulf  Cooperation Council [GCC] summit to stop the decline in oil  prices. The Omani oil official added, in an interview with  AL-HAYAH, that the tour is intended to urge both OPEC and  non-OPEC producers to reduce their output, absorb the surplus  oil supply, and reduce the international output ceiling by about  1.3 million b/d [barrels per day].    The following is the text of the interview:    ['Abd-al-Ghani] The Omani petroleum and minerals minister  has  begun a tour to implement an initiative supported by the summit  of the GCC countries. Do you believe that the Gulf summit's  declaration of its readiness to lower the GCC countries' oil  output will bolster the chances that the Omani initiative will  succeed in persuading non-OPEC producers to lower their output  to improve collapsing prices?    [Sha'ban] Petroleum and Minerals Minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad  al-Shanfari is undertaking a tour to several non-OPEC oil  producing countries within the context of the decisions arising  from the GCC summit to salvage and stop the fall of oil prices.    As is known, the GCC countries, like most other oil  producers, depend entirely on oil revenues. Any drop in prices  has an extreme effect on their development plans, revenue, and  earnings.    Therefore, the kings and heads of state of the GCC countries  decided to invigorate the initiative to lower output undertaken  by the sultanate, which had previously announced a five-percent  drop in its output beginning in January 1994, in the hope that  it would be emulated by producers inside and outside OPEC.  Minister al-Shanfari's tour can be viewed primarily in this  context. It is intended to urge the countries he is visiting to  help stop the decline in oil prices and to consequently bring  the OPEC countries themselves to take a similar position.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Is the Omani and Gulf initiative aiming for  a  specific output reduction with respect to a single country or  all producer countries?    [Sha'ban] There is no specific target, although the  sultanate  does have a specific view regarding a maximum drop in output.  The sultanate hopes that the initiative will result in a  reduction in output amounting to 1 million b/d or 1.3 million  b/d.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some believe that the condition laid down by  the GCC summit for carrying out its initiative is unrealistic or  unfeasible because this has not happened in the past and because  the North Sea oil producers (Britain and Norway) refuse to  reduce their output or cooperate with OPEC. Do you agree with  this view?    [Sha'ban] I do not believe that this condition is  unfeasible.  The GCC summit is aware, as are others, that some producers that  are benefiting from low prices have no interest in prices rising  again and are unwilling to cut their output. The GCC countries  know that, when they stipulated that producer countries reduce  [their output] by specific quotas, the summit did not have in  mind, in its decision, countries which have no interest in  prices not rising. In calling upon all producer countries to  reduce their output, the summit had in mind countries that share  the Gulf countries' interest in joining together to salvage  prices and the market.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do you believe that the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia and the other GCC countries will join the sultanate in  lowering output if most of the producer countries agree to  reduce their output?    [Sha'ban] First, the non-OPEC producers need to be  consulted.  Minister al-Shanfari's tour is a basic part of this  consultation, inasmuch as it will include Yemen, Egypt, Syria,  Russia, and even Norway and Britain. Contacts are also being  held with a view toward non-OPEC ministers holding contacts with  several non-OPEC oil producer countries to cover the base of  non-OPEC producers. After that, we expect that there will be a  good, positive response. After the results are sorted--and every  event is subject to discussion--a decision will be made on a  reduction in OPEC's output and the rate of the reduction. I  believe that a general, positive tendency exists among all  producer countries to cut output and improve prices.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] You said that the initiative aims to reduce  the international oil supply surplus by about 1.3 million b/d.  Is there a deadline for achieving this target, such as by late  winter or early fall 1994?    [Sha'ban] I believe that if we obtain a positive outcome, we  can leave the setting of a date or the timing of an announcement  to cut output to the relevant parties. They will engineer the  timing, declaration, effective date, and implementation of this  policy.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Were the GCC countries led to support the  Omani initiative by the economic difficulties and hardships they  are experiencing because of the drop in oil prices?    [Sha'ban] Without labelling, the GCC countries no doubt rely  greatly on oil revenues, as do all producer countries,  especially the developing countries among them. All of them  share an interest in improving oil prices, because oil revenues  finance their development plans. All of the GCC countries rely  on oil revenues to finance all of their development programs and  to meet their financial obligations. The drop in prices is  having an adverse effect on these countries' economies. The GCC  countries are not the only ones suffering from this problem and  these hardships. But some of the GCC countries are perhaps more  able and prepared than other oil producing countries inside and  outside OPEC to endure and cope with this oil crisis, regardless  of its intensity.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Will there be a meeting of the oil ministers  or deputy oil ministers of the GCC countries after Minister  al-Shanfari's current tour?    [Sha'ban] I can say that there will be a meeting. I do not  know at what level it will be. However, coordination and  contacts among the GCC countries are certainly ongoing. And the  GCC countries will be evaluating the results of the tour and the  OPEC countries' position.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] There have been recurring reports that Oman  may call for meetings between OPEC producers and non-OPEC  producers in the IPEC [Independent Petroleum Exporting  Countries] group to study the position of the oil market after  Minister al-Shanfari's tour. Are these reports correct?    [Sha'ban] I cannot rule out such a possibility, but I cannot  confirm it. It will depend greatly on the results of the tour.  Thus, this subject could be studied by Oman together with its  brothers in the GCC.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] When do you expect the initiative to bear  results and oil prices to improve?    [Sha'ban] That depends on the producer countries'  willingness  to lower prices [as published]. No one can predict precisely  when prices will improve, because a multiplicity of intermeshed  factors underlies the current oil situation. Consequently, an  improvement in prices depends on the elimination of all of these  causes, or at least some of them.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGURE SKATING U.S. CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> BOWMAN SUFFERS BACK SPASMS, TAKES A FALL  </P> <P> Christopher Bowman, who calls himself Hans Brinker from hell, spent a night  there Friday. He suffered back spasms before going onto the ice and then skated  one of the poorest performances of his career to virtually eliminate himself  from contention in the national figure skating championships.  </P> <P> Bowman, the defending champion and runner-up in the 1989 World Championships,  fell once, failed to complete his required combination jumps and then almost  fell again.  </P> <P> Only the generosity of the judges, who scored him high for his presentation,  enabled him to finish as high as fourth in the original program, which is where  he remained in the overall standings entering Sunday's freestyle competition.  </P> <P> Dr. David Howe, medical director for the championships, treated Bowman for the  recurring back spasms both before and after the performance.  </P> <P> "It's a treatable problem," Howe said, indicating that Bowman could compete  Sunday.  </P> <P> The prognosis for his title hopes is less optimistic. For Bowman, from Van  Nuys, to win, catastrophe would have to strike the three skaters who are ahead  of him. Considering their performances Friday night at the Salt Palace, that is  highly unlikely.  </P> <P> Todd Eldredge, an 18-year-old former world junior champion who is from South  Chatham, Mass., but has trained in San Diego for the last two years, added a  victory in the original program to one Thursday in the compulsory figures to  take a commanding lead.  </P> <P> But a Salt Palace crowd of 8,479 gave its first standing ovation of the week to  Paul Wylie, a 1988 Olympian and Harvard undergraduate, who finished second in  the original program and improved from third to second in the overall  standings. Mark Mitchell of Hamden, Conn., is third.  </P> <P> Wylie, 25, also received the first perfect 6.0 scores of the week, both for his  stylish presentation. It was a significant improvement over last year, when he  entered the championships as a co-favorite along with Bowman but finished  third.  </P> <P> "I learned last year that nobody owes you a living in the sport," Wylie said.  "You must go out there and make it happen every day. I trained ad nauseum, and  it worked."  </P> <P> This year, it was Bowman's turn to take the fall.  </P> <P> "It went through my head: 'The door is open; if you don't walk through it,  you're dumber than anybody,' " Wylie said of his reaction when Bowman had his  problems. "It didn't take any pressure off. I said, 'You've got to put yourself  on the line and do it.' The short program is like the final putt. Everything is  on the line.  </P> <P> "It's a tough sport. You hate to see somebody like Chris go down. He's a great  skater. But, at the same time, that's part of it."  </P> <P> The United States has had three consecutive four-time men's champions, Charlie  Tickner, Scott Hamilton and Brian Boitano. Bowman is not likely to add his name  to that list.  </P> <P> "That makes it strange," Wylie said. "Past nationals have always been more of a  coronation."  </P> <P> The king is injured; long live the king. Or perhaps it is more appropriate to  call Bowman the chief. A flamboyant skater, he dressed Friday night in an  American Indian costume, including a headband that, as one U.S. Figure Skating  Assn. official said, "makes him look like Tonto."  </P> <P> Bowman, 22, has received as much attention for his off-the-ice adventures as  for his performances, but he has proved himself as one of the world's best  skaters. If he does not finish among the top three here, however, the USFSA  will have to decide whether to still send him to the World Championships next  month in Halifax, Canada.  </P></p>

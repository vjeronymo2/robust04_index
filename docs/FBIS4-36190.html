			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Text] Members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee headed by Knesset member [MK] Ori Or yesterday toured  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Northern Command and south  Lebanon. The committee members were briefed by senior Northern  Command officers about the reasons for the Air Force attack on a  Hizballah training camp in the Ba'labakk area. They were also  briefed about possible terrorist attacks.    MK Or said that if Lebanon disarms Hizballah it will be  possible to speak about evacuating the security zone.    Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu expressed support for the  IDF operation in Lebanon and voiced total support for the  government's decisions in this regard.    Meanwhile the state of alert on the northern border  continues. Senior military sources said despite the fact that no  Katyushas have been fired by Hizballah since Friday they are  continuing their activity in the security zone.    The sources say that the terrorists are trying to plant  explosive charges, to attack outposts, and to kidnap soldiers.  The terrorists are also trying to smuggle suicide squads into  the security zone for attacks against IDF and SLA [South  Lebanese Army] forces.    "We are convinced that Hizballah will try to carry out a  spectacular attack in retaliation for the Air Force attack,"  said a senior Northern Command source.    Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the Northern  Command, will today brief the General Staff about recent  developments in Lebanon.</p>

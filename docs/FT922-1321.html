			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Exit the big spenders: Consumers still squeezed by debt - Stores report slow sales - Growth in exports broadly based / Why there is somuch caution in the high street THE BRITISH consumer, chastened by debt and fearful of rising unemployment, may well be developing a new and sober attitude to spending in the high street. As the uncertainty of the general election fades and interest rates move slowly downwards, shoppers have failed to respond with the enthusiasm many retailers were expecting. Instead, there appears to be a trend among spenders to seek quality ahead of flashiness, durability ahead of fashion, and above all the benefits of savings ahead of conspicuous consumption. Hopes that spending was about to revive were demolished by the paltry rise of retail sales in May. A limited splurge in spending in April dwindled to a trickle last month as consumers continued to stay away from Britain's high streets. The reluctance to spend is at odds with the general trend of consumer confidence, which has been moving upwards since the beginning of the year. Consumers appear to believe that the worst of the recession is over, but are still cautious. The main squeeze on consumers, and still the biggest cause for uncertainty, is debt. Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, has estimated that about 1.8m people are sitting on so-called 'negative equity', where the value of their house has fallen below the value of their mortgage. Inflation - at 4 per cent and falling - can no longer be relied upon to erode the value, and hence the burden, of the debt. At the same time, unemployment continues to rise, creating a general air of uncertainty about the future. But although the debt burden and fear of unemployment weigh heavily on Britain's households, not everyone is feeling the pinch. Average earnings growth of 7 per cent a year against inflation of about 4 per cent should mean that those in work are feeling better off. Mortgage payers everywhere have seen interest payments come down as base rates have dropped from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. One theory to explain the timidity of British consumers is that a new mood of sobriety has combined with the constraints on spending left over from the 1980s. The horror of indebtedness is still foremost in people's memories so that consumers, once bitten in the 1980s, are twice shy in the 1990s. 'There is no point looking to the credit figures for signs of an upturn,' says Mr James Barty at Morgan Grenfell. 'People will start to spend out of extra cash rather than borrow to spend.' Yet that alone does not explain the more stoical mood of consumers that has been noted by the retailers themselves. 'There is plenty of cash out there but there is still too much emphasis on saving,' says the managing director of a chain of electrical goods shops based in the south-east. He blames government incentives such as tax-exempt special savings accounts and personal equity plans, which are taking funds that would otherwise go on discretionary expenditure. According to retailers, those who are spending are spending differently. The finance director of a clothing chain says consumers are looking for clothes that are more durable, if a little less fashionable. The managing director of the electrical goods chain says turnover of toasters costing Pounds 37.95 is much higher than turnover of toasters at Pounds 11.95, whereas the reverse was true during the boom. 'People are less prepared to take risks and try out different products,' he says. 'They want quality, something they know will last.' Some have even suggested that spending on flashy products is no longer fashionable. Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, speaks of 'conspicuous non-consumption' restraining demand, and points to a cut in advertising expenditure on consumer products at the same time that spending on savings products has held up. Mr Douglas McWilliams, economic adviser of the Confederation of British Industry, puts it another way. 'Spending is not as fashionable as it used to be. There is no need to keep up with the Joneses if the Joneses aren't spending.' There are also fewer new innovations on the shelves to tempt shoppers, and with the economic outlook still uncertain, investment in innovation is likely to remain modest. The store manager of a London electricals store says: 'Sales of brown goods, such as radios and televisions, have held up pretty well because the technology moves on. But white goods have not sold well because there has been little innovation in fridges and cookers.' Perhaps the key to explaining the change in people's attitudes remains the torpor of the housing market. People do not feel as wealthy as they did when the value of their homes was on a seemingly endless upward path. Furthermore, because people are not moving, they are not buying expensive items such as curtains, kitchens and carpets. As long as the housing market remains stagnant, spending on smaller moveable items such as lamps and rugs might tick over, but big expensive items will shift only slowly. How long then are retailers going to have to wait to see life return to the high streets? Optimists believe that the brighter sentiment consumers are expressing now in confidence surveys will soon translate into higher retail sales. Others think sales will remain feeble until the housing market perks up. Those retailers that have survived the recession appear to be braced for such slow growth. 'I don't think we are in a recession,' says the managing director of the small electricals chain. 'This is something different. This is the level of retail sales we are going to have to get used to - what we saw in the 1980s was an aberration.'</p>

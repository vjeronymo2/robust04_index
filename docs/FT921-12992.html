			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Charge puts Caterpillar in red CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment, reported a Dollars 404m annual loss for 1991, compared with earnings of Dollars 210m in 1990. The loss per share for last year was Dollars 4.00, compared with earnings per share in 1990 of Dollars 2.07. The loss was attributed primarily to a Dollars 373m pre-tax, non-recurring charge, most of which was taken in the fourth quarter, and a 12 per cent decline in physical sales volume. The charge was for plant closings and employee redundancy costs. Although the company has been embroiled in a labour dispute with the United Auto Workers since the start of last November, it said this did not have a significant effect on the deterioration in sales. It did, however, admit that with some 9,300 workers idled, operations have been disrupted. The company's outlook for this year is also clouded by the labour dispute. It said that because of the uncertainties about the economy and resolving the labour problems, it was 'not practical to forecast 1992 profitability at this time'. But it is expected that the first quarter of 1992 will be unprofitable. In the fourth quarter, the company reported a loss of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 3.16 per share. This compares with earnings of Dollars 11m, or 11 cents, in the year-ago period. A non-recurring Dollars 324m charge was taken in the fourth quarter. Most of this was related to the closings of a York, Pennsylvania plant and the consolidation of two plants into one in Brazil. Sales and revenues in the fourth quarter were Dollars 2.46bn, down by Dollars 299m from the 1990 period.</p>

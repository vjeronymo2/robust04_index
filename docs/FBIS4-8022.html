			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Aware that the number of Albanians in  this former Yugoslav republic is probably greater than suggested  by official statistics and now that the government is preparing  for new elections, the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM] authorities are dragging their feet over  the census, which should be carried out under international  supervision. Ibadete Hajrullahu has more details:    [Hajrullahu] To settle the controversy about the number of  Albanians in Macedonia -- which according to Macedonian  officials is approximately 21 percent, while according to  Albanian politicians is 40 percent, Macedonia agreed under  international pressure to carry out a new census because the  exact number of Albanians is needed to determine their status in  this republic. The date of the census has already been  postponed more than once because disputed issues have not yet  been resolved. Council of Europe experts have asked that some  articles of the Census Law be amended since the Macedonian side  did not take into consideration remarks made by the Council of  Europe when drafting this bill. On this and other problems, we  interviewed the chairman of the Party of Democratic Prosperity,  Arber Xhaferri:    The census is about to be carried out. Have the necessary  preparations for a real and objective census been concluded, and  how is the situation regarding the procurement of personal  documents of Albanians for the census?    [Xhaferri] This problem is real and objective. The  Macedonian Government is attempting to have the census carried  out according to their standards and needs. We, however, are  not satisfied with these preparations, which is why we are  trying to organize the census ourselves. We have already  contacted some experts on statistics and demographic censuses  from Kosova and the United States. We intend to maintain our  stance. We have our demands and we will not give up.    We are also having a number of difficulties helping people  obtain personal documentation. In my opinion, this strategy is  aimed against the Albanians or against peoples who should be  marginalized in the system. No matter where they are,  particularly in the postcommunist states, these peoples are  having problems obtaining personal documents and with property.    These difficulties have been fabricated so that a majority  of  the population will not be able to register.    [Hajrullahu] The coalition government prepared the election  laws some time ago. What is your view on this?    [Xhaferri] Even under these election laws, a political  result will emerge on the Albanians' political strength. It is  anticipated that Albanians should in no way obtain one-third of  the deputies in the parliament. If they were able to reach this  number, they would become a relevant political factor because  they could then oppose any law or constitution that could be  introduced in Macedonia. Thus, the weight of their vote would  have some political significance.    Meanwhile, with the percentage they occupy in parliament,  they cannot influence the polls and the election process. This  election law that is approved or proposed has this in mind --  the Albanians should in no way obtain one-third of the  parliament members.    [Hajrullahu] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    [Xhaferri] You are welcome.</p>

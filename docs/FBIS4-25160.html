			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 6 Jun -- Speaking at a recent seminar on  the work of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] in 1994, Ye Xuanping, vice chairman of the  CPPCC National Committee, stressed that CPPCC organizations at  all levels should attach greater importance to theoretical  study, and should strengthen research and discussion of theory.    Ye Xuanping pointed out that at every important moment of  the  party's history when the party faces a major task, there is  always an upsurge of study to review past work experience and  correctly understand the situation and tasks. He urged the  CPPCC to unify their thinking with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and  successfully push CPPCC work forward.    Ye Xuanping said: It is necessary to study CPPCC work and at  the same time acquire a correct understanding of China's  national conditions. Only by correctly understanding our  national condition can the CPPCC find its place, successfully  carry out its responsibilities, bring its strong points into  play, and make its due contributions. He continued: The topics  for research and discussion should be selective. They should  have theoretical depth and at the same time provide guidance to  CPPCC work. He said: It is necessary to implement the policy  of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of  thought contend" in theoretical research and discussion, and  everyone should be able to freely air their views so as to  achieve unity in understanding and raise their standards to  serve for the country's central task.</p>

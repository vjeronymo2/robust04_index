			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] The text of the forged letter from Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd to Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, dated April  18, 1994, is as follows:    ``Dear Malcolm,    ``Following our conversation in the committee, I believe  what  has been done in recent days in Gorazde shows that General Rose  and the British forces have been successful in implementing our  policies.    ``These achievements are indeed creditable, and we should  continue to give our full support to our troops. To keep the  lead that we took in the United Nations in co-ordinating that  effort, and to continue our policies, I think it is the  appropriate time to respond to the (sic) General Rose's request  for more troops.    ``As you have observed on your recent visits to the United  States there might be some change of policy by the United States  and some other European countries which disagree with our  policies to help to (sic) the Serbs.    ``So I am beginning a new effort to persuade the United  States Administration on (sic) our objectives and to ensure the  others that we are trying to secure the long-term interests of  Europe.    ``I believe much has been achieved, and there is a lot to be  done.    ``Yours sincerely,    ``Douglas Hurd.''</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pietermaritzburg May 11 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini welcomed the inauguration of the KwaZulu/Natal  Parliament in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday [11 May] night as  the beginning of a new era in his kingdom. But he said it was a  new start following a sad period of intense political violence.    Echoeing the words of the region's Premier Frank Mdlalose,  the Zulu monarch said differences in political ideas should  result in healthy debate rather than conflict. "I appeal to you  to make deliberate plans to bring about peace. Let the  political violence we have had not spill over into the new era."    King Zwelithini also welcomed all people in the province as  his people, saying: "I love all people created by God in his  own image."    He told the legislature to co-operate and work together for  the well-being of the people.    At a press conference later, the African National Congress  leader in the Parliament, Jacob Zuma, said his party was  continuing with legal steps into alleged voting irregularities  during last month's elections in the province. But he would not  say whether the ANC was in favour of a re-election in the  province: "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."    Dr Mdlalose also acknowledged that many things had gone  wrong. Both leaders, however, indicated their willingness to  work together in the regional government.</p>

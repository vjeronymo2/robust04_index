			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Byatt's water escalator UK WATER customers have had a poor deal on prices since privatisation. While telephone prices are falling by 7.5 per cent a year after inflation, and gas consumers' bills are coming down by 5 per cent, water charges are rising by 5 per cent. This price escalation must be stopped, Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said yesterday. Such words will be music to customers' ears. But unfortunately it is doubtful that Mr Byatt, who is responsible for regulating water charges, can deliver an end to above-inflation price increases. His freedom of action is constrained by expensive obligations to clean up sewage and improve water quality imposed by government and the European Community. In setting charges, he is required to ensure water companies earn sufficient returns to finance investment - now Pounds 3.5bn a year but slated to rise by Pounds 1.5bn if obligations agreed since privatisation are maintained. Mr Byatt has for the past year campaigned against some obligations on the grounds that they are unnecessary to improve public health and too expensive. Ministers, influenced by the fact that escalating water charges are a political issue, are coming round to his view. But given that the obligations are enshrined in Community law, renegotiating them will be difficult. Mr Byatt is therefore turning his attention to those areas where he does have authority. He plans to bear down on the industry's profitability, arguing that current levels of profits are not needed since the industry's cost of capital is only 5-6 per cent in real terms. That compares with the 7 per cent the government thought necessary at privatisation and the 6 1/2 -7 1/2 per cent advocated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in its recent review of British Gas. The discrepancy between Ofwat and the MMC's figures is largely explained by the fact that water is an even lower risk business than gas. The prospects that competition will develop are slim, while it is hard to envisage the demand for water being undermined by technological developments. The higher government figure reflects the fact that the water industry was fattened up for flotation in 1989. The consequence is that water shares have risen by about 130 per cent since privatisation. Now Mr Byatt plans to reduce those excess margins, although the change will be phased in over a decade. The effect of this tough but fair approach is that Ofwat will be able to slow down the price escalator but not stop it entirely. To achieve that, ministers will have to work harder to reverse EC directives. To give them an incentive, Mr Byatt might consider splitting the K-factor, specifying how fast prices can rise, into two parts when he sets new price controls next year. An X-factor would show price cuts flowing from improved efficiency and lower profitability, while a Q-factor would show increases due to obligations agreed by ministers. That way, customers would know whom to blame for higher bills.</p>

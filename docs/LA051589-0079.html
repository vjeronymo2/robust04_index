			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Showing violent scenes on a Chinese-language program proved costly for one of  Hong Kong's two television companies. The Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority  fined Asia Television $45,000 after receiving complaints about scenes of a  violent assault on a woman and a rape included in a show titled "The Police  Archives." The rape scene in particular "was considered by the authority to be  a most serious breach as it depicted sexual violence in a severely excessive,  gratuitous and explicit manner."

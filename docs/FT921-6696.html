			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Names reassured on Lloyd's probe A DISPUTE over the appointment of Sir David Walker to head an inquiry into alleged malpractices at the Lloyd's insurance market was defused yesterday at a meeting between Conservative MPs, leading Names and the market authorities. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of an action group of Names - individuals whose wealth backs underwriting - said he was now convinced of the independence of Sir David, chairman of the Securities and Investment Board, who also attended yesterday's meeting. Sir David's appointment on Friday followed allegations in parliament that Names working in the market were benefiting at the expense of outside Names. The Lloyd's Council admitted yesterday that 'some syndicates with a greater than average participation of external Names are syndicates that have incurred very substantial losses from catastrophe business'. This was 'based on a snap-shot at a point in time' and did not 'necessarily indicate that these syndicate compositions result from improper practice in the allocation of syndicate capacity'. It was necessary to examine 'how the composition has developed over time'. The admission came in a dossier, provided to Names and MPs, drawn up in response to questions raised by Mr Paul Marland, a Conservative MP who is also a Lloyd's Name. Earlier in the week some Names had questioned the appointment of Sir David, who is also a member of the Lloyd's Council, the market's governing body. Mr Doll-Steinberg, representing Names on catastrophe reinsurance syndicates formerly managed by Gooda Walker agency, said he was impressed with Sir David's forthrightness. 'We had some reservations at the beginning, but having heard him and met him, whatever reservations we had have been unconditionally withdrawn.' Together with a delegation of four Conservative MPs, including Sir William Clark, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, and three other Names' leaders, Mr Doll-Steinberg met Sir David and leaders of the Lloyd's market, including Mr David Coleridge, chairman, and Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, yesterday. Names on Gooda Walker, which managed a number of syndicates that have suffered devastating losses in 1989 and 1990, are among those seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down from the Names' funds to meet cash calls. Sir William said he had received 'categorical assurances' that Sir David's terms of reference would be 'as wide as anything'. Sir David would be able to investigate any allegation, he said.

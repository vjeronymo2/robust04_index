			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SIERRA CLUB FILES SUIT IN BID TO BLOCK RT. 56  </P> <P> The Sierra Club filed a lawsuit in San Diego Superior Court on Monday to block  the widening of Interstates 5 and 805 near Del Mar, the western extension of  Route 56 through North City West and the construction of a massive interchange  joining the freeways.  </P> <P> The lawsuit contends that the freeway project will do irreparable harm to  coastal wetlands and Carmel Valley, and that the California Coastal Commission  didn't adequately pursue alternatives that would do less harm to the  environment.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was not unexpected; the Sierra Club promised to pursue the matter  in court after the Coastal Commission approved the project by a bare 5-4 vote  last month.  </P> <P> The commission's own staff had recommended against the $160-million project,  saying the destruction of coastal wildlife habitat around Los Penasquitos  Lagoon and in the Carmel Valley was not sufficiently offset by mitigating  measures.  </P> <P> The project has been backed by Caltrans and the city of San Diego as necessary  to relieve the I-805-I-5 bottleneck near Del Mar and to provide a link between  Interstate 15 and the coast by widening 1.8 miles of Carmel Valley Road into a  six-lane freeway.  </P> <P> But Laurens Silver, attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, said the  organization is asking the court to set aside the Coastal Commission permit  because the commission should have approved a less environmentally damaging  alternative -- one that would have consumed less of the wetlands.  </P> <P> Furthermore, he said, the commission should have, at least, demanded more  mitigation than it did to replace the 50 acres of wetlands that will be lost in  the project.  </P> <P> "Because of uncertainties in replacing wetland habitats, the commission in the  past has required that new wetlands be created by a 3-1 ratio over the ones  being destroyed," he said. "But the commission didn't do that in this case.  It's a marked departure from the commission's historical practice."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Coastal Commission said he could not comment on the lawsuit  because his office had not yet seen it.  </P> <P> But Hannah Cohen, a consultant to the Mid-County Transportation Coalition that  had lobbied for the highway project, called the Sierra Club's lawsuit  "frustrating" and said she hoped the city of San Diego and Caltrans would move  ahead until told otherwise by the courts.  </P> <P> "This alignment has been approved since 1965. It's been a frustrating and long  process, but we all feel we have a very viable and defensible environmental  impact report.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry they're trying to put another hindrance in our way, but I believe we  are on the winning end, having gotten this far with the project."  </P> <P> A differing position was held by Jerry Mailhot, co-chairman of the Carmel  Valley Coalition, which has fought the Route 56 plans.  </P> <P> "It's encouraging for us that the Sierra Club has taken this on, because they  don't normally take on lawsuits unless they see merit in them and think there's  a chance of winning.  </P> <P> "We are concerned by the destruction that freeway project will cause in the  Carmel Valley and the impact on the Los Penasquitos Lagoon."  </P> <P> Silver said he wasn't sure when a court hearing on the suit will be scheduled.  </P></p>

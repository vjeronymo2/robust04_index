			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Japan's reform bills head for last hurdle Japan's coalition government yesterday took a big step toward getting final parliamentary agreement, by next week, for plans to reform the discredited political system. Leaders of the seven parties yesterday agreed to put the four reform bills to the vote in the upper house of parliament today week - the last hurdle before they become law. The government is expected to win the vote narrowly, thus leaving it free to table an urgent and much-delayed economic stimulation package. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa aims to present the economic package a day later, on January 20, though it might be delayed because coalition members remain divided over how to fund a proposed income tax cut. The prospect of an end to the stalemate over the economy has contributed to a 6.4 per cent rise in Tokyo share prices over the past week. The opposition Liberal Democratic party yesterday paved the way for a reform vote by reluctantly deciding to stop delaying the plans. 'We are angered by the forceful tactics of the coalition ..but will solemnly take part in the deliberations,' said Mr Tomio Yamamoto, leader of the LDP in the upper house. Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president, is expected to meet Mr Hosokawa early next week to negotiate a compromise. A victory on political reform would conclude a troubled five-year national debate on the issue, which has led to the downfall of two prime ministers and provoked the biggest upheaval in national politics since the war. Mr Hosokawa split the LDP and forced the reform package through the lower house two months ago, in a departure from the tradition of forming a cross-party consensus on important legislation. He has tried to avoid a forced vote in the upper house because the coalition's majority there is both smaller and more fragile than in the lower chamber. The coalition only has 131 of the 251 upper house seats. They include seats held mainly by rebels in the Social Democratic party, the coalition's largest but least dependable partner. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Socialist party chairman, yesterday tried to enforce discipline by ordering members at the party's annual convention to support the bills. The plans will replace the present system of multi-seat lower house constituencies with a mixture of single seats and proportional representation, and curb corporate political funding. But it is unclear whether Mr Murayama has the authority to pull into line the 10 or so upper house Socialist members who oppose reform on the grounds that they believe the party, humiliated in the last election, will do even worse under the new system.

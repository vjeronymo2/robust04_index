			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Equity derivatives bubbled into life with a rise in volume and a robust performance by the June FT-SE contract against cash, writes Christine Buckley. Open interest - positions in the market - has increased and yesterday one market specialist said the direction of least resistance had proved upwards. June closed at a 6 point discount to cash although it had kept closer pace for most of the session. Volume was a fairly strong 15,181 contracts. Put buying was said to have been strong in options which indicates dealers may be preparing for a fall in prices.</p>

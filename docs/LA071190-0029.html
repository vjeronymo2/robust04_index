			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO MAIL FRAUD IN OIL WELL SCHEME  </P> <P> An Encino man who operated a company that sold hundreds of investment shares in  wells it falsely claimed were actively producing oil pleaded guilty Tuesday to  mail fraud, authorities said.  </P> <P> Peter Gaston Stanford, 42, pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud in U.S.  District Court in Los Angeles and faces up to 15 years in prison and $750,000  in fines, Assistant U.S. Atty. Terree Bowers said. Stanford is scheduled to be  sentenced Aug. 28.  </P> <P> Stanford and Anthony Colagreco, 32, also of Encino, ran a telemarketing firm  called American Southwest Petroleum Ltd. in West Los Angeles, which solicited  oil investors from across the country, Bowers said.  </P> <P> Bowers called ASP a "boiler room" operation and said that in the summer of 1985  about 350 people paid $2,400 to $3,000 each for shares in two oil leases in  Kansas and two in Oklahoma.  </P> <P> "Most of the wells on the leases were not producing oil at all," Bowers said.  "They actually purchased some producing wells at the start, but then they  started drilling their own wells and got into problems."  </P> <P> Bowers said that although the wells on three of the leases were producing only  water and no wells had been drilled on the fourth, potential investors were  told that the leases were producing oil.  </P> <P> Some investors received some money back on their investments along with  fictitious oil production reports, Bowers said. The money they received,  however, was actually from new investors in the scheme.  </P> <P> ASP collapsed in late 1985 and was investigated by a task force of prosecutors  and investigators from the U.S. Attorney and Los Angeles County district  attorney's offices. The investigators learned that some of the money taken in  the scam was allegedly used by Stanford to make speculative investments in the  commodities market, Bowers said.  </P> <P> Stanford and Colagreco were indicted in May of this year on 19 counts of mail  fraud. Colagreco has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial next week.  </P></p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Where two sides differ over basic law The Hong Kong government last night said China was in breach of the 1984 Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and its own Basic Law for Hong Kong after 1997. The Joint Declaration provides for the continuance of current Hong Kong law after 1997, of which the British law of contract is part. The Basic Law, which was promulgated by China's National People's Congress, or parliament, in April 1990 is specific in regard to contracts. Article 160 says: 'Documents, certificates, contracts, and rights and obligations valid under the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall continue to be valid and be recognised and protected by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, provided that they do not contravene this Law.' China has said that the Basic Law cannot be amended before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.</p>

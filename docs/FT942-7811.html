			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / People: David Gelber joins the 'enemy' Derivatives broker Intercapital has always had the reputation of throwing some of the best parties in the business. David Gelber, at that time chief operating officer of Midland Global Markets, walked into last year's thrash, which had the Wild West as its theme, to find a poster on the wall: 'Grisly Gelber - wanted for cutting brokerage'. Gelber, 45, acknowledges the irony that he, once the scourge of the brokerage business because of his attempts to force down commission levels, should be joining the 'enemy'. He has just been appointed group managing director of Intercapital, reporting to chairman and founder Michael Spencer. A veteran of Citibank and Chemical, and Hong Kong Bank before its merger with Midland, Gelber left Midland Global Markets in April. 'My first love is derivatives,' says Gelber, who, despite his managerial role at Midland, is basically a trader through and through, and sees himself as one of the pioneers of the swaps market. 'I've had it with huge organisations.' When Midland and Hong Kong Bank merged, he says he accepted the chief operating officer slot because it was 'a big position. I guess I had more grey hairs than most people. Someone needed to do the job.' But after a while he appears to have fallen out with Guy Heald, a colleague from Chemical days, and now head of Midland Global Markets. 'One grows apart - like a marriage,' is all Gelber will say. He admits that the Intercapital job came as rather a bolt from the blue. But the entrepreneurial challenge fits the bill. He points out that he has always been attracted to a variety of growing businesses; he was, for instance, a founder director of Cafe Flo, the London brasserie chain. 'Intercapital has grown beyond anyone's expectations,' Gelber says, explaining the need for the new position at the 8-year-old company. Between its offices in London, New York and Tokyo, it now employs more than 200 people. 'I was brought in to lend some management expertise to a growing organisation.' Asked whether he had injected capital into the venture, Gelber refused to comment.</p>

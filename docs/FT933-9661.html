			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / US calls for Mogadishu retaliation: Clinton demands action after four soldiers die in ambush PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday condemned a Somali attack that killed four US soldiers in Mogadishu and vowed 'appropriate action' against those responsible. He said the US would do everything it could to find out who was to blame but stressed Washington would 'proceed through the UN, as our troops are there are part of the UN.' Mr Clinton defended the UN mission, saying it had averted mass starvation and enabled food and medicine to reach Somalia. 'I still believe the United Nations mission was well conceived and properly undertaken,' he said. However, the ambush, the third in four days on troops of the UN peacekeeping force, prompted fresh demands in Washington led by Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, for a re-examination of the US role in Somalia. The ambush resulted in the highest US death toll in a single incident since American troops arrived in Somalia in December to safeguard relief supplies and end the reign of warlords. Yesterday's deaths bring US fatalities to six. The UN said six vehicles were on their way to Mogadishu airport when one hit a land mine and a fierce gunbattle ensued, until reinforcements arrived. The UN special representative in Mogadishu, retired US Admiral Jonathan Howe, blamed followers of the fugitive warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed for the attack. Gen Aideed has been sought by the UN force since 24 Pakistani peacekeepers were killed in an ambush in June. 'We will take appropriate action to ensure we defend our people,' Mr Howe said. Senator Dole told a television interviewer it was time for the administration to reassess US participation in UN operations. Asked if the troops should be withdrawn, he said: 'The time may be close.' He recalled that more than 35 UN troops had been killed in Somalia and thought that pressure on President Clinton to call an end to US participation in the operation would increase. Mr Dole said it was the view of other senators that the peacekeeping operation had strayed from its original purpose of providing humanitarian assistance. However, Vice-President Al Gore ruled out an immediate withdrawal of US forces. 'We have got a mission there and we are going to continue it,' he said on television. Mr Gore said the administration would be consulting its allies to decide on the appropriate response to the attack.</p>

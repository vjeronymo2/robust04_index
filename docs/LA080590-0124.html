			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCULPTOR TAKES HIMSELF OUT OF PICTURE;  </P> <P> CHARLES RAY COMES UP WITH NEW FORMS -- NOT HIS OWN -- IN DEPARTURE FROM  CONFRONTATIONAL BODY SCULPTURES  </P> <P> Charles Ray has disappeared.  </P> <P> Once, the 37-year-old artist was regularly seen among the sculptural materials  employed in his art. His naked body would lay perfectly still inside a  horizontal steel box attached to the wall, with one arm dangling through a  cutout hole to literally create a sculptural appendage, the other arm resting  on the bump of a bony hip that peeked above the box.  </P> <P> Or else he would stand, again naked, with his head in a lineup of ordinary  objects placed on a high shelf: vase next to box next to gasoline can next to  human head.  </P> <P> Or, simpler still, Ray would pin himself against the wall with a plank, the  dead weight of his torso pressed between the two, conspiring with gravity to  suspend his body several feet off the floor. In these precocious student works,  his body became a human painting hanging on a gallery wall.  </P> <P> The transformation of flesh and blood into the form of sculpture, domestic  container and painting came to an end about five years ago, as Ray began to  disentangle his body from his art. A principal interest of these body-related  works had been the peculiar, if frequently unexamined, relationship between a  work of art and the spectator who encounters it. Simply by making the spectator  aware that, as a viewer, he was not the only living, breathing half of the  liaison, Ray clearly meant to disorient that common relationship. Made quietly  unnerving, the spectator's discourse with art would be refreshed and vivified.  </P> <P> At least, it would be vivified in principal. In practice, that eye-opening  refreshment did not quite work out. Ray's body sculptures had developed out of  a larger artistic  </P> <P> shift. His hybrid form brought together aspects of performance art and Minimal  sculpture -- two modes that had emerged in the 1960s in an effort to  acknowledge and explore the complex social space in which art and meaning take  shape. But, for me, encounters with Ray's body sculptures were marred by their  decidedly demonstrative nature; they had a nagging aura of show-and-tell.  </P> <P> As with the operatic installation art of Ann Hamilton, which also employs  costumed actors as silently posed perfomers in elaborate tableaux, a  conspiratorial quality of "let's pretend" defused the necessary tension of  Ray's art. Certainly it was startling to come upon a naked person embedded in a  sculpture. Yet, in order to convincingly stage the performance-sculpture, the  mute artist/performer was required to ignore the spectator -- to simply pretend  you were not there.  </P> <P> For an aesthetic determined to dig deep into a spectator's equivocal experience  of art, this was a rather ironic handicap. The body-to-body confrontation  central to Ray's endeavor was safely intellectualized, out of physical harm's  way. Your surrender to the situation was demanded.  </P> <P> A key ingredient in Ray's evolving solution to the dilemma has been to sidle  off center stage, as his often compelling work of the last several years  attests. Now, he lurks impishly in the wings. Ray began to make sculptures in  which the essential pivot is often a perceived absence of the body. Typically,  the spectator's presence fills in for the artist's. At its best, Ray's art  becomes a vivid point of contact between the artist's outstretched hand and  yours. His sculpture could be described metaphorically, as attempting to  harness that electrically charged space between the index fingers of God and  Adam in a certain Sistine ceiling fresco.  </P> <P> A good chunk of Ray's work from the past five years may be seen in Newport  Beach and Los Angeles. Nine sculptures dating from 1986 through 1989 are on  view, through Sept. 23, at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, including his great  breakthrough piece, "Ink Box." And five more recent works, all but one made  this year, are presently at Burnett Miller Gallery, where the Los Angeles-based  artist has lately been represented, to Aug. 31.  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor exhibition is the artist's first significant show at a  museum -- a single exceptional piece was included in last year's biennial  exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art -- yet, it's somewhat  disappointing. The show feels lackadaisical. Several individual works are  strong, and a few have not been seen here before; still, the selection as a  whole seems decidedly haphazard.  </P> <P> Together, the concurrent exhibitions suggest several emergent themes in Ray's  sculpture; at the museum, however, it's hard to discern any curatorial point of  view at work, save for an apparent desire to offer a general sampler of the  artist's increasingly important oeuvre. Nor is there a catalogue or brochure,  nor even a didactic label on the wall (according to a museum spokesman, a  planned brochure has been delayed). The show, which will not travel, feels more  like a commercial gallery presentation than a rigorous museum exhibition.  </P> <P> Ray's art frequently looks simple, but in fact it is often very difficult to  install and maintain. (For proof, try filling an old-fashioned porcelain  bathtub with water, then mounting it -- vertically, not horizontally -- on a  wall. Ray's water-filled "Bath," from 1989, floats impossibly in the space of  the museum wall, as if seen from an aerial vantage point.) At least three of  the nine works at Newport required heroic measures to accommodate. You have the  sense that the complications of installation were all the museum could handle.  </P> <P> Still, coupled with the actual gallery presentation at Burnett Miller, the  perspicacious (and peripatetic) visitor will find numerous rewards. Together,  the shows make plain that a lexicon of forms has begun to emerge in Ray's  mature work, forms whose ancestry in his early body sculptures is clear. The  shelf, or table-top, is a recurrent motif, as are the rotating disk and the  mannequin (a surrogate human body). And the box, or other type of container, is  perhaps pre-eminent.  </P> <P> Space, a sculptor's principal medium, is keenly deployed within this range of  forms, several of which can coexist in a single piece. "Table" (1990) is most  eloquent in this regard. A simple table of steel, topped by a clear sheet of  plexiglass, is arrayed with a variety of containers -- pitcher, bowl, drinking  glasses, carafe, covered jar -- also formed of transparent plastic. In each  case, the plane of contact between container and table-top has been cut out; if  you put anything in the bowl, for example, it would go through to the floor.  Intangible space seems to flow disconcertingly through the sculpture.  </P> <P> The jar provides a subtle but important counterpoint to that flow, its cover  rudely putting a lid on the action. Thus are the fluid properties of space made  strangely visible, while emptiness is given energetic life.  </P> <P> Two earlier table sculptures also play with perceptual incongruities. One  transforms a still life into a group of individual objects, each slowly  rotating at an almost imperceptible speed; the other connects its assorted  still-life elements by way of a network of tubes crisscrossing beneath the  table's surface. (A fourth table, not in either show, removes the surface of  the table altogether; each still-life element is suspended by a supporting rod,  together identifying a plane of empty space.) Vaguely diabolical in bearing,  these disparate sculptures show how Ray returns to a simple motif to mine it in  a variety of ways.  </P> <P> More important, there is something poignant and solitary about the table  sculptures. The technical complexity of Ray's art is such that you tend to  scrutinize the work in an effort to understand how it was made and, by  extension, through what processes the idea might have originated. The table  sculptures conjure someone sitting alone at a kitchen table -- "contemplating  the salt shaker," as it were, or thinking about the nature of things. The  artist, in absentia, is suggested.  </P> <P> He also turns up as a costumed department store mannequin in a recent  self-portrait sculpture, as well as in an installation in which a framed,  photographic self-portrait is curved to fit the swelling, curved wall on which  it incongruously hangs. The curved wall, irrationally bowed out into the room,  seems to be responding to enormous hidden pressures; riding the crest of the  wave, the artist's image is carried along for the ride.  </P> <P> Ray's mannequin is very funny, in part because such things are supposed to be  generic, not specific, and in part because artists' self-portraits typically  tend toward the cerebral or emotionally refined, not toward assertions of  cultural status as a commercial dummy. "That's not really me," this rudimentary  self-portrait declares, its unexpected candor running contrary to the very  genre of portraiture.  </P> <P> A slightly earlier manifestation of the department store mannequin motif is  also on view. This undressed, anatomically incorrect mannequin has been  pointedly "corrected" by the artist. At first, the hyper-realistic genitals on  the otherwise schematic dummy are startling; soon, it is the hyper-phoniness of  the idealized dummy itself, with its typical department store style, that seems  truly odd. Ray's addition to this bizarre creature, which was initially  designed to be a surrogate for you and me, unearths an implied duet between  idealization and taboo.  </P> <P> Technically, the obvious tour de force at Burnett Miller Gallery is a wonderful  mechanized carousel titled "Revolution Counter-Revolution." The base of a  child-size merry-go-round rotates clockwise, at a fairly good clip. Four pairs  of suspended ponies and two swings, all empty and awaiting riders, also rotate,  but in the opposite direction. Ray has calibrated the speed ratio of these two  conflicting rotations so the riderless steeds appear nearly stationary,  suspended in space as the ground plane rushes away. Almost imperceptibly, the  horses inch forward, as if against an unseen but overwhelming inertia.  </P> <P> More quietly, if nonetheless technically surprising, "7 1/2 Ton Cube" (1990) is  a pure white, pristine, perfectly milled block of solid steel. Its elegant,  immovable bulk stands as wild counterpoint to Ray's most accomplished  sculpture, the pivotal "Ink Box" (1986). A hollow, open cube of black-lacquered  steel, also three feet to a side, "Ink Box" is filled to the brim with some 200  gallons of jet-black printer's ink. The quivering meniscus of ink that is the  top plane of this menacing black cube forms a threatening surface just begging  to be touched, even in the face of certain disaster. Avant le deluge, the  hair-raising conflict between a desire to act and a denial of experience is  tightly focused.  </P> <P> In the evocation of disarming conflicts such as this, Ray's art finds its most  profound resonance. At his best, he is able to locate these complex perceptions  deep in the bodily consciousness of the spectator. The High Modernist  conception of the work of art as an all-knowing, all-seeing eye, disembodied  and disengaged from the passive viewer but held aloft as his moral guide, is  laboriously pulled back down to Earth. Charles Ray gives his art weight and  dramatic space -- and he acknowledges the same prerogatives for its spectators.  </P></p>

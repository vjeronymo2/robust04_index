			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (At a glance): Docklands EZT blow There was more bad news for Docklands enterprise zone trust investors this week. Investors in PET 8, which owns Two Exchange Tower, have been asked to defer the rent they are owed. This rent is in many cases used to pay off the loans with which investors have funded their investment, and extra tax relief is available if this is done. Globe Trust, the private property company formerly called Charter Group, guaranteed the income from its 250,000 sq ft office building, which is still only 40 per cent let. It has asked the trust's investors to defer the rent, which is Pounds 5m a year, until it has solved its liquidity problems by making a property sale.</p>

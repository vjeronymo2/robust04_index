			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 19 (CTK) -- "The Czech Republic has  refused for the time being to grant a request from the United  Nations to reinforce the UN forces in Rwanda and send a military  hospital complete with the staff there," Monday's [20 June]  issue of the independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES writes. "The  request was conveyed last week to the Czech delegation to the UN  and visiting representatives of the parliamentary Defense and  Security Committee by UN Undersecretary General Kofi Anan," the  paper writes.    "According to diplomatic sources, the Czech UN mission said  that the Czech Republic would not most likely grant the request  because it had already exhausted all its possibilities to  reinforce the peace-keeping forces.    "The director of the Defense Ministry Foreign Relations  Section, Jaromir Novotny, had said earlier that the Army did not  have any more reserves for UN operations. But according to  Czech Army representatives it would be much more difficult to  find volunteers ready to go to Rwanda than to provide the  hospital," the paper says. It recalls that the Czech Republic  has already sent one field surgical team of 20 doctors to the  former Yugoslavia. Czech soldiers and civilian policemen of the  Czech Armed Forces are currently active within five UN  peace-keeping operations, the paper points out.</p>

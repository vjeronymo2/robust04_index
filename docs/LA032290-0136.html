			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUBLIC RELATIONS WEIGHTED DECISION TO HALT SPRAYING  </P> <P> The decision by state agriculture officials this week to set a May 9 deadline  to end aerial malathion spraying in Southern California was as heavily weighted  by public relations considerations as by science, according to officials  involved in the decision.  </P> <P> Battered by protests from environmentalists, residents and local politicians,  Department of Food and Agriculture officials in charge of eradicating the  Mediterranean fruit fly from Los Angeles and Orange counties decided they had  to send a loud and clear message to the public that California was winning the  war against the Medfly.  </P> <P> "Just saying 'trust us' wouldn't do it," said Isi Siddiqui, the state's point  man in the eradication program. "We had to show them. . . . It was time for us  to make a decision and tell the public the end is in sight. We had to turn this  around."  </P> <P> But, in setting the deadline and choosing to phase out aerial pesticide  spraying in favor of eliminating the pest through the release of sterile  Medflies, Agriculture Department Director Henry J. Voss was rejecting the  recommendation of the state's scientific advisory panel on the Medfly.  </P> <P> The decision was made Monday at a Sacramento meeting of Voss, Siddiqui,  Associate Director Rex Magee and Deputy Director Robert C. Fox. According to  Siddiqui and Magee, Siddiqui argued for the deadline and Voss agreed.  </P> <P> Some agriculture officials concede that setting a firm deadline of May 9 is  potentially risky. If the strategy fails and the state has to resume spraying,  it could further inflame a population angered over repeated malathion  sprayings, they say.  </P> <P> Opposition to aerial spraying of malathion has mounted in recent weeks and a  number of cities have unsuccessfully brought court actions aimed at halting the  spraying. Critics contend the safety of malathion spraying is uncertain while  the state contends it is not harmful to people in the small doses used.  </P> <P> Siddiqui said the decision to stop spraying would not have been made so soon if  not for a meeting of the state's scientific advisers a week earlier to review  the eradication program's progress.  </P> <P> To the state's surprise, the panel of five entomologists recommended that  spraying continue, despite the near completion of a second breeding facility in  Hawaii that promised an abundant supply of sterile flies to breed the pest out  of existence. The scientists were skeptical that the facility could produce  enough sterile flies, and they recommended that shipments be held in reserve in  case of new outbreaks.  </P> <P> Siddiqui said the recommendation directly contradicted promises the state had  been making for months -- that spraying would be phased out as soon as  possible.  </P> <P> "I told them, 'The department has made commitments to public officials and the  media,' " Siddiqui said. "We cannot hold 150 million sterile flies in reserve  and say to folks, 'We're just going to continue spraying you.' "  </P> <P> The scientists, nonetheless, stuck by their recommendation.  </P> <P> "The panel was sending a signal to people that this thing is going to go on and  on," Siddiqui said. "We had to set the record straight. If we didn't, there  would be people saying, 'You could have used the sterile flies in May.' "  </P> <P> Siddiqui said he was forced now to send out an equally strong message to  counter the panel's recommendations.  </P> <P> Some members of the panel, however, had viewed their recommendation as the  safest course, both scientifically and politically.  </P> <P> Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture entomologist in Hawaii and the  chairman of the panel, said the recommendation provided Voss with a  justification for continued spraying while insulating him against the  uncertainties of future sterile Medfly supplies.  </P> <P> "I think Mr. Voss is putting himself into a corner he didn't need to be in,"  Cunningham said. "It's more or less a political thing. Suppose we commit 200  million steriles to these areas and then production (of the sterile flies)  falls? We're just leaving ourselves open."  </P> <P> Siddiqui said he felt an immediate and strong response was needed to the  panel's recommendations. He demanded and got a one-hour meeting with Voss on  Monday morning.  </P> <P> Voss, who was in Washington Wednesday and not available for comment, was  confronted with two issues. One was whether to simply reject the panel's  recommendations and phase in sterile fly releases as soon as practical. The  other was whether to attach a firm date to the end of spraying in already  infested areas.  </P> <P> The first question was easy to decide, Siddiqui said. The state had always  maintained that it would use alternatives to aerial spraying whenever possible.  </P> <P> The eradication program began that way last year with single sprayings followed  by the release of sterile flies. But the infestation grew so quickly that the  state depleted its supply and had to rely on repeated pesticide spraying.  </P> <P> Now the situation was different. Not only had no new flies been discovered in  five weeks, but also adequate numbers of sterile flies were soon expected.  Voss, Siddiqui and Magee knew that a second breeding facility in Hawaii was  close to completion.  </P> <P> With that information, the decision was clear, Siddiqui said. "How could we  explain to the public if we had all these sterile flies but continued  spraying?" he asked.  </P> <P> Deciding whether to place a deadline for the end of spraying was a trickier  question.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it was that critical," said Magee, who thought the state could  have waited until April or May before making a final decision.  </P> <P> But Siddiqui argued the state should not just reiterate its vague position that  sterile Medflies would be phased in during May or June -- a stand that would do  little to alleviate criticism. The state had to provide a concrete date, he  said.  </P> <P> Siddiqui's staff calculated that a sufficient number of sterile flies would be  on hand by May 9 and that spraying could be discontinued. And Voss agreed to  the date.  </P> <P> Siddiqui said additional spraying may be necessary if additional flies are  discovered before May 9 in some of the already infested areas and enough  sterile flies are not available.  </P> <P> If wild flies are discovered in new areas, sterile flies will be released after  a maximum of two malathion sprayings, he said.  </P> <P> But he said the state is confident that the sterile flies will arrive in  sufficient quantities and that most areas will soon see their last helicopter  sorties.  </P></p>

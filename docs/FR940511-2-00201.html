An application must receive a minimum score of 75 points out of the maximum of 120 points that may be awarded under this competition to be eligible for funding. Grants will be awarded to the three highest-ranked, eligible PHA applications within each of the following 10 groupings of Area and State Offices: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> New England, New York, New Jersey, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Great Plains, Rocky Mountain, Southwest, Northwest/Alaska, Pacific/Hawaii. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, grants will be awarded to the three highest-ranked, eligible IHA applications on a nation-wide basis, subject to the following condition: Of the total grants awarded to IHAs, the Director of ONAP retains the authority to insure that each Field Office of Native American programs receives a minimum of one eligible grant. This means that before an award is made to an IHA from the jurisdiction of a Field ONAP in which an IHA has already received an award, that award may be made to the next highest scoring IHA from the jurisdiction of a Field ONAP in which no IHA has yet received an award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the remaining eligible applications, both PHAs and IHAs, will then be placed in overall nation-wide ranking order, with the remaining funds granted in order of rank, except as discussed above for IHAs, until all funds are awarded. The following criteria will be used to evaluate eligible applications: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The extent to which the Youth Sports activities to be assisted with the grant address the particular needs of the area to be served by the activities and employs methods, approaches, or ideas in the design or implementation of the activities particularly suited to fulfilling the needs (whether such methods are conventional or unique and innovative). (Maximum points: 25). In assessing this criterion, HUD will consider the following factors: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The appropriateness of the applicant's methods, approaches, or ideas in addressing the particular needs of the area to be served by the program, as reflected in the description of the services to be provided by the applicant's proposed Youth Sports Program (section III.(a)(3) of this NOFA); (10 points) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

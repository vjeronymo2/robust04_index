			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 OF DISTRICT'S SCHOOLS WILL BECOME  YEAR-ROUND  </P> <P> The Lancaster School District, seeking relief from crowded classrooms, has  decided to begin moving toward a year-round calendar by converting two of its  14 campuses to the controversial schedule this fall.  </P> <P> The change will mean an early end to summer vacation for students at Lincoln  and Nancy Cory elementary schools, both of which opened last fall.  </P> <P> Year-round classes there will begin Aug. 6, about a month ahead of other  schools in the 10,800-student district.  </P> <P> The Board of Trustees voted 5-0 Tuesday to approve the switch. Parents will  have the choice of keeping children in those schools or transferring them to  schools with traditional calendars.  </P> <P> Lancaster officials said most parents have supported the switch so far, which  is designed to relieve overcrowding in the fast-growing area.  </P></p>

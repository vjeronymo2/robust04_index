			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Amec deal averts Tyneside strike A COMPROMISE deal between Amec Offshore and officials of the GMBU general union and the AEEU engineering workers' and electricians' union yesterday averted an indefinite all-out strike at the Tyneside offshore fabrication company, Chris Tighe writes. The threatened strike by the 900 manual workers was over company plans to make the night shift work seven hours a week longer without extra pay. An overtime ban has also been called off. Under the compromise the night shift will work an extra four hours. All employees will receive a one-off compensation payment and night-shift workers will receive extra payments until June.</p>

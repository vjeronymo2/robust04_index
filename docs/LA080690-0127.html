			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SINGING BETTER, DENVER SAYS  </P> <P> John Denver hasn't had a hit record in 10 years, but he says his voice has  improved with age.  </P> <P> Denver, who will perform Wednesday at the Deer Creek Music Center north of  Indianapolis, said he struggled during the 1980s to keep his career afloat.  </P> <P> "It was always hard to get my songs on the radio," he said. "But when they did  get airplay, a lot of people liked the music, and I still have an unusually  large audience for not having had a hit record in that time."  </P> <P> Denver's album "Earth Songs," which is sold through the National Wildlife  Federation, includes new versions of the hits "Sunshine on My Shoulders,"  "Rocky Mountain High" and "The Eagle and the Hawk."  </P> <P> "I'm singing so much differently than I was 20 years ago," Denver said.  "There's a much greater range of emotion in each and every word. And I'm  singing better. All of that tends to make it a different recording."  </P></p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Letter: Way to avoid surprises Sir, The leaking of price sensitive information by companies seeking to avoid surprises by giving guidance to analysts can be avoided by issuing profit statements and relevant comment on a quarterly basis. The practice, followed by the great majority of UK companies, of reporting twice yearly creates an information gap of some eight months between the announcement of half-year figures and the issue of the preliminary profit statement for the full year. Quarterly reports, issued about mid-way through the following quarter and containing comment on current trading and the outlook, in practical terms virtually eliminate information gaps.

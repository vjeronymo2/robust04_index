			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Rated capacity'' is defined in the final rule as the maximum load that a piece of material handling equipment can safely lift and move. This is a term that is commonly used when describing the capability of a piece of material handling equipment. The rated capacity of a piece of material handling equipment is initially determined by the manufacturer and documented in the operators manual and on the equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Serviceable condition'' is defined in this final rule as that quality of a tool, machine, vehicle, or other device to operate as it was intended by the manufacturer to operate. OSHA believes that there are many conditions that can exist with a piece of equipment that would make it unserviceable, as well as other conditions that would not similarly qualify. For example, seat covering material on a tractor that has become cracked, although uncomfortable, would not normally qualify as a condition that would make the machine unserviceable. On the other hand, worn brakes or a leak in the brake system would definitely make a machine or vehicle unserviceable. Additionally, cracked or broken gauges and defective or leaking fuel systems are other conditions that would render a machine or vehicle unserviceable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of personal protective equipment, head protection that has a crack that would compromise the ability of the hard hat to absorb further impact without injuring the employee is an example of an unserviceable condition. On the other hand, a small dent in a hard hat would not necessarily render the head protection unserviceable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Tie down'' is defined in the final rule as an assemblage of binder and strapping (either chain, cable, steel strips or fiber webbing) that is used to secure a load to the bed of a transport vehicle. In the proposed rule, OSHA used the term ``binder'' to indicate the assembly that is used to secure a load to a vehicle during transport of that load. As pointed out by two commenters (Ex. 5&hyph;7; Tr. OR 20), a binder is a component of a tie down and is the ratchet assembly that is used to secure and tighten the strapping of the tie down. In this final rule, the Agency has corrected the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Vehicle'' is defined as a personnel conveyance and/or material handling equipment. Included are cars, buses, trucks, trailers and semi-trailers. Although vehicles normally operate on public roads, their use is not limited to that environment. Any of these pieces of equipment may operate not only on public roads, but may also be used to transport personnel or materials off-road. For example, when a logging truck or tractor/trailer is moving a load of trees or logs, the vehicle may have to traverse not only the logging trails or roads, but may have to operate on the public thoroughfares to deliver its load to the mill or other off-loading point. This final rule covers the logging operation from the site of the felling of the trees to the point of delivery of the trees or logs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d) General Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Included in the general requirements paragraph of the final rule are requirements for personal protective equipment, seat belts, first aid, fire extinguishers, environmental conditions, work areas, signaling and signal equipment, overhead electric lines, flammable and combustible liquids and explosives and blasting agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Personal Protective Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d)(1) contain requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE), including its use and maintenance, and the inspection of PPE before its use during a workshift. Paragraph (d)(1) also specifies when employees must use gloves, leg protection, logging boots, head protection, and eye and face protection. This final rule, however, does not contain requirements for other types of personal protective equipment that are covered by other general industry requirements contained elsewhere in part 1910 (i.e., hearing protection and respiratory protection). Paragraph (b)(3) already makes clear that other requirements contained in part 1910 automatically apply when the logging standard has not addressed a particular hazard or working condition. Therefore, since part 1910 already require the use and maintenance of PPE, OSHA has included in paragraph (d)(1) only those items of personal protective equipment that are not contained elsewhere in that part or that are in some way different from the requirements contained in elsewhere in part 1910. As such, references to respiratory protection in subpart I of part 1910 and hearing protection at &sect;1910.95 have been deleted from this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

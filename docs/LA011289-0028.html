			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIRD WORLD DEBT  </P> <P> "Living standards in sub-Saharan Africa have been declining steadily for more  than a decade," says Barber Conable (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 3). In other words, the  mother who bought a loaf of bread in 1980 now gets by on a half.  </P> <P> Yet in the rest of his column the president of the World Bank loses touch with  that mother. He prefers sophisticated financial arguments over Third World  debt. The economic-adjustment programs applied by the bank have resulted in big  reductions in health care and social services in debtor countries. So the  mother must walk farther to the clinic when her children are sick.  </P> <P> In the end, it is the poor who suffer most from the debt crisis. As part of  U.S. support for the World Bank, we must force it to look at the human face of  poverty. The problems of the African mothers are easily hidden behind the  billions of dollars of debt.  </P> <P> RICHARD HART  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

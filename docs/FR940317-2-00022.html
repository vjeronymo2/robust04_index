The Site is approximately 25 miles southeast of Augusta, Georgia and 20 miles south of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aiken, South Carolina. Since its establishment, the mission of the SRS has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been to produce nuclear materials that support the defense, research, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical programs of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, reactor fuel or target assemblies were chemically dissolved into aqueous solutions in the F- or H-Canyon chemical separations facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various processes were performed to separate the useful isotopes (uranium-235, uranium-238, neptunium-237, plutonium-238, americium-243, curium-244, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plutonium-239) from the rest of the fuel and target material. The uranium-235  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solutions were shipped off the site for conversion to a solid form and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uranium-238 in solution was converted to an oxide using the FA-Line facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at SRS. The neptunium-237 was recovered, and when required, converted to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid and fashioned into new targets. The plutonium was recovered and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted to metal or oxide products using the FB- and HB-Line facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most converted materials were shipped to other DOE sites. Any product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials stored onsite were placed in ``vaults'' designed for storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In March 1992, chemical processing operations were suspended in the canyons to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address a potential safety concern. The concern was subsequently addressed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but prior to resumption of processing, the Secretary of Energy directed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defense-related chemical separations activities (i.e., reprocessing) be phased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out at SRS. Since this decision, the Department has determined that further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action related to the disposition of nuclear material is subject to the NEPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. Non-safety related facility operations have remained shut down, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exception of plutonium-238 processing associated with the support of NASA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> missions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of these shutdowns, the canyons and the reactor fuel and target storage basins <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  have a large inventory of in-process solutions, fuel assemblies, and targets. This inventory includes materials containing a wide variety of special isotopes (plutonium-239, uranium-235, plutonium-242,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> americium-243, curium-244, neptunium-237, etc.). There are approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100,000 gallons of in-process solutions in storage and approximately 200  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metric tons of spent fuel and targets in storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> There are several storage basins currently in use. These are the K-, L-, and P-Reactor basins, the Receiving Basin for Off-site Fuels (RBOF) located in H-Area, and the Canyon receiving basins. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the above solutions and targets, there are over 90,000 gallons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UNH) stored in tanks outside the facility. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UNH contains the uranium-235 recovered from the processing of fuel from SRS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production reactors, and DOE, domestic, and foreign research reactors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are also approximately 35,000 55-gallon drums of uranium-238 (known as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``depleted uranium'') oxide stored on the site. This material is the product of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing the targets from which plutonium-239 is recovered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For some solutions (e.g., enriched uranium and americium/curium) no conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability exists. Conversion, stabilization, or disposition options must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed for such solutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

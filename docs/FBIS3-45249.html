Official statistics show that from 1992 to the end of 1993  more than 27,000 technological contracts had been signed, with a  total business volume of over 800 million yuan (about 91.95  million U.S. dollars)-worth.    Through these markets, the latest research findings have  been  spread all over the country and have been applied to production,  resulting in a remarkable increase in profits.    For instance, a computer designing system for silk spinning  traded on the technology market has already brought more than  700 million yuan (about 80.5 million U.S. dollars) in increased  profits to those firms which have applied it to production.    A centrifugal ventilator invented by researchers at Zhejiang  university has been applied in over 20 cities throughout the  country and has created more than one billion yuan (about 115  million U.S. dollars) in profit.    Local officials said that they are developing the technology  market "in a bid to commercialize and spread new- and high-  technology nationwide".    This is also the best way to optimize the uneven allocation  of technological forces, which has hindered the development of  both scientific technology and the economy as a whole, they said.    Meanwhile, the province has held a number of training  classes  in the operation of technology markets and technological  contracts.    Administration offices have been established in the  meantime,  in an effort to control the markets and remove trade barriers.    With the improvement of the markets and policies, the  province has witnessed a boom in science and technology  development and has made remarkable progress in applying  research findings to production.    According to officials from the provincial technology market  coordination and direction office, many items of high-technology  have been sold to foreign businesses.</p>

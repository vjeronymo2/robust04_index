			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The United States  has moved some of the staff at its liaison office in Mogadishu  to Nairobi, Kenya, because of the security consideration, the  State Department said here today.    "In Nairobi they will continue to work on Somali issues,"  department spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters at a news  briefing.    "There is a small number of essential personnel who remain  behind in Mogadishu to carry out a lot of the necessary work we  do in liaison with the U.N. mission," McCurry said.    Since Thursday, there have been some serious inter-clan  fightings in Mogadishu between the Aidid faction on one side and  a coalition of clans on the other side, according to the  spokesman.    Over the weekend, some of the gun battles occurred in areas  directly adjacent to the U.N. mission compound in Mogadishu.    "The compound was not the target of any of the fighting that  occurred over the weekend," McCurry said, "but stray rounds have  hit the compound, resulting in some injuries," that included a  U.S. civilian working for a U.N. contractor in Somalia.    There are some reports that there have been some resumption  of shelling in Mogadishu today.    The United States has also issued a very strong travel  warning, urging American citizens not to travel to Somalia.</p>

If you haven't seen the  1959 George Stevens film, you will be delighted to discover that it stands the  test of time magnificently as one of the most poignant of all coming of age  stories.  </P> <P> Willie and Phil (KTLA, Monday at 3:30 a.m.). Paul Mazursky's sunny and gentle  1980 variation on Truffaut's "Jules and Jim" is one of the director's  lesser-known films, but it is no less than an affectionately satirical survey  of the changing relationships between bright young people in the 70s. With  Michael Ontkean, Ray Sharkey and Margot Kidder.  </P> <P> I've Heard the Mermaids Singing (Bravo, Wednesday at 9 p.m.). Patrice Rozema's  swift, witty and intimate 1987 debut feature reveals with humor and compassion  the pitfalls in a working relationship between two radically different women.  </P> <P> A complete listing of the week's films begins on Page 68.  </P></p>

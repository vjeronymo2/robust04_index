			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report based on data from the Russian Federation </F> Government's Center for Economic Conditions: "No Comparison  Between Taganrog and Magadan"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Government Center for  Economic Conditions has summed up the results of the month.  Judging by the operational figures revealed by weekly price  monitoring, the inflation rate in March was slightly down on  last month at 8.7 percent (9.9 percent in February, 22 percent  in January).    Foodstuffs increased in price by 6.2 percent over the month,  while nonfood goods were up 11.3 percent, and paid services to  the population rose by 14.6 percent.    The springtime vitamin deficiency and inflation have done  their job -- in March the most tangible price rises were for  vegetables (up 24 percent). Bakery, groats, and pasta products  were up 13-14 percent. Fish, dairy products, and fruit were up  10-11 percent. Prices for these products were slightly higher  than the average growth in the price of foodstuffs -- 6.2  percent. But salt was out in front even here. It increased in  price almost by a third in March. Prices for animal and  vegetable fat rose insignificantly (by 4-5 percent). Prices for  sugar and eggs were virtually unchanged. Vodka prices fell by 4  percent on average.    The biggest food price rises over the month were in the  Northwest and East Siberian regions -- by 12 and 10 percent  respectively. On the other hand, foodstuffs in the Urals and  Central Chernozem regions increased by just 3 percent.    Prices for foodstuffs as a whole have increased by 40.6  percent since the start of the year. The biggest rises have  been for dairy products, vegetables, and salt -- up 80 percent.  Bakery products are up 60 percent.    Looking at the basket of 19 of the most important  foodstuffs,  its average cost has increased by 7.3 percent over the month and  by 44 percent since the start of the year to stand at 44,300  rubles [R] on a monthly basis. The basket cost R42,700 at store  prices, and R56,900 at market prices. The spread between the  maximum and minimum cost of the basket in different cities of  Russia increased from a factor of 3.4 to 3.6 compared with the  previous month. The most "expensive" area for the basket  continues to be the Far East region at R79,200. The average  cost of the basket in the Central Chernozem region (which was  the "cheapest" in late March) was R33,100.    The cost of the basket of 19 of the most important  foodstuffs  in Moscow increased by 5.7 percent in March to stand at R48,000.  The basket increased by 15.4 percent over the month in St.  Petersburg to stand at R49,200. On the list of cities surveyed  Moscow ranks 39th most expensive (it was 33d a month ago), while  St. Petersburg has leapfrogged Moscow to take 34th place (as  opposed to 47th).    During March prices for nonfood goods rose twice as fast as  food prices. As was the case in February prices rose by 2  percent on average every week. As was to be expected, fuel  prices in March were out in front -- up more than 30 percent,  and 43 percent for coal. There was a significant rise in the  price of wallpaper -- up 26 percent -- medicines, and synthetic  detergents (up 24 percent). The smallest increases were for  tobacco products and footwear (up 4 and 7 percent respectively).    Among Russia's economic regions the increases in nonfood  goods were more noticeable in the Volga and East Siberia  regions. But prices increased at different rates within the  regions. Thus, for instance, over the past month prices for  televisions in the Volga region and Kalmykia (which is part of  that region) increased by 70 percent, wallpaper was up 30  percent, and the overall increase for nonfood goods was 23  percent. Yet in Saratov Oblast (in the same region) price rises  for these goods did not exceed 7 percent.    The industrial goods boom has left the Volga-Vyatka region  virtually untouched. Nonfood goods there were up 7 percent.    There continue to be considerable differences in the price  of  the same goods in different Russian cities. Thus, in late March  prices for tobacco products differed approximately by a factor  of five, and by a factor of 15 for analgin [type of analgesic].  Whereas a packet cost R56 in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the price was  R810 in Yakutsk.</p>

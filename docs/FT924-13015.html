			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Canadian oil restricts Hunting fall to 13% HUNTING, the defence, aviation and oil services company, yesterday reported a 13 per cent fall in interim profits which would have been greater without a much improved contribution from the group's Canadian oil business. Pre-tax profits in the six months to end-June fell from Pounds 15.56m to Pounds 13.45m on flat sales of Pounds 369.31m. Earnings per share fell from 9.1p to 8.2p and the interim dividend is maintained at 4p. At the operating level defence profits were down from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 3.5m reflecting the end of the group's contract to supply the MOD with JP 233 runway denial bombs that were extensively used in the Gulf War. This division also suffered as a principal contractor in the supply of LAW 80 infantry-portable anti-tank weapons as a result of some production difficulties among sub-contractors. Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, said that in spite of the spending cuts, Hunting's base load of defence business would not be eroded much beyond the current level. Certain contracts for which it had tendered, including one for the management of Aldermaston, the atomic weapons establishment, could return the defence side to growth. Profits in the aviation division fell from Pounds 5.60m to Pounds 4.65m following the loss of a contract to maintain BP's lazar-aided oil exploration aircraft over the North Sea. The group has also been hit by the reduction in the number of companies maintaining their own corporate aircraft. Aircraft fitting had slowed on the BAe Jetstream 31 and 41 and the Saab 340. On the avionics side, the amount of overhaul work also fell. The group, had however won an MOD contract to maintain the Rolls Royce Conway engines for the RAF's VC10 tanker fleet. On the oil services side, Gibson Petroleum, the Canadian subsidiary, helped improve profits from Pounds 6.17m to Pounds 7.06m on sales up 17 per cent at Pounds 237m. Despite the slow-down in Canadian exploration activity, the group was able to increase its pipeline volumes. The division also benefitted in the US where losses on specialised products were reduced.</p>

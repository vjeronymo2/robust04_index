			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CARL LEWIS BARRED FROM BRITISH RELAY;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA RUNNERS CAN'T COMPETE AGAINST NATIONAL TEAMS, FEDERATION SAYS  </P> <P> Olympic champion Carl Lewis and three club teammates on an 800-meter relay team  were barred from an international track meet this weekend by the sport's U.S.  governing body, British officials said today.  </P> <P> The British Amateur Athletics Board said it had been told by The Athletics  Congress, U.S. track's ruling federation, that Lewis and three other members of  the Santa Monica Track Club had been refused permission to compete.  </P> <P> TAC denied, however, that it banned the athletes.  </P> <P> "We don't have the power to ban athletes at a meet on British soil," Pete Cava,  a public information spokesman for TAC, said at the organization's headquarters  in Indianapolis.  </P> <P> "Our contract with the meet promoter calls for the national team to compete,  and the four athletes are not on our four by two relay team."  </P> <P> "We told the British that if they wanted a four by two relay team from the  United States, the national team would supply one."  </P> <P> The United States, the Soviet Union, West Germany and Britain meet at Alexandra  Stadium Friday and Saturday in one of the major events of the European track  season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Set Sights on France  </P> <P> In New York, Lewis' business manager, Joe Douglas, said Lewis and his teammates  will try to set a world record in the 4x200 meters in France Friday instead.  </P> <P> "If they won't let us run there, (in Birmingham) we will go to St. Denis  (France) and try to break the world record there," Douglas told Reuters news  service.  </P> <P> "The difference is we won't have any competition. If we had run in England, the  Soviets have a good team and we could have possibly set the record there. Now  it will be more difficult."  </P> <P> Lewis, Olympic 200-meter champion Joe DeLoach and Danny Everett, all from the  Santa Monica Track Club, did not compete in the U.S. track and field  championships last weekend in Houston, where the U.S. team was picked. The  fourth Santa Monica runner, Floyd Heard, won the 200-meter run at the meet with  a 20.9 clocking.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica athletes and TAC have been feuding, but Lewis has denied he  boycotted the meet. Everett was graduated from UCLA on the day of the finals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Running as Independents  </P> <P> The four planned to run at Birmingham as an independent squad to try to break  the world record in the 800-meter relay. They would have run against four  national teams, including the British squad led by Linford Christie, who  finished second to Lewis in the Olympic 100 meters last summer.  </P> <P> But the British board said it had been told by TAC executive director Ollan  Cassell that U.S. club teams would not be allowed to run against national teams  in meets where a U.S. national squad was competing.  </P></p>

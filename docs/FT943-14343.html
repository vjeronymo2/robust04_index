			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Retail sales increase by 0.6% in June US retail sales increased 0.6 per cent between May and June after falling for two consecutive months, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The report follows other recent signs of renewed economic vigour, including a 379,000 rise in non-farm payroll employment in June - far above Wall Street projections. The recovery in retail sales mainly reflected higher sales of motor vehicles, which rose 1.5 per cent from May. Other strong sectors included building materials, up 2.7 per cent, and department stores, up 1.8 per cent. Overall, retail sales are running 6.6 per cent higher than in June last year, before allowing for inflation of about 2.5 per cent. Officials released revised figures for May showing a decline of 0.4 per cent rather than 0.2 per cent as initially reported. Allowing for the weakness of sales in April and May, analysts expect real consumer spending to grow at an annual rate of little more than 1 per cent in the second quarter, sharply down from 5.2 per cent in the first three months. But strong growth in capital spending, a rebound in construction and a rebuilding in corporate inventories are expected to compensate for weaker consumer spending. Most forecasters expect real economic growth at an annual rate of at least 3.5 per cent in the second quarter, and possibly significantly faster, against 3 per cent in the first quarter.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Football's Tony Mandarich found a new diversion while waiting out negotiations  with the Green Bay Packers. The All-American offensive tackle from Michigan  State made his acting debut on NBC's "Dear John," portraying a football player  who thinks his girlfriend is cheating on him with recurring character Mike (Sam  McMurray). Mandarich said the audience laughed at his lines, and the shooting  went without a hitch. "I've got all this talent that has yet to be exposed," he  said. A spokeswoman for the show said the 6-foot-6, 315-pound offensive tackle  was cast by producers who were seeking an imposing and threatening individual  for the role. The episode is scheduled to air in October. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVING WATER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara and Ventura are now on mandatory water rationing. How long will  it take for other Southland municipalities to implement such plans to save  water?  </P> <P> According to recent articles in The Times, (water) use is divided up  accordingly: one-third for private residences, one-third for business and  construction, and one-third for remaining needs. Waste runs rampant in Costa  Mesa and especially in Newport Beach, where streams, small lakes and automatic  sprinklers in complexes can be seen running into storm drains. Newport Beach  recently reported daily usage of 18.5 million gallons for 100,000-plus  residents. How absurd!  </P> <P> EDWARD PFIRRMANN  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

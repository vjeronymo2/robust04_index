			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Management: At the cutting edge of budget plans - Civil servants making hard choices As the Cabinet puts the finishing touches to next year's public expenditure plans, senior civil servants all over Whitehall are preparing contingency plans for implementing budget cuts. The decisions are often agonising and can be particularly hard when comparisons between different projects depend on subjective judgments about their merits. How, for example, to decide between an extra 1,000 places in nursery schools or spending the same amount on improved teacher training? Or between competing research proposals in different technical areas, all of which might bring benefits to British industry - the problem faced by one branch of the Research and Technology Division of the Department of Trade and Industry? 'We have to set priorities among a dozen or so programmes,' says Richard King, the head of the branch. 'Without some comparative indicator of cost-benefit, we had to rely on subjective advice, with all the difficulties of reading across from one field to another.' This year, the branch has used a new system to decide priorities on these programmes using much more objective criteria. Developed with Generics Group, the Cambridge-based consultants, it converts a wide variety of expert opinion and judgment into a single quantitative measure - the expected benefit indicator. The EBI has two elements. A policy score which evaluates how much each project contributes to meeting policy objectives. For the DTI, these objectives are the seven set for the department in the 1989 white paper - for example, improving quality in UK industry and assisting innovation. The extent to which each project meets these seven policy objectives is assessed by the DTI's own expert advisers using common criteria. These assessments are then weighted and standardised, producing scores which are comparable between different projects. An economic importance indicator, reflecting the value of the industrial activities which might be affected by the project. The inclusion of this element means that projects which are attractive on policy grounds are downgraded if they would have only a marginal impact on the economy. Again, expert advice is used to decide which sectors of the economy are likely to be affected by each project and the degree to which they will be affected. The current gross sales figures for each sector are projected forward to give a snapshot of the economic benefits of each project in 10 years' time. Multiplying these two elements together produces the EBI which can be set against the anticipated costs to produce a cost/benefit ranking of projects. The results so far have been promising, according to King. 'Not only did it succeed in producing a ranking for programmes, it also did so in a way which seems to make sense to our advisers and specialists. It is clearly important that they should respect the methodology if it is to be useful in establishing consensus over priorities.' For now, the system is used only in this one branch of the DTI. But with increasing emphasis on value for money in public spending, interest is likely from other budget-holders looking to optimise the allocation of scarce resources.</p>

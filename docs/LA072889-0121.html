			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chrysler Announces Cost-Cutting Plan: Chrysler Corp. said it plans to cut its  white-collar staff by about 2,300 people as part of a $1-billion cost-reduction  effort designed to restore its competitiveness in a soft U.S. auto market. The  job cuts represent about 8% of Chrysler's U.S. corporate staff of 31,000, and  the auto maker said it hoped the reductions would be done mainly through early  retirements and attrition. In addition, Chrysler said it set up a special bonus  program for its top 2,000 managers, who will invest up to 10% of their annual  salaries over the next 15 months and be repaid only if the company meets its  cost-reduction goals. "Car and truck business in the United States is  undergoing a dramatic and permanent transformation that puts enormous pressures  on all manufacturers to get their programs and costs in line," said Chairman  Lee A. Iacocca.  </P></p>

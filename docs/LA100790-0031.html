			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ART GALLERY, DIRECTOR ACQUITTED IN MAPPLETHORPE PHOTO EXHIBIT;  </P> <P> OBSCENITY: JURY REJECTS THE PROSECUTION'S CONTENTION THAT SEXUALLY GRAPHIC  WORKS LACK ARTISTIC VALUE.  </P> <P> An art gallery and its director were acquitted Friday of obscenity charges by a  jury that rejected prosecution claims that sexually graphic photos by Robert  Mapplethorpe lacked artistic value.  </P> <P> The obscenity trial was the nation's first of an art gallery.  </P> <P> "What a great day!" gallery director Dennis Barrie told reporters.  </P> <P> The jury of four men and four women returned the verdicts after slightly more  than two hours.  </P> <P> Barrie smiled slightly as a clerk read the verdict. When the clerk finished,  Barrie smiled broadly, said, "All right!" and hugged his attorney, H. Louis  Sirkin.  </P> <P> Spectators in the Hamilton County Municipal Court room shouted and applauded.  </P> <P> Judge David Albanese expelled gallery board Chairman Roger Ach and Robert  Allen, whose video production company sponsored the exhibit, when they jumped  out of their seats to hug Barrie.  </P> <P> The jury cleared the Contemporary Art Center and Barrie of misdemeanor charges  of pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-related material. Barrie  could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,000, and the gallery  fined $10,000, if convicted on both counts.  </P> <P> "Obviously, this is a very emotional moment. It's been a very hard time for  me," Barrie said. "We did something very important for this city. We stood up  for the 1st Amendment.  </P> <P> "This is a major battle fought here today. It's a major battle for the arts and  for freedom of expression in America."  </P> <P> However, the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, whose American Family Assn. in Tupelo,  Miss., has fought National Endowment for the Arts funding for exhibits such as  the Mapplethorpe, said, "This is not a landmark, Pearl Harbor decision. This  was just another obscenity trial.  </P> <P> "I think this really puts the NEA issue right back in the political arena where  it belongs."  </P> <P> In closing arguments, defense attorneys contended that there was no basis for  the charges of using children in nudity-related material because the mothers of  the children gave their consent. The prosecution contended that consent was not  in writing when the exhibit opened.  </P> <P> The defense also noted the U.S. Supreme Court's three-pronged test of  obscenity: Material must appeal to a prurient interest in sex, be patently  offensive according to contemporary community standards, and must lack  redeeming artistic, scientific or political value.  </P> <P> "The jury has made its decision. We accept it," said Frank Prouty, assistant  city prosecutor.  </P> <P> During closing arguments, Prouty told jury members it was up to them to decide  the artistic merit of the photographs.  </P> <P> "Are these Van Goghs, these five pictures?," he asked.  </P> <P> Prouty told the jury to judge what they considered to be art using contemporary  community standards, not the standards of art experts who testified for the  defense.  </P> <P> Prouty recited the fable of the vain emperor who, although naked, believed he  was fully clothed because his subjects praised his imaginary clothing.  </P> <P> "The art world wants to tell you these are art. And the townspeople sat there  and watched the emperor walk down the street without any clothes on, but yet  all his advisers told him 'You have a beautiful coat,' because nobody wanted to  come out and tell them that it's not art.  </P> <P> "You are the townspeople. Don't let somebody from outside come in and say it is  art. You say whether these five pictures are like the emperor without any  clothes on."  </P> <P> Sirkin, Barrie's attorney, said the five photos no doubt offended some people,  but have serious artistic merit.  </P> <P> He quoted from a speech by John F. Kennedy:  </P> <P> "Society must set the artist free to follow his vision, wherever it takes him.  We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda. It is a form of  truth. The highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist, is to remain  true to himself."  </P> <P> "That's exactly what Dennis Barrie did," Sirkin said. "He wanted to share with  this community a beauty that he felt was shown by an artist, Mr. Mapplethorpe."  </P> <P> Sirkin reminded jurors that the same exhibit was shown in Philadelphia, Chicago  and Berkeley without incident.  </P> <P> "Is Cincinnati that different? Are we that childish? Are we not big enough to  say we can't accept what other cities have seen?" Sirkin asked.  </P> <P> Defense experts have testified that Mapplethorpe was an accomplished and  respected photographer, and that photographs of the children were morally and  sexually innocent. Mapplethorpe died last year of AIDS at age 42.  </P> <P> The exhibit drew 81,000 people during its seven-week run last spring, an  attendance record for an art exhibit in Cincinnati. It closed Friday in Boston,  where 103,000 tickets were sold.  </P> <P> Attorney Marc Mezibov, representing the gallery, said the state failed to prove  its case. No presentation was made to back up the assertion that the  photographs were not legitimate art.  </P> <P> "Have you thought why it is that no one for the state of Ohio came in and  testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic value? Don't you think that  if there were people out there who thought that, the state of Ohio would have  found them?" Mezibov asked.  </P></p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / MEPs vote for tobacco advertising ban THE European Parliament voted yesterday to back a Commission proposal to ban all tobacco advertising, except at the point of sale, reports David Gardner from Strasbourg. It was passed in spite of intense lobbying by the tobacco industry to water down the measure. The proposal will now go before a meeting of EC health ministers in May, where it has still to overcome a blocking minority of member states formed by the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. This minority was weakened when Denmark recently changed its position. The ban was backed by 150 out of 285 Euro-MPs who voted, with 123 against and 12 abstentions. The Commission's support centred on the majority of the socialist group, the largest bloc in Strasbourg, backed by MEPs from the Greens, Gaullists, and the group made up largely of the former Italian Communist Party. Christian Democrats, Tory MEPs, and German Social Democrats voted against the ban. The latter argued that it was contradictory to prohibit advertising of a legal product. The MEPs voted through a series of amendments which in general would stiffen the Commission proposal by allowing member states to take even tougher action, and by tightly circumscribing any possibility of getting round the directive by resorting to indirect advertising. As often occurs in the European Parliament, a potentially contradictory amendment - put on the agenda by the UK Conservative group - also got through. This would allow all advertising except where public health is at risk.</p>

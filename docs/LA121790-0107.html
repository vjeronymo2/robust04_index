			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY CARDS PUT EXTRA EMPHASIS ON PEACE  </P> <P> With thousands of soldiers encamped in the deserts of the Middle East, peace on  Earth may be too much to wish for this holiday season, but there's good reason  to expect peace in your mailbox.  </P> <P> Greeting card industry officials and analysts say holiday cards bearing peace  wishes will sell briskly this holiday season, reflecting consumer concerns  about the state of the world and events in the Persian Gulf in particular.  </P> <P> And although the sputtering economy is expected to bring a not-so-merry  Christmas for the nation's big retailers, sales of greeting cards should buck  that trend, industry analysts said.  </P> <P> "When times are tough, people cut back on buying expensive gifts and buy more  expensive cards," said analyst Kendrick Noble at Paine Webber Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> The Greeting Card Assn., an industry group based in Washington, estimates that  2.3 billion cards will be purchased this holiday season, up from 2.2 billion in  1989.  </P> <P> But for the full year, consumers will spend $4.6 billion on 7.3 billion  greeting cards, up nearly 10% from $4.2 billion last year, the association  projects.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a pretty tough Christmas," said Kevin Moore at Ohio Co. "But  on the other hand, greeting cards are a lower-priced kind of purchase and  generally more of an impulse purchase."  </P> <P> Nancy Riviere, a spokeswoman for the trade group, said card sales overall have  grown steadily for years. They totaled $2.1 billion in 1980, she noted.  </P> <P> Christmas is by far the leading card-sending holiday, said Riviere. Valentine's  Day and Easter are second and third, respectively, followed by Mother's Day.  </P> <P> In addition to peace theme cards, the environment is another theme likely to  dominate this season and throughout the 1990s, the experts said.  </P> <P> "There is a consumer preference for peace-themed items, such as doves, a  reflection of people's concern over the world situation," said Steve Doyle of  Hallmark Cards Inc. in Kansas City, Mo., the nation's largest greeting card  producer.  </P> <P> Riviere said many manufacturers are jumping on the environmental bandwagon by  planning cards made of recycled paper or linking their products to  environmentally friendly organizations.  </P> <P> "Retailers are being pushed by consumers to have a green ideology in all their  products," said Jody Roberts, marketing coordinator at Cleveland-based American  Greetings Inc., the No. 2 manufacturer.  </P> <P> Roberts said American Greetings plans a complete environmental line of boxed  cards for Christmas, 1991, and will introduce a line linked to the National  Wildlife Federation before Father's Day next June.  </P> <P> Other growing categories in the industry are cards that reflect changing social  realities -- "Merry Christmas, Stepfather" is one example -- and cards,  particularly those with humorous messages, designed to appeal to younger  buyers.  </P> <P> The average family sends a total of 44 Christmas cards, according to the group,  37 of them from boxed sets and seven that are purchased individually.  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 companies make greeting cards in the United States. But the three  largest generate 80% of the sales, the association estimates. Gibson Greetings  Inc., based in Cincinnati, is third behind Hallmark and American Greetings.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jergus Ferko and Viera Urbanova: "Moravcik's </F> Coalition Has Sold Out Slovakia's State Interests;  NEPSZABADSAG's Scandalous Revelation--Secret Agreement With  Hungarian Parties"]    [Text] "Moravcik's government is hanging on the string of  [ethnic Hungarian leader Miklos] Duray's pants," master of  intellect Vladimir Minac said in a recent interview for  REPUBLIKA. Many people suspected that the old man was right, and  the Slovak Heritage Foundation demanded in vain that the  coalition disclose the contents of its secret agreement with  ethnic Hungarian parties. Let the Slovak public learn what  promises had been made to Miklos Duray and Vojtech Bugar  [chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement] for  the support they give in Parliament to the fragile, actually  minority coalition that is limping on both legs. As so many  times before, the truth surfaced on the other side of the  Danube, in the Hungarian press, in which our minority  politicians tell completely different things than they say at  home, things they would never dream of telling the Slovak  public. On 14 March, the Hungarian left-wing daily NEPSZABADSAG  (the largest Hungarian daily) carried the following scandalous  information:    "According to Hungarian sources from Slovakia, Hungarian  parties really did not wish to be represented in the new  government (as they do not want to give Meciarites and  nationalists the opportunity to play the Hungarian card), but  they agreed with the other parties that their view would be  taken into account in decisionmaking, particularly on ethnic  issues. The foundations of this cooperation have been laid down  in eight points:    "As [Coexistence Deputy Chairman] Arpad Duka-Zolyomi told  our  daily, the agreement provides for the adoption of laws on the  names of communities and on the writing of family names in a  form that will be acceptable to the Hungarians. Important  points concern guarantees of community property and the transfer  of care of schools and cultural institutions to the jurisdiction  of community self-administrative bodies. It is necessary to  halt the organizing of the so-called bilingual alternative  schools in areas inhabited by ethnic Hungarians. The Hungarian  parties expect that the process of preparations for territorial  reorganization will be halted. The new government will also  prepare the signing of the European Self-Rule Charter and the  European Regional and Minority Charter. Furthermore, the  agreement concerns the establishment of minority departments at  the Ministries of Education and Culture, within the framework of  which there will be separate Hungarian sections. The  appointment of state secretaries at the aforementioned  ministries will have to be coordinated with the Hungarian  parliamentary parties. Finally, it is necessary to reconsider  the composition of local state administration bodies in the  minority regions and take into consideration special  recommendations from the Hungarian parliamentary parties."  <H5>  Behind-the-Scenes Scenario for Undermining the Constitution </H5>   The documents approved at the 8 January rally in Komarno,  which was organized by the Association of Zitny Ostrov [Rye  Island; area along the Danube in southern Slovakia inhabited by  ethnic Hungarians] Towns and Communities, in close cooperation  with representatives of the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement and Coexistence, uncovered the cards of those ethnic  politicians. They were also uncovered by a statement made by  Istvan Pasztor, mayor of Komarno and member of the Coexistence  leadership, after the rally: "If we do not succeed with this  government with our demands, we will succeed with another one!"  Even Sibyl would be pleased [as pubalished]. The Komarno  documents contain exactly what Arpad Duka-Zolyomi presents as  points of the agreement with the broad-coalition government.  The well-written scenario of the executors of Budapest's policy  in Slovakia is starting to be implemented. Cultural and school  autonomy, guaranteed by the property of communities, would lead  in the ethnically mixed regions to actual autonomy, also in view  of the electoral law, which is based on the majority principle  regarding elections to self-administrative bodies.    The position of the state-forming nation, the Slovaks, in  southern Slovakia is already alarming, starting with the  discrimination against Slovak pupils and ending with the  impossibility for Slovaks to claim their rights with city and  community councils, which are controlled by [ethnic] Hungarian  politicians. As can be seen, the Moravcik coalition's craving  for power is stronger than its responsibility for the fate of  its own nation and defense of its state interests as enshrined  in the Constitution.    The coming days, when the laws on the names of communities  and on [birth and marriage] registers and the solution to  Slovakia's territorial and administrative division will be  discussed, will show how far the present broad coalition intends  to go in its concessions to the already privileged Hungarian  minority! Above-standard rights of minorities have never  brought anything good in history.    By the way, in the last "Kroky" ["Steps"; television panel  discussion broadcast every Sunday morning], Vojtech Bugar swore  that no agreement exists between the coalition and the Hungarian  political entities. Who is actually using lies as a working  method?</p>

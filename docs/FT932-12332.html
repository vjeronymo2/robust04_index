			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Israel's plan for banking criticised A government reorganisation programme for Israel's banking system was yesterday sharply criticised by the banks and their staff, writes Judy Maltz in Jerusalem. The programme, formulated jointly by the finance ministry and central bank, calls for limiting bank holdings in non-banking enterprises and forcing the large banks to sell off their banking subsidiaries. It is expected to pass with little opposition in both the cabinet and parliament, where a consensus has emerged that the banks are too large and have disproportionate influence in the economy. Bank Leumi said the plan would cause serious damage to the Israeli banking system. 'We hope the cabinet will weigh this damage against the benefits before taking its decision,' it said. The heads of the works committees of Israel's largest banks yesterday joined their management in protesting over the programme and threatened to declare a labour dispute if it was implemented. Bank managers said while the trend in the rest of the world is toward mergers and acquisitions, the government will force them to sell off assets, making them less competitive.</p>

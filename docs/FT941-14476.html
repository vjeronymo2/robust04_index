			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Beyond the short term Sir, In your editorial, 'The case for lower rates' (January 13), you come quite close to suggesting that short-term interest rates should be cut for short-term political purposes. Surely we have moved on from all that. My understanding is that short-term rate changes are now decided predominately by the monetary authority - and a good thing too. Those decisions should be de-politicised as much as possible, although the break can never be complete. Ultimately, as your editorial rightly concludes, the answer is greater bank independence a la francaise. In the meantime, I hope that the idea of adjusting interest rates in response to political flows and eddies is buried, as it should have been long ago. David Howell, House of Commons, Westminster, London SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Arts: Low spirits on the literary front - Cinema THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS (15) Bille August THE MUSIC OF CHANCE (15) Philip Haas AUTUMN MOON Clara Law THE THIRD MAN (PG) Carol Reed What exactly is going on in the title mansion of Bille August's The House Of The Spirits? Isabel Allende's original novel was a bestselling chunk of magic realism by the niece of the junta-toppled Chilean leader Salvador Allende. Writing in a prose style breathy with mysticism, Miss Allende is to writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez what Daphne du Maurier is to Emily Bronte. Rapt, romantic, rainbow-emotioned: but somehow, in the final accounting, more Reader's Digest than real literary thing. In the infinite process of cultural bio-degradation, we now have the film, which is to the novel what Sylvie Krin is to Daphne du Maurier. In a 'nameless' South American country the years pass while passions explode and expire. Centre-screen is handsome, hardhearted Jeremy Irons, a landowner and aspiring politician who owns the 'most productive hacienda in the country' and the most baffling accent since Loyd Grossman. (Is it American? Irish? And why does he sound as if he is speaking through a set of dislodged false teeth?) Around him swirl Glenn Close, incestuous sister, Meryl Streep, telekinetic wife, and daughter Winona Ryder who, to Irons's climactic shotgun-toting fury, loves revolutionary Antonio Banderas. You can tell that this young man is a dangerous misfit. He appears to be the only person in South America speaking with a Spanish accent. As the hours and decades go by, the relationships grow ever more complicated. The seething backdrop of political change exacerbates things. Close dies, Streep dies, Irons ages; the audience ages, the script ages, the film reaches for a quietus or at least for a climax. But when the big coup finally comes and the rent-a-rebels charge across the land, our now 70-ish hero has entered his four-hours-in-the-make-up-room phase and writer-director August (late of Pelle The Conqueror and The Best Intentions) is searching frantically for a Point To All This. Of course there is none. The book's notional theme was something about the reconcilability of present-day enemies under spiritual guidance from the past. (Everyone comes back as a ghost, causing major congestion in production designer Anna Asp's lovingly detailed mansions). But the movie seems more about the revivability of three once starry acting careers, hoping to jump-start themselves with a prestige property. La Streep gets another bite at a modern literary 'classic' after the ill-fated Ironweed. La Close gets to play with La Streep, a longtime ambition according to the blurb. And Senyor Irons gets to try another way-out character part like the one that got him an Oscar in Reversal Of Fortune. But this is the worst performance of his life: caricatured in accent and appearance, undercooked in conception. In Philip Haas's The Music Of Chance the Significant Modern Novel strikes again. Another talented cast stands and delivers the dialogue, all but reading out the page numbers as they turn. Paul Auster's fiction is a question of taste: very dry, very teasing, like a piece of cheese in a mousetrap. This is the one about two itinerant gamblers (James Spader, Mandy Patinkin) who lose their all, and more, to two fey poker-playing millionaires (Charles Durning, Joel Grey). To repay Dollars 10,000 they must rebuild the castle wall their creditors have had shipped into their back garden in loose stones. Shades of Auschwitz? Vision of America as theme park cum penal colony? Ex-documentarist Haas has no particular idea and thereby hangs the problem. A movie that needs the forward thrust of a convinced and convincing metaphor is instead neutral, craftsmanlike, uncommitted: a sort of radio play with pictures. Good performances lovingly recorded - especially from Spader, greasing himself into black locks, black moustache and black-comedy New York accent  - are no substitute for a kinetic vision. The lumpy, wordy scenes sit on Auster's story and squeeze all the life out of it. Clara Law's Autumn Moon, a slow mood-piece from Hong Kong, streaks ahead of the competition this week. At last] A film-maker who understands that cinema is more than exposing strips of celluloid before grandstanding actors. Miss Law's main actors, Masatoshi Nagase and Li Piu Wai, hardly act at all. He, a young Japanese drifter in Hong Kong, is all touching, kooky quizzicality, with a haircut that looks as if it had been plugged into the same mains-socket as his ubiquitous camcorder. She, the schoolgirl who platonically befriends him, is all zonked teenage anomy mixed with bits of sly awakening. The third main character is the city itself, filmed like a giant computer circuit-board. Maze-like streets and waterways connect with sudden chunks of skyscraper; the bluish photography lends a dreamlike miasma; and occasionally God's tweezers descend, as it were, to shove in a new karmic microchip or to shuffle around the microscopic human components and their destinies. This could have been a maudlin 'meeting cute' story between two strangers each with his/her own language  - they converse in pidgin English  - and his/her own life-and-love agenda. He is seen strenuously coupling with a Japanese girlfriend; she timidly beds a self-obsessed schoolmate. But writer-director Law gives the film the larger lung power of poetic imagery. A scene of scatterbrained chat under a bridge is filmed in a mesmering lightshow of reflected ripples, mimicking the rubato of the conversation. The girl's granny keeps a fridge full of sinisterly splendid jarred vegetables, resembling the petrified forest of her own mind. And near the end a do-it-yourself firework display sizzles and flares like the character's own thoughts. If not quite a masterpiece, this is the work of a director who could clearly go on to make one. Autumn Moon is at the ICA. From there why not run to Hampstead to see The Third Man in a new print? You would arrive in the right breathless state to catch this still breathless classic. Did a British director really make this roaring rococo plaything, featuring the best lost-in-a-foreign-city atmospherics in movie history and a show-off performance (O. Welles) that never out-showoffs the direction? Carol Reed's film shows in a season of homegrown cinema at the Everyman, also including The Fallen Idol, Brief Encounter, Odd Man Out and (new print) Brighton Rock.</p>

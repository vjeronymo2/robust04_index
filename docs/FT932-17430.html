			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / BAe says it needs airfield approval BRITISH AEROSPACE has given way over its controversial plans to develop its airfield at Filton, north Bristol, as a commercial airport and conceded it should seek planning permission for change of use. A fledgling airline, Air Bristol, had hoped to fly scheduled services from Filton to European cities from late spring. Yesterday's agreement with Northavon district council, which disputed BAe's claim not to need consent, will mean a delay of several months even if the company's application is successful. It could be much longer if the scheme goes to a public inquiry. BAe, by claiming it did not need fresh planning consent, antagonised many residents in the area, where more than 4,000 homes have been built in the last few years in the new town of Bradley Stoke. MANCHESTER Airport yesterday picked the site for its second runway, opting for a line parallel and to the south of its existing runway, but beginning half-way along and intruding into the Cheshire green belt. The runway would enable the airport to expand to 30m passengers a year from its present level of about 13m.</p>

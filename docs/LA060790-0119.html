			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATIC TICKET HAS A NORTHERN CAST;  </P> <P> ELECTION: FEINSTEIN IS FIRST NON-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN TO WIN MAJOR PARTY  NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR SINCE 1966.  </P> <P> The overriding axiom of California politics since a massive shift of power in  the 1960s has been that the votes and money -- and therefore successful  candidates -- lie south of the Tehachapi Mountains.  </P> <P> But look what happened in Tuesday's primary election: Democrats nominated  almost a solid slate of northerners for statewide office.  </P> <P> Leading the Democratic ticket is former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein,  the first Northern Californian to win a major party nomination for governor in  24 years, since Democrat Edmund G. (Pat) Brown was chosen to run for a third  term against Republican Ronald Reagan in 1966 and lost. In addition to the  other northerners who won contested nominations Tuesday for statewide office,  Bill Honig of San Francisco, was elected outright to a third term as the  nonpartisan state superintendent of public instruction.  </P> <P> While the Republican slate in the Nov. 6 general election reflects growing  areas of GOP strength, particularly in Orange and San Diego counties, that  party's ticket also includes a northerner, incumbent state Treasurer Thomas W.  Hayes of Sacramento.  </P> <P> The Reagan sweep of 1966, coupled with court-ordered reapportionment that ended  northern and rural control of the state Legislature, turned traditional  California politics on its ear. Since then, southerners have dominated  statewide races. It has almost been a political rule of thumb that, all other  things being equal, a Southern California candidate will defeat a northerner.  </P> <P> But that political axiom proved untrue Tuesday. The northern wins captured the  attention and imagination of California political experts. But generally they  suggested the northern success was due to coincidence and the peculiar nature  of each contest rather than any geographic flexing of political muscle.  </P> <P> One historian, however, said there was significance to the regional victories.  Kevin Starr said the outcome reflected a trend toward the economic and  political unification of urban Northern and Southern California.  </P> <P> "It's a wonderful shift, a very important shift," said Starr, a Bay-Area  resident who commutes regularly to a teaching job at USC.  </P> <P> Increasingly linked by transportation and communication, the San Francisco-Los  Angeles-San Diego corridor is emerging as "a city called California," Starr  observed. As old jealousies and points of pride blur, Southern Californians can  be comfortable voting for northerners, he added. Northern Californians are  recognizing the south as a dynamic world capital to which they are inextricably  linked.  </P> <P> If elected, Feinstein also would be the first California chief executive to  jump directly from local government into the state's top elective office since  Republican James Rolph Jr. was elected governor in 1930 while serving as San  Francisco mayor. Her opponent in the Nov. 6 general election, Republican U.S.  Sen. Pete Wilson, also is a former mayor -- of San Diego -- and would be the  first governor from that city in modern times.  </P> <P> Back in 1974, Pat Brown's son Jerry came along to win the governorship back for  Democrats, but by eschewing his San Francisco-Sacramento roots and consciously  choosing Los Angeles as his political power base, first winning election to the  Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> Today, as Feinstein goes against Wilson, she heads a ticket dominated by  Northern Californians, including Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy; Arlo Smith, the San  Francisco district attorney who was an upset winner over Los Angeles County  Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, and state Sen. John Garamendi of Walnut Grove, who  defeated Southerners Bill Press and Conway Collis for the nomination to be the  state's first elected insurance commissioner.  </P> <P> The Republican slate more closely reflects the growing GOP power base in  Southern California, although Wilson served in the capital as a member of the  state Assembly in the 1970s, and Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach, the party's  nominee for lieutenant governor, is an incumbent state senator who is respected  by the Sacramento Establishment.  </P> <P> As for the Democrats, the only explanation political experts could give was  that it was the strength of the candidate and the nature of the campaign that  counted.  </P> <P> Reiner was far better known than Smith, his San Francisco counterpart, going  into their contest but was plagued by far higher negative views among those  familiar with his controversial career. The underdog Smith campaigned  tirelessly throughout Southern California while Reiner made only token campaign  forays into the North.  </P> <P> Feinstein ran as a candidate who could rise above geographic differences and  bring disparate parts of California together. "Nobody thought I would get a  plurality of votes in Southern California, but I did," she told a San Francisco  news conference Wednesday. "Our destinies are intertwined."  </P> <P> But even with the success of all the candidates from the north, the fact  remains, that "it would be fantasy to think that a Northern Californian could  win without Southern California money," said Robert Forsyth, an aide to Senate  President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). "The money is still in the  Los Angeles area."  </P></p>

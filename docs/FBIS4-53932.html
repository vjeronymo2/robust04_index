			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Choe Tu-sam in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Western and business sources in Beijing said on 22  May that the 105-storey Yugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, which had  been left unfinished, has been slowly leaning to one side since  the early nineties due to inadequate foundation groundwork.    Therefore, the North Korean authorities recently invited  Chinese civil engineering and construction experts to find out  ways to make the hotel stand straight. The five-man Chinese  team stayed in Pyongyang for a week and studied the building  extensively. The team returned to China after saying that "we  have no technology to make the building stand straight."    A source says: No information is available on which  direction the building is leaning. However, given various  circumstances, the building does not seem to have tilted to the  extent easily recognizable to the naked eye.    A business source in Beijing says: The Yugyong Hotel is  leaning because of inadequate foundation work. As a result, it  is difficult to install elevators and other high-technology  equipment in the hotel. And, it is difficult to find foreign  companies that do interior work. This has been cautiously said  for a long time in business circles.    A diplomatic source says: North Korea had made every effort  to build the hotel since the mid-eighties. It even mobilized  soldiers. It managed to finish the foundation, structure, and  brick work. However, when a French joint-venture company  withdrew from the construction work, North Korea tried to have a  Hong Kong company finish the construction, but failed to reach  an agreement with the company on the interior work. As a  result, the construction work has stopped, and the hotel has  been left unfinished. North Korea failed to reach agreement  with the Hong Kong company because the payment conditions for  the $500 million-worth interior work were not good and because  North Korea did not accept the Hong Kong company's demand that  after the hotel construction is finished it be allowed to  participate in the hotel management by directly controlling and  supervising 200 of its employees.    However, business circles think that there will be many  difficult technical in addition to monetary problems. It is  also speculated that there are many difficulties North Korean  technology cannot resolve, including supplying water to the  105-storey building and making the top stories of the building  flexible enough to withstand typhoons. It is also speculated  that the French company left and a Hong Kong company refused to  do the interior work not because of the financial problems but  because of difficulties to do the interior work due to the  shoddy workmanship of the structure.    North Korea has tried hard to build this hotel to display  the  honor of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il and give boundless pride  to its people. North Korea can neither dismantle the hotel nor  proceed with the construction. As a result, the hotel now seems  to be a skeletal "ghost house" that typifies the North Korean  economic reality.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin held  a news conference for Russian and foreign journalists at the  foreign ministry's press center. The conference was devoted to  the Partnership for Peace program and Russia's participation in  it. This is part of what the deputy minister said:    [Begin Churkin recording] For us, the issue is whether the  Partnership for Peace program fits our own ideas and our own  concept of pan-European partnership. I'd like to recap on the  two possibly fundamental elements of our idea of pan-European  partnership.    First, development of Euro-Atlantic interaction through the  transformation of the CSCE into an effective pan-regional  political organization, and the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council into a structure for military-political cooperation that  is independent but closely linked to the CSCE. The aim is to  coordinate the efforts of NATO, the European Union, Council of  Europe, West European Union and CIS towards strengthening  stability and security, peacekeeping and protection of national  minorities' rights in Europe. Second, growth of cooperation  under North Atlantic Cooperation Council auspices, enlisting the  neutral states of Europe, including to put into effect the  Partnership for Peace program, on the basis of equal rights and  conversion of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council into an  independent body with a small secretariat.    The North Atlantic Cooperation Council could become a pan-  European laboratory for peacekeeping, greater military openness,  and conversion of military industries.    I wish to point out that our concept is broader. In our  view, and this is explained by our positive opinion of the idea  behind Partnership for Peace, it fits fairly well into our own  Russian concept of how pan-European partnership should develop  and in which directions the process to strengthen European  security should move.    What isn't the Partnership for Peace program? It is not a  new international treaty imposing new obligations on its  members. When Russia joins the program, it will not be  accepting any new legal obligations in respect of NATO, just as  NATO will not be taking on any new obligations in respect of  Russia. Therefore, the question sometimes asked of whether this  will drag us into something we don't want can be very simply  answered: since there are no obligations we cannot be pulled  into anything against our will.</p>

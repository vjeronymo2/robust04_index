			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: New drugs lobby fights for reforms PHARMACEUTICAL Partners for Better Healthcare, the organisation that commissioned the NERA survey, is a group of 40 of the largest pharmaceutical companies from around the developed world. They have come together to lobby for reform of national health systems because of their fears that pressures on health budgets are undermining their businesses. In many countries, short-term measures to cut health spending have included restrictions on prescribing branded pharmaceuticals and the use of new and expensive treatments. Helping countries with structural reform of their health services appears to be the best way for the drugs companies to fight such restrictions and ensure a healthy market for pharmaceuticals in the future. As Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of Pharmaceutical Partners, puts it: 'We see our customers in difficulty and we want to help them get into shape.' Pharmaceutical Partners is anxious to avoid the charge that it is a short-term response to developments such as President Bill Clinton's health reforms and budget cuts in Germany. The NERA survey was commissioned in April 1992, before Mr Clinton had won the presidential nomination.</p>

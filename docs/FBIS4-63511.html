			<p>BFN     [Text] "During the talks with the Ukrainian leadership we  want to prove that we do not violate the Ukrainian  constitution," leader of the Russia bloc faction in the Crimean  parliament, Chairman of the Commission on State, Legislation and  Law Sergey Nikulin told INTERFAX-Ukraine on Sunday [22 May].    Nikulin is a member of the Crimean parliamentary delegation  which is expected to meet the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet  delegation in Kiev on Tuesday in order to discuss the present  situation.    "I do not think that the talks can fail. We have not only  political goals. We want the Ukrainian people to see what in  fact is happening in Crimea," Nikulin pointed out.    He repeated that the Crimean parliament would not annul its  law on restoration of the constitutional basis of the Crimean  statehood adopted on 20 May 1994.    This law by the Crimean parliament re-established the  Crimean  Constitution of 6 May 1992. In accordance with this version of  the Constitution, relations between Ukraine and Crimea must be  based on treaties and agreements and Crimean inhabitants have  the right for dual citizenship.    Nikulin stressed that the Russia bloc stood for a union on  the treaty basis both with Ukraine and Russia. "We have never  wanted to withdraw Crimea from Ukraine. I hope this issue will  not be raised," he added.    However, he emphasized that the issue on a new state status  of Crimea could be considered if Ukraine made life of Crimeans  within the composition of Ukraine unbearable.    On possible reunification of Crimea with Russia, Nikulin  said  there was no such purpose as a state reunification. However, he  admitted that certain Crimean parliamentarians spoke in favor of  this. He said that the Crimean parliament would be satisfied  with the maximum of economic and cultural rights within the  composition of Ukraine.    Nikulin confirmed that the Crimean parliament had no claims  to the Ukrainian troops on Crimean territory since the troops  had the right to be stationed in Crimea. He added that certain  statements on the part of some Crimean politicians were just  their point of view.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Manchester buses to be privatised GM BUSES, the biggest of the seven English metropolitan passenger transport companies formed in 1986 as part of bus deregulation, is to be split into two businesses, each of which will be sold. The company is owned by 10 local authorities through the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority and covers a conurbation of about 2.5m people with a fleet of more than 1,600 buses. Annual revenue exceeds Pounds 110m. The split and sale is one of the biggest bus privatisations attempted so far and will attract interest because of the planned privatisation of London Buses' 10 operating subsidiaries later this year. GM Buses says it has about 70 competitors in Greater Manchester. After mergers and takeovers involving other bus companies, it is the UK's fourth largest bus company outside London. One GM business will have more than 900 buses and its routes are expected to bring in an operating revenue of about Pounds 60m a year. The other business will have 700 buses and should earn about Pounds 50m annually.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Trade union leaders meet to discuss German EU presidency Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Dieter Schulte, the new chairman of the German trade union federation, met yesterday with other European trade union leaders to discuss Germany's forthcoming presidency of the European Union, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. Mr Kohl promised that plans for EU-wide works' councils in multi-national companies would be a priority, along with measures to fight unemployment and promote faster growth. The union leaders called for promotion of further measures on social protection, including for part-time workers, and to ensure that trade liberalisation was accompanied by provisions for better social standards in low-wage cost countries. The unions are concerned at Bonn's stress on deregulation and greater flexibility in labour markets as a principal way of creating jobs.</p>

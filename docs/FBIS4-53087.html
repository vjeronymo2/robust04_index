			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Three key government panels  will form a joint conference to press the government to come up  with an overall administrative reform plan that is vital to  change the taxation system, sources close to the panels said  Monday [16 May].    The joint conference plan was agreed by the chairmen of the  Tax Commission, the Economic Deliberation Council -- both  advisory panels to the prime minister -- and the Fiscal System  Council, an advisory body to the finance minister.    The conference, made up of 10 members sent by the panels,  will study such issues as the scrapping and reorganization of  government ministries and agencies and the further privatisation  of public organizations.    It will present a concrete administrative reform plan to  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata by early June, the sources said.    They said panel leaders agreed that if they leave the  long-proposed administrative reforms up to bureaucrats, the plan  may lack substance. The leaders believe that the reforms should  be carried out with the government taking the initiative, the  sources added.    At present, Japan faces the needs to change its taxation  system in order to implement income tax cuts designed to  stimulate the flagging economy, the sources said.    Also, to cope with the rapid greying of the Japanese  society,  it is necessary to change the taxation system to secure funds to  implement welfare programs for senior citizens, they added.    The panels have urged the government to promote  across-the-board discussions between panels responsible for  different fields, such as the economy and spending for social  security and defense programs.</p>

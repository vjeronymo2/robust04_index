			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Stock exchange calls for regulator SIR ANDREW Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, has called for the creation of a single enforcement agency with the power to bring criminal and civil charges in cases of market manipulation. In the exchange's report for the year ended March 31 this year Sir Andrew said that amid growing public concern about market manipulation 'it is not widely recognised how limited are the exchange's powers nor how much valuable work we do to monitor and detect irregularities.' Sir Andrew's call comes just weeks after the City's chief watchdog, the Securities and Investments Board, issued a review of its own powers. It concluded that such an enforcement body, with a greatly increased surveillance capacity, may be necessary. The exchange and the SIB have both called for the creation of a surveillance mechanism which would allow regulators to track all equity-related transactions, including those in underlying derivative instruments which are now not captured by enforcement authorities. Sir Andrew said in the annual report: 'Unless market regulators have access to all this information their chances of detecting clever financial crooks will diminish.' On other matters Sir Andrew said the Stock Exchange intended to spend about Pounds 40m over the next two and a half years to build a successor to the outdated SEAQ price display system. The exchange has already spent about Pounds 7.5m in planning the system, which had been the subject of opposition from some members who favoured asking the US-based National Association of Securities Dealers to build a system for it. Some members had suggested that the exchange's inability to make its Taurus paperless settlement system work raised questions about its ability to build a cost-effective successor to SEAQ. Sir Andrew said IBM Consulting had been retained to act as an independent monitor of progress on the project in an effort to avoid the pitfalls of Taurus. The annual report noted that the exchange suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11.9m for the year which ended in March, against a profit of Pounds 1.5m the year before, as it absorbed the costs of closing down its Taurus paperless settlement project. Sir Andrew pointed to a reduction in the exchange's operating costs and said: 'We dont regard ourselves as being judged by the amount of money we make.' He said the current year's earnings should see a substantial improvement. The annual report says the exchange's review of its Yellow Book, its rules governing the admission of securities, would be published this summer and there would be an interval of at least two months before the new rules came into effect. It says 112 companies were suspended and there were 134 cancellations of listing during the year, mainly at the request of the companies involved. During the year the exchange's market supervision department conducted more than 295 investigations into possible breaches of trading and reporting rules and 10 cases were referred to disciplinary panels.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL MISSES DEADLINE FOR BALLOT ARGUMENTS  </P> <P> The Lawndale City Council missed the city clerk's Wednesday deadline for filing  ballot arguments on four city measures to be decided by voters in November.  </P> <P> Because they missed the cutoff date, council members will not be able to  present their views on the measures, which they placed on the Nov. 7 ballot  earlier this month.  </P> <P> On Aug. 3, the council voted unanimously to put on the ballot three measures  designed to clear up confusion over the validity of the city's General Plan.  They approved, 4 to 1, a fourth measure, which would allow the city to accept  large federal or state grants to finance public projects without voter  approval. Councilman Harold E. Hofmann opposed that measure.  </P> <P> At Thursday's council meeting, Councilwoman Carol Norman said she is  disappointed that council members will not have an opportunity to write ballot  arguments on their measures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Thought Council Had Time  </P> <P> Norman said that because items relating to the measures were on Thursday's  agenda, she had assumed the council still had time to draft its arguments for  the ballot. She said she went out of town for the weekend without opening a  letter notifying her of the deadline.  </P> <P> In spite of Norman's comments, City Clerk Neil K. Roth would not budge from the  deadline. He said he had posted it at City Hall and sent notification letters  to the homes of the five council members on Aug. 10 "as a courtesy." "Everyone  had an equal opportunity to respond," he said during a break in Thursday's  meeting.  </P> <P> City Atty. David J. Aleshire acknowledged that setting the deadline is entirely  up to Roth. It is "completely within the discretion of the city clerk," he  said.  </P> <P> Aleshire will write an impartial analysis of each of the measures, and  opposition arguments have been filed against the measures, including one  co-authored by Hofmann.  </P> <P> At the council meeting, developer Jonathan Stein objected loudly to Roth's  deadline. He said he heads a 488-member homeowner group that "had no idea the  election deadline had come and gone. The election is not until November."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Example of Arrogance'  </P> <P> Stein called Roth's holding to the deadline "another example of the arrogance  and insensitivity of city government" and said the council should order the  city attorney to draft a resolution extending the deadline.  </P> <P> Nancy J. Marthens, however, said that she and other residents made it their  business to find out when the deadline for the ballot statements were, and to  meet it. "If you are interested in these things you can respond (on time)," she  said.  </P> <P> And Hofmann commented that since deadlines were set, "we have to live with  them." Hofmann, acting as a private citizen, co-signed with four other  residents the argument against the financing measure. He said he did not sign  as a councilman because, under state law, this would have precluded other  residents from submitting arguments on the same side.  </P> <P> Activists Marthens, Herman Weinstein, Virginia Rhodes and Steve Mino joined  Hofmann in the argument against the financing measure. Marthens, Weinstein,  Rhodes and Mino also opposed the three General Plan measures.  </P> <P> The financing measure would allow the city to take advantage of federal or  other outside funding to build public facilities costing more than $1 million.  A 1987 initiative, enacted by a 3-1 margin, requires the city to obtain voter  approval for public projects costing more than $1 million. The proposed measure  would allow the city to exceed that figure as long as the amount in excess of  $1 million comes from outside sources.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attempt to Resolve Confusion  </P> <P> The other three measures attempt to resolve confusion over Ordinance 82 and the  city's General Plan.  </P> <P> Ordinance 82, a successful 1963 initiative, required the city to obtain voter  approval for the General Plan. The ordinance was deemed unconstitutional in a  1974 state attorney general's opinion, so the council adopted the plan in 1976  without a citywide vote.  </P> <P> Last December, the attorney general's office reviewed the case and found the  1974 opinion erroneous, throwing the legality of the city's General Plan into  question.  </P> <P> One of the measures on the ballot would repeal Ordinance 82; another would  amend it to include major amendments to the General Plan, and a third asks  voters to decide whether to approve the 1976 General Plan.  </P></p>

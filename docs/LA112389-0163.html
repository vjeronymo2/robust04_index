			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: A DOG FOR DAD? ASK HIM FIRST  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My father, who's 75, always wanted a pet, but my mother was  allergic so they never had one during their marriage. Unfortunately, my mother  died six months ago, and my father is having a difficult time adjusting. My  husband and I are wondering about buying him a dog. Is this a good idea?  </P> <P>  -- B.L.  </P> <P> DEAR B.L.: It might be great, but I certainly wouldn't do anything until you've  talked it over with him first. It's important to find out if he can have a pet  where he lives and also to consider if he's able to give an animal the care and  attention it needs.  </P> <P> Having a dog is a responsibility, as well as a joy. Just as with humans, it  takes time for relationships to build. Puppies always need to be housebroken.  Even well-trained, older dogs may make mistakes for the first night or two  while getting adjusted to a new person and a new home.  </P> <P> If your father is able to walk the dog, this would probably be good for him, as  well as for the animal. It would get him out of the house and give him a new  interest. You might want to think about getting an older dog, one who's gentle  and trained and one whose disposition and temperament would blend well with  your father.  </P> <P> Studies show that good pets help to alleviate loneliness, and stroking pets can  lower the blood pressure. If your father is contemplating a move, however, it  might be better to wait until he's settled.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I think my 34-year-old son is making a terrible mistake, but  there's not much use of my talking to him because he never listens to his  father. He's about to pass up a promotion in order to have more time to stay at  home with his two children. He tells me this isn't as unusual as it was in my  day. It seems absurd to me. This isn't a man's role. He has a wife, and even  though she works, it seems to me he's trying to do her job.  </P> <P>  -- L.C.  </P> <P> DEAR L.C.: Your son is correct when he reports that more and more young fathers  are choosing to be good fathers first and are placing their families ahead of  their jobs. Many of these men do this because they feel they didn't get to see  enough of their own fathers in their childhood and are determined to be closer  to their children than their fathers were to them.  </P> <P> There's no question about it, we're living through a social revolution when it  comes to sex roles. Men used to define themselves and their role in society as  the breadwinner, but men are no longer the only breadwinners. Many children are  being raised in two-career families, such as your son's, and when this is the  case, both partners frequently find themselves making some sacrifices in  furthering their careers in order to be better parents.  </P></p>

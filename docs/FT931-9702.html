			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / American Palestinian released by Israel ISRAEL yesterday released without charge an American Palestinian after complaints from Washington over his arrest with two other US citizens, whom the authorities originally accused of being agents of the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement in the occupied territories. Mr Mohamed Hajjaj, a US citizen resident in the West Bank, was set free more than two weeks after he was detained, as police decided there was no evidence against him to back an indictment. The US twice protested to the Israeli authorities over the treatment of Mr Hajjaj and two other US citizens from Chicago, Mr Mohamed Salah and Mr Mohamed Jarad. They were arrested amid allegations by Israel that much of the organisation of Hamas had been switched from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the US. The allegations were made as Israel faced widespread international condemnation over its expulsion of 400 alleged Hamas activists to Lebanon. The US was concerned that the three men had been publicly accused by Israel of involvement in Hamas, including ferrying funds to its activists and helping it reorganise following the deportations, without any formal charges being laid against them. It also complained over the conditions of their detention. Mr Salah and Mr Jarad are still under arrest but have not been charged. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday discussed the Palestine deportees question with Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli prime minister, and urged further measures to expedite their return, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. However, Mr Peres told reporters later that the meeting had not constituted a negotiation. He dismissed the prospect of sanctions against Israel by the UN security council, which the Arab states are demanding.</p>

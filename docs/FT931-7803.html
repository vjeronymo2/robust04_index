			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Russian traders beat a path to China's door - Rapid growth in business seen VALERA, the fast-talking Russian trader, had no doubt he was on to a good thing as he supervised the packing of colourful children's pullovers for shipment to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. 'This is a hard business, but it's a good business,' he declared. 'Believe me, I've been everywhere - Turkey, eastern Europe, Pakistan - but China is the best.' Valera is typical of thousands of east European traders who are streaming to China to buy inexpensive garments to sell in the markets of Moscow and Warsaw, and other former east bloc cities where there is a shortage of affordable clothing. Figures for this informal trade - dubbed as the new Silk Road - do not show up in official Sino-Russian trade statistics but its value is estimated to run into tens of millions of dollars annually. The rapid growth of this relatively small scale trade - entrepreneurs buy as little as a few thousand dollars worth of items - coincides with an explosion in more formal two-way business between China and the Russian Federation, much of it concentrated in the border regions. According to Chinese and Russian customs statistics, border trade grew from Dollars 88m in 1987, the year that most restrictions were lifted on cross-boundary commerce, to Dollars 2bn in 1992. Total Sino-Russian trade last year reached Dollars 6bn with the balance slightly in favour of the Russian side, due in part to arms transfers worth about Dollars 1.5bn. A Russian official in Beijing said that the flow of goods across Russia's 7,400-long border with China's Heilongjiang province in the east, and the Xinjiang region in the west was fast becoming the most important component of trade between the two countries. Border trade doubled last year to Dollars 2bn compared with the year before, and it shows little sign of slackening. Much of the trade is conducted by barter and is denominated in Swiss francs. It includes minerals, buildings materials and machinery from the Russian side, in exchange for Chinese food, clothes and electronics. Joint ventures involving Russian and Chinese entrepreneurs are also becoming a feature of commerce on the frontier. At last count, some 200 Sino-Russian ventures had been initiated, most of them small enterprises such as hotels and restaurants. Another sign of burgeoning trade links, especially in the border areas, lay in the surge in visitors passing back and forth. In 1992, 700,000 passed through the 20 frontier posts, gates, including the seven established last year. While a number of these visitors were tourists, most had come to do business. In all, about 1m Russians - including the hundreds of Russian garment traders flying into Beijing each week on Aeroflot charters - visited China last year, an increase of approximately 50 per cent on the year before. Barriers to even brisker activity on the Sino-Russian frontier include extremely poor communications - telephone calls are still routed through Beijing and Moscow - and the paucity of railway lines in one of the world's most inhospitable regions. The absence of bridges across the Amur river, which delineates the Sino-Russian border in the east, also hinders transportation. Booming Sino-Russian trade is, as might be expected, causing security problems for the two sides. Chinese border police reported 3,000 arrests along the frontier in 1992, most for smuggling offences. There are also indications that the Russian 'mafia' may have begun to collaborate with organised crime in China. Formal links between the Russians and Chinese have flourished since the lifting of a two-decade freeze in the 1960s and 1970s. Apart from 40 or so representative offices of state organisations perhaps several dozen private companies have recently opened their doors. But it is on the streets of the capital that the Russians are most visible, especially in the street market that runs along the western flank of Ritan park, near the city's diplomatic quarter. There, mainly Russian guoji dao ye, a slightly derogatory Chinese reference to 'international pedlars', spend their days haggling over women's angora sweaters, padded jackets and other textile items. Business is conducted strictly in dollars. Despite the rapid growth in contacts and business dealings, both sides appear as untrusting and suspicious of each other's activities as their predecessors were during the heyday centuries ago of the Silk Road between China and Europe.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Official rouble rate drops The Russian central bank bowed to pressure from the market yesterday and lowered the value of its fixed 'market rate' for the rouble from 90 to 100 to the dollar, Reuter reports from Moscow. The so-called market rate is used for some compulsory currency exchange by firms earning hard currency. It has changed three times this year. Black market dealers are offering up to 125 roubles per dollar. Companies paid an average of 160.4 roubles per dollar on Tuesday in small-scale trading sessions organised by the central bank.</p>

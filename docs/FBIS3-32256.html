			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 3 Feb (AFP) -- The four-day-old  strike of cargo transportation vehicles in Guatemala ended today  after the government accepted all of the demands of businessmen  and pledged in writing to respect them, a transportation  association official has reported.    The National Transportation Coordinating Board (CNT)  announced it ordered all of its members to suspend the strike  "immediately" because President Ramiro de Leon Carpio gave a  "favorable" response to all of their demands. The resolution to  the conflict came at a time when the supply of fuel at gas  stations was beginning to run out and officials feared the  nation would become paralyzed within the next 48 hours.    According to a CNT communique, telephone conversations were  maintained "until the predawn hours" with President de Leon, who  finally accepted the increase in rates and other demands made by  transportation workers. The president had threatened to  intervene and cancel current concessions with the striking  businesses, transferring them to other enterprises.  Nevertheless, De Leon ultimately yielded to the pressure of  transportation businessmen.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korupayeva under the "Edict Adopted. </F> What Now?" rubric: "Will We Be Able To Halt the Crime Wave?"]    [Text] The Russian Federation president's edict "On Urgent  Measures To Protect the Population from Banditry and Other  Manifestations of Organized Crime" came into force yesterday.  We continue the discussion of the merits and shortcomings of  this document.    ...On 13 May this year, in the village of Slobodka in Moscow  Oblast's Klinskiy Rayon, staffers of the regional administration  for combating organized crime "took" an armed gang. The  criminals had brutally killed Militia Captain A. Grushevskiy.  But first they had tortured him: There were 21 knife wounds on  the captain's body, and they had drowned and burned him.... For  what? They had demanded that he cooperate with an organized  criminal grouping.    It is said that when they "took" the criminals, the  residents  of Klin yelled: "Kill them!" But not a mark was left on the  bandits' corpulent bodies, so professionally were they detained.    Unfair? Yes. But staffers of law enforcement organs are not  bandits.... The "work" methods (forgive the comparison) are  different. One group has the law at their disposal, albeit a  bad law, while the others are bloody inhuman people. Human life  is nothing to them. It is against them that the Russian  president's edict "On Urgent Measures To Protect the Population  from Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime" must  work.    Militia Colonel General Mikhail Yegorov, Russian Federation  first deputy minister of internal affairs and chief of the  Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs Main Organized  Crime Administration, has expressed his position on the edict's  application.    In his opinion, the rejection of this edict by many  officials  and politicians is attributable to the fact that they themselves  are businessmen and it is not to their advantage for law  enforcement organs to gain access to commercial information or,  more importantly, to be able to follow the tortuous paths along  which their money proceeds.    As M. Yegorov pointed out, today there are more than 200  well  organized and armed-to-the-teeth criminal groupings operating in  Moscow alone.    Every month criminal groupings in Russia commit  1,500 crimes. More than 700 firearms are regularly confiscated  from them, as well as material assets and money to the value of  over 5 billion rubles. Every month.    Over the past 18 months alone proceedings have been  instituted in 46 criminal cases connected with contract  killings, which today have become the most effective means of  eliminating the "enemy."    Corruption and organized crime in close tandem have  penetrated all spheres of state management.    During 1993 alone the militia got rid of over 500  operational  workers who had cooperated (sold operational information!) with  criminal groupings. There were also ones who "did" "wet" jobs  together with bandits. Criminal proceedings were instituted  against them, and they were dismissed from internal affairs  organs. Several high-ranking officials were arrested in  Vladimir Oblast, in Komi....    An analysis of the courts' verdicts in such a category of  criminal cases as bribes is interesting. Last year 843  officials were convicted of this.    Roughly the same verdicts are passed for illegal gun  running.  Just 19 percent of criminals convicted under Article 218 of the  Russian Federation Criminal Code are in jail. And the rest?  Some are dead, some are far distant....    But the ones who really are "far distant" today are the  leaders of criminal groupings released on bail [pod zalog] from  Moscow Oblast courtrooms. Seventeen thugs safe and sound!    The dynamics of the growth in people released on bail  [zalozhniki] is staggering. On 23 June 1991 there were two of  them in Moscow. There were five on the same day in 1992, 16 in  1993, and 118 in 1994. This in Moscow alone!    According to recent data obtained from foreign law  enforcement organs, 24 Russian criminal groupings are working in  the United States and have a connection with the Cosa Nostra,  and six go to Italy. Some 100 criminal groupings are oriented  toward other distant foreign countries, and 200 toward nearby  foreign countries (the former USSR republics).</p>

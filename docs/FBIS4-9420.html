			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 25 (AFP) -- Albania's last communist  president, Ramiz Alia, and nine other former top officials are  to be tried next month for abuses of power under the country's  former hardline regime, a prosecutor's spokesman said here  Monday. Alia, 67, and other senior officials are to be charged  with numerous abuses, including ordering summary executions,  deportations, and compulsory atheism, the spokesman for the  Tirana prosecutor told AFP.    Appearing alongside the former communist number one will be  ex- interior ministers Adil Carcani, Simon Stefani and Hekuran  Isia, former Politburo members Manush Myftiu and Rita Marko, and  former top secret police and judicial officials, the spokesman  said. Their trial will start at the beginning of May. If  convicted, they face up to 25 years in prison.    The charges against Alia and his henchmen allege their  responsibility for the actions of the Sigurimi, the regime's  secret police. The charges cite the deportation of thousands of  people, the summary execution of 22 people accused of  involvement in the 1951 bombing of Tirana's Soviet embassy, and  the banning in 1967 of all forms of religious activity in  Albania, the spokesman said.    According to the Albanian association of deportees and  former  political prisoners, almost 60,000 people were deported or  imprisoned during the regime in place between 1945 and 1991.  One of the group's leaders, Kurt Kola, said an estimated  700,000 citizens suffered varying degrees of persecution during  that period, while the ex-political prisoners' Liria newspaper  added that almost 6,000 people were executed.    Six other top officials, including former ideology chief  Foto  Cami, were sentenced on similar charges in February to between  five and eight years in jail. Last year Nexhmije Hoxha, the  72-year-old widow of Enver Hoxha, the founder and long-time  Stalinist dictator of the post-war regime, was sentenced to 11  years for embezzling state funds.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible military source at the Defense  Ministry has stated the following:    As the masses of our Yemeni people were rejoicing at the  announcement issued by the joint meeting of the presidential  council, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the  Council of Ministers to consider the day of the blessed 'Id  al-Adha, the fourth national anniversary of the restoration of  unity and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen, and the  days that follows [21-23 May] as days for peace during which  military operations against the rebellious secessionist gang in  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership will be suspended in  honor and appreciation of both the meaning of these two  occasions and the sanctity of religious rituals and also in  response to the calls by the unionists and a number of Arab  leaders to give a new opportunity to the misled and helpless  ones to return to the path of justice, unity, democracy, and  constitutional legitimacy and to declare their rejection and  confrontation of the secessionist conspiracy; and as our valiant  Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, were abiding  by both that announcement and the instructions of the higher  political and military commands to suspend all military acts,  they were surprised by the flagrant hostile escalation by the  forces of rebellion and secession, who opened fire with a  variety of weapons and launched air raids in criminal acts  coordinated with the treacherous, invalid crime of secession  only two hours after the chance for peace was announced.    This prompted all Armed Forces units to implement what was  stipulated in the announcement -- that military breaches by the  gang of rebellion and secession will be replied to. They took  measures to confront these hostile acts, thus the military  confrontation continued even after the last veil fell off the  faces of secessionists led by the rebellious traitor al-Bid.    The heroes in our Armed Forces' air defense units managed to  down one aircraft belonging to the gang of rebellion and  secession in Habil al-Jabr on the Lahij-Abyan axis. Our Armed  Forces units acting on that axis also seized 15 tanks, four  BM-21 Katyusha vehicles, 15 vehicles and BTR armored personnel  carriers, five fuel and water (?pickups). They also seized  warehouses containing large quantities of military ammunition  and hardware.    At dawn yesterday, and only a few hours after the futile  secessionist announcement and the emergence of the truth about  the allegations and lies of the forces of rebellion and  secession in the YSP leadership, several military brigades under  the hegemony of the secessionist gang announced they were  joining the ranks of the unity and constitutional legitimacy and  their rejection of the destructive, treacherous calls for  secession. The commander, as well as some officers, NCO's, and  soldiers from the 22d Brigade announced their rejection of the  crime of secession and that they were returning to the trench of  defending unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy.    On the Shabwah axis, the heroes of our valiant Armed Forces  were able to confront attacks by the secessionist, rebellious  forces and inflicted heavy losses on them. In the name of God,  the merciful, the compassionate: If ye will aid [the cause of]  God, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly. [koranic  verse]</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON OIL SPILL AND HIGHER GAS PRICES  </P> <P> It's incredible that the oil industry has been so irresponsible in its response  to the country's largest and most environmentally threatening tanker oil spill.  All the advertising and public relations efforts have not overcome the  industry's inability to carry out the promises that it made to assure effective  response to such events. The industry has argued that its expertise and  improvements in technology would prevent the sort of catastrophe that we saw in  Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> A nightmare seems to be passing before us, a President and secretary of  interior pushing for leasing of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (perhaps  the most sensitive ecosystem in the nation) for oil development, an industry  promising environmental protection we know is not possible, and a failure to  address energy issues in a reasonable manner.  </P> <P> The whole coastline of California is being readied for leasing for oil and gas  development. Local governments from San Diego to Mendocino have opposed  offshore leasing for reasons that have so unfortunately come to pass in Alaska.  It's time for the federal government to stop promoting oil development and  favor other conservation and alternative fuel sources.  </P> <P> BOB HARTMAN  </P> <P> Lemon Grove  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: US employee options rule to be tightened AN accounting rule change forcing companies to disclose the value of options granted to employees and subtract them from profits, has moved closer. The US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has published its exposure draft which is essentially unchanged from an earlier FASB proposal which would force companies to recognise stock options and other stock-based compensation rewards as an expense. The FASB wants comments on the draft by December 31.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Computing: Accounts an open book The best selling personal finance package these days is Quicken from the US company Intuit. On June 1, Intuit released QuickBooks 2.0 for Windows with which they hope to achieve similar domination in the small business market. QuickBooks costs Pounds 149.95 (or Pounds 157.62 inc VAT) from Intuit, including postage and packing. As with all Intuit products, telephone support is free in perpetuity. QuickBooks will print sales invoices and cheques. It will handle bills from suppliers, cheque payments and cheque receipts. Quicken can do all this too, but only when the volume of transactions is small. Intuit suggest that if you run your business and personal affairs from the one bank account, basic Quicken will suit. However, if you need to run a separate bank account for business use, you should be thinking of QuickBooks. Quicken already has a legion of followers who delight in its ease of use and slick interface. QuickBooks is even better; a superb underlying design which is overlaid with numerous ingenious touches. This is state of the art software of the highest standard and represents terrific value. QuickBooks joins two other packages which have appeared in the last two years, Mind Your Own Business from Soft Numbers and Exchequer from SBS, which belong to a new generation of accounting software. Traditional accounts packages work on a 'summarise and carry forward' basis: once a transaction has been entered on to the computer its original details are lost. By contrast, these new packages retain all transactions in full detail and from anywhere in the program a couple of keystrokes or mouse clicks can display any invoice or payment exactly as it was entered. Packages like QuickBooks 'unlock the door of your filing cabinet', giving you instant access to all your files and limitless management information. QuickBooks contains over 50 standard reports covering profit and loss statement, balance sheet, VAT analysis, aged debtor and aged creditor reports, sales analysis by customer, by item or by rep. You can customise each of them with a report-writer which I can only describe as fabulous - then use the Quickzoom feature to drill down from any report total to display the underlying transactions in full detail . . . QuickBooks is full of nice touches to make life easy for the user. For example, to amend the date just tap the + or - key to the right of the keyboard. It also analyses data 'proactively'. So, by looking at the payment due dates on your invoices it generates a 'Reminder' list of payments due as well as a cashflow forecast. Both these ideas are excellent, but unfortunately nullified by Intuit's assumption that if an invoice is on payment terms of '30 Days' this means it actually comes due for payment in 30 days. Nonetheless I like this product very much. What sort of business is it suitable for? For the service company or the company that does jobs and recharges costs to customer QuickBooks is excellent. For the business that buys things and resells them, it is less good. It holds a selling price but not a cost price for each stock item. Therefore, it can neither work out profit margins nor maintain an accurate cost of sales figure within the Profit and Loss account. MYOB has these features and more, and for the company that buys and sells things is well worth the extra money (Pounds 195 from Soft Numbers, 0992-451551). Intuit say that QuickBooks is 'designed for time-pressured business people, not trained bookkeepers. Being a Windows product, data entry is awkward and slippery compared with DOS. QuickBooks is therefore ideal for the owner-manager of a service or jobbing company who is already a keen user of products such as Excel or Ami Pro. Finally, a caution, in 20 minutes an ill-disposed person could change without trace every clients' name on every document stored in Quickbooks. I am surprised that the Institute of Chartered Accountants has approved this package. The auditing profession must consider how far accounts packages such as QuickBooks should allow you to rewrite the past.

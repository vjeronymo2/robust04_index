			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] During a budget examination on 27 April, the  Legislative Yuan froze the No. 4 nuclear power plant portion of  the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] budget due to the plant's  alteration of its generator capacity. The Legislative Yuan  Education Committee examined the AEC budget yesterday [27 April].    After completing the environmental impact appraisal of the  power plant, the Taiwan Power Company and the AEC rapidly  approved the power plant's plan to enlarge its generator  capacity by one third. The altered plan has caused concern among  many Legislative Yuan members. Some have interpellated the  event. Legislative Yuan member (Meng Chun-chu) called for  freezing the power plant's portion of the AEC budget before  completing a reappraisal of environmental impact under the new  plan. The portion totals 24 million yuan, including the power  plant's budget for reexamination of transport plan, industrial  cooperation planning, and other technological matters.</p>

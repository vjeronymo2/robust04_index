			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nabil Ghishan] </F>   [Excerpts] The government's food and medicine policy was  the main topic of the hot debate that took place at the House of  Representatives during yesterday's session. Following a lengthy  discussion, the House decided to devote its session on Wednesday  to the government's food and medicine policy. [passage omitted]    Answering a question by Deputy Bassam al-'Umush, Tourism and  Antiquities Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Affash al-'Adwan denied what  was reported by some newspapers that there are tourist  activities between Jordan and Israel in the Petra area and that  companies are arranging such matters. The minister said: These  allegations are baseless. He said that there are no contacts at  all with the Israelis in this regard and no companies are  arranging for this.    Deputy Bassam al-'Umush announced that he was not convinced  with the minister's response, particularly in light of the visit  of 83 rabbis, who desecrated the land of mobilization and  steadfastness and the soil of Jordan when they walked on the  streets of al-'Aqabah, Amman, and Petra. Al-'Umush added: They  were about to meet with a senior official, but they were kind  enough to excuse him because he was very busy. Deputy al-'Umush  said that some Jewish rabbis took part in the recent  Islamic-Christian dialogue held in Amman. [passage omitted]    Deputy al-'Umush said: We still hear every now and then  about the calls on the private sector to make investments,  particularly in Petra, because tourists are coming now secretly  with U.S. passports. He added: Tourists will come openly in the  future, particularly since the Jews are using the name Petra to  propagate tourism in the region through world media which are  under their control. We cannot accept the excuse that we  receive foreigners because they carry foreign passports. A Jew,  he said, remains a Jew regardless of his citizenship. [passage  omitted]    [Amman JORDAN TIMES in English carried in its 27-28 January  issue a 100-word front-page REUTER report which says that  "Jordanian deputies condemned 83 Jewish rabbis for visiting the  Kingdom." A statement, signed by 29 members of the House of  Representatives, says: "We, like our people, were shocked by  the rabbis' visit because it is something that was previously  not allowed and they want to make it become something normal."]</p>

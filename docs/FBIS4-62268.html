			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] A three-year program for Turkmenistan's  socioeconomic development was proposed at today's meeting of the  republican parliament in Ashgabat. Our correspondent says it  was drafted by President Niyazov. The program is entitled "10  Years of Prosperity" and contains specific presidential  proposals. These include, for example, the idea that there  should be a change in the ratio between the proportion of wages  devoted to living expenses and the proportion set aside as  savings. The leaders of contemporary Turkmenistan claim that  citizens should be able to save 30-40 percent of their income  and that all the necessary conditions have been created in the  Republic for this.</p>

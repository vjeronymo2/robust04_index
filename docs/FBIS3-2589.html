			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary on the Two Sessions" column by staff reporter </F> Ai Feng (5337 0023): "Moving Toward Maturity for Another Year  -- Written on the Eve of the Opening of the NPC and CPPCC  National Committee Sessions"]    [Text] "Here comes yet another spring verdant with  sprouting grass." This year's "two sessions" are soon to open.    The past year was the first year after the party proposed  building the socialist market economy at its 14th national  congress. Though the voyage has not been "soul-stirring," it  nevertheless followed "an uneven course." It has been a year of  moving toward maturity.    At this year's "two sessions," the deputies [to the National  People's Congress (NPC)] and members [of the national committee  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  (CPPCC) ] will deliberate and discuss the government work  report. They will naturally have a lot to say about this major  subject.  <H3>  Seize the Opportunity: A Year of Brilliant Achievements.  The "Resolution" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee Is An Important Sign of "Moving Toward  Maturity" </H3>   People probably still remember clearly, even without looking  through the old papers, that the keynote or hottest topic at  last year's "two sessions" was "to seize the opportunity and  speed up development" and "to seize the opportunity and speed up  reform." This inspiring, enthusiastic momentum was especially  keenly felt at the news briefings held in various provinces.    One year has passed. The situation and figures indicate that  the desired results were achieved.    The GDP exceeded 3 trillion yuan, up 13.4 percent over the  previous year; a bumper agricultural harvest was reaped and the  added value of agriculture grew by 4 percent, with total grain  output reaching 456.4 billion kg; the "bottleneck" industries  were strengthened, and new records were created in the  construction of new railway lines and the conversion of  single-line tracks to multiple tracks; the total retail volume  of consumer goods grew 11.6 percent over the previous year, with  price hikes factored in; and so on and so forth. In a word,  last year, China's economy carried forward the fast growth it  had experienced in 1992.    On the front of reform, the regulations on the "change of  mechanism" for state-owned enterprises were implemented; diverse  economic sectors were developed; explorations were made for the  establishment of a modern enterprise system; price reform was  deepened; and grain prices were decontrolled in more than 90  percent of all counties (cities). More importantly, proposals  for the reform of the financial and tax system, the monetary  system, the investment system, and the foreign trade system were  formulated and promulgated one after another.    What is particularly important is that the "Decision of the  CPC Central Committee on Certain Issues Concerning the  Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System," made at  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last  November showed so complete a structure, so well-defined a  framework, so original a mental approach, and such closely  combined theory and practice that it amazed people both in and  outside China. The birth of this magnificent and scientific  blueprint that maps out the reform of our country in this  century signals that our reform has smoothly reached the  critical stage of overall advance and is also the most important  indication that we have begun "moving toward maturity."    "Ah, the unique view unfolds on this side of the trail." (A  line from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1934) Today, what  people both within and outside the country can see is a  socialist China enjoying economic development, political  stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress.    Have the Chinese seized the opportunity? How was the  government work in the past year? The talks made by the  old-generation revolutionaries, such as Comrade Deng Xiaoping  and Comrade Chen Yun, just before the Spring Festival can be  seen as a positive answer to this question on behalf of the  whole nation.  <H3>  Macroregulation and Control: The Unforgettable 1993.  Deepening the Comprehensive Understanding of Socialist Market  Economy Through Practice Is Yet Another Manifestation of "Moving  Toward Maturity" </H3>   "Macroregulation and control" was probably the most  characteristic content in 1993 economic life.    When people were throwing enormous fervor into economic  development and when the planned economy was being converted to  the market economy at an accelerated pace, the inadequacy of  understanding, the lack of experience, and the limiting angles  often gave rise to some "blind spots" in people's vision.    In the context of rapid economic development, should we  guard against "overheating?" How shall we assess the messages  from the "development zone rush," the "stocks rush," and the  "real estate rush?" Is the latent deep-level danger growing?  Faced with these and other questions, for a time, people  developed differing opinions. At the end of the year before  last, the central authorities gave some warning to "prevent  overheating." Last year, at the beginning of the year and in  March and April, the central authorities issued more reminders.  But people did not quickly come to a consensus. The thought  that "if you are overheated, I am not" became an argument "not  for publication;" "I will do it my way" was interpreted as  "market behavior;" and the "uneven heat distribution" caused by  structural and inter-regional imbalance seemed to provide  "evidence" for such ideas. As proved time and again by history,  the phenomenon of "rushing headlong into action" that  overstepped the bounds of feasibility resulting from "emulation"  in "doing something good" is the most difficult to stop. People  have been too eager to speed up development.    But the most sensitive economic barometer, commodity prices,  issued a serious warning. Not only did the price of steel  products soar, the cost of living index in large cities exceeded  22 percent! Furthermore, there was serious disorder in the  monetary sector, the lifeblood of the national economy:  unchecked interbank loaning, rampant fund-raising, direct and  indirect participation of banks in speculative real estate  deals, and the excessive release of banknotes. If these  problems could not be solved in good time, major fluctuations  would be inevitable.    It was under these circumstances that the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council resolutely made the decision to  strengthen and improve macroregulation and control. After that,  the people's ideas gradually converged.    The work on macroregulation and control was naturally  difficult, but the desired results were soon achieved and what  is commonly known as a "soft landing" was realized. The  phenomenon of "issuing IOU's to purchase agricultural products,"  the solution to which had been demanded for many years, has been  greatly changed this year, winning praise.    Yet there is no need for reticence about the fact that the  effects of macroregulation and control on the economic life are  also multifaceted. The latent problems in some areas, which  were born out of "overheating" were exposed earlier than they  would have been because of the implementation of the regulation  and control measures; other parts, due to lack of experience in  controlling the strength and method of regulation and control,  felt new difficulties. "Macroregulation and control" itself,  for a time, became the most talked about and thought about issue.  <H3>  Work as One: Overall Advancement of Reform. To Give Full  Play to Our Advantages in Implementation Is an Important  Guarantee for "Moving Toward Maturity" </H3>   "Macroregulation and control" was designed not to "check and  stifle," but to "check and enliven." The new practice and new  thinking in this area have generated two achievements that are  of profound and far-reaching significance.    Achievement one: People have come to realize that the market  economy also requires macroregulation and control, which, at the  current stage in the transition, should be even strengthened;  and that today's macroregulation and control must conform to the  market economy and therefore must be improved. It is essential  to reform as well as an important element of reform.    Achievement two: Under the leadership of the central  authorities, a blueprint for realizing the socialist market  economy in China was well drawn in terms of theory and the  overall framework. In terms of concrete operations, various  reform proposals were well designed after sufficient  investigation, research, and repeated consultations and, with  the right opportunity, were promulgated in good time.    During the system changeover, what must be avoided at all  costs is the "overlapping" of two problems. What kind of  trouble will be created if enterprises that are not yet capable  of "self-restraint" and a "laissez-faire market" come together?  In the final analysis, whether we are looking at a problem  which macroregulation and control aims to solve or a difficulty  that macroregulation and control itself encounters, there are  always underlying causes in the system. That is why it is only  logical that strengthening and improving "macroregulation and  control" should lead the way in the overall deepening of reform.    There were also all kinds of comments and worries about the  various reform proposals, especially those for financial and tax  reform.    Considering the risks of the "merging of two exchange  rates,"  even foreign experts were seized with deep concern for us. In  June, the exchange rate of U.S. dollars to renminbi reached  1:12, and some people even predicted that it would go up to  1:15. Could we hold our ground? But no sooner had the  macroregulation and control measures been published than the  exchange rate started to drop. After moving on a downward curve  for some time, it rebounded. But the state exercised regulation  and control with economic means, quickly stabilized the  situation, and kept it down. Through this process, the state  even obtained more foreign exchange. Comments coming from China  and overseas said: That was a brilliant job!    The reform of the tax system is considered worldwide to be  one of the most difficult reforms. It once took the Japanese  Diet three terms to adopt a new tax regime. It has been said  that Mrs. Thatcher's stepping down was somewhat related to the  change in the tax regime. A senior U.S. official said: In the  United States, whoever does this job is probably the most  unpopular person in the entire country. This is because any  change in the tax system would touch the most extensive scope of  interests.    The current situation of China's tax system reform is  different from that in the West, but people are nevertheless  still worried that it will run into obstruction, give rise to  disputes, and cause a shock. But the actual progress that has  been made so far may well be called another "exception to the  rule." It has not only exceeded what was generally predicted  abroad, but has also been much smoother than what we ourselves  originally imagined. Judging from what happened in January this  year, the operation of the new tax system was normal. Though  there were some operational problems in the convergence of old  and new procedures, they did not have any negative impact on  production and circulation. Tax revenue in January was 61  percent higher than the same period last year. As well as being  a result of growth in production, it is also an achievement of  the new tax system. Naturally, however, this is just a  beginning.    The above facts are another proof of this truth: In  socialist China led by the communist party, as long as the  central authorities, local authorities, and the people at all  levels in the whole country work with one mind and make  concerted efforts, any difficulties on the path ahead can be  surmounted.  <H3>  Deepen Reform: The Focal Point of This Year's Work. To  Handle Well the Relationship Among Reform, Development, and  Stability Is the Key to "Moving Toward Maturity" </H3>   At the beginning of the year, the central authorities put  forward the 20-character principle, namely, "to seize the  opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote  development, and maintain stability [zhua zhu ji yu, shen hua  gai ge, kuo da kai fang, cu jin fa zhan, bao chi wen ding 2119  0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 2368 1129 7030 2397 0191 6651  4099 1455 0202 2170 4489 1353].    The forthcoming two sessions are bound to understand and  implement this principle at greater depth.    This year, when a number of major reform measures were being  promulgated at the same time, the "acceleration" had in a sense  become reality; and to implement these proposals and to carry on  with reform in greater depth and in a down-to-earth manner is  now the most important task.    Development is the last word. Development also requires a  new mental approach. In the context of rapid development, the  key to avoiding the "chronic maladies" that have easily cropped  up in past years is to introduce new mechanisms through reform  and to push forward and catalyze development with the new  mechanisms.    This might constitute the background against which last  year's "acceleration" can be converted to this year's  "deepening" and "promotion."    --How shall we continue to handle well the relationship  among  reform, development, and stability?    --How shall we continue to realize the sustained, rapid, and  healthy [chi xu, kuai su, jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256  1660] development of the national economy? How should we  interpret the word "healthy?"    --How can the stabilization of commodity prices be achieved?  How is it intrinsically related to control on the scale of  capital construction?    --How can the exploration of ways to establish a modern  enterprise system be integrated with the enhancement of the  economic efficiency of state-owned enterprises?    --How can such matters as anticorruption operation and  improvement on social security, which people are concerned with,  continue to be strengthened?    People are hoping that, at this year's two sessions, the  deputies and members will discuss these important issues from a  higher, deeper, and more comprehensive perspective and make the  corresponding decisions.    "Another year of yearning, to the twittering of the  swallows." The "two sessions," to be held in the spring season  which is full of vitality and hope, herald a still more colorful  [duo zi duo cai 1122 1217 1122 1752] future.    People believe that, on the road of China's construction of  the socialist market economy, 1994 will certainly be another  year of "moving toward maturity!"</p>

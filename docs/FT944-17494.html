			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Poseidon to re-open Gecko copper mine Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, is to recommission the Gecko copper mine at Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory, writes Nikki Tait. The mine was put on a care and maintenance basis last year because of the weak copper price. However, PosGold said yesterday that the recent improvement in metal prices meant that it had been able to forward-sell enough copper, gold and currency to ensure the mine's full operational status to June 1998, based on current reserves. Production is now due to commence in April next year, after a treatment plant upgrade.</p>

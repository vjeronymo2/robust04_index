			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Royal visit to a British corner of Spain IF EVER there was a good time to be British in Spain, it was yesterday in Seville - when the Prince and Princess of Wales arrived to celebrate British Day at Expo '92. Pipe bands and the band of the Royal Marines marched in front of a huge glass waterfall. The Royal couple walked around a yacht built by British Steel and waved to the crowd. The Red Arrows zoomed overhead but were invisible because the walkways have over-hanging shrubs to keep out the sun. Inside Britain's pavilion, which is British territory for the summer, visitors are greeted by Elizabeth, who says: 'I'll be your navigator today.' The Expo theme is Discovery. In front of a bank of about 400 screens filled with images of Britain, Elizabeth said she was going to take the visitors on a journey 'to a country you think you may know well'. But first, some questions. Did we think the British were unemotional? Did we think they loved tradition more than technology (this as the pipe band struck up again outside)? Did the British value dignity more than dynamism? In a theatre high in the steel tube and glass pavilion, an actor did an elaborate and impressive mime to sound and lights. In the often-used US portable pavilion things were hopeless. The hamburgers were cold and there were no hot dogs. One of the pavilions belongs to Cruzcampo, a local brewery owned by Guinness. The royals never made it to Cruzcampo, but the managers were hoping the Red Arrows might drop in for a pint. Unfortunately they were last seen heading south, maybe back to Gibraltar, another bit of territory owned by Britain.</p>

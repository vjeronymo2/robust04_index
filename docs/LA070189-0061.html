			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JARUZELSKI WON'T SEEK PRESIDENCY;  </P> <P> POLISH LEADER CITES UNPOPULARITY, BACKS INTERIOR MINISTER  </P> <P> Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski threw the national political situation  into deeper turmoil Friday by announcing to the Communist Party's Central  Committee that he will not run for the new office of president.  </P> <P> Declaring that he would not be an "obstacle to reconciliation," Jaruzelski  endorsed instead Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak for the post, which  will be filled by a vote of the newly elected National Assembly, expected to  meet next week.  </P> <P> The new uncertainty about Poland's leadership came little more than a week  before President Bush is scheduled to start a three-day visit July 9.  </P> <P> The Central Committee, along with Communist Party deputies in Parliament,  immediately asked Jaruzelski to reconsider his decision. But it adjourned its  lengthy meeting without deciding on an endorsement for the presidency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Linked to Martial Law  </P> <P> Jaruzelski's statement to party leaders, who have been thrown into an  unprecedented crisis by the Communists' feeble showing in last month's free  elections, took note of the widely held public view that he is the one who  should be held accountable for the imposition of martial law in 1981.  </P> <P> "I know well that public opinion associates me more often with martial law and  less often with the line of reforms -- with those so significant decisions of  the 10th plenum," he said, referring to the meeting at which various factions  of the party fought over what ultimately was a decision to re-legalize the  Solidarity trade union. "I must take into consideration social reality. . . .  </P> <P> "When there is an obstacle to reconciliation, to uniting social forces, there  is only one possible solution -- even if that obstacle is Wojciech Jaruzelski."  </P> <P> There was no indication from Jaruzelski whether his decision not to run for  head of government would affect his position as party chief.  </P> <P> As the party leader spoke, about 300 demonstrators opposing his choice as  presidential candidate were battling police, using water cannon and tear gas  just yards from the Central Committee headquarters. There were also  anti-Jaruzelski protests in Katowice in southwestern Poland and Kielce in the  south.  </P> <P> As head of the country's extensive police and security apparatus, Kiszczak is  also associated with the martial-law era. However, in his case the stigma seems  to have been erased effectively as he led the government delegation to the  so-called "round-table" negotiations with Solidarity starting last August.  </P> <P> Those talks produced the deal whereby Solidarity was once again legalized after  seven years; a new political system, including the office of president, was set  up; and the first free elections at which voters dealt the Communist Party a  firm humiliation.  </P> <P> Endorsing Kiszczak, Jaruzelski called him "a soldier, a politician, a patriot  and a man who has been close to me for many years. . . . In the eyes of  society, including opposition circles, he is rightly considered a leading  representative of the line of reconciliation."  </P> <P> Although the elections last month saw Solidarity win 99 of 100 seats in the new  Senate and all of the 161 seats it was eligible to contest in the Sejm, the  lower house of Parliament, the Communist-led coalition maintains a slim  majority in both houses, and is thus able to elect its own candidate for the  office of president.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski's declaration, however, could throw the process of reform here into  even more conflict.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support From Solidarity  </P> <P> At the end of the "round-table" talks, it was generally agreed by Solidarity  activists that Jaruzelski, the undoubted architect of the negotiations, should  hold the newly created office of president.  </P> <P> The elections, however, amounted to a cold shower for the Communist authorities  and, somewhat surprisingly, for Solidarity, which had given at least tacit  support to Communist liberals who had helped design the agreement between  Solidarity and the government. But where they had a choice or the opportunity  to cross out an unopposed Communist Party candidate's name, the voters  expressed their disapproval of the regime.  </P> <P> Solidarity's senators and Sejm members are scheduled to meet today to decide on  a policy in the apparent Central Committee impasse, and activists said that  Kiszczak is an acceptable party candidate.  </P> <P> However, the party's reluctance to immediately accept Jaruzelski's withdrawal  -- and his endorsement of Kiszczak -- suggested the possibility of a hard-line  backlash that could threaten the Solidarity-backed power-sharing arrangement,  which for the last year has depended on having the liberal wing of the  Communist Party as a negotiating partner.  </P> <P> The issue is of major significance not only in Poland but in Eastern Europe,  where Communist regimes have been given a fearful lesson in electoral politics,  suggesting that even so-called "liberals" in the Communist Party have little  hope of winning approval in free elections.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Impact on Bush Visit  </P> <P> Party spokesman Jan Bisztyiga said at a news conference that the Central  Committee, and Jaruzelski, would make a final decision over the weekend after  consulting the Communist-allied Democratic and Peasant parties.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, commenting on the situation  aboard Air Force One while en route with Bush to Maine, told reporters, "All we  can say at this point is that we don't expect that to disrupt the President's  trip." He said that Bush "will be happy to meet with whoever the new leadership  is."  </P></p>

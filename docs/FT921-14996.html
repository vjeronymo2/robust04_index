			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / US Money and Credit: Economists debate cutting long bonds CAN the US government save hundreds of millions of dollars on its interest bill by refinancing the deficit at shorter maturities and, in the process, stimulate the economy by bringing down mortgage rates? This question, first asked last month by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury secretary, has sparked a lively debate among bond market economists in the past few weeks. Mr Brady posed the question because he has been dismayed by the stubbornness of long-term interest rates, which have refused to decline as sharply as short-term rates, in spite of the aggressive easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Long-term rates have remained high - the spread between the yield on short- and long-term securities is currently more than 300 basis points  - primarily because demand for longer-dated securities has dwindled as overseas investors, especially the Japanese, have stayed away from the market or invested in other, higher-yielding sovereign debt. High long-term rates has led many to ask why the government should be paying 7.5 per cent interest on its debt when it could be paying 4 per cent or 5 per cent. Although there have been radical calls for a complete phasing out of the long bond, if there were change it would probably involve reducing the supply of longer-dated securities. The theory behind such a move is simple. If less long-term securities are issued, prices rise and long-term yields fall. This would stimulate the economy, because long-term yields are used to calculate most US mortgage rates, and a reduction in mortgage rates would free up extra income that could be spent on goods and services. Reducing the issue of long-term debt means having to increase supply at the short end, which pushes up short-term interest rates. But the rise in yields at the short end of the market would not be as pronounced as at the long end, and the Federal Reserve could always cut the discount rate to force short rates lower if they went too high. Opponents of reducing the supply of bonds warn serious debt-management problems could arise if maturities are shortened. They say the Treasury would have to roll over the Federal debt more often, and that the debt would be exposed to fluctuations in short-term rates. The core of their case is that the Treasury's management of the country's debt should not involve interest rate speculation. If the economy were to recover strongly, and push up inflation, the government could have to roll over matured short-term debt at much higher rates. While the two sides have battled it out, an intriguing solution has come from Mr Donald Coxe, an economist in New York with Gordon Capital. Mr Coxe, who for six years helped the Canadian health minister manage Canada's huge social security pension fund, says the answer lies in the enormous buying power of the US Social Security Trust Fund (SSTF). The SSTF, which owns a quarter of the US national debt, is the world's largest pension fund. It has always invested US taxpayers' social security payments in US government securities right across the maturity range, from monthly bills to 30-year bonds, buying them from the Federal Reserve at auction, and occasionally in the open market. Mr Coxe believes the fund should stop investing in short-term securities. Instead, the Fed should announce that in future all 10-, 20- and 30-year government bonds will be sold direct to the SSTF. This would lead to a big drop in long-term yields, and quickly bring down mortgage rates. It would not affect the duration of the government debt. Moreover, the interests of the taxpayers who contribute to the fund would be better served because a shift away from lower yielding short-term securities to higher yielding bonds would improve the return on the fund's portfolio. Mr Coxe's scheme would not be without its losers, the biggest being Wall Street's dealing firms, whose commissions would plummet if the SSTF bought all the supply of new bonds direct from the Treasury. But, as Mr Coxe asks: 'Why should a commission be paid unnecessarily on a sale to a government trust fund?' Close observers of the Treasury believe the most likely outcome of the debate will be a modest reduction in the issue of long-term bonds. Expect the next quarterly refunding, due in early February, to include Dollars 2bn to Dollars 4bn fewer 10-year and 30-year bonds than in the previous round, and more bills and notes.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Last   1 week   4 wks   12-month  12-month                             Friday    ago     ago      High       Low Fed Funds (weekly average)   3.63    3.75    4.00     11.00      2.00 Three-month Treasury bills   3.90    3.93    4.24      8.29      3.76 Six-month Treasury bills     4.00    4.00    4.32      7.70      3.95 Three-month prime CDs        4.07    4.12    4.55      7.17      4.07 30-day Commercial Paper      4.00    4.20    4.85      7.12      4.00 90-day Commercial Paper      3.97    4.10    4.60      7.02      3.97  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Last    Change            1 week     4 wk.

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities digest conflicting data Wall Street With bonds holding steady yesterday amid conflicting economic signals, US stocks finished in an even draw between advancing and declining issues, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.78 lower at 3,661.47, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 0.20 to 446.18. The American SE composite edged 0.97 ahead to 438.29, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.67 to 727.98. The Federal Reserve's eagerly awaited data on capacity utilisation proved to be an anti-climax, and that was good news for stocks. The country's factories, mines and utilities operated at 83.6 per cent of capacity last month. The slight gain was a little less than economists had forecast. It was a signal to the bond market that its worst fears about growing inflationary pressures in the economy were unsupported. The news undercut speculation this week that the Federal Reserve was about to lift interest rates again. But the pervading bearishness of the fixed-income markets, and a University of Michigan survey showing improved consumer sentiment this month, mitigated any impulse to bid up bond prices. Treasuries held close to their opening values. The Dow industrials quickly added 15 points, then fell back to five better, holding that level for the rest of the morning. The ride grew more bumpy in the afternoon. Yesterday was a 'double-witching' session, in which options on individual issues and stock indices expired. Reinvestment activity brought some volatility late in the day, and helped lift NYSE volume to 310m shares. Among individual issues, strong crude-oil prices for a second day running boosted energy stocks. Chevron climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 91 7/8 , Mobil Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 78 3/4 and Phillips Dollars 2 to Dollars 31 3/4 . Digital Equipment was down Dollars 6 or about 20 per cent at Dollars 22 7/8 . The stock was battered when the company surprised investors by posting a net loss of Dollars 1.34 a share and announcing plans to cut 7,000 jobs. Elsewhere in the technology sector, Motorola shed a further Dollars 2 to Dollars 89 1/2 after posting disappointing results earlier in the week. On the Nasdaq, Wellfleet Communications jumped Dollars 5 to Dollars 70 1/4 . The computer-equipment supplier revealed that its third-quarter earnings had doubled and declared a two-for-one stock split. Canada Toronto stocks closed lower as precious and base metals shares losses weighed heavily on rebounding forestry stocks. But some market watchers believe that an upward swing is a strong possibility next week. The TSE 300 composite index lost 14.90 points to 4239.95 in trade of 64.07m shares valued at CDollars 675m. Technical analyst Ron Meisels, president of P&amp;C Holdings, said the low volume and almost equal advancing and declining volumes of this week's sell-off augur well for a firmer future. Brazil Sao Paulo was down 4.1 per cent in moderate trade ahead of Monday's options settlement. The Bovespa index was off 628 at 14,434 points. Turnover was Crz238.6bn (Dollars 215.9m).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson  Mandela has received a tumultuous welcome in Bophuthatswana. It  was his first visit to Bophuthatswana since the violent clashes  and looting there last week, as well as his first ever visit to  the capital Mmabatho. Caro Kriel reports that if the ANC leader  had any doubts about his popularity in Bophuthatswana they would  have been dispelled by the huge and enthusiastic turnout of his  supporters.    [Begin recording] [Kriel] Mr. Mandela chose the Independence  Stadium in Mmabatho for his historic first rally in  Bophuthatswana, a stadium built for the now ousted Bop  [Bophuthatswana] leader, Mr. Lucas Mangope. Today it belonged to  Mr. Mandela.    [Mandela] My mere presence here is proof that in  Bophuthatswana there is now free political activity in this area.    [Kriel] Mr. Mandela praised the people (?who ousted) Mr.  Mangope, but condemned those who took part in looting sprees  last week.    [Mandela] That is not how decent people behave. That is the  behavior of animals.    [Kriel] But he also slammed the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement].    [Mandela] It is a lesson they will never forget. They were  chased out and humiliated. That is what is going to happen in  future.    [Kriel] Earlier, Mr. Mandela visited the family of a woman  who was allegedly killed by the AWB. He also spent time at the  home of a woman whose husband died in the violence. Mr. Mandela  said he wanted to come to Bophuthatswana to speak to the people  and find out for himself what had happened. Mr. Mandela was  well received wherever he went, telling this crowd of civil  servants what they wanted to hear.    [Mandela] You are all going to get your pensions. All of you  are going to get your jobs without exception.    [Kriel] Pensions, jobs, and similar problems are now in the  hands of Bop's two coadministrators. Mr. Mandela met interim  administrator, Mr. Tjaart van der Walt, and with him Mr. Job  Mokgoro. At parliament today where a defiant Mr. Mangope said  he was going to have a cabinet meeting, the only sign of him was  a statue. The doors of parliament were locked and guarded by  SADF [South African Defense Force] troops. [end recording]</p>

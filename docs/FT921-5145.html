			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / King George's victory is spoilt: Bush ponders how to crush rival's challenge AFTER another Pyrrhic victory in the latest primaries, President George Bush's campaign managers are wondering what they can do to crush the right-wing challenge to his re-election prospects and stop the damage it is inflicting on him. Once again Mr Bush won every state primary and caucus he contested on Tuesday, beating Mr Pat Buchanan, the conservative television commentator, by margins ranging from 28 to 40 percentage points. But once again he proved unable to defeat his ebullient and acerbic critic soundly enough to stem the impression that he, and not Mr Buchanan, was the real loser. In Georgia, where Mr Buchanan had concentrated his campaign, the right-wing challenger got 36 per cent of the vote to Mr Bush's 64 per cent, almost matching his 37 per cent tally a fortnight ago in New Hampshire that launched his rebellion against the president and the Republican party leadership. But in Maryland and Colorado, where he hardly campaigned, he still won 30 per cent of the votes. Exit polls showed that 40 per cent of Mr Buchanan's voters would vote for a Democratic candidate against Mr Bush in the November 3 presidential election. Mr Buchanan's insurgency has so far inflicted only flesh wounds on the president. Mr Bush is still well on course to win the Republican primaries or caucuses in every single state, so assuring himself of his party's nomination by an overwhelming margin. To suppose Mr Bush would be shamed by the consistent 30 per cent vote against him into pulling out of the race is almost certainly to under-estimate his tenacity in clinging to office. Mr Buchanan acknowledges that he needs a real win, somewhere, to sustain his campaign. 'We've got to start moving those levels of support up. But I think one breakthrough and that big hollow army of King George, as we call it, could crumble and virtually disappear,' he said yesterday. But the repeated embarrassment will not only open up Mr Bush's flank to the eventual Democratic candidate in November but also strain the unhappy coalition of social conservatives, ideological free marketeers and mainstream moderates who make up the Republican party. Mr Bush's leadership of this coalition has been called into question by his apparent lack of commitment to any of the ideals that inspire the Republican rank and file. The lack of commitment that rankles most is his failure to live up to his 1988 campaign pledge: 'Read my lips - no new taxes.' The president has for the first time admitted that breaking this pledge, in his 1990 budget agreement with the Democratic-dominated Congress, was a mistake. Until now, he had defended the budget agreement as a necessary compromise, in which he was forced to accept higher taxes in return for tight caps on government spending. 'Frankly, the president tore himself apart by signing the tax bill in 1990. I'm glad to see that he's slowly, grudgingly beginning to accept the fact that maybe it was not a good idea,' said Congressman Newt Gingrich, one of the leaders of the right wing of the Republican party. Mr Gingrich remains committed to Mr Bush's re-election, but shows no signs of enthusiasm for the prospect. Like many Reagan Republicans, he longs for someone to carry on the revolution led by President Ronald Reagan. 'While he was a great cultural visionary leader, he didn't complete the job. And then Bush, frankly, has not been able to figure out how to execute it,' he complained yesterday. Mr Bush's confession of error on the tax bill could, his advisers hope, open the way for a fresh start, enabling him once again to position himself against a Democratic challenger as the best defence against more tax increases. In the process, it could win back the right-wingers who are now deserting him. But neither the administration nor the Bush campaign organisation give the impression of a team rejuvenated; instead, there is a palpable air of fatigue that Mr Buchanan's sustained sniping can only aggravate.</p>

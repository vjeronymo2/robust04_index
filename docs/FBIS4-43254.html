			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> Roberto Gervaso; place and date not given: "Silvio Has the  Television Channels, I Have the Streets" -- first four  paragraphs are L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] Milan -- He feels more of a leader than ever, and if  anyone questions his charisma, he adopts a crusading attitude.  A Godfrey of Bouillon, as well as an Albert of Guissano  [medieval crusaders], to whom God has entrusted the mission of  destroying Fortress Italia and of subjugating the Saladin  Berlusconi without placing him in chains.    The two allies spy on one another, neither trusting the  other  sufficiently. The two allies are strong as long as they remain  united (between themselves and with [National Alliance leader]  Fini), but are less united than they should be and than the  voters would like.    If Berlusconi goads him, [League Secretary] Bossi replies by  calling him the "Kaiser," the "Fuehrer," the would-be tyrant,  the cynical "foundry boss": It is a difficult marriage but one  that is destined to last. Otherwise, it means an early election  and political upheavals, with imponderable consequences or,  worse, a swing toward authoritarianism.    May God help us. And may God help Umberto [Bossi] and Silvio  [Berlusconi], the founder of the League and of Forza Italia  respectively.    [Gervaso] What will happen to the League in the European  elections?    [Bossi] It will hold its ground. In fact, it will gain a few  points.    [Gervaso] And what will happen to the government, after  that?    [Bossi] Nothing.    [Gervaso] What do you mean, nothing?    [Bossi] The European elections have nothing to do with the  Italian Government or with Italian domestic politics.    [Gervaso] Do you mean that there are no strong feelings  about  the elections?    [Bossi] Certainly not on the part of the nationalist and  leftist parties.    [Gervaso] Does Berlusconi not feel strongly about them  either?    [Bossi] As far as Berlusconi is concerned, Europe is a huge  market with no regulations and with no legislative parliament.  All that concerns him is financial strength.    [Gervaso] Why do you take issue so strongly with the prime  minister?    [Bossi] Who said I do?    [Gervaso] You mean you do not know?    [Bossi] I am simply asserting my identity and that of the  League within the Freedom Alliance, which, as you know, was  launched by my movement.    [Gervaso] Why do you say that Berlusconi represents "the  old,  the oldest of the old"?    [Bossi] That is not exactly what I am saying. I am saying  that Berlusconi is the last link in a transformation which was  set in motion when we, we of the League, prevented the election  of members of the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani] group to the  presidency.    [Gervaso] Which members?    [Bossi] Forlani and Andreotti. Their fall marked the fall of  Craxi as well.    [Gervaso] What do you envy about the prime minister?    [Bossi] Nothing. I know no envy, just as I know no rancor or  hatred. Berlusconi is certainly a man of great tactical skills.    [Gervaso] But does he know anything about politics?    [Bossi] Enough. He is not unprepared.    [Gervaso] What about him do you not envy?    [Bossi] His desire to be first.    [Gervaso] Why: Do you not have that desire?    [Bossi] It is not so important. You see, there are moments  in history when destiny, through its often inscrutable designs,  places you at the center of historic changes.    [Gervaso] That is determinism.    [Bossi] Not necessarily. I wanted to be a doctor, and  instead, here I am, leading the League.    [Gervaso] Are you more afraid of Berlusconi or is Berlusconi  more afraid of you?    [Bossi] I am not afraid of Berlusconi or of anyone else. I  merely note that he has so many television channels and so many  newspapers with which he attacks me and deals me devastating  blows.    [Gervaso] I would not say so.    [Bossi] He does, he does. With a great deal of skill.    [Gervaso] In that case you should be afraid of Berlusconi.    [Bossi] I have the League and its formidable organization:  They are enough for me. He has the television channels; I have  the streets.    [Gervaso] Are you happier to shake hands with Berlusconi or  with Fini?    [Bossi] I do shake hands with Fini.    [Gervaso] And what about Berlusconi?    [Bossi] He prefers to embrace you.    [Gervaso] What kind of an embrace? A deadly one?    [Bossi] I am a prey with talons, that will not allow  himself to be torn apart.    [Gervaso] If Berlusconi is a Kaiser, what is Fini?    [Bossi] I do not know what he is. What I do know is that at  the moment he is ambiguous.    [Gervaso] Why, ambiguous?    [Bossi] Because he needs to be legitimized by Berlusconi.    [Gervaso] Does that need influence him?    [Bossi] Yes, but I do not know how much.    [Gervaso] Do you get along better with Forza Italia's leader  or with Fini?    [Bossi] Better with Fini. Perhaps because he knows that  sooner or later he will merge with Berlusconi.    [Gervaso] What is the best thing about Forza Italia?    [Bossi] There was a vacuum in politics, and Berlusconi  filled  it. It is thanks to him that we joined the government.    [Gervaso] The worst thing?    [Bossi] His materialism. I repeat: He is the last link in a  chain of transformation which is functioning as an inhibitor.    [Gervaso] Why?    [Bossi] Because there is no politics without ideals.    [Gervaso] How can you forget that Berlusconi prevented a  victory by the Left by entering the arena?    [Bossi] But he also tried to recycle the DC [Christian  Democratic Party] and the Socialists.    [Gervaso] What is the best aspect of the National Alliance?    [Bossi] Its rational tendency, which coincides more or less  with Fini, who nevertheless has to be legitimized by Berlusconi  and who thus risks becoming ensnared.    [Gervaso] What is the worst thing about the National  Alliance?    [Bossi] Its banners, its backward-looking tendencies, and  its  past, which oblige Fini to make certain concessions and to grant  some institutional influence to the old and hard-line wing of  the MSI [Italian Social Movement].    [Gervaso] In which party are there the most dilettantes?    [Bossi] Definitely in Forza Italia -- the party of the  toupees and the great vested interests, which has opted for the  politics of so-called ordinary society: a disguise for a  philosophical plan of transformation. Do you know what the  trouble is?    [Gervaso] What is it?    [Bossi] That those who vote for Berlusconi do not realize  it.    [Gervaso] I do not understand.    [Bossi] The idea of a chaste and pure society set against  always corrupt politics is a false one.    [Gervaso] Which party has the most professionals?    [Bossi] The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], because it  is  an old party with an apparatus, a bureaucracy, a school, and  internal homogeneity. The opposite of Forza Italia -- a very  flexible movement, a factory-party which raises the issue of  democracy.    [Gervaso] Why?    [Bossi] Because it is an autocratic movement in which there  are no elections, but appointments -- from the top.    [Gervaso] In which party do you have most friends?    [Bossi] When I come to think about it, in none. Perhaps  because the political scene now is in a constant state of  turmoil and evolution.    [Gervaso] And in which party do you have most enemies?    [Bossi] At the personal level, in Forza Italia.    [Gervaso] And at the political level?    [Bossi] In none, because everyone acknowledges that the  League caused the walls and roofs of the old edifice of power to  totter and fall.    [Gervaso] In which party do you have most accomplices, most  Trojan horses?    [Bossi] In Forza Italia, I think. Let us hope that the  opposite is not true.    [Gervaso] Is there fascism only on the Right?    [Bossi] Fascism in what sense?    [Gervaso] In terms of intolerance.    [Bossi] It exists on the far Right and it exists on the far  Left. The fascists and Communist Renewal are angry people,  active only in word, but subordinate in deed. The former to the  National Alliance, and the latter to the PDS.    [Gervaso] Is there antifascism only on the Left?    [Bossi] No. Look at the League: It is the most antifascist  party. It is no coincidence that both right-wing and the  left-wing extremists take issue with us. If I appear in public  they both give me the bird.    [Gervaso] What if Berlusconi appears in public?    [Bossi] Only the die-hard communists give him the bird.    [Gervaso] Who are the League's supporters?    [Bossi] Those who believe that through active commitment it  is possible to change Italy; to resolve its political, economic,  and social problems; and to impart a new boost to its great  social and individual principles.    [Gervaso] How many tendencies are there within the League  now?    [Bossi] Two. The tendency of those who want change, the  regeneration of the state; and the tendency of those who want to  bring it down or replace it. But the latter are in a minority.    [Gervaso] Who is more loyal to the League: You or [former  League ideologue] Miglio?    [Bossi] Miglio, the advocate of a strong and presidentialist  state, has no background as a federalist.    [Gervaso] Is the League's former ideologue a separatist, a  traitor, or a suicidal?    [Bossi] Those words are too strong. In 1992 I included him  on our lists to attract the moderate voters, who could thus vote  for a university teacher.    [Gervaso] But is he or is he not a politician?    [Bossi] He is a political scientist, that is, someone who  interprets politics after the event. If you give him the  steering wheel he will skid at the first bend and go off the  road.    [Gervaso] But you could have granted him a ministry.    [Bossi] Neither Berlusconi nor Fini would do so.    [Gervaso] How did he react?    [Bossi] He blamed me. He insulted me over the telephone --  this very telephone -- for a quarter of an hour.    [Gervaso] What did you do?    [Bossi] I let him speak, then eventually I blurted out: "I'm  sorry that at the age of 80 you need a ministry in order to  prove yourself."    [Gervaso] Who within the League would like to stab you in  the  back?    [Bossi] Let us hope that it happens soon so that I can  occupy  myself with the things I would like.    [Gervaso] What, for instance?    [Bossi] To preside over the Foreign Affairs Committee.    [Gervaso] Who are the complainers within the League?    [Bossi] Some people complain about the various regional  secretaries. The League's two tendencies -- federalist and  separatist -- can also give rise to ill feelings and polemics.  But all this does not affect our essential compactness.    [Gervaso] Is it easier for an elephant's trunk to pass  through the eye of a needle or for a southerner to become a  League supporter?    [Bossi] Look, a large number of southerners have joined the  League. The federalist wing has made a breakthrough everywhere  -- from Lambrate to Capo Passero.    [Gervaso] Does federalism remain your obsession?    [Bossi] It is the cornerstone of the League, the single  target, on which the great change depends.    [Gervaso] Is the League now more of a bulldozer or a cement  mixer?    [Bossi] A cement mixer, but if necessary, a bulldozer too.    [Gervaso] Could the League ever do without you?    [Bossi] The League has battled, is still battling, and will  continue to battle. I am a fighter, capable of shooting in all  directions.    [Gervaso] Could you ever do without the League?    [Bossi] I could. At congresses I do not concern myself with  factions, large or small. I will continue along the path I have  chosen, always prepared to relinquish my post and always willing  to continue.    [Gervaso] In what circumstances would you leave the League?    [Bossi] You cannot join or leave the League just as you  please. You join because other people want you there, and you  leave for the same reason. I am the instrument of the cause to  restore constitutional state.    [Gervaso] On the subject of comings and goings, will  Scalfaro  leave the presidency?    [Bossi] Definitely.    [Gervaso] When?    [Bossi] Berlusconi would say, "Once the new Constitution has  been drawn up and once presidentialism has been introduced."    [Gervaso] When will that be?    [Bossi] Let us say, in a couple of years' time.    [Gervaso] How can [former Senate Speaker] Spadolini be  compensated?    [Bossi] Time moves on, and he has had his time. I realize  that the state and the Republic were his life, his family, but  now he must understand. Politics is merciless to everyone.    [Gervaso] Is [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio a good choice, or  would Speroni have been better?    [Bossi] Speroni is a formula one racer; Scognamiglio is a  luxury car.    [Gervaso] Is [Chamber of Deputies speaker] Irene Pivetti the  guardian of the institutions or guardian of the Church?    [Bossi] She considers herself to be invested of an authority  that comes directly from God, to whom she has devoted her term  of office.    [Gervaso] Do you have any advice to give to [Pact for Italy  leader] Segni?    [Bossi] If he opts for values, let him approach the League.  If he prefers conservation, then let him approach Forza Italia.    [Gervaso] Any advice for Formigoni [Italian Popular Party,  PPI]?    [Bossi] He has already taken advice from Berlusconi, and he  has become his fifth column.    [Gervaso] Any for Buttiglione [PPI]?    [Bossi] To develop some autonomy.    [Gervaso] Are you disturbed more by Rosa Russo Jervolino or  by Rosy Bindi [PPI]?    [Bossi] I am not disturbed; they may be disturbing.    [Gervaso] What if you had to choose?    [Bossi] I would not choose. I can only say that Rosa is a  well-rounded and fulfilled lady; Rosy is more combative and  therefore politically more interesting.    [Gervaso] Do you trust Occhetto or D'Alema [PDS] more?    [Bossi] Occhetto. He is better balanced, more intelligent  and human. D'Alema is a rather serrated knife edge. He is  sharper than Occhetto, and the voters and grassroots would be  unlikely to forgive him any mistakes.    [Gervaso] Are you not flirting rather too much with the PDS?    [Bossi] I never flirt with the PDS, which wants a League,  within the Freedom Alliance, subordinate to Berlusconism, which  has nothing to say to us and nothing to give us.    [Gervaso] But as you yourself have said, you would not have  joined the government without Berlusconi.    [Bossi] But we would have had the same number of  parliamentarians elected.    [Gervaso] Why have the chairmanships of so many Senate  committees been granted to members of the progressive forces?    [Bossi] Because of lack of expertise, or perhaps because of  the excessive power of the Forza Italia and National Alliance  leadership group. Those two parties' conservatives have failed  to realize that permanent committees are needed in order to  govern.    [Gervaso] What about the watchdog committees?    [Bossi] In a democracy they belong to the opposition. In  other words, there should have been negotiations.    [Bossi] Is there any ministry that you would have liked but  did not secure?    [Bossi] Perhaps the Education Ministry. Be that as it may,  we wanted ministries in order to plan the country's future, and  we got them.    [Gervaso] Are you hungry for the prime ministership?    [Bossi] Berlusconi is fine, for the present.    [Gervaso] Will this government live long?    [Bossi] Probably.    [Gervaso] Months or years?    [Bossi] Years.    [Gervaso] Who could shorten its life?    [Bossi] Any ally that considered that the time had come for  a  show of strength and another election.    [Gervaso] Which grouping would gain most votes from another  election?    [Bossi] None. It would be chaos.    [Gervaso] Are you sure that the corruption investigations  were a sham?    [Bossi] Not merely a sham. At the beginning they were a  mechanism of restoration. After the League brought down the old  regime, the judiciary attacked their former "masters," by then  reduced to zombies.    [Gervaso] Why do you insinuate that [Judge] Di Pietro  conducted a political trial of the League?    [Bossi] Because he did so. When he questioned me he asked me  if we wanted to split the country. In any case, what does the  League have to do with Bribe City?    [Gervaso] Does the RAI [Italian Public Broadcasting  Corporation] need to be cleansed or purged?    [Bossi] I was the first, a year ago, to talk about purges,  albeit in a provocative manner. The fact is that there must be  a review of the entire radio and television system, both public  and private. Both the RAI and Fininvest must be deprived of  some channels.    [Gervaso] Which is your dominant trait -- the eye of a hawk,  the dogged determination of a bulldog, or the cunning of a fox?    [Bossi] I am a hawk who keeps his aggression under control.    [Gervaso] Do you feel more like a native of Brianza or a  providential leader?    [Bossi] I would never have aspired to become leader of the  League. It was events that obliged me to do it.    [Gervaso] Is yours still hard?    [Bossi] Tougher than ever. But my inner core is still  intact.    [Gervaso] What does your core have to do with it?    [Bossi] I do not suffer from priapism.    [Gervaso] Whose is hardest: yours, Berlusconi's, or Fini's?    [Bossi] Are you kidding? Mine is by far the hardest.</p>

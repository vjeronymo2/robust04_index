			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Yelenskyy, Kiev: "The Crusaders: </F> Ukrainian Churches and Great Politics!"]    [Text] A Group Portrait of the old parliament would be  incomplete without a tall white cowl of the then-Metropolitan of  Vinnytsya and Bratslav Ahafanhel, that formed a nice contrast to  the grey suits in the halls of parliament. Deputy Savin (as he  was known in lay life) was always polite and courteous, voted  but, it seems, never once gave a speech. His calling allowed him  to talk only from the pulpit, but everybody was aware that the  church had a presence in the parliament.    There are no clergymen among the deputies now. But the  church  was much more active in the March elections than four years ago.  And if there are no vestments in the new parliament it does not  mean that the devotees of the cult--so to say--have given up  politics and limited themselves solely to communicating with  God. On the contrary, the social profile of the church activists  is on the increase. One does not have to go far to see the  vehemence with which the Catholic Church is attempting to  `theocratize' Poland. We see the confluence of church and state  in Ukraine and attempts at indirect influence. Having recovered  from repressive state control, Church activists quickly captured  the trust of a people devastated by atheism. The confusion of  the post-perestroika years has been replaced by awareness of  their political interests and might, and the utility of front  men.    Article 5 of the Public Laws of Ukraine on "Freedom of  Conscience and Religious Organizations" states quite clearly  that churches cannot "advance candidates for elections to  governing bodies, nor promote or finance election campaigns."  But such paper barriers obviously are not enough to control the  ambitions and interests of church leaders vis-a-vis lay matters.  As Post-Postup predicted a last spring, all Ukrainian churches  were active in the elections. Since more elections are scheduled  this year, we can prophesize that this activity was just the  beginning.    The Ukrainian Autocephalic Orthodox Church (UAOC) publicized  its elections credo in spring of 1993. The UAOC called its  adherents to vote for believing christians to repel atheists who  lack "any moral credentials." But the heavens seemed to favor  the latter in elections. Father Chudinov, who stood for  elections in the Snihuriv Electoral District in Mykolayiv  Oblast, had his church set on fire by some goons, while the  chancellor of the UAOC, Fr. Yuriy Boyko, survived the firs bout  of elections in Shpolyanshchyna area (Cherkasy Oblast), but then  lost big to Oleksander Tkachenko, a former minister of  agriculture and a leader of the socialist movement.    Nor did Vitaliy Zhuravskyy win; he heads the Christian  Democratic Party (CDP) which is simpatico with the UAOC. He may  have counted on some other support since he ran in the Marynskyy  district in Zhytomyr Oblast where UAOC is weak. Still, the UAOC  can count on two deputies from the CDP and Serhiy Holovatyy.  Holovatyy is one of the leading proponents of a reviews of the  legality of the Common Orthodox Sobor, held in June 1992, that  deprived UAOC of its official status.    The Ukrainian Orthodox Church--Kiev Patriarchate (UOC-KP), a  more clever competitor of the UAOC, issued a sharp appeal to the  faithful before the elections. They hit hard at the fifth  columnists, betrayers of the Black Sea fleet, and external  enemies. In two words, the essence of the appeal was to vote for  "true patriots." This patriotism has several interesting  features, including the recent elevation of Metropolitan  Volodymyr (Romanyuk)--a former religious dissident--to a  patriarch. Then there are the close ties between the UOC-KP and  the government as well as with personages connected with the  former Congress of National Democratic Forces. In short, the  clergy seem to be more catholic than the pope--after all, before  and during the first few months of Ukrainian independence many  of the highest UOC-KP hierarchs were on the other side of the  barricades.    If one is to believe the Moscow news agency IMA-Press, sixty  percent of the candidates running for parliament in Kiev  declared their devotion to Patriarch Volodymyr before March 27.  My observations showed a steady stream of politicians to the  hierarchy's reception rooms during spring, as well as to other  ecclesiastical luminaries in their districts.    This was, however, a two-way street. In Ukraine the mountain  and Mohammed take turns visiting each other. The leaders of  UOC-KP visited the Rivne region where two powerful figures in  Ukrainian Orthodoxy, Vasyl Chervoniy and Mykola Porovskyy, both  members of the Supreme Church Council, were successful  candidates. But a third lay member of the council, Oles  Shevchenko, was less successful despite a patriarchal visit and  Oleksander Moroz, leader of the Ukrainian Socialist Party,  emerged victorious. Nor did patriarchal efforts help Svitlana Li  in the Kharkiv District in Kiev. Still, having Porovskyy and  Chervoniy in parliament assures the UOC-KP that its interests  will be protected.    The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (UGCC) is also taken  care  of in the parliament. In Galicia, especially in the rural  districts, a word from their priests made a decisive difference  in an election. The only question was the delicate manner in  which the hint was given to avoid breaking the law. But the  names that were mentioned with sympathy in the rectories of  Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil wound up as deputies--Volodymyr  Pylypchuk, Vyacheslav Chornovil, Yevhen Pronyuk and others.    The UGCC hierarchy strongly favored the rightists and  rightist centrists. But they also favored liberals--although  seeing in them a threat to their puritanical philosophy--and  extreme radicals. At St. George's Hill they noted that  nazism-fascism is no better than communism and both should be  kept from emerging. In fact, the legendary Metropolitan  Sheptytskyy had already expressed those sentiments in 1942.    The UGCC had outlined its views in a pre-election message:  "Epistle of the UGCC Hierarchy on the Occasion of the March 27,  1994 Parliamentary Elections." The bishops advised saying `No'  to the political system of the past and irrational  centralization, and `Yes' to Ukrainian independence and  democracy, private property and the new constitution. The future  deputies were reminded of Christ's maxim: you were elected to  serve and even give your life for others, not to be served.    The Ukrainian Orthodox Church--Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP)  was most consistent in not popularizing its political tastes,  perhaps because the candidates themselves avoided affiliation  with a collaborationist church. Perhaps it was due dissent  within the church. Still, adherents of the UOC-MP count in the  thousands and thousands and their parishes dominate in 22  Ukrainian oblasts (except for the three Galician oblasts.) My  view is that Metropolitan Volodymyr (Sabodan) is not indifferent  to the outcome of the elections.    Nevertheless, the confessional synod of the UOC-MP allowed  two of its hierarchs to run (unsuccessfully) in the  elections--Avhustyn (Markovych), Bishop of Lviv and Drohobych,  and Sofroniy (Dmytruk), Bishop of Cherkasy and Kiev.  Interestingly, the MP had forbidden its bishops and other  clergymen from running for the Russian Duma since such duties  would interfere with the divine duties of pastoral care. Father  Hlib Yakunin ran for the Duma and was defrocked. Even as a  dissident in Brezhnev's time he was treated more gently and  simply forbidden to hold services.    What are we to make of this? Either there is a conflict  between Kiev and Moscow or Patriarch Alexei's court feels that  two disparate approaches to politics are called for in Ukraine  and Russia.    Avhustyn and Sofroniy, as well as father Anatoliy  Kyrychenko,  who ran in Fastivka, Kiev region, should have been aware of  their noncompliance with apostolic decrees. But willful  noncompliance was and is a church tradition and the position of  the UOC-MP is quite uncomfortable at the present time,  particularly since their colleagues in the other Ukrainian  churches did not shy away from politics.    Through it all the protestants remained remarkably calm and  quiet. Nowhere in Ukraine do they form a compact electorate--  except Hungarian reformists in Transcarpathia, but that is a  nationality issue--and the candidates ignored them. However, had  elections been held on a proportional basis, the 300,000  disciplined protestants could have been heard from.    These ruminations exclude Jehovah's Witnesses who during  Soviet times avoided having anything to do with temporal affairs  and refused to vote. On the other hand Baptists, Pentecostal  Christians, and Seventh Day Adventists--who account for most  Ukrainian protestants--did their civic duty. On March 20 the  Baptists even proclaimed a day of fasting and special prayers  for the elections. Leaders of the protestant communities  supported centrist candidates who would not drag the country  back to socialism or promote dubious innovations. Since the  traditional churches are not very welcoming to these believers,  in the future only those candidates who advocate freedom of  religion and legal equality of all churches will be able to  count on their support.    In Conclusion, it appears that keeping churches out of  politics is as unattainable as the Ten Commandments. Churches  are, after all, social institutions with tens of millions of  members. The effectiveness of their pastoral care depends on  worldly realities. Some commentators have even attribute the  fall of communism to the Vatican, while others feel it was due  to a desire to replace a foreign ideology by our own.    There are principal differences between churches with finely  honed political aims and those that seek to protect the weak  from the "powerful of this world." There are the stirring  examples of Bishop Midszenty who opposed the pro-Moscow and  pro-Stalinist regime in Budapest, Father Tekesz who helped bring  down Ceausescu, and our own martyr, Metropolitan Yosyp Slipyy.  But then there are also contrary examples.    President Leonid Kravchuk noted with some trepidation on the  eve of the elections that "...recently various political forces  have attempted to subvert the authority of the Church to their  ends in the upcoming parliamentary elections." He took the  appropriate steps to control such machinations...but the  skeptics pointed out that the Presidential Press Service made  similar announcements a year ago on May 26. Nobody, of course,  paid any attention to this and elections have become a tradition  in Ukraine. Just a glance on the goings-on makes it easy to tell  which local or presidential candidates have been blessed by an  ecclesiastical hand and which have not.</p>

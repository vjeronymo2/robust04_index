			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Antimony price surge continues Antimony, a metal with a wide variety of uses, has more than doubled in price in the past three months, from about Dollars 1,750 to nearly Dollars 4,000 a tonne last night. Traders said there had been problems with supplies from China, by far the biggest producer, for some time and the recent price surge was caused by US dealers buying heavily on behalf of consumers. When combined with other substances antimony is an extremely useful metal. It expands when solidifying (a rare characteristic it shares with water) so is a particularly valuable ingredient of alloys used for castings and type metal as the expansion forces metal to fill small crevices of casting molds. Even when added in very small quantities, antimony gives strength and hardness to other metals, particularly lead, with which it forms alloys used in plates of car storage batteries, in bullets and coverings for telephone cables. Among the many applications for antimony compounds, the trioxide and trichloride are used in flame-proofing fabrics and the trioxide in paints and plastics both as a pigment and as a fire-retarding agent. Traders said that consumers could not easily find substitutes for antimony at short notice and that extra supplies of metal from sources outside China were not likely to appear until producers were convinced that present high prices would continue for some time. Mr Richard Samuels of Lambert International said: 'There seems no reason for the market to collapse and the price might go a bit higher judging by the lack of offers and the large number of inquiries we have had'.</p>

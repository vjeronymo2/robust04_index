			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Kurds seek access to Turkish lira TURKEY is evaluating a proposal to circulate its national currency, the lira, in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, but has not yet made a decision, a senior Turkish official said yesterday. 'The Turkish government is examining the possibility of allowing large-scale use of the lira in north Iraq, but has made no decision on the matter,' Mr Volkan Vural, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Mr Vural told reporters at a news conference in Istanbul that the Kurds in northern Iraq were already using the lira along with other convertible western currencies. Some Kurdish groups in north Iraq have proposed that Turkey allow wide use of the lira in the Kurdish-controlled region after Iraq withdrew the premium-priced 25-dinar notes from circulation earlier this month. The withdrawal has blasted a hole in the economy of the north, already all but dependent on western aid ferried in from neighbouring Turkey. If the speculators in Jordan and Iraq's other Arab neighbours were Baghdad's main target, the decision to withdraw the note from May 6 has also seriously hurt the Kurdish region, where the note was the main instrument for savings and for trade with Turkey and Iran. Mr Mohamed Zejjari, the United Nations special co-ordinator for Iraq, who was in Ankara yesterday, reportedly told western officials the Iraqi move was 'understandable' and played down the impact on the Kurds. However, a fact-finding mission by Turkish and western diplomats this week concluded that as much as a third of the wealth of the self-declared Kurdish region had evaporated. The old 25-dinar note, manufactured in Switzerland before the Gulf war, has been replaced with a new inferior-quality note, which because of UN sanctions had to be printed on President Saddam Hussein's own presses. Baghdad finessed the speculators and the Kurds by sealing the country's borders, thus preventing those outside from being able to benefit from the week-long currency amnesty when old notes could still be exchanged. On June 1, government donors meet in Geneva, in the wake of a new appeal by the UN for Dollars 500m for Iraq. Diplomats say humanitarian needs in the north have sharply increased, as the note's withdrawal has devastated Kurdish savings, and caused a 50 per cent rise in prices and a 50 per cent depreciation of the dinar against the dollar. Kurds estimate that a third of the entire currency in circulation in the north was in 25-dinar notes. In a surprisingly orderly exercise, holders of the 25-dinar note were told to register with local banks. About 1.3bn Iraqi dinars in 25-dinar notes was registered, each holder issued with a certificate, locally known as a 'death certificate'. Money traders in Erbil and other cities refused to handle the note this week. It was, as one diplomat put it, 'tragic to see the market mechanism at work.' For western governments, the move marks a further tightening of Iraq's economic embargo on the Kurdish region. No western power, Turkey least of all, wants to see an independent Kurdish state in north Iraq for fear of Iranian exploitation. But the allies are keen to support the region, not least to avoid another exodus of refugees, the main reason for the continued allied air presence in south-west Turkey, the so-called operation Provide Comfort. There is concern now that Baghdad may take similar action to withdraw the 5-dinar and 10-dinar notes, the principal denominations for transactions in the local market.</p>

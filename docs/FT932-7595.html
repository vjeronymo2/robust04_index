			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nintendo ahead as sales rise strongly NINTENDO, the Japanese company that leads the video games market, yesterday reported a 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y163.8bn (Dollars 1.48bn) for the year to end-March, as sales of its games continued to rise strongly. Nintendo said demand for its most advanced games machine, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, grew strongly to support an 11 per cent rise in sales to Y562.75bn from Y507.50bn the year before. Net income rose 2 per cent to Y87.16bn and the directors are proposing to increase the net dividend by Y10 to a total of Y70 per share for the year. Although Nintendo managed to stage a buoyant performance, it was not immune from the effects of the worldwide economic slump and the impact of the sharp appreciation of the yen. The rise in earnings was however much lower than in the previous year when pre-tax profits rose 11 per cent and net profits by 21 per cent. Nintendo, which has an export ratio of more than 60 per cent, expects to face a difficult trading environment in the year ahead, with the yen forecast to continue its rise and the Japanese and European economies unlikely to recover significantly in the near term. The company faces growing competition in the games market not only from Sega, which has been building up its share of overseas markets, but also from new entrants into the market such as consumer electronics manufacturers. Kyocera, the leading Japanese manufacturer of semiconductors, reported a 7.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y38bn for the year to March due to weak domestic demand, foreign exchange-rate considerations and lower interest rates, writes Wayne Aponte. Net profits slipped by 13.9 per cent to Y20bn while sales dropped 5.2 per cent to Y300bn.</p>

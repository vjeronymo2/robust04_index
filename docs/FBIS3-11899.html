Narasimha Rao a message from  President Fidel Castro.    During the meeting, the prime minister showed interest in  Cuba's current situation and said relations between the two  peoples will always be special, despite the difficulties the two  countries are facing. Rao said he will support any bilateral  initiatives to reinforce ties, and he thanked Robaina for Cuba's  donation to the Mahastra earthquake victims in September.    Robaina said he felt compelled to visit India during his  tour  of the continent, because India is a country that has maintained  historic friendly ties with Cuba.    In terms of international affairs, the two leaders agreed on  the need to keep working to reinforce the Nonaligned Movement  and to attain greater cooperation among developing countries.    At the end of the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister held a  news conference at which he said his country opposes any form of  interference in India's internal affairs, and he expressed  support for India's position on the Kashmir issue. He also  underlined India's role in the Nonaligned Movement and the fact  that India's opinion and position are highly regarded among the  member-states.    Robaina, who arrived in New Delhi on Thursday, has met with  India's top leaders on numerous occasions.    Robaina's talks with Rao were preceded by an official  meeting  between the Indian and Cuban delegations studying economic,  scientific, and technical cooperation between the two countries.    The host delegation was headed by Salman Khursheed, minister  of state for external affairs, and included the ministers of  health, agriculture, commerce, fisheries, food, and science and  technology.    The two sides agreed on the need to increase bilateral trade  because both countries intend to make large investments in  various areas of their respective economies.    Trade between Havana and New Delhi fell 50 percent following  the collapse of the socialist bloc with which both nations  traded actively.    Currently, India is conducting a children's immunization  program for which the nation needs anti-meningococcal vaccines  produced in Cuba.    India also showed interest in agriculture, specifically  Cuba's experiences in tobacco and apiculture.    During the talks, the two sides agreed to conduct exchanges  and transfer technology on the manufacture of reinforced ships  [barcos de ferrocemento] and other specific areas.    Minister Khursheed said a business delegation will soon be  created to explore in Havana the possibility of future  cooperation in a number of areas. Robaina said these talks are  designed to determine what Cuba would need or might offer in  terms of possible future investments.    During his 48-hour stay in New Delhi, Robaina talked with  groups in solidarity with Cuba, as well as leaders of several  political parties. He also met with more than 60 businessmen at  the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of India.    Robaina leaves for Malaysia on an official visit tomorrow.  He will later travel to Vietnam, the last stage of his tour  through Asia.</p>

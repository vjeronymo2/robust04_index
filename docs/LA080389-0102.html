			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: D.A. FILES 2ND MURDER CHARGE AGAINST DRIVER  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has filed a second murder  charge against accused drunk driver Harry Bouboushian after the second of his  seven passengers died over the weekend from injuries sustained in a single-car  accident July 16.  </P> <P> Bouboushian, who had been scheduled Tuesday to face his preliminary hearing on  the original charges, instead was arraigned on additional second-degree murder  and vehicular manslaughter charges involving the death of Arthur Bezekian, 14.  Bezekian, who had been unconscious since the accident, had been on a  life-support system at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffery Oscodar said prosecution and defense attorneys  agreed to a postponement of the preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> Testimony of witnesses who are due to leave the country later this month will  be taken today and Aug. 10.  </P> <P> Bouboushian, 34, had been charged with one count each of second-degree murder,  vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, hit-and-run and two counts of felony  drunk driving at his July 19 arraignment. He has pleaded not guilty to both the  original and the new charges.  </P> <P> All charges stem from an accident that took place shortly before 11 p.m. July  16.  </P> <P> Police said Bouboushian was driving westbound on Los Feliz Boulevard at speeds  exceeding 100 m.p.h. when he lost control of the car just west of Vermont  Avenue and crashed into a light standard. The car became airborne and struck  two parked cars, police said.  </P> <P> Armine Karapetian, Bouboushian's wife, died at the scene. Bezekian was one of  four passengers who were seriously injured.  </P> <P> Bouboushian, an Inglewood auto body shop owner with two previous drunk-driving  convictions, had completed a court-ordered drunk-driving treatment program just  three days before the accident and had six outstanding speeding tickets, one  for driving in excess of 100 m.p.h.  </P></p>

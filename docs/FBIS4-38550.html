			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government of Kazakhstan intends to firmly  pursue a stringent financial policy and adhere to the budget  deficit agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund -- no  more than 4 percent. Finance Minister Erkeshbai Derbisov said so  in an interview with INTERFAX after Monday's session of the  Cabinet of Ministers held to consider changes in Kazakhstan's  budget for the current year.    Earlier the finance minister said that President Nursultan  Nazarbayev's decision to raise the minimal wages to 100 tenges  may entail a rise in the budget deficit.    According to estimates, in May inflation in Kazakhstan will  reach 26 percent, Derbisov said. In January it ran at 42  percent, in February at 27 pct, in March at 17 percent and in  April at 31 percent.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Building societies fare badly BUILDING SOCIETIES fared badly on both sides of their business in January according to figures published yesterday by the Building Societies Association. There was little sign of improvement in the societies' mortgage business. Net new lending was Pounds 2.26bn, down from Pounds 2.53bn in December. Net advances were up at Pounds 1.35bn from Pounds 1.16bn but this was well below the Pounds 1.67bn for January last year, when figures were depressed by the impending Gulf war. In spite of the very poor showing in the mortgage market, Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the BSA, said seasonal factors were largely responsible. 'The recently reported signs of an upturn in housing market activity would not have shown through in the January figures,' he said. City housing market analysts described the figures as extremely disappointing, however. Building societies enjoyed a modest upturn in their savings business in January after two months in which there were net outflows of savings. The improved performance in January, when Pounds 293m flowed into the societies compared with an outflow of Pounds 54m in December, may have been linked to the first anniversary of Tessa accounts. The January figure was the highest since June. Mr Boleat said, however, the underlying flow of savings was subdued and that this pattern seemed set to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>

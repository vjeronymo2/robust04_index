			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, April 23, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati here today reiterated the full support of the  Iranian people and government for the oppressed people of Bosnia  against the aggressor Serbs.    He made the remark in a meeting with his Bosnian counterpart  Haris Siladzic on the sidelines of the Crans-Montana forum here,  where the two sides also reviewed the latest developments in  Bosnia-Herzegovina particularly the Gorazde crisis.    Informing Velayati on the details of the strong resistance  of  the people in Gorazde against the wide-scale Serbian invasion,  Siladzic said his country was pessimistic towards the "ambiguous  function" of the international circles.    He termed the aid rendered by the Islamic Republic of Iran  to  the Bosnia people as "Islamic and brotherly" and appreciated the  Iranian people and government for their sympathy with the  Bosnian Muslims.</p>

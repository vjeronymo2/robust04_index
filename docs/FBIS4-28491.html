			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takaaki Kamitada, lead statistician, Customs </F> Bureau, Ministry of Finance: "When It Comes to Trade Surpluses,  Keep an Eye on Volume Data"]    [Text] Volume Data Substantiate "Effects of the  J-Curve" in Trade With United States and Reflect Trends  Accurately    1) When there is a sharp increase in the value of the  yen as was the case in 1993, an accurate appraisal of Japan's  foreign trade trends requires focused attention on changes in  volume data which reflects a clear picture of foreign trade  transactions.    2) When the subject concerns the sharply increasing  Japan's trade surplus, it is insufficient to track only the  monetary aspects of trends. There is a need to effectively  appraise the factors which cause trade surpluses by principal  regions such as the United States, the European Union (EU) and  Asia.    3) The Ministry of Finance (MOF) recently decided to  publish a trade index categorized by principal regions such as  the United States. This index clearly provides numerical  substantiation that the "effects of the J-curve served as the  basis for the increase in foreign trade surplus with the United  States in 1993 on a dollar basis.  <H5>  Indicators Expressed in Yen and Dollar Reflect Differing </H5> Results    An examination of Japan's foreign trade trends for 1993  shows  that the trade surplus declined for the first time in three  years on a yen basis, but that it increased and hit a record  high for three years in a row on a dollar basis. Whether the  foreign trade trends are viewed on a yen basis or a dollar basis  makes a difference in arriving at the result of trend analysis.    The reason for this phenomenon is that when the value of the  yen rises sharply as it did in 1993, shifts in foreign exchange  rates are accompanied by major shifts in prices; and shifts in  export and import volumes expressed in monetary values are  strongly impacted by price factors. Accordingly, it is believed  that an accurate appraisal of Japan's foreign trade trends  requires focusing of attention on changes in volume data for  "commodities," providing an unadulterated picture of foreign  trade transactions without regard for indicators based on the  yen or the dollar.    Export and import volume data are compiled on the basis of  unit for motor vehicles and tonnage for steel. Although it is  possible to appraise volume by each of the respective categories  of commodities, it is not possible to easily summarize export  and import volume data for an entire nation as can be done in  monetary terms because of the existence of unit count and weight  in quantifying volumes for each commodity category. Even the  trend is difficult to appraise on an overall basis.    However, observations of movements in the "volume index,"  among the trade indices published by the MOF, can provide an  appraisal for export and import trends on a volume basis for the  nation as a whole.    Further, export and import values can be arrived at by  multiplying prices and volumes. It is known that if such data is  converted to trade indices, that, generally speaking, the growth  in monetary values can be expressed as an approximation of the  sum of growth in the price and volume indices. This relationship  can be used to analytically group export and import monetary  value changes into price factors and volume factors.  Accordingly, the use of foreign trade indices can provide an  analysis and appraisal for the causes of Japan's trade surplus  in terms of price and volume.    Trade indices are one of the very important economic indices  in accurately appraising Japan's foreign trade trends, and the  MOF has compiled trade indices that supplement past worldwide  foreign trade indices, categorized by principal regions such as  the United States, the EU, and Asia, which provide the primary  objective of 1) appraising export and import trends for each  region on a volume basis and 2) analyzing changes in regional  trade surpluses on a price and volume basis. The new indices are  released beginning in March 1994, following approval by the  Statistics Council.  <H5>  Reduction in Volume Which Lags Rise in Prices </H5>   First, let us take a look at trends in the volume of exports  and imports with the United States in 1993.    Export volumes decreased 1.8 percent owing to commodities  such as motor vehicles which declined because of the strong yen  and attendant growth in local production while import volumes  increased 2.4 percent reflecting increases in imports of  commodities such as motor vehicles, electronic components such  as semiconductors, and clothing. Also, trends in January and  February 1994 were similar to those in 1993. A look at monthly  volume indices for the United States further shows that export  volumes are in a declining trend and that import volumes are in  an increasing trend.    A look at trends based on prices indicates that export  prices  expressed in dollars have increased 12.1 percent, but this  reflects a rise of 13.7 percent in the yen's value in 1993. The  10.0 percent rise in exports to the United States in 1993 on a  dollar basis reflects the effect of the strong yen, causing a  rise of 12.1 percent in prices, whereas volume fell 1.8 percent.  Imports from the United States rose 5.8 percent because of a  rise in volume and prices.    Accordingly, if an immediate decrease in export volume  commensurate with the rise in export prices had been realized,  exports to the United States would have failed to expand.  However, as is known under what is generally referred to as  "effects of the J-curve," when the value of the yen rises  sharply, export prices on a dollar basis rise steeply and export  volume trends lag are reflected in statistics on a gradual  basis. Therefore, reductions in export volumes commensurate with  rises in export prices are normally not reflected immediately.    Additionally, increases in import volumes also lag in  manifesting themselves in response to changes in foreign  exchange rates. As a result, trade surpluses increase on a  short-term basis, and the aforementioned trade indices  indisputably attest to the manifestation of this phenomenon on a  numerical basis. In other words, the major increase in trade  surplus with the United States in 1993 is a reflection of the  effects of the rise in export prices on a dollar basis arising  from a significantly stronger yen as depicted in the so-called  "effects of the J-curve," despite a decrease in export volumes  and an increase in import volumes.    Next, let us take a look at trends in export and import  volumes with the EU in 1993.    Export volume recorded a significant decrease of 14.2  percent  owing to effects of the strong yen and drop in exports for  commodities such as motor vehicles because of the recession in  the EU economy. On the other hand, import volume fell 1.6  percent overall because of a decline in imports of luxury items  such as fashion apparel and expensive automobiles. Additionally,  in January and February 1994, export volume trends remained the  same as in 1993, but import volumes rose.    Price-wise, dollar-based export price hikes have been  limited  to 5.2 percent, but this trend conceivably reflects the effects  of a strong yen and the shift of exports from high-priced items  to lower-priced items owing to the recession in the EU economy.  As a result, exports to the EU on a dollar basis declined  substantially by 9.7 percent because of a significant drop on a  volume basis while imports declined modestly in terms of volume  and price and thus limiting the decline to 3.6 percent.  Accordingly, the major decline in trade surplus with the EU in  1993 primarily reflects a major decline in export volume.  <H5>  Importance of Regional Factor Analysis </H5>   Finally, let us take a look at trends in export and import  volumes relative to Asia in 1993.    Export volume to Asia increased 7.4 percent including motor  vehicles, steel, and visual equipment owing to the favorable  economic climate in that area. On the other hand, import volumes  rose 6.5 percent because of increased imports of items such as  clothing and audiovisual equipment owing to progress in the  localization of production. Further, trends for 1993 extended  themselves in January and February 1994.    Both export and import volumes increased significantly in  relation to Asia, but a major contributor to this trend was the  active pace of trade with principal constituent regions such as  China. A look at export and import volumes in relation to China  indicates a favorable Chinese economy in recent times and a  conspicuous rise of 37.6 percent in export volume and of 22.3  percent in import volume.    Exports to Asia rose sharply by 16.0 percent reflecting a  rise in export volume and an 8.0 percent jump in export prices  on a dollar basis. On the other hand, imports from Asia rose 8.9  percent reflecting an increase in both volume and prices.    Thus, in 1993 the trade surplus with Asia rose to a record  high of $53.6 billion to a level surpassing the trade surplus  with the United States, but this is a reflection of a climb in  export prices based on a strong yen and an increase in export  volume that exceeded the growth in import volume.    As discussed in the preceding text, trade indices  categorized  by principal regions enable clarification of foreign trade  trends for each region on a volume basis and provide for an  analysis of causes in shifts relative to trade surpluses for  each region. The procedures enable an appraisal of foreign trade  trends which could not be adequately measured on the basis of  monetary value trends alone. It is believed that the new index  is very effective in providing an accurate appraisal for Japan's  trade with principal regions.    Further, aside from the principal regions covered in this  article, trade indices are published for newly industrializing  economies of Asia such as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and  Singapore.</p>

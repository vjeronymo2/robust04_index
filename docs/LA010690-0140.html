			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHOUTING MATCH ERUPTS OVER EAST ORANGE PLAN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE PROPONENTS OF IRVINE CO. PROJECT ACCUSE CRITICS OF BRINGING IN  'OUTSIDERS,' BUT FOES FEAR TRAFFIC CONGESTION.  </P> <P> A news conference turned into a shouting match Friday between opponents of the  Irvine Co.'s proposed 12,000-home development in east Orange and proponents who  held the conference and accused critics of using "outside anti-growth" leaders.  </P> <P> Theodore Botens, president of the Rural Orange Coordinated Council, composed of  10 homeowner groups that have endorsed the development, was repeatedly  interrupted as he stood on the steps of City Hall and tried to characterize  citizens against the development as either "outsiders" or people who did not  attend any of the city's hearings.  </P> <P> "It's very obvious to me that these outside people have a slow-growth agenda,"  Botens said amid shouts of "You're wrong! You're wrong!"  </P> <P> "I'm against the wording of one of their flyers that said this plan will divide  the city," Botens said.  </P> <P> One of those who disagreed with Botens was Dorothy Hudecek, who lives in  Orange. She attended the news conference to hear what Botens had to say and was  not planning on making any statements. But when Botens characterized some  organizers as "anti-growth outsiders," she said she saw red.  </P> <P> "I resent people like Ted Botens describing me as anti-growth," she said, loud  enough for Botens to hear. "I'm not anti-growth, and petition organizers are  not anti-growth. We're residents concerned about added traffic congestion that  this development will bring. . . . As for not attending any city meetings on  the issue, I've attended almost every single one."  </P> <P> The outburst was an example of some of the emotions that have boiled over among  residents as a result of the Irvine Co.'s proposal to turn 7,100 acres of open  land into a sea of 12,300 homes, a hotel and major recreational facilities over  the next 20 years.  </P> <P> Hudecek was part of a group that, along with reporters, ringed Botens, Nicky  Calagna of the Orange Taxpayers Assn., and Robert Walters, a member of the  Rural Orange Coordinated Council, during the news conference.  </P> <P> Hudecek is a member of the Five Coves Conservancy, which is one of several  groups helping to organize a petition drive to collect 5,500 signatures by Jan.  18. They want to put the development issue on the city's June ballot.  Organizers said they became frustrated when the City Council voted unanimously  Dec. 19 to approve an amendment adding the development to the city's General  Plan. The proposal has been the subject of negotiations for 3 1/2 years.  </P> <P> Petition organizers, including Carole Walters of Orange (no relation to Robert  Walters), have taken exception to Botens' comments praising the development and  criticizing those who disagree because they were not part of the  decision-making process.  </P> <P> Carole Walters said she is fearful that the development, which would increase  the city's population by an estimated 40% and bring in 25,000 new jobs, would  drastically alter the city she now knows by dividing the older housing sections  in west Orange from the new subdivisions in east Orange.  </P> <P> After the conference, Botens said he favored the project because it had  included jogging and horse trails, open space and two parks, all suggestions  made by his east Orange neighborhood known as Orange Park Acres and other  homeowner groups.  </P> <P> Sherry Meddick, who lives in nearby Silverado Canyon and is against the  development, said petition organizers plan to step up their fight next week.  Although she said she was confident that enough signatures would be obtained to  qualify a referendum, she and other organizers did not have any estimates on  the number of signatures already obtained.  </P></p>

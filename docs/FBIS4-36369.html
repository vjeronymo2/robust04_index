			<p>BFN     [Text] After holding his first meeting with  representatives of the autonomy in Jericho, Environment Minister  Yosi Sarid said that considering the prevailing conditions, he  found the Palestinian Authority organized. Sarid asserted that  Israel had no complaints with regard to Palestinian control over  the area. Sarid was speaking after a meeting with several  Palestinian officials, including Faysal al-Husayni, Jibril  al-Rujub, and a representative from the Gaza Strip.    The meeting was held at the al-Aqsa base, formerly known as  the Hanan army camp. After the meeting, Yosi Sarid said it had  been held with the approval and encouragement of Prime Minister  Rabin. Sarid pointed out that issues related to Jerusalem were  not raised at the meeting in Jericho, nor did the participants  discuss the order prohibiting Jibril al-Rujub from leaving the  Jericho area. In reply to a question, Minister Sarid said that  negotiations for continuing the peace process would resume soon.    Faysal al-Husayni said that the atmosphere at the meeting in  Jericho had been positive, noting that problems pertaining to  the daily life of the Palestinian populace had been discussed.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 8 June  adds:  "Referring to Orient House in East Jerusalem, Sarid said that  its status will not change and that all Palestinian Authority  institutions will be located only in the Gaza and Jericho.    ["Minister Sarid reprimanded the settlers at the ancient  synagogue in Jericho for their provocative behavior toward the  Palestinian policemen, but noted that he does not propose  evacuating them from the site. Our correspondent Moti Amir  reports that two armed Israeli security guards are posted at the  entrance to the synagogue. According to a military source,  these are soldiers in civilian clothes, and their presence was  coordinated with the Palestinians. The settlers claim that the  two were hired as security guards to protect them.    ["Sarid noted that Former Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren's halakic  edict sentencing 'Arafat to death is serious. The man is  deranged, Sarid said, and he should not be taken seriously  because his status is of no relevance."]</p>

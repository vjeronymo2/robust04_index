			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS: FROM YOUNG GUN TO YOUNG WRITER  </P> <P> At the side of a tenement building near MacArthur Park that serves as a key  location for Lou Diamond Phillips' new film, "Mind Game," is a billboard  promoting the just-released "Young Guns II," in which he stars with Emilio  Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland and Christian Slater.  </P> <P> Already this year Phillips has appeared in the supernatural horror film "The  First Power" and the political thriller "Show of Force." Since his film career  was launched three years ago with "La Bamba," in which he played the late  rocker Ritchie Valens, Phillips has made 10 films.  </P> <P> Too much exposure? Too many roles?  </P> <P> "I haven't had any regrets yet," says the 28-year-old actor, during a break on  the "Mind Game" set recently. "A lot of films have come along that appealed to  me for a variety of reasons. Yet I still turn down many more than I accept."  </P> <P> Clearly, one reason for the flood of offers is the actor's "crossover" status:  in the eyes of Hollywood dealmakers, Phillips is one of the few ethnic actors  who can carry a film. And his ethnicity is sufficiently vague -- Scots-Irish  and Cherokee Indian on his father's side and Filipino with strains of Chinese  and Spanish on his mother's -- that Phillips jokes, "I can play what's in me  the rest of my life and never do the same role twice."  </P> <P> So far, he's made a good stab at exactly that, playing Mexican-American in "La  Bamba" and "Stand and Deliver," Lakota Sioux in "Renegades," Navaho-Mexican in  "Young Guns I and II," Irish in "The First Power," Puerto Rican in "Show of  Force," plus non-ethnic roles in the feature film "Disorganized Crime" and the  made-for-TV movie "The Three Kings."  </P> <P> In "Mind Game," a psychological thriller that Phillips wrote, he deliberately  created his character as a Filipino. "I figured this was probably my only  chance to play what is a large portion of my (ethnic) makeup."  </P> <P> Phillips plays a struggling novelist discouraged by numerous publishers'  rejections. Looking for an instant best-seller, he strikes up a friendship with  a mass murderer (Clancy Brown) newly released from prison. As their  relationship evolves into something darker, the film hopes to raise questions  about ambition and what people will do to gain success.  </P> <P> These questions were certainly on Phillips' mind the night four years ago when  he conceived the story. This occurred, he says, while waiting for a traffic  light to change at an intersection in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> " 'La Bamba' had been finished but it wasn't going to come out for a year," he  says. "I made little on 'La Bamba' and was worried about money running out.  Casting agents liked me but I had no jobs. They wanted to wait and see how 'La  Bamba' did. At the same time people were whispering in my ear, 'This movie is  going to do it. "La Bamba" is your big break.'  </P> <P> "So waiting at that light, I started thinking about what I was going to do when  this movie finally did open on a Friday night and the next day I'm a known  entity. How is this kid from Texas going to deal with that? Those themes went  into the character of this writer, who wanted success and was willing to  compromise to achieve it."  </P> <P> Phillips says he had been writing plays and film scripts long before he came to  Los Angeles. He makes a point to explain that not all his scripts have roles  for himself and none of them are typical mainstream Hollywood films.  </P> <P> "I came up in the Texas independent film industry, where you don't write in car  chases because you can't afford them."  </P> <P> Although he was always committed to a career as an actor, Phillips says he  wrote and produced plays throughout his high school and college days in Texas  and after his graduation from the University of Texas at Arlington's drama  department, he spent three years in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area writing and  performing with a comedy troupe called "The Zero Hour."  </P> <P> "We were pretty much an uncensored 'Saturday Night Live.' We did some rude  things, not all of which went over. We started in a punk club in 1980 -- an  hour show at midnight -- then later made the rounds at other night clubs. This  was my introduction into professional theater."  </P> <P> Phillips began studying film technique with the man he describes as his mentor,  Adam Roarke, an actor who has appeared in such films as "The Stunt Man" and  "Play It as It Lays." Soon, Philips worked as an assistant director and  instructor at Roarke's Film Actor's Lab. During this period, Phillips received  his first screenwriting credit.  </P> <P> "It was on an independent film I'm not going to name because it's in video  stores. A group had made a film in Texas that they hadn't been able to sell for  two year. So they came to Adam and me. We had a reputation in Dallas as people  who knew film -- and we were cheap.  </P> <P> "We looked at this film and Adam asked if I could fix it. I spent a month  studying the film, the script and outtakes. I rewrote 40 pages of dialogue and  rerouted the plot. Then we reshot for about two weeks.  </P> <P> "Is it a good film? No. But I'm proud that (the new footage) doesn't look like  it was tacked on two years later. The plot works better and it was a wonderful  lesson in screenplay structure for me. Also I achieved what I set out to do as  a writer: We made a cohesive movie that the producers sold and got their money  back."  </P> <P> "La Bamba," of course, did make the kid from Texas a known entity.  Writer-director Luis Valdez used the life story of the Chicano rock star to  create one of the few positive images of Latinos in American films. Valdez and  Phillips portrayed Valens as the boy next door who achieved success through  spunk and ambition. Some critics found the film overly sentimental. But  audiences responded and the film became a hit.  </P> <P> Which, of course, resulted in the flood of movie offers. "I pretty much  approach acting as I do my writing." says Phillips. "I try not to do the same  thing twice."  </P> <P> Re-creating the role of Chavez Y Chavez for the "Young Guns" sequel was, in  Phillips' mind, less of a repeat than a chance "to fix things I didn't like  about the first film." In these two Brat Pack Westerns, Phillips found himself  in the company of other young actors who face the pressures of early success.  </P> <P> "Being in that fish bowl at a fairly early age carries certain baggage, either  in the press's or the public's eye. I mean, whoever deserves to be as lucky as  this? You can become extremely bitter about trying to prove something to  somebody. So you do the best work you're capable of and hope that it speaks for  itself.  </P> <P> "It's all about choices and tenure. I don't think any of us have tenure yet.  Certain guys establish themselves at the box office or establish themselves as  artists beyond what the box office dictates. None of us are at that point.  We're all working like maniacs but, personally speaking, I don't feel like I'm  there yet. And maybe I never will be."  </P> <P> Another of the sequel's enticements was a chance to recreate a role that  Phillips says he likes more and more. "A lot of that has to do with my  involvement with the Native American community. I'm Cherokee by blood but I've  just been adopted by the Sioux tribe. On Labor Day, I'm going to the Pine Ridge  Reservation in South Dakota for my naming ceremony."  </P> <P> Philips, whose Sioux name is Star Keeper, is also organizing a benefit concert  in Santa Fe this October, called "The Winds of Life," which he plans to emcee.  The concert will benefit Native American causes.  </P> <P> But the main reason for the Texas native's involvement in "Young Guns" was the  simple fact that they were Westerns.  </P> <P> "That was the most fun I will ever have on a film set," he says. "I was  thrilled to death to be in a Western."  </P> <P> During the shooting of a lynching scene for "Young Guns II," Phillips got more  thrill than he bargained for. The scene called for Phillips' character to be  saved from a lynching when Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) shot the rope in half  just as he was about to be hanged. But when Estevez fired his gun, the horse  beneath Phillips -- whose hands were bound behind him -- bolted.  </P> <P> The rope around Phillips' neck snapped before it could do any damage, but the  actor's foot got caught in the stirrups of the saddle and as he was being  dragged alongside the spooked horse, his right forearm was shattered in four  places.  </P> <P> Phillips holds the arm out at a right angle to his body. "It's not entirely  straight," he says. "In softball the other day I hit one over the fence. But I  can't throw yet. One nice thing about 'Mind Game' -- I don't have to break a  sweat, I'm not beat up and I do no stunts. I'm playing a writer."  </P> <P> "Mind Game" producer Richard E. Johnson admits that normally he would have  "great trepidation" about producing a film whose star also functioned as the  writer. "You might wind up with a vanity piece. But Lou is extremely  level-headed and professional. He can really separate the functions. On the  set, he responds like an actor, not a writer."  </P> <P> "This is probably the most complex character he has done on screen," adds  director Scott D. Goldstein. "Lou's using aspects of characters he's played  before in films and molding them together into a new form."  </P> <P> Phillips himself notes: "Usually, you do research to assume somebody else's  personality. But I created this guy for me. I know what my motivations are."  </P> <P> A smile crosses his face.  </P> <P> "Right before this film began, I received a batch of rejection letters for a  novel I've written. We got clearances to use the (publishers') letterheads for  a scene where the character throws his rejection letters into a fire. Just  before filming, I read over one letter and said, 'Guys, there's no question  about my motivation for this scene. I know what it's about.' "  </P> <P> Once "Mind Game" wraps, Phillips gets even busier. First on his schedule is  "The Dark Wind" for executive producer Robert Redford and director Errol  Morris. Phillips is negotiating to play mystery writer Tony Hillerman's  American Indian detective, Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police. He then  heads to Canada for "Agaguk," a film directed by Jacques Dorfman, which finds  Phillips cast as -- yes, an Eskimo.  </P> <P> "When I got the script, I had to laugh. For years I've been saying, 'Hey, maybe  one day I'll play an Eskimo.' Then here it is. But then I stopped and thought,  Well, gee, who else are they going to send this to?"  </P></p>

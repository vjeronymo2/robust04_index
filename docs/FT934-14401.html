			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Sport: Phillies wreck the game plan - World Series re-match is foiled as outsiders beat the odds / Baseball FOR A MUG, we did not do too badly this year. We predicted when the season began that the Toronto Blue Jays, last year's World Series baseball champion, were still the class act of the American League while the pitching of the Atlanta Braves ought to give them the National League pennant and a re-match with the Canadian club. And so it should have come to pass - except for the inexplicable grittiness of the Philadelphia Phillies, a team which nobody, even itself, picked to do much this year at all. On Wednesday, victory over Atlanta gave Philadelphia the National League title and today they will meet the Blue Jays in Toronto in the opening game of this year's World Series. Our wish list was also generally only half fulfilled. On the field, Fernando Valenzuela won eight, not 15, games for the Baltimore Orioles but, at least in July, was his old devious self again. Bo Jackson hit 15, not 30, home runs for the Chicago White Sox (and flopped horribly in the play-offs against Toronto); but even to perform at the top level with an artificial hip is an achievement in itself. Nolan Ryan's last season was marked by injury, not a no-hitter but, aged 46, he could still pitch at 95 mph. Off the field, Marge Schott, suspended owner of the Cincinnati Reds, was mercifully quiet but George Steinbrenner, restored to the New York Yankee helm, could not in the end contain himself and began musing about vacating Yankee Stadium. Baseball did not get its desired new commissioner while the owners, desperate for the television dollar, infuriated traditionalists by announcing that both leagues would be split into three divisions, not two, next year with 'wild cards' (ie, non-champions) eligible for an extra round of play-offs. With more teams losing money than making it, the fire sale of the higher-paid players on the San Diego Padres could be a grim harbinger. This summary of developments might be read to imply a predictable, even depressing, season. New Yorkers probably believe it was both, for the once-beloved Mets played abominably and behaved worse. The Yankees flattered only to deceive. In many respects, though, this was a wondrous year. It featured, given next year's re-alignment, what many consider probably to have been the last great divisional race - in the National League West between Atlanta and the San Francisco Giants. This was decided only on the last day of the regular season when the Giants lost to their old nemesis, the Los Angeles Dodgers, thus missing the play-offs. The Giants, who last took the World Series 39 years ago when still in New York, deserve sympathy. They won 103 games, a total higher than any other team except the Braves and more than enough to have won a pennant in the 25-year history of divisional play. At the start of August they were 10 games ahead and, apart from an early September swoon, did not fold. They were managed expertly by Dusty Baker, and Barry Bonds - he of the Dollars 42m, six-year contract - had another colossal year. The Braves, however, simply were irresistible. Their record after the mid-season All Star break was a staggering 51-17. The starting pitching  - Glavine, Maddux, Avery and Smoltz - was all it was expected to be; but the key probably was the acquisition in July from San Diego of Fred McGriff, the slugging first baseman. The American League East had its moments, too, until September. Then, Toronto suddenly started winning and the Yankees, Orioles, Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox all began losing, even to the weaker teams. The Orioles' Cal Ripken played every game and is now only a season and a half away from passing Lou Gehrig's record for indestructibility. Undoubtedly, the surprise packet was Philadelphia, who went from bottom of the National League East last year to an easy first. This is a team of hairy, burly men (noteably Dykstra, Kruk, Incaviglia and Daulton among the hitters; Schilling, Greene and Williams among the pitchers) who revel in their unkemptness and, mostly, played well above all known form. Perhaps, though, the season was most memorable for the coming of age of a new generation of authentic young superstars, all aged about 25: Juan Gonzales of Texas, Ken Griffey in Seattle, Frank Thomas of the White Sox, Mike Piazza of the Dodgers, Carlos Baerga of the Cleveland Indians, and Roberto Alomar and John Olerud of the Blue Jays. Alex Fernandez and Wilson Alvarez helped give the White Sox a pitching staff worthy of comparison (not always fanciful) with that of Atlanta. Add Jose Canseco of Texas, Mark McGwire of Oakland and Mike Mussina of Baltimore, all beset by injury this year, and baseball's playing future seems in excellent hands. The same goes for Toronto, the defending king of the hill. The Blue Jays sometimes are described as a 'rent-a-team' paying top (therefore, not Canadian) dollars to the better mercenaries but using them well. They compensated for off-season departures by picking up some venerable warhorses: Paul Molitor, 15 years a Milwaukee Brewer, and Dave Stewart and Rickey Henderson, who found great success with Oakland. Molitor, 37, merely batted in 100 runs for the first time in his career and became the oldest player to hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases in a season. Pitcher Stewart, still fiercely competitive at 36, was undefeated in September and took his team to two wins in the play-off with the White Sox. He has now passed Jim 'Catfish' Hunter for most wins, starts and innings in championship play. In reality, the Blue Jay pitching remains spotty. But the first six of its batting line-up - Henderson, Devon White, Molitor, Joe Carter, Olerud and Alomar - are the best in the game while the ninth in the order, Pat Borders, was the most valuable player (for his hitting more than his catching) in last year's World Series. So, the mug must make his choice - the bat against the arm. Contrary to our long-standing personal conviction (bolstered by the serious prophets in baseball) that great pitching will usually beat great hitting, the imported Canadian timber gets the nod this year. The World Series is too short for it to be denied.</p>

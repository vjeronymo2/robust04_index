			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Books: Rogue males on stage LOITERING WITH INTENT by Peter O'Toole Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 198 pages FATAL CHARM by Alexander Walker Weidenfeld and Nicolson Pounds 18.99, 457 pages PETER O'Toole's jottings cover his years from about five to somewhere in his twenties, but not in any order. There are affectionate notes on his life with his father, an itinerant bookie; about his unprofitable visits to schools, his employment on a local newspaper, but not what he did there; we have rough sketches of National Service in the Royal Navy, some notes on rugby. He seems to have enrolled in RADA almost by accident. There are pages about Adolf Hitler, whom he subsequently shot in the BBC's Rogue Male and who was one of his early obsessions, like the knight Sir Yvain and the wizard Merlin. It is likeable enough, but there is hardly anything about the theatre, which is what makes O'Toole interesting. Alexander Walker's Fatal Charm: The Life of Rex Harrison is another matter. A comprehensive account of Harrison's work on stage and film is strung around his six marriages, one of which, and one of his incidental affairs, led to a suicide. Harrison, a splendid actor, was a less splendid citizen. With the wealth he earned, he made himself increasingly 'upper-class' and increasingly self-centred, with insistent demands on casting. He served with the RAF in the war until the spring of 1944. At this period he left his first wife, Collette Thomas, and began an affair with Lilli Palmer, whom he married six months later. From here on his acting career was a virtually unchecked line of film and stage success: his marriages, not. An affair with Carole Landis ended with her suicide. Divorced from Lilli Palmer, he married Kay Kendall, but she died of leukaemia after two years. He played opposite Rachel Roberts and duly married her. She became mentally unstable, and there were attempted suicides. They ultimately divorced and he set up house with Elizabeth Harris and her three children. This was not his scene; separation and divorce followed, and he settled down with Anglo-Asian Mercia Tinker, who survived him. Walker gives much authentic detail of Harrison's personal unpleasantness and his dramatic success, most vividly recalled in his Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pakistan has expressed shock at the Serb attack on  the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, which claimed 68 people and  wounded over 200 others. In a statement issued in Islamabad,  the Government of Pakistan urged the world community to punish  those responsible and get the siege of the capital lifted. It  has also asked the UN Security Council to lift the arms embargo  against Bosnia to enable the Bosnians to defend themselves  against the aggression. The statement says failure of the world  community in taking any action would seriously undermine the  credibility of the United Nations.</p>

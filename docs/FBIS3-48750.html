			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Part one of article by Vu Oanh, member of the Communist </F> Party of Vietnam Political Bureau: "Developing Combined Forces  in Mass Motivation Work and Renovating the Work Content and  Method of the Fatherland Front and Mass Organizations"]    [Text] President Ho Chi Minh said: "The national renovation  and construction work is the duty of all people. We must  administer social reform, improve the people's life, and apply  real democracy in society. Mass motivation is the mobilization  of all people's forces, not leaving anyone out, to create a  force of the entire people to carry out all necessary works."  (Ho Chi Minh Collected Works, Volume 5, page 299) The  undertaking of making the population prosperous, the nation  strong, and society civilized and just and the protection of  national independence and sovereignty is the work of all people.  In understanding this leading idea, at present, we must realize  that the construction of a law-governed state of the people, by  the people, and for the people; the economic development and the  social stabilization; the harmonious combination of a strong  economic development with the settlement of social issues; the  combination of economic development with the strengthening of  national defense and the broadening of foreign relations; the  development of an internal and external open-door commodity  economies to integrate into the world economy with different  economic sectors under the state management; and the  implementation of a multilateral and diversified foreign policy  to be friends will all nations on the principles of respecting  one another's national independence, sovereignty, equality,  cooperation, and mutual benefits is the duty of all people.  This duty requires a widespread public movement to  satisfactorily carry it out.    The noble and final goal of the party is to serve the  people's interests. The leadership of the party is the  concentration of the people's willpower, aspiration, and  intelligence to outline the developing path and steps and to  educate, organize, and change the mass organizations into great  forces to practice the people's right to mastery and to carry  out the aforementioned noble goal.    The law-governed state of the people, by the people, and for  the people introduces laws to regulate the political, economic,  social, national defense, security, and external affairs  activities for the interests of the fatherland and the public.  It creates favorable conditions for the people to practice and  develop their rights to mastery, improve the material and  spiritual life of their families, contribute to the common  undertaking of the society, achieve happiness for themselves,  and respect other people's freedom and happiness.    To mobilize human and natural resources to implement the  party and state's policy, line, and law for the undertaking of  national construction and protection, the people must be  organized into different mass organizations. These  organizations must really become political foundation and bases  of the party, state, and public forces, working for a common  interest.    For that reason, the Sixth Plenum of the party Central  Committee issued a resolution on the mass motivation work with a  fundamental idea as follows: In the new stage of the revolution,  to make the revolution the people's undertaking, the party,  state, and mass organizations must achieve high results in their  mass motivation work. They must not look down on any social  forces. Only from the continuous perfection of the division and  coordination of the mass motivation content and work scale  between the party, state, and mass organizations and with the  development of a combined strength from all the forces, can we  create great strength for the mass motivation work. The mass  motivation work is a permanent, strategic, and fundamental duty  of the party. From this fundamental conception, we must think  profoundly and review our practical results to clarify and unify  our conceptions to revamp the work content and method of the  fatherland front and mass organizations in the new stage.    Thoroughly understanding this, together with the  implementation of Uncle Ho's teachings and party's resolutions,  the government and mass organizations have been improving the  people's daily life and creating favorable conditions to  generate more jobs, increase people's earnings, secure living  conditions, foster patriotism, eliminate old structures, and  actively contribute, build, perfect, and execute our renovation  and socioeconomic policies.    Our socioeconomic situation, albeit great challenges, is  gaining good developing momentum and scoring important  socioeconomic achievements. In 1993, most of socioeconomic  targets were overfulfilled. These achievements regain the  confidence in the party and its renovation undertaking from the  people, making them more active in the movements for the  increase of business, production, and social activities. That  is the result of the satisfactory implementation of party  resolutions, including the important Resolution No. 8 of the  sixth party plenum.    However, facing new requirements, we must continue to  practically and profoundly review exemplary models to upgrade  the mass motivation work to its new duties.    1. Strengthening the party leadership is an important factor  to accelerate activities of the fatherland front, mass  organizations, and public movements. The party performs its  mass motivation work through guidelines and policies. Correct  policies will create a great strength for public movements. For  example, the correct policy of contractual system in agriculture  has motivated peasants to increase agricultural production. The  party must regularly listen to public opinions to quickly  correct and amend its policies.    The party considers the guidance and motivation of the  public  for the construction of a law-governed state of the people, by  the people, and for the people is the foremost duty of the mass  motivation work in the new stage. It also creates favorable  conditions to motivate the public to carry out the party's  political duty and line. The party chapters and members working  in the state organs must concretize the party's line and  resolutions into government's decisions and policies. Through  work experience and training, the party assigns good citizens  with good morality, a sense of professionalism, and social  management skills to government positions to maintain national  order and counter waste and corruption.    The party directs the National Assembly elections  adequately in order to choose highly qualified and competent  deputies to represent the people's will and aspirations as well  as the common interests of the nation as a whole. It directs  the formulation and perfection of laws, regulations, policies,  citizens' rights and duties, statutes, and practices at  grassroots installations. It guides the establishment of  administrative organs at all levels, keeping in mind the need to  streamline their personnel organization to make them neat and  effective and avoid overlapping work and delays, which cause  obstacles and inconveniences for the people.    It is necessary to make use of party papers and other party  propaganda instruments to propagate the party's policies and  lines among the masses and motivate everyone to implement all  party resolutions. It is important to step up educational  activities to promote public awareness of false arguments and  foil attempts by hostile forces to distort the truth and  implement their peaceful evolution strategy.    The party directs the front and mass societies by helping  them formulate their orientations, guidelines, objectives, and  tasks. The party does not exert direct leadership over work  implementation. Instead, it uses the activities of party groups  and party members assigned to each organization to fulfill its  leadership role and apply its resolutions to the practical  action programs of the front and mass societies. Each  organization should be given the chance to hold democratic  discussions to decide on the content of its action program.    Through their separate guidelines and control work, party  committee echelons discover and develop progressive elements in  production and business organizations, as well as in special  task force units and mass societies. It is necessary to assign  party cadres and members to oversee or take part in the  activities of mass societies so as to assess the actual  situations of each organization, family, and individual, and  thereby work out appropriate assistance programs. The action  programs of party organizations must include the orientations  and tasks of mass societies. Arrangements must be made for  party committee echelons and party committee secretaries to meet  periodically with the people to hear grievances and resolve  problems.    Party members must not only take the lead in fulfilling the  tasks of the units they are assigned to, but must also set a  good example of high quality and ethics for members of other  organizations to follow. Party members must go out of their way  to serve the people and must always stand ready to direct and  learn from the masses. Let them hold discussions with the people  and help them make their legitimate aspirations come true. It  is important to revamp party organizations; screen the  contingent of party members; and get rid of opportunistic,  corrupt, and deviant elements. It is necessary to put an end to  unreasonable favors and privileges. Constant efforts must be  made to build and develop the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union.  Practical measures must be taken to accelerate party-building  work among the youth, and to ensure that this task receives  close guidance.    Party committee echelons in charge of providing guidance  for mass motivation work have a fundamental duty to closely link  party building -- especially the building of grass-roots party  organizations -- with the building of the administration and  mass organizations. Mass motivation work must be carried out in  conjunction with and through the implementation of specific  political tasks.    2. Our state is a law-governing state of the people, by the  people, and for the people. Therefore, it has a very heavy duty  toward the cause of mass motivation. President Ho Chi Minh  said: "Administrative cadres, mass organization cadres, and  members of the various mass organizations such as the Lien Viet  [Vietnamese Alliance], the Viet Minh [Vietnamese Independence  League], and others must all be responsible for mass motivation  work." (Su That newspaper, 15 October 1949). President Ho put  mass motivation work on top of other activities of the  administration. This is because when there is a ruling party,  public administration will become a main function of the state  and will be carried out by means of laws and policies. In the  same token, the state must carry out mass motivation mainly by  means of laws and policies. These laws and policies must  reflect party policies and lines and must be compatible with the  people's aspirations and interests. They must become a  tremendous driving force for the mass movement.    The state's working mechanism must create favorable  conditions and environment legislatively, economically,  politically, culturally, and socially, and in terms of national  security and development so the people can feel secure in doing  their business and can take the initiative in developing their  production and business and organizing their own material and  cultural life.    We must work out a correct system of laws, creating  conditions for the people to carry out their production and  business, broaden their branches and trades, and enrich  themselves legally. Earlier, the government was anxious about  finding enough food for the people to subsist on. Now it is  concerned about the question of how to clear up the surplus  foodgrain and how to produce high quality rice for export. The  pace of house construction and of neighborhood and urban  renovation among the people has been very fast, far beyond the  imagination of many people.    The administration must work out substantive policies and  systems for various areas of work in a correct and flexible way  capable of keeping the people's activities under control.    The party and various mass organizations must also  participate in the supervision of this issue.    The state must spread explanatory propaganda on the laws so  the people can clearly understand and comply with them.  Satisfactorily resolving various issues -- such as the issue of  "doing away with hunger and easing poverty;" the issue of  maintaining public order and security; the issue of education,  public health, and culture; the issue of caring for those with  meritorious deeds, for the families of disabled soldiers and  fallen heroes, and for retired cadres; and the issue of caring  for and providing assistance to people in dire straits -- by the  administration at all levels is also part of our mass motivation  work.    Attention must be paid to various organizations at the  village, ward, and hamlet levels such as urban household groups  which are the lowest organizations in close contact with the  people. Such a self- governing popular organization, which  controls not more than 15 families, is an appropriate and  effective format which is designed to control each family and  each group of families while caring for the life of people and  resolving problems relating to the people in compliance with the  resolutions and policies of the party Central Committee and the  government.    The administration must use the mass media sysem to carry  out  its mass motivation work. The mass media is a highly sensitive  and effective tool of the party and the state for carrying out  mass motivation work. We must expand our radio and television  transmission signals, especially radio transmission signals, to  many localities in order to bring messages of the central  authority to households. The party must direct mass  organizations to join with the government in satisfactorily  stepping up the activities of the mass media in the right  direction.    Schools must be places where people are educated and trained  to become educated persons with good ethical qualities.  Teachers of both sexes must be active cadres in mass  motivation, trying to build good people. We must bear in mind  the need to improve the qualities of the education sector so it  can become an effective tool for mass motivation. We must use  the people's Armed Forces to carry out mass motivation work in  various areas, particularly in remote and mountain areas.</p>

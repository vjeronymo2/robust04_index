			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Hata faces motion of no confidence Japan's Liberal Democratic party, the country's largest political opposition group, yesterday launched a no-confidence motion against the minority government. The attack came after the upper house of parliament finally agreed this year's national budget, three months after it was due to take effect. The LDP and other opposition parties had agreed a political amnesty until Japan's national finances were assured. The five-party coalition of Mr Tsutomu Hata responded by boosting its campaign to entice the Social Democratic Party to rejoin the government, in the hope of restoring its parliamentary majority. Mr Hata was closeted last night with Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Socialist leader, in a last-ditch attempt to save his two-month-old administration. The LDP attack paralysed attempts to resolve the US-Japan trade deadlock, a factor in the recent currency turmoil, forcing Mr Koji Kakizawa, Japan's foreign minister, to shelve next weekend's talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. Mr Hata admitted his government's fate hung on the result of talks with the Socialists. 'I would like to stake everything, including whether to resign, on the policy talks between the coalition and the Socialist Party,' he said. The Socialists left the government in late April in anger at the formation of a right-wing group excluding them. Mr Hata said if he did resign, he would not call a general election, but leave it to opposition parties to form a new government. An election would delay the final phase of electoral reform: the redrawing of electoral boundaries. Japan's move from a multi-seat electoral system to a mix of proportional representation and single-seat districts would benefit parties such as Mr Hata's Renewal Party. If the SDP joins the coalition, the vote will fail. But up to 20 SDP MPs could ignore such a call, when the coalition's survival would hang by a thread.</p>

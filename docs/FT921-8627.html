			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: Community housing scheme HUNT THOMPSON ASSOCIATES (HTA) has been appointed as community architects by the Waltham Forest Housing Action Trust for the redevelopment of three 1960s high rise estates. The three estates are Cathall Road, Leytonstone, Oliver Close, Leyton, and Chingford Hall, Chingford. Under the proposals most of the 2,100 high rise flats will be demolished in phases and their occupants will work with the architects on the design of the new two or three-storey homes which will be built to house them. The appointment of HTA covers the preparation of a masterplan for the redevelopment of each of the estates.</p>

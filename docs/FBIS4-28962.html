			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of People's Armed Forces arranged a  banquet for a high-level military delegation of Vietnam, which  is visiting our country, at the Mansudae Assembly Hall on the  evening of 14 June.    Invited at the banquet were delegates led by General Doan  Khue, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of  Vietnam and minister of national defense, and Duong Chinh Thuc,  Vietnamese ambassador to our country.    Comrade O Chin-u, member of the Presidium of the Political  Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea  [WPK] and minister of People's Armed Forces; Kim Kwang-chin,  vice marshal of the Korean People's Army [KPA]; Col. Gen. Pak  Chae-kyong; Lt. Gen. Pak Sung-won; and other generals and  officers of the KPA were also on hand.    Comrade O Chin-u made a speech at the banquet. He warmly  welcomed the delegation's visit to our country and said that its  recent visit will serve as a momentum in promoting traditional  relations of cooperation and friendship between the two  countries onto a higher stage.    He said that the fraternal Vietnamese people and army are  invariably marching along the road of socialism which they  themselves chose, and are achieving great results in the  struggle for building prosperous socialist Vietnam and  strengthening the country's defense power, by upholding the will  of President Ho Chi Minh. He said that they were very pleased  with this and hoped that greater results would be achieved in  the course of future struggle.    Comrade O Chin-u pointed out that our people and the  officers  and men of the army are overflowing with confidence and optimism  that we will be ever-victorious as long as the supreme commander  Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership exists as they strive  vigorously for socialist construction and for the independent,  peaceful reunification of the country.    He said that the United States and its follower forces are  intensifying more than ever before, anti-Republic maneuvers to  isolate and crush our country's socialist system by finding  fault with the fictitious nuclear issue of ours. He also said  the government of our Republic took self-defense measures of  immediately withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] and no longer allowing any inspections against the  IAEA Secretariat's shameless maneuvers of demanding the agency's  overall [chonmyon] inspections with the threat of sanctions.    He stressed that our people and the officers and men of the  People's Army will defend, adhere to, and develop, the popular  masses-centered socialism of our own-style under the wise  leadership of the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, and  will unfailingly realize the historic cause of national  reunification. Our people will accelerate the socialist  construction of the two countries, will fight with the fraternal  Vietnamese people to build an independent, peaceful, and  prosperous great Asia, and, on this course, will make positive  efforts to strengthen and develop friendly relations with  Vietnam, he said.    Next, National Defense Minister Doan Khue made a speech. He  expressed gratitude for the warm welcome given to the  delegation. Saying that Vietnam and the DPRK are socialist  countries which have a tradition of friendly relations formed by  the respected Comrade President Ho Chi Minh and the respected  Comrade President Kim Il-song, he stated that the two countries  have supported and helped each other in the arduous yet glorious  struggle for national independence, the country's reunification,  and socialist construction.    National Defense Minister Doan Khue said that today's  situation calls on Vietnam and the DPRK to be firmly united in  the struggle against the imperialists' plot to terminate  socialism. He said that we were happy about the great results  achieved by the DPRK people and the People's Army in the  struggle to lay the material basis for socialism and to  peacefully reunify the country without the interference of  outside forces, and under the leadership of the WPK headed by  the respected Comrade President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim  Chong-il, the supreme commander of the KPA.    He said he firmly believes that the DPRK people and the  People's Army, with their steel-like conviction, and energetic  and creative labor, will overcome all sorts of difficulties and  trials, and achieve a new result in the struggle for socialist  construction and the country's independent, peaceful  reunification.    Saying that he is happy that the people of the two countries  have strengthened and developed friendship and unity in the  past, he emphasized that this has contributed to consolidating  cooperation and development not only between the two countries,  but also in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. He said that  the delegation's recent visit to the DPRK will contribute to  further promote friendship and unity between the people and army  of the two countries.    The participants of the banquet proposed a toast for the  fraternal friendship and unity between the people and army of  the DPRK and Vietnam; for the long life of the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song; for the long life of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander of the KPA; for the  long life of General Secretary Do Muoi; and for the long life of  the respected Comrade President Le Duc Anh.</p>

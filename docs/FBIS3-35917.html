			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev received  today the Russian president's personal representative Vladimir  Kazimirov.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Is there any  chance  of yet another initiative by the Russian government succeeding?  And, who stands to gain from Vladimir Kazimirov's visit to  Azerbaijan? These were the questions which most concerned my  colleagues who had come to shed light on the talks held today  between President Geydar Aliyev and the Russian president's  personal representative Vladimnir Kazimirov.    Vladimir Kazimirov again reiterated during this visit to  Azerbaijan that Russia has not changed its previous proposals  for the peaceful resolution of the conflict, and, in his  opinion, it is far more appropriate and useful to renegotiate  the peace conditions advanced during the previous consultations  than to put forward a new idea each time.    Geydar Aliyev said that the Azerbaijani side has often  supported the peace initiative and exerted every effort for the  elimination of this meaningless war but every time the Armenian  side attached no importance to these proposals.    Kazimirov noted that this time around the concrete aim of  his  visit to Baku was to submit proposals for the establishment of a  cease-fire as of 1 February; and Russia calls on the sides to  endorse this initiative by remaining in their present positions.    The Azerbaijani president replied to this proposal by  advancing consistent and convincing evidence. [passage omitted]    Vladimir Kazimirov mentioned another point in an effort to  have Aliyev change his mind. Kazimirov argued that a new  chairman of CSCE Minsk Group has been appointed and it would be  good if he took up his duties tomorrow morning with a report  that a cease-fire has been achieved in Nagorno-Karabakh.    Geydar Aliyev's reply clarified this issue. [Aliyev  statement in Russian omitted]    After the conversation, the republic's president announced  his concrete proposals. [passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, and State Adviser Vafa  Gulizade were also present at the meeting. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Canada's junk provides some rich pickings THE CRIPPLED and convalescing companies which litter Canada's business landscape have offered rich pickings to investors willing to pay less heed to credit-rating agencies than to their own instincts. In a local adaptation of the US junk-bond market, a large number of US and, more recently, Canadian investors have put their money into corporate securities well below the grade normally favoured by pension funds and other institutions. The returns have in many cases been spectacular. Bonds issued by Stelco, Canada's second-biggest steelmaker, traded as low as 30 cents to the CDollars late last year when it looked as if the company might go to the wall. They are now changing hands at close to par. Participants agree that the best is probably over for the 'distressed' sector of the market, comprising companies which have filed or come close to filing for bankruptcy protection. They include bonds issued by buildings owned by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property developer, and Royal Trust, the financial institution in the process of being rescued by Royal Bank of Canada. But opportunities still appear to be lurking among another troubled group of companies, described by one trader as 'below investment-grade'. The companies seem likely to survive the tough times of the early 1990s, but their finances have been strained to the point that credit-rating agencies have cut their ratings below investment-grade level. One money manager cites the example of 10-year bonds issued by MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry group. Rated BBB-high by Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto, the spread between the Macblo bonds and the equivalent government of Canada bonds has already shrunk from 3 percentage points to about 1.9 points. Another portfolio manager points to a series of 10-year first mortgage bonds secured by leasehold improvements at three Westin hotels in Canada. The bonds were issued at a spread of 1.25 percentage points in 1988. The spread is now 6 percentage points. Other companies in troubled sectors whose bonds have become popular include Four Seasons Hotels, Domtar and Canadian Pacific Forest Products (both pulp and paper companies), and Scott's Hospitality (restaurants). The Canadian high-yield market was spurred by US 'vulture funds' looking for fresh opportunities, and the reluctance of conservative Canadian institutions to become involved with securities of dubious credit quality. 'The Canadians didn't understand value in liquidation,' says one market maker. 'The Americans are accustomed to that sort of thing.' One sign of US interest is that Goldman Sachs, the New York-based investment bank, has brought a credit analyst to its Toronto office to seek investment opportunities among corporate Canada's walking wounded. Some Canadian portfolio managers, such as Lincludin Management of Oakville, Ontario, have joined the bandwagon. Local securities dealers, including Richardson Greenshields and RBC Dominion Securities of Toronto, have also become more active in trading distressed and below-investment-grade securities. Several investment managers say that the market in 'below investment-grade' securities springs largely from the poor judgments of Canadian rating agencies. Confidence in local rating groups was especially undermined by their late recognition of the severity of the problems at property developer, Olympia &amp; York. In this respect it is perhaps significant that Standard &amp; Poor's has recently opened an office in Toronto, and that Moody's is in the process of following suit.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Ofgas aims to curb speculators Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, has proposed tough criteria to stop speculators and independent gas companies abusing the system which allocates supplies from British Gas reserves to its competitors. A consultation paper published yesterday proposed two options for the gas release programme, which was set up in 1992 to stimulate early competition by selling British Gas supplies to independent gas marketers. They are: The introduction of stringent eligibility criteria, requiring applicants to prove they have been active in the market since last October and that they have customers. They would also have to present proof of access to at least 1.5m therms of gas from sources other than the release programme. In addition, recipients of release gas could transfer only 20 per cent of their allocations to other suppliers. The price would be the weighted average cost of gas purchased from British Gas plus a wholesaling fee of 0.25 pence per therm. A postal auction of 200m therms of gas. Companies would bid for packages of gas, which would vary according to factors such as different entry terminals. All independent gas marketers who can demonstrate a trading track record would be eligible, although no single bidder could buy more than 20 per cent of the total. Ofgas said it had asked British Gas to make more gas available for an auction-based system to stimulate the development of a spot market in gas trading, but British Gas declined to do so. The regulator last year took over control of the release programme from the Office of Fair Trading after complaints that speculators were dominating the auctions. In 1992, 32 companies qualified for the programme under rules which guarantee them access to 300m therms of gas during 1994-95. But 70 new applicants emerged in last year's auction. Many were speculators who sold their gas allocations to established companies at inflated prices. Some marketers also made multiple applications under different names. The gas release programme was devised as a temporary solution to enable the marketers to serve industrial and commercial customers while developing their own sources of offshore gas or entering into long-term contracts with gas producers. Ofgas says it is prepared to look at alternative arrangements if there is no clear sign of support for either of its alternatives. February 25 is the deadline for submissions to Ofgas.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Chernov: "Peacemaking in Abkhazia"] </F>   [Text] Sukhumi-Sochi -- It looks as if 26 June has been  set as the latest official date for the start of peacekeeping  operations in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. All news  agencies have been informed that Russian military units, which  are due to take up positions between the warring sides' armed  formations in the next two-three days, have started moving into  Abkhazia. Reports on the specific timing of the introduction of  peacemakers started circulating after the Federation Council, at  its 21 June sitting behind closed doors, adopted a decision on  the use of Russian troops in peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia  and ratified the relevant presidential edict. According to  Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, the military  perceived this decision as an order to act.    In fact, the Russian military have been in action in  Abkhazia  since August 1992. On the eve of the official introduction of  peacemakers in the conflict zone, it would be apt to recall that  military pilots from Russian Air Force subunits based at Gudauta  airfield and servicemen from the 345th Airborne Assault Regiment  transferred from Ganja to Gudauta have been inside this zone  since the very start of the Georgian-Abkhazian war. For almost  two years they have performed the functions of peacemakers:  Transporting people out of the fire zone, helping thousands of  refugees, and -- mainly -- restraining the adversaries by their  presence and preventing them from applying scorched-earth  tactics.    At present the soldiers and officers of the 345th Airborne  Assault Regiment, together with paratroopers from the Volga and  Leningrad Military Districts, are preparing to take up positions  along the Inguri River. Incidentally, the movement of  paratroopers, military construction personnel, sappers,  communications specialists, and their equipment to Gudauta had  already started by the end of May (TRUD reported this in its 2  June 1994 issue). The first subunits arrived in Abkhazia at  that time for the purpose of carrying out serious preparatory  work -- deploying the staff of the peacemaking forces and their  control and command posts, organizing communications, defusing  tens of thousands of mines and demolition charges, repairing  eight bridges.... All the signs indicated that the Russian  peacemakers intend to deploy in Abkhazia and the border region  of western Georgia in depth and for a long time.    Even a press center has been set up for the Russian  peacemaking forces. Its staffers said that preparatory work has  been almost completed and checkpoints will soon start operating  on the highway bridge across the Inguri River along which the  Georgian-Abkhazian border runs and which, until very recently,  has been the dividing line between the adversaries. There are  plans to set up a total of 50 permanent Army checkpoints in the  conflict zone. The total number of Russian "blue helmets" in  Abkhazia will reach 3,000 men.    If truth be said, the Federation Council's decision to use  Russian troops in peacekeeping operations was accepted as a  necessary formality in Sukhumi. Nobody here had any doubt that  the decision would be positive, seeing that the plan for the  separation of the sides and the introduction of "blue helmets"  was already being practically implemented by 21 June. In  accordance with this plan, elaborated and agreed by the  Abkhazian and Georgian military with mediation from Russian  Defense Ministry officers, the region along the Inguri River is  declared a security zone. The zone is 24 km wide (12 km on each  side of the river). All armed formations, together with their  combat equipment of course, will be completely withdrawn from  the zone. The Georgian and Abkhazian positions will come under  the peacemaking forces' control. The plan provides that areas  adjacent to the security zone will be restricted armaments zones  -- areas where the adversaries' military units may be stationed  but without heavy combat equipment. Thus, once the "blue  helmets" have been introduced, the warring sides will find  themselves at a distance in excess of the maximum fire range of  the most powerful artillery systems at their disposal.    The problem of the Kodor Gorge, the scene of heavy fighting  on several occasions this year, has been resolved and,  hopefully, permanently: Under the plan for the separation of  the sides, all Georgian formations in the gorge will be  withdrawn outside Abkhazia, while regular patrols by peacemakers  and UN military observers will operate in population centers  along the banks of the Kodor River.    What will the Russian paratroopers be doing in Abkhazia?  Major General Vasiliy Yakushev, commander of peacemaking  operations in the conflict zone, explained that the tasks facing  the peacemakers stem from the Agreement on Cease-Fire and  Separation of the Sides, which was signed by representatives of  Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia, and the United Nations in Moscow 14  June. The document clearly states that the peacemakers' task is  to monitor the unconditional observance of the cease-fire. In  the event of threatened attack against peacemaking subunits, and  especially in the event of direct attack, they have the right to  take appropriate self-defense measures.    Of course, one of the main purposes of the introduction of  peacemaking forces in Abkhazia is to create conditions for the  return of refugees and displaced persons to the republic. So  far, however, the refugees who are impatiently awaiting  permission to return home, have no cause to rejoice: The finer  details of the procedure for registration and repatriation of  people have yet to be worked out. In my view, the commission  whose task it is to tackle the problems of the refugees'  repatriation will encounter serious complications: I saw no  vacant homes during my visit to Galskiy Rayon. They are  occupied by people whose homes have been destroyed. Where will  they be housed if the homes have to be vacated for their former  occupants?    On the whole, however, the introduction of Russian  peacemaking forces in the Inguri River region is accepted in  Abkhazia calmly, without any fuss. Or, to put it more  accurately, with less fuss than in Russia. People here realize  that the peacemakers will not eliminate the causes which made  the war flare out. According to Abkhazian politicians, the  unrecognized republic will have to live for a long time to come  in conditions of frozen conflict and uncertain political status.  But this is of course better than existing on the brink of  death.</p>

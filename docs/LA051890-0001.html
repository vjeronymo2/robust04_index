			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 111 PROS AND CONS AND ENDING TRAFFIC GRIDLOCK  </P> <P> Ironically, we are faced with a situation where gridlock isn't slowing us down  but actually speeding up our arrival with disaster.  </P> <P> It is time we focus our energies towards solutions instead of creative ways to  occupy our time while stuck in traffic.  </P> <P> I can't count how many times I've longed to be on a commuter train, reading,  rather than inhaling pollutants from hundreds of cars around me. My eyes and  lungs burn to the point of having to keep my windows shut.  </P> <P> Props. 111 and 108 are solutions that will produce noticeable results from our  conscious efforts. I intend to vote yes on Props. 111 and 108.  </P> <P> ALYCIA ANDERSON  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

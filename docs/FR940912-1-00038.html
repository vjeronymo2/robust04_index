			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As currently structured, the proposed rule would make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensive use of the volatile organic concentration (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured by Method 25D). The concentration cutoffs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining if a wastewater stream is an affected stream are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formatted in terms of the volatile organic concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The small quantity cutoff of 1 Mg/yr is calculated using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organic concentration; the effluent concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit is expressed in term of volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration; and the mass removal requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule are calculated using the volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration. The EPA is aware that using the volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic concentration rather than a direct measure of VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does have some limitations and drawbacks. The test method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to measure volatile organic concentration, Method 25D,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is based on volatility (i.e., Henry's Law) and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speciate organic compounds. Therefore, the results may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the presence of compounds that are not considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC (based on their photochemical reactivity). The EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering ways of discounting the non-VOC components of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test results but has not included a means to do so in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulation. One option for accomplishing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be to allow owners or operators the option of using a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test method that speciates VOC. If this approach is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected, provisions could also be made to allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured VOC concentration to be adjusted to represent VO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration by multiplying by the fraction emitted (f <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values reported in the IWW CTG. The EPA also intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include an alternative percent reduction standard based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the stripability of specific volatile organic constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach is also described in the IWW CTG. Because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issues associated with the use of method 25D for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability and compliance determinations, the EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soliciting comments all aspects of this approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 1 is to require emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only of those SOCMI process unit wastewater streams having a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organic concentration at the point of wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation equal to or greater than 1,000 ppmw and a flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate greater than or equal to 10 Lpm. Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 2 is to require emission control only of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI process unit wastewater streams having a volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic concentration at the point of wastewater generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equal to or greater than 800 ppmw and a flow rate greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than or equal to 5 Lpm. Regulatory Alternative 3 is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require emission control only of those SOCMI process unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams having a volatile organic concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the point of wastewater generation equal to or greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 500 ppmw and a flow rate greater than or equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 Lpm. Regulatory Alternative 4 is to require emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control only of those SOCMI process unit wastewater streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having a volatile organic concentration at the point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater generation equal to or greater than 100 ppmw and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a flow rate greater than or equal to 1 Lpm. Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives 1 through 4 also have a maximum volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic concentration limit whereby any wastewater stream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a volatile organic concentration above the limit would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require emission control regardless of the wastewater stream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow rate; for Regulatory Alternatives 1 through 4, the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum concentration limit of 10,000 ppmw was used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternatives analysis. Regulatory Alternative 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to require air emission control for all SOCMI process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit wastewater streams with any detectable volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration as determined at the point of wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation (i.e., a volatile organic concentration action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of 0 ppmw).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA estimated nationwide VOC emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would be achieved by implementing air rules based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each of the five regulatory alternatives; the EPA also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated the capital and annual cost of achieving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reductions and the nonair quality environmental and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy impacts associated with each regulatory alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These estimates of emissions and costs reflect the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts in the fifth year following promulgation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSPS. The methodology used to develop estimates of VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions and other impacts within the SOCMI source category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the five regulatory alternatives is based on the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a model plant analysis and is discussed in detail in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 6 of the BID and in docket number A&hyph;94&hyph;32.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model plants are typically defined to represent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected facility over a range of sizes corresponding to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range found in the regulated industry. Two previous EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies developed model plants that relate to emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams at SOCMI facilities: the Guideline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Series Document for the Control of Volatile Organic Compound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions from Industrial Wastewater (EPA&hyph;453/D&hyph;93&hyph;056,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1992 Draft) and the BID related to the development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the HON (EPA&hyph;453/D&hyph;92&hyph;016, November 1992). The EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed model plants for the SOCMI wastewater NSPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory analysis by making use of information, data, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodologies developed in these previous studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

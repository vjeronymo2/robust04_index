			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Gummer to brush aside 'Nimbys' Mr John Gummer, environ-ment secretary, yesterday promised to sweep aside unreasonable objections to new roads and housing and other developments needed to strengthen the economy, Ivor Owen writes. He told a fringe meeting the Nimby (not in my backyard) attitudes of those who oppose any development in their area whatever its merits derived from an antagonistic view of growth and a misunderstanding of the nature of conservation. 'Nimbyism describes an obsession with the bric-a-brac of the past and the substitution of preservation for conservation.' Mr Gummer said this approach would be rejected whenever it appeared, whether houses, businesses or roads were the target. He sympathised with those miscast as Nimbys when they had legitimate objections to inappropriate development. They were rightly concerned about intrusive buildings which made no pretence of being an integral part of a town or village, or when they saw the same designs and materials used in towns with widely differing characteristics.</p>

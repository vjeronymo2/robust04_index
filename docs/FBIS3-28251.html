The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  ruling  coalition parties had planned to adopt the package this week,  but political turmoil over tax issues has forced a delay at  least until Monday.    Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said, "there is no time to  spare in implementing a comprehensive stimulative package,  including a major income tax cut."    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said "economic recovery will  come later than expected."    He said Hosokawa may come under strong pressure from the  United States to implement an income tax cut when he meets  President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11.    "The most urgent task facing the government and coalition  parties is to get the weak economy back in good shape as soon as  possible while keeping political reforms from retreating any  further," Nagano said.    In this connection, Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of  electronics giant NEC Corp., called on Hosokawa to show strong  leadership.</p>

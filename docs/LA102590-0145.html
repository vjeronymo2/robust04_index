			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BARS:  </P> <P> The Village Inn, 127 Marine Ave., Balboa Island. Open daily, 7 a.m. to 9:30  p.m. (714) 675-8300.  </P> <P> People here tend to be a little older than the kids you find thronging many  beachside bars. The atmosphere's informal, friendly and real. And the fireplace  and couches in the corner make it just perfect for winter nights. MIKE FLAGG  </P></p>

Two others have been  arrested pending legal moves to hold them under administrative  detention. However, Kakh leader Barukh Marzel, who heads the  authorities' wanted list, remains at large. Summing up the  situation is reporter Alan Ben-'Ami:    Currently in jail on a three-month administrative detention  warrant are Shmu'el Ben-Yishay, Shmu'el Ben-Ya'aqov, Eyal Noqed,  Bentziyon Gobstein, and No'am Federman, the spokesman for the  Kakh movement. Kakh leader Barukh Marzel remains at large. He  is the No. 1 wanted man at the moment, and his wife Sara told  reporters today that she remains a declared Kakh activist and  she taunted police to come and arrest her along with the wives  of the other activists who are currently in administrative  detention. Two people who are currently under arrest, but not  in administrative detention are Barukh Ben-Yosef, a Kakh member,  and Mikha'el Ben-Horin, a former Kakh member who is the  self-styled president of the State of Judaea. Both these people  must appear before a district court if they are going to be put  in administrative detention. Ben-Horin appeared at the Nazareth  District Court today. He was kept under arrest until next  Sunday, when the court will decide whether in fact he will be  put in administrative detention. Ben-Yosef is due to appear  before the Jerusalem District Court tomorrow with regard to his  case.    Another development today was the questioning by police of  Rabbi Moshe Levinger of Hebron and his wife on charges that they  had been involved in various disturbances several months ago in  Hebron. Levinger is due to appear tomorrow in court to answer  police charges. That is the situation at the moment. Police  say that other arrests could well come in the days ahead but  they are keeping very quiet on who it may be and where the  arrests may take place.</p>

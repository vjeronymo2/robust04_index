			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Murray Enterprise lifts net asset value by 40% MURRAY ENTERPRISE yesterday belied recent problems in the venture capital trust sector with a 40 per cent rise in net asset value per share over the year to September 30. The recession's impact on small businesses and the difficulty of valuing unquoted holdings has caused problems at investment trusts such as Drayton Consolidated and Gresham House. Murray Enterprise's portfolio was strengthened by the flotation of two of its US investments, Fleet Call and Centigram. Four unlisted investments were also realised for a total consideration of Pounds 1.67m. Since the end of the financial period, the directors have announced that due to the strengthening of the US dollar and a rise in share prices of two of the US holdings, the net asset value has increased to 162p per share. During the year, the trust redeemed some Pounds 2.48m of loan stock, which increased net assets per share by 5.25p. The trust's aim is capital growth, not income. Nevertheless, the trust received a one-off dividend from an unlisted investment last year. Since investment trust rules require the distribution of income, Murray Enterprise will make a dividend payment of Pounds 125,000 in July 1993.</p>

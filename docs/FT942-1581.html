			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Air France asked to speed up sale of hotels chain The French government has asked Air France, the state-owned airline, to re-open negotiations with bidders for a controlling stake in its Meridien Hotels chain for a rapid conclusion of the sale. The negotiations will be based on a report by France's privatisation commission, an independent body which advises the government on the sale of public sector assets, according to the economics ministry yesterday. Forte, the UK hotels group, and Accor of France, are vying for control of the Meridien, in which Air France holds a 57 per cent stake. A decision on their bids was delayed in April and the dossier was sent to the privatisation commission for its opinion. The economics ministry said Mr Edmond Alphandery had recently received the views of the privatisation commission on the relative merits of the two bids. The ministry said the report identified the questions which needed to be discussed in greater detail with the bidders. However, it indicated that it did not express an overall preference. Once an agreement has been reached between Air France and the successful bidder, the choice will be presented to the privatisation commission. No deadline has been set. Yesterday's announcement coincided with news that the Meridian hotels group fell into a net loss of FFr29.7m (Dollars 5.3m) for 1993, compared with a profit of FFr112m for 1992. The battle for control of Meridien has become highly sensitive. Forte's is the higher bid, valuing the luxury hotel chain at FFr1.8bn compared with the FFr1.6bn offered by Accor and its partner, Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talaal of Saudi Arabia. Meridien's management has expressed a preference for the Forte bid, but political pressure has been brought to bear to keep the hotels chain under French control. Forte yesterday welcomed the French government's call for the decision to be taken quickly. It said that further delay could lead to Meridien managers leaving and the chain losing contracts to manage hotels. It said it expected to be given further details of the government announcement in the next few days. Air France, which suffered losses of FFr8.48bn last year, needs to raise cash to reduce debts.</p>

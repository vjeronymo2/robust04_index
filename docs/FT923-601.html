			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / People: Gregory's new chapter at Pentos Clive Gregory is returning to Pentos, the booksellers and office equipment retailers - to the same position he left ten years ago. He will be group finance director, and will replace Patrick Hooper, whom Gregory recruited in 1977. Hooper moves to 'another public company' shortly to be announced. In the meantime, Gregory has been chief executive of greenhouse and conservatory manufacturer Halls Homes &amp; Gardens, a management buyout company he took out of Pentos in 1982, and floated on the USM four years later. The company has just gone into receivership, following the loss of its biggest customer, B&amp;Q. Gregory, however, left last November, when he says he had done all he could do in terms of cost cutting and asset reduction. 'It was set reasonably fair then,' he contends. But Halls Homes &amp; Gardens' market has been particularly badly hit by the slump in consumer confidence - even if Pentos company secretary Mark Jenner admits to buying a conservatory from the company this year. Gregory, 49, who says he thinks he has aged ten years in the last decade while Terry Maher, 56, the combative Pentos boss, has advanced 'only about seven years', is returning to a very different business. In 1982 books were only one, if the largest, of six divisions among activities such as engineering and construction. Since then Pentos has built the Dillons and Athena networks and acquired Rymans. Gregory has been reacquainting himself with Pentos in the past six months by advising on the integration of Wilding Office Equipment, as well as a small MBO of the parts of Wilding, acquired earlier in the year, that Pentos did not want. When it was apparent Hooper wanted to leave, the company says it engaged in a full executive search, and then chose Gregory. ***** Maurice Oberstein (left), the New Yorker who became one of the British music industry's most prominent figures, is to retire as chairman and chief executive of PolyGram UK at the end of the year. He will be replaced by Roger Ames, currently managing director of London Records, a joint venture with PolyGram. Oberstein, 64, came to the UK in 1965 to work for CBS Records as chief manufacturing engineer. He became chairman of CBS Records in the UK in 1978 and chairman of the UK arm of PolyGram in 1985. During his seven-year stint, PolyGram UK's market share rose from 15 to 24 per cent. Oberstein is chairman of the council of the British Phonographic Industry, a post he held from 1983 to 1986 and to which he was re-elected last year. He will remain a member of PolyGram International's management team, responsible for Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The Trinidad-born Ames worked for EMI UK before joining PolyGram's Phonogram division in 1979. Since 1983 he has been managing director of London Records, which he owns jointly with PolyGram and Tracey Bennett. Under his leadership, London Records developed such acts as Bronski Beat, Bananarama and Fine Young Cannibals.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Ion Iliescu by Larisa Ivshyna, </F> deputy editor in chief of the Russian-language Ukrainian daily  KIEVSKIYE VEDOMSTI; place and date not given -- "translated from  the Russian-language audio recording"]    [Text] [Ivshyna] I believe that the people of Ukraine  want their country to be part of a united Europe. As far as we  are concerned, it is obvious that this is also one of the  characteristic features of Romania's foreign policy. At the  same time, the Ukrainians would like to know your opinion on  this and also whether your are satisfied with the relations with  your neighbors, particularly Ukraine.    [Iliescu] Regarding your first question, I believe this is  the common desire of all European countries, which is in  accordance with the new trend in the evolution of international  relations on our continent. The old state of affairs and the  old division of the continent into two parts have been done away  with. The old opposing military alliances and  political-ideological divisions have been abandoned. I believe  that all European countries are now moving toward the  establishment of a new climate of general integration of all  European countries into a single community. Of course, this  does not exclude the existence of good relations with one's  neighbors. Therefore, our foreign policy is aimed at developing  overall relations with all the European countries, while also  improving relations with neighboring countries, primarily  Ukraine, since both our countries are going through the same  difficult period of changes. I believe it is to our mutual  benefit to have good-neighborly relations.    [Ivshyna] The first question was rather diplomatic, while  the second one had more to do with the human aspects of  relations between people. For instance, when I left Kiev, it  was no easy matter to get to Bucharest. I would have liked to  have been able to board a plane in Kiev and fly directly to  Bucharest. Will that become possible? That would be a good  sign in view of the fact that we are, after all, close  neighbors. Do you not think that we can move toward closer  economic cooperation if we develop our transportation links? Is  this a real possibility?    [Iliescu] I believe that we will find ways and means of  facilitating these links as well as the human links so that  people can communicate more easily with one another. In this  way, we will also be able to eliminate the relics and vestiges  of the past, when we proclaimed "fraternal relations" between  our countries, while extremely tough and forbidding obstacles  were being raised to block communications between people. I  believe that, with the development of democratic structures in  our countries, we will manage to establish new and good links  for direct communication.    [Ivshyna] As far as I know, you are already expected in Kiev  and we hope that you will meet with our president there. Could  you specify when that visit is going to take place?    [Iliescu] I hope that we will be able to pay this visit to  Kiev in 1994 and meet with President Kravchuk.    [Ivshyna] Will the visit take place at the beginning of the  year?    [Iliescu] This will be established through democratic [as  published] channels.    [Ivshyna] I hope we will not have to wait too long.    [Iliescu] No. I believe it will take place in the first  half of the year.    [Ivshyna] In this regard, I would like to ask you another  question, one which is equally important for us, namely whether  work is proceeding on the drafting of a treaty between our  countries and whether you expect it to be signed in the near  future. If this is not the case, maybe you can tell us if there  are any obstacles to its drafting. Or maybe the drafting of the  treaty is not so important as its essence.    [Iliescu] Right now, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs is elaborating a political document -- a political  statement -- to be signed by the two presidents. I believe that  we will manage to finish it so that we can meet and sign it in  the first half of 1994. This will be a good signal for the  overall development of our relations.    Of course, there are various problems between our countries.  History has left us a difficult inheritance regarding  territories and borders, but we are approaching these issues  realistically by taking into consideration the new realities  prevailing on the continent and between our countries. In view  of these realities, we must find political solutions to all  these problems in order to promote a climate of good  neighborliness between us.    [Ivshyna] Mr. President, you are known as a man with  progressive views in Ukraine. We do not think of you as a  revolutionary in politics, but rather as a politician who  believes in consensus, something which is good for politics,  since the people are tired and want some quiet for a change.  They seem to think that, if things proceed at a slower pace,  such a process may ensure that confrontations can be avoided. I  realize that a politician of your caliber must take into  consideration the entire political spectrum. In this respect,  it would be very important for our countries to engage in a  dialogue of trust so as to dispel the doubts nurtured by some  people in Ukraine. I am referring to the problem that might  hamper the signing of a treaty between our countries, namely the  territorial problem. If I understand correctly, the real issue  is the recognition of existing borders.    [Iliescu] The problem raised by you is a complex one. I  consider myself a revolutionary but also a politician who is a  realist. I was at the center of all the events that  characterized the Romanian revolution that was spontaneous and  tougher than all the upheavals that took place in the other  countries. This has also led to an abrupt change in the  political structures. Romanian society was given a  revolutionary jolt but, then, we had to create new structures,  foster new relations between people, establish a democratic  climate in political and social life, reorganize the economy,  and implement economic reforms, something which requires a  climate of overall cooperation among all the constructive forces  in society. This requires exactly what you have just said,  namely an open approach to all problems and an open attitude  toward all social categories and all political and social  forces. This is what I am striving to achieve in my practical  activity and what is important for international relations too.  In other words, there is the need to tackle concrete situations  in a realistic and unbiased manner, something which can create a  good climate for the development of international relations.  This is what we are trying to accomplish in our foreign policy.    [Ivshyna] Of course, there are also certain people in  Romania who disagree with this and demand a radical solution.  What is your attitude toward them?    [Iliescu] We are trying to solve all these problems through  dialogue because there are also persons who maintain that the  Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact was not only antidemocratic but also  illegal and that we must reestablish the rights of all states  and nations proceeding from the historical realities and on the  basis of the legal principles governing relations between  states. At the same time, as I have already said, one must take  into consideration the prevailing realities because nothing good  can come out of any other approach.    [Ivshyna] The approach suggested by the extremists is very  dangerous.    [Iliescu] Yes, because it would upset the entire situation  in Europe. Such problems exist not only between our countries  but practically between all countries. Let us just take Ukraine  for example. You have similar problems with the Slovaks, Poles,  Russians, and so forth.    [Ivshyna] That would be tantamount to opening a "Pandora's  box...."    [Iliescu] Germany also has such problems. I am referring to  Koenigsberg that has become Kaliningrad and so forth. If one  starts delving into this problem, there is going to be no end in  sight. Therefore, I believe that the only realistic approach to  the problem is a political one that takes into account existing  realities. All efforts should be made to create a good climate  for relations between states.    [Ivshyna] You said that you do not speak Russian very well  but I see that your Russian is very good.    [Iliescu] I have some difficulties in speaking it.    [Ivshyna] I would like to ask you how you assess the  economic situation in Romania. It seems to me that you started  from a very low level, under very harsh conditions, and have now  advanced to creating the mechanism of a market economy, whereas  Ukraine has probably reached the "critical point" regarding its  problems right now. Your experience would be very useful to us,  particularly since you recently held consultations with the  opposition that has expressed its dissatisfaction with the  government's activities. How do you assess the current efforts  to promote the process of reform?    [Iliescu] There are two aspects to economic life. On the  one hand, the difficulties created by the "overthrow" within the  country; that is to say, the very rigid and centralized  framework and system of economic management of the past was  destroyed overnight, at the start of 1990, something which has  led to a number of hardships in the development of economic  relations within the country. This is one of the aspects. The  second one is the collapse of our system of international  economic relations particularly with our neighbors -- members of  the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance -- and the  entire space of the former Soviet Union that was our main  partner and a very important source of raw and energy materials  as well as an important market for the sale of our industrial  products. This has been primarily reflected in the fall in  industrial production. At this time, our industrial enterprises  are operating at half their capacity, something which is  obviously creating great social hardships, particularly due to  unemployment and inflation.    [Ivshyna] The number of unemployed has reached almost one  million in Romania. Is this true?    [Iliescu] Yes. It is about one million.    [Ivshyna] Has it reached the figure of one million? Or  maybe even exceeded it?    [Iliescu] Yes, it is maybe more than a million. However, as  early as the first half of 1990, we started taking steps to open  up our economic system and redress our economic situation by  giving impetus to the private sector. At this time, the private  sector is playing quite an important role in our economy, with a  share of more than 30 percent of the labor force. There are  over 400,000 private enterprises: The first ones appeared in  the trade network, then they extended to services. Now, there  are also several small and medium-sized production enterprises.  The aforementioned sector is already playing a very active role  in the economy, contributing to a reduction in the level of  unemployment that otherwise might have been even higher.    At the same time, we have been implementing economic reform  since 1990, proceeding from an early study on the structure of  our economy. That study also represented a first attempt to put  together a single strategy for economic reform. We set up a  group of experts and economists from various fields, including  experts in macroeconomy, who elaborated the general outline of  this economic reform: The liberalization of all elements of  economic relations and the restructuring of the entire economy,  industry, and so forth. It is on this basis that we have taken  certain measures in the direction of privatization. The  large-scale privatization process is being implemented at a  slower pace. We have reorganized industry in its entirety.  Some 6,000 industrial enterprises have been reorganized and  turned into commercial companies that, in turn, will be  transformed into private enterprises on a share-holding basis.  However, this process will last a long time due to a shortage  of capital for the purchase of those shares. However, in order  to facilitate this process, 30 percent of the social capital of  these enterprises has been distributed free of charge to all  citizens over 18 years of age in the form of value bonds, while  the government plans to turn these bonds into shares in 1994.  About a third of the 6,000 enterprises will be privatized in  1994. Measures have been taken to liberalize domestic and  foreign trade activity as well as prices. This has been a more  difficult process; it resulted in the emergence of a number of  social problems during the first half of 1993. The entire  system of taxes and revenues has been changed with the  introduction of value-added-tax that plays a new major role in  relations among economic units. This was one of the more  radical steps taken in 1993. We also did quite a few things  toward laying the foundations of a market economy system, but  there is obviously quite a lot still to be done in this respect,  hence the new measures envisaged in the government's program. I  believe that we will solve some of these problems in 1994 and  this will enable us to place our economy on new foundations.    [Ivshyna] What is it that upsets the opposition so much that  it is demanding a change of government now?    [Iliescu] The opposition will always find something to be  upset about and will always try to change the government. This  is obviously the case with all societies. However, this is not  the main problem. The most important problem is the people's  discontent; this has its own valid reasons that are linked to  the outcome of this "involution" of our economy. By that, I  mean the decline in production, inflation, and unemployment,  which are causing many hardships for the people and lie at the  root of all this discontent that the opposition is obviously  trying to exploit.    We hope that 1994 will be the year that will see the  normalization and revival of our economic activity. We have  already had several positive signals in 1993 since we have  managed to stop the decline in production; the industrial  activity curve is hovering at the "zero level," something which  will create the basis of the economic recovery that we are  counting on in 1994.    In agriculture, we have also had three very difficult years  because of the drought. This year was the first one with good  crops. Of course, we were faced here with other hardships too,  since the cooperative farm system had been disorganized. That  was due to the reaction of the peasants after years of brutal  interference by the state in the life of cooperative farms that,  actually, were not cooperative at all. Hence the reaction of  the peasants against the cooperative farms as such, but this has  led to other hardships as well. Nevertheless, certain positive  trends have already emerged. The peasants are beginning to  associate without coercion in order to carry out agricultural  work communally, to use jointly the available agricultural  technology and the irrigation system, and so forth. Therefore,  we hope that, in 1994 and in the coming years, prospects will be  created for our agriculture that will enable us to achieve a  normal situation. The agricultural sector should play an active  role in our economy.    Likewise, regarding our exports, we have reached a negative  foreign trade balance in the past three years, meaning that  imports have increased rapidly while exports have decreased.  This has had a very negative impact on our economy and has led  to the depreciation of the national currency. In the last three  months, we have made certain progress in the sphere of exports.  We hope that this will give further impetus to exports in 1994,  since this is an important prerequisite for our economy.    Consequently, there are certain positive elements that have  marked 1993 and we want to develop them further in 1994.    [Ivshyna] Many people recall that, a few years ago,  foreigners who came to Romania were not able to see neon  advertisements and public lights but only a poor market, with  only occasional street lighting. We would like to know how you  have managed to do away with this energy crisis, so to speak.    [Iliescu] This issue has both positive and negative aspects.  First, the decrease in industrial production has reduced energy  consumption in industry. This has created conditions for  improving energy and fuel supplies to the population that had to  suffer a lot in this respect in the last years of Ceausescu's  regime.    [Ivshyna] Did you extract more of your own oil or did you  take other measures as well?    [Iliescu] No. Simply, the industry has started to consume  less, hence my statement about a positive aspect associated with  various negative elements.    [Ivshyna] As far as we are concerned, this problem of energy  resources is a painful one in Ukraine. What is the situation in  your country? Do you use your own resources or do you resort to  imports?    [Iliescu] We are importing crude oil, for instance. Our  national production of crude oil is only 6-7 million metric tons  per year while we consume some 15 million tons annually. Our  refineries have a capacity of 35 million tons. Therefore, we  are not even exploiting our refineries to full capacity since we  have lost some major suppliers such as the Russian space, Iraq,  Libya, and Kuwait and we do not have the necessary financial  means to extract more crude oil. Hence, we are limiting  ourselves to refining some 15-16 million tons per year.    [Ivshyna] When you talked about the serious changes that  have occurred in your country, you obviously referred to not  only the changes in the economic structure but also those in the  political sphere.    [Iliescu] The biggest progress of all has been made in the  political sphere. The economy is registering a slower pace in  this respect.    [Ivshyna] I would now like to raise the issue of security,  namely how one should fill the "security gap" that has emerged  after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. I am not referring to  "bloc" matters but I would nevertheless like to know your  opinion on the way in which Romania intends to ensure its  security in the future. Do you plan to become an unconditional  NATO member or do you have other alternatives? For instance,  what is your opinion about our president's initiative on  creating a security zone in East Europe?    [Iliescu] Today, the problem of security is more of a  political than military nature. It should reflect all the  progress made on our continent in view of the new political  relations that have been established between all the countries  on this continent. Therefore, we have become actively involved  in the CSCE process and we believe that this institution is an  important political framework for expanding political relations  between all CSCE countries.    At the same time, we look toward other international bodies  that should radically change their content, such as NATO and the  West European Union [WEU], with a view to ensuring that all our  countries are included in this framework. We speak out against  any discrimination on this matter. There is some talk on  whether to include only certain countries in NATO while others  are going to be left out. I believe that, if NATO is to become  a broader framework for cooperation, then the problem should be  broached in the same way for all the countries in our zone.  That is why we supported both the initiatives to create a new  framework of cooperation with our countries -- there is a  partnership and cooperation council at NATO and the WEU -- and  the new U.S. initiative Partnership for Peace that advocates a  nondiscriminatory approach to all the countries in our region.    Generally speaking, we also appreciate the initiative of  Ukrainian President Kravchuk as a further possibility of  cooperation between the countries in Eastern Europe; an  initiative that takes into consideration both the West and  Russia so as not to create elements of tension among our  countries but to create a general climate of understanding among  states.    [Ivshyna] It seems to me that you are treating your  opposition quite kindly. I would like to know your opinion  about the results of the elections in Russia.    [Iliescu] There are two aspects there. On the one hand, you  have the general results on the adoption of the Russian  Constitution with their positive aspects, since the Constitution  creates possibilities for the development of the democratic  forces in Russia. We hope that these forces will become  stronger as this is important both for Russia and for the  overall climate in our region, Europe, and the world over.    At the same time, there are also certain signals that make  us  wonder: Zhirinovskiy and all those extremist forces as well as  those longing for Russian imperialism whose activities pose a  real danger for all domestic forces in Russia but also for our  countries. However, we hope that the democratic forces will  manage to remove this danger.    [Ivshyna] Yes, this worries us too, since we keep being  reminded of tragic things regarding a greater Russia and so  forth -- something which is rather dangerous if we just think of  Germany in 1933 -- at a time when our nations are going through  painful changes in the economic and social spheres. Regarding  cooperation zones, I would like to ask you another question in  connection with the sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia. Since  both Romania and Ukraine have had to suffer from the embargo,  how do you think that our countries could be compensated for the  damage incurred by observing this embargo?    [Iliescu] We pin no great hopes on compensations as such.  Of course, we acted and raised this problem with all the  relevant bodies, including the Sanctions Committee of the UN  Security Council, but we have no great hopes of any real  compensation.    There is another thing that is important, namely to search  for a radical solution to the Yugoslav problem and to find  political solutions to all those problems. This primarily  depends on Yugoslavia's internal forces and the newly emerged  states that themselves have to find solutions to their own  problems, something which would lead to the lifting of the  sanctions imposed against the internal forces there, sanctions  which cause suffering to all innocent people. We also have to  suffer, those who are neighboring on the region. I believe that  nobody stands to gain from the continuation of this abnormal  situation. We hope that political solutions will be found to  these problems by establishing normal relations between our  countries.    [Ivshyna] Mr. President, how do you view the fact that all  the West's plans for reestablishing peace in former Yugoslavia  have borne no results?    [Iliescu] It is very easy to create tension and conflict,  but it is very difficult to normalize the situation. I believe  that the problem has not always been tackled in a realistic way  within Yugoslavia itself, where the internal forces have failed  to make the necessary efforts to ensure a normal evolution of  the changes that have occurred in Yugoslavia. At the same time,  neither have the international bodies treated Yugoslavia's  internal problems with adequate understanding and I believe that  such an approach has been quite dangerous not only for  Yugoslavia but also for the stability of our entire region.    [Ivshyna] Mr. President, I would like you to talk about a  specific sphere, namely your government's official policy on the  issue of guaranteeing the rights of national minorities. I  realize that this humanitarian problem is quite important for  both our countries.    [Iliescu] We have tackled this problem from a political  point of view. I believe that we have created the  constitutional and legal conditions for all national and  religious minorities to become freely involved in the  development of our society. We have created conditions for them  to be represented in the political bodies. All national  minorities are represented in our Parliament, not only the  Hungarians, who are the largest minority and have the highest  percentage of representation, namely 39 representatives in our  Parliament. The smaller minorities also have their  representatives in Parliament and in local administration. We  have also created conditions for them to be able to develop  their culture and specific features in all directions. We  consider this a political necessity, in view of the conditions  prevailing in our country, while being aware of the fact that  this problem is being treated differently in other countries.  For instance, many Western European countries do not even have  the notion of "national minorities," as the minorities are  considered citizens of the respective country and members of its  national structure. Take France, for example: If a person is a  citizen of France, then he is French.    [Ivshyna] This approach has its positive and negative  aspects.    [Iliescu] For France, there is no such thing as a "French  German," but just a "Frenchman." The Germans in Strasbourg are  bound by the status of the citizens of that city, hence they are  members of the French nation.    However, we have a different historical tradition and we  have  always treated this problem in another way. Our Constitution  provides the necessary framework for solving the problems of the  national minorities. There are two elements to which one should  pay great attention. There are certain separatist trends that  are concretely expressed in such slogans as "territorial  self-determination on the basis of ethnic criteria." This  cannot lead to normal relations between people. How can we  isolate the Hungarians living in the center of our country,  actually in two counties where they represent the majority of  the population? You see, there are Romanians and other  nationalities living in those counties as well. Such an approach  would lead to a dangerous tendency of isolation and separatism.  We view as equally dangerous the desire of certain circles to  patronize minorities living on the territory of other states.  This could lead to tension in relations between states. In our  political activity, we attach great importance to monitoring  these two trends that we obviously reject.    [Ivshyna] You are distancing yourself from them?    [Iliescu] We are in favor of using the national minorities  as a binding element between neighboring states and not as an  element of creating tension in relations between our countries.    [Ivshyna] From press reports, I learned of a sad and  undesirable incident that occurred during the protest  demonstrations recently held in front of the Russian Embassy in  Bucharest in connection with the Ilascu trial [trial of a group  of Moldovans headed by Ilie Ilascu, official of the Christian  Democratic Popular Front of Moldova, sentenced to death by a  court in Tiraspol, Dniester region]: Hooligans destroyed the  busts of Russian writers, including Shevchenko. I would like to  know your reaction to this incident and whether the busts will  be restored.    [Iliescu] There can be no doubt at all that we are against  such demonstrations organized by some very vociferous groups  that are in a minority. From a sentimental viewpoint, I might  understand their motivation, but one cannot approve of such  deeds.    [Ivshyna] As far as Ukraine is concerned, Shevchenko is  not only a monument but also a symbol.    [Iliescu] The same as Eminescu [classic Romanian poet] is  for us.    [Ivshyna] I would like you to tell us something about your  life outside politics. What else do you do?    [Iliescu] Right now, I have no time for anything else.  Politics takes up all my time. As a matter of fact, I have no  free time left at all.    [Ivshyna] Do you like your work?    [Iliescu] Of course. Otherwise, I could not do anything.    [Ivshyna] Do you have a large family?    [Iliescu] No. But I have a lot of brothers and nephews. I  live just with my wife. We do not have any children.    [Ivshyna] Do you have time for travel? Maybe you like to go  hunting or fishing.    [Iliescu] No. I have not had time for such things during the  last few years.    [Ivshyna] Let us make a small incursion into history. It is  obvious that your destiny as a politician has obviously blended  with the destiny of other personalities and prominent people.  What was your relationship with Ceausescu, for instance?    [Iliescu] Not very close, although I worked with him  directly for some six months in 1971, when I was secretary of  the Central Committee [of the Romanian Communist Party]. Until  then, we had pretty good relations because, at that time, he was  one of the people who worked for openness in our political  activity. That was a good time -- the 1960's; I mean, when one  can say that Romania was at the forefront of the political,  cultural, and economic openness as far as the countries in the  East were concerned. In Romania and Czechoslovakia, people were  talking for the first time about economic reform, market  economy, and merging the plan with the requirements of life. A  national conference on this subject was even held in 1967.  However, the intervention in Czechoslovakia [Russian invasion  of Czechoslovakia in 1968] was followed by a period of  involution not only for the countries where Soviet troops were  deployed but also for Romania. The political tension that  emerged at the time was used by Ceausescu as a pretext for a new  kind of policy based on the personality cult and on a hardening  of the political regime. In 1971, I was in direct contact with  him and our differences came to the fore. This happened after a  visit he paid to certain Asian countries -- to China and  particularly North Korea. Afterward, he removed me from the  political leadership....    [Ivshyna] Nevertheless, what is your opinion about him as a  man?    [Iliescu] He had an intuitive intelligence, otherwise he  would not have been able to advance so far, but he had a limited  education and culture; actually, he was quite a primitive man.  When he got hold of power and began to dominate political life,  all these primitive trends came to the fore, that is to say the  characteristics of a man who wanted to control and know  everything.    [Ivshyna] This is an explanation that makes you understand  such a phenomenon better. You see, many postsocialist countries  are faced with a common danger, namely the danger of nostalgia  for the past. What is your opinion on this? What kind of  politics should one implement so as to prevent people from  developing these feelings of nostalgia?    [Iliescu] This is quite a difficult thing to accomplish at  such a time as this, when the economy has had to suffer a lot.  The Romanian revolution occurred as a reaction of the people  against very difficult living conditions. Right now, the  situation for some people is even worse than then. The  transition is creating such an amount of discontent that some  people are beginning to think that it was better before, despite  the dictatorship, since they at least had secure jobs and,  although they lived modestly, they enjoyed a certain security.  But now, when there is unemployment and inflation and the  commodity prices keep going up with every passing day, certain  people have become melancholic and are longing for the past.  Such a danger exists and it can compromise the very idea of  reform. Therefore, we are doing our best to make headway along  these lines, but it is no easy thing to accomplish. We must get  through a very tough period and must openly tell the people  about the hardships inherent in the transitional period.    [Ivshyna] However, your meetings with the people have become  rarer of late. Maybe it is not so comfortable to meet the  people at a time when they are having such thoughts, to talk to  them about unpleasant things, and tell them to be patient and  work....    [Iliescu] No, it is not easy to do that, but it has to be  done, and I must say that most of the people realize what is  happening, although life is quite hard for them. On the other  hand, there are also people who are exploiting such moments; I  am basically referring to certain political forces and trade  union leaders who are paid to do that.    [Ivshyna] What should one do to ensure that the government  ship can sail on without being hampered by populist  pronouncements?    [Iliescu] It is necessary to engage in a frank and constant  dialogue with the people and tell them everything openly. When  you are frank with the people, they are ready to understand you,  even though it may be quite difficult for them to do this.    [Ivshyna] I had prepared a few more questions for you but I  do not want to take up too much of your time. I would like to  thank you for this discussion and ask you to say a few words for  our Ukrainian readers.    [Iliescu] I would like to take this opportunity to convey my  best wishes and my feelings of friendship to the readers of your  newspaper. I would also like to express the hope that we will  manage to cover this difficult road together, that we will  create new and good living conditions for both our peoples, and  that we will develop traditional good-neighborly relations  between our countries.    [Ivshyna] Of course, it is very nice to have relations of  friendship. Thank you.</p>

The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has finally decided to define its  attitude toward the trilateral declaration of the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States and Russia. As official sources have  indicated more than once, this document proclaims the removal of  nuclear weapons from Ukraine and defines the mechanism for  compensation and security guarantees for our nation.    All of the nuclear warheads, according to the trilateral  declaration, will be removed from the territory of Ukraine to  Russia for their subsequent dismantling in the shortest possible  time. Russia will provide compensation in the form of deliveries  of fuel rods for the requirements of Ukrainian nuclear power  engineering.    Ukraine will provide for the destruction of all nuclear  weapons, including strategic offensive weapons, deployed on its  territory within seven years, and all of the SS-24 missiles will  be deactivated within ten months through the removal of their  nuclear charges.    Russia will in turn guarantee the technical servicing and  safe operation of the nuclear warheads. The United States will  provide technical and financial assistance for the reliable and  safe dismantling of the nuclear weapons.    Everything that is contained in the trilateral declaration  and the addendum to the declaration, from the point of view of  President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, conforms to the  requirements posed by the Supreme Soviet regarding ratification  of the START-1 treaty and satisfies the restrictions advanced by  the people's deputies. There were 13 such restrictions, and they  talked chiefly about the aforementioned security guarantees and  the granting of financial and technical assistance directed  toward the elimination of the nuclear arsenal.    Life has confirmed once again, however, that there are as  many ideas as there are people. And when we are talking about  politicians, then they could have even more.    There were meetings the day before the recent session of the  Supreme Soviet by the commissions on questions of defense and  national security, questions of legislation and legality,  foreign affairs and the working deputies' commission to study  the START-1 treaty. The aim of the session was to prepare  findings regarding the conformity of the trilateral declaration  signed on January 14 in Moscow. Since there was not a quorum at  the session, they did not come to any unified findings, but each  commission came to its own findings separately. Since it would  be out of place to cite those findings, we will address the  results of the working commission to study the START-1 treaty.    According to the statement by President of Ukraine Leonid  Kravchuk, the members of that commission indicate, he has  confirmed his "commitment to the fact that Ukraine join the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NNPT] as a state not  possessing nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time." The  Supreme Soviet, at the same time, had earlier considered Ukraine  to be the possessor of nuclear weapons, and only the realization  of START-1 "would open up the way for the resolution by the  Supreme Soviet of Ukraine of the question of joining the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty."    Another detail is connected with the fact that the  trilateral  declaration indicates that "Ukraine will provide for the  destruction of all nuclear weapons, including strategic  offensive weapons, deployed on its territory," even though the  Supreme Soviet has stipulated the destruction of only 36 percent  of the missile delivery systems and 42 percent of the nuclear  warheads. Moreover, this presidential wording obligates Ukraine  to destroy not only all nuclear weapons within seven years, but  also all strategic offensive weapons along with their  infrastructure. After all, as was indicated on this score in a  memorandum of the U.S. embassy, "any preservation of deployed  SS-24 ICBMs after the seven-year period of cutbacks under the  START treaty would be in contradiction to the obligations of  Ukraine, whether those missiles are fitted with nuclear or  conventional warheads," and the United States "will not agree to  any weakening of this obligation." This categorical American  attitude signifies that the prospects for the creation of  high-precision weaponry with conventional warheads based on the  SS-24 delivery system as a means of strategic deterrence are  quite uncertain.    The terms of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons,  financing for inspection activities, the possibility of using  launch silos for peaceful purposes, the use of weapons-grade  plutonium, and expenditures for the social support of officers  and warrant officers of the missile forces who will be  discharged from the army owing to the cutbacks all remain  uncertain in the trilateral declaration.    I am citing all of these contradictions in great detail in  order to give a better sense of the tension that was present in  the hall of the Supreme Soviet during the discussion of the  trilateral declaration, the ratification of the START-1 treaty  and the joining of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The  speeches by President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of  Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy  Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko  stressed once again the fact that nuclear weapons are no  guarantee of security for us, we are not able to maintain them,  and to go against the world opinion, even if you are correct, is  a hopeless matter. Nuclear weapons for Ukraine, in the current  economic difficulties, are almost a suitcase for a drowning  man--too heavy to hold on to, but a shame to let go of.    The fate of the nuclear weapons stationed on the territory  of  Ukraine was resolved in two hours of discussion by the two  paragraphs of a Decree of the Supreme Soviet, namely:    1. Bearing in mind the specific steps taken by the President  and Government of Ukraine with regard to the fulfillment of the  provisions of the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of 18 November  1993 and the reciprocal steps on the part of the United States  and Russia, to remove the restrictions with regard to Article 5  of the Protocol to the START Treaty that was signed in Lisbon on  23 May 1993.    2. To authorize the Government of Ukraine to exchange  letters  on the ratification of the START-1 treaty and to make more  active the actions of the Government to reach a concrete  agreement that flows out of the restrictions of the Supreme  Soviet regarding the ratification of the START-1 Treaty.    What do the two paragraphs of this short decree mean?    First, that very difficult and painstaking work lies ahead.  At least five treaties or agreements will have to be reached,  which translate or at least should translate the declarative  substance of many provisions of the trilateral declaration into  the area of concrete, detailed and documented mutual  obligations. This pertains first and foremost to a schedule for  the dispatch of the first lot of nuclear warheads to Russia, an  agreement pertaining to the procedure and conditions for  monitoring their dismantling and salvaging on the part of  Ukraine, an agreement on compensation for the value of the  nuclear weapons transferred to Russia, and an agreement on  guarantor's and originator's oversight of the status of the  warheads that are still in Ukraine, including their transport to  "S" facilities and plant yards.    Second, that it is still too soon to put a period to the  resolution of the problem of the nuclear weapons stationed in  Ukraine, since a thing or two remains that is not entirely clear  or resolved. Although the removal of the restrictions pertaining  to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol also envisages Ukraine's  joining in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after all, the  deputies were still disinclined to the possibility during the  voting. Ukraine, under legal canons, does not have the slightest  right to demand compensation for strategic and tactical nuclear  weapons in joining the NNPT. The United States and Russia,  however, as indicated in the trilateral declaration, will  provide Kiev with security guarantees only in the event Ukraine  joins the NNPT. So the circle closes. And only time will tell  what the way out of this legal-political stalemate will be...</p>

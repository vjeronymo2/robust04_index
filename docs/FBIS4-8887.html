			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bernt Conrad on interview with Prime Minister </F> Waldemar Pawlak in Bonn; date of interview not given: "Pawlak  Satisfied With Kohl's Support"]    [Text] Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak wants to  "solve for good" the problem of smooth border traffic between  Germany and Poland within two to three years. He said so in an  interview with DIE WELT after concluding talks in Bonn.    Pawlak stated that the currently hopelessly crowded border  checkpoints at the Oder and Neisse Rivers should be addressed  and the transport infrastructure decidedly improved. This  includes the construction of five new bridges, the establishment  of four new border checkpoints, and an extension of the  Berlin-Warsaw-Minsk-Moscow highway, the Wroclaw-Katowice-Krakow  highway, and the already initiated modernization of the  Berlin-Warsaw railway line. These projects will soon be  discussed by a German-Polish working group initiated by Kohl and  Pawlak.    The 34-year-old government head, who promoted investment in  Poland during his visit to the Daimler-Benz company in Stuttgart  yesterday, also intends to tackle the mounting, sensitive  problem of car thefts in the FRG by Polish thieves. "Rapid  exchange of information is of utmost importance for the police  in this connection," he said in the interview with DIE WELT.  The better-equipped criminals are taking advantage of the still  very poor technology used by the Polish police. This should  change in the coming years. Yet, Pawlak added: "I am cautious  as far as promises are concerned."    Pawlak did not shirk the question as to whether and how the  leftist government of former communists and the Peasant Party,  which he leads, intend to pursue market-economy reform: "Our  main objectives are democracy and the social market economy--on  the basis of social stability and evolution, and without shock  therapy. What we need is wide acceptance of reform by the  population." With great emphasis, the leader of the Peasant  Party pointed to the significant decrease in the rate of  inflation and 10-percent production growth in the first quarter  of 1994. "These are signs of a stable economic situation."    Pawlak noted with satisfaction Kohl's support for leading  Poland toward the European Union and NATO. Regarding Moscow's  objection to his country's NATO membership and that of other  Central-East European reformist states, the prime minister said:  "Russia had said yes before, but NATO did not react quickly  enough and Russia changed its mind. I think the chances are not  bad if we are all determined." He said that military aggression  was not an acute danger but "a danger in the form of chaos.  This can lead to most serious consequences. The former  Yugoslavia should serve as a warning to all of us." Pawlak's  conclusion: "The important thing is cooperation in partnership.  This can be a solid basis also for security."</p>

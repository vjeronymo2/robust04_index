			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Fashion: Style of the well-disguised writer - Me and My Wardrobe / Jane Mulvagh meets Harriet Sergeant who dresses so that she can see without being seen Harriet Sergeant's clothes, like her word processor, are a tool not a plaything. They serve a professional purpose: to insinuate herself into communities in order to write about them. Whether she is moving through the black townships in South Africa, the waspish yuppies of New York's Upper East Side, or teenage gangsters in a Shanghai brothel, her clothes signal a wish to integrate. 'The right clothes can help to get people to talk. If I am in a difficult situation,' she explains, 'I dress so that people will help me. For instance in Soweto, where I was doing research for my book, I wore a conservative pleated skirt and pretty blouse with high shoes to inspire respect and, more importantly, to show them respect. Shorts and a T-shirt would have sent a powerful message that you thought they were not good enough.' There is an intelligent matter-of-factness in her approach. Like the spare style of her prose, her clothes efficiently communicate a message. 'They are armour, to be used as a disguise or a confidence booster,' she says. Fitting in, socially and professionally, matters to Sergeant, 39. Firm sartorial views would be an encumbrance when trying to assimilate the dress codes of far-off cultures. 'You have to watch carefully,' she says. 'It takes about a year to understand the unspoken rules - and then I can adapt to that environment.' Her latest book, The Old Sow in the Back Room, An English Woman in Japan, draws on her experience of living in Japan for seven years after her banker husband was sent there by his company. Putting aside her European notions of individualism, she submitted to their dress codes and was able to understand many levels of Japanese society. 'In the east women dress to please men. In the west women often dress to please other women and many of the clothes are hated by men. Take Issey Miyake. Most of my women friends love it. Stephen (her husband) can't stand it]' She was astonished by the women in Tokyo who wore Chanel suits to play in sandpits with their children. Initially she rebelled, but the cultural pressure was overwhelming and the snappy suits in her wardrobe bear witness to the fact that she conformed. She drew the line at the 'lady-like' Japanese taste for white lacy tights and white court shoes. The influence of Japan lingers. Her wardrobe reveals that she broadly adheres to fashion's diktats. The contents hang like entries in fashion's seven-year diary: sharp, short suits circa 1987; sovereign-sized diamante buttons fastening cream lace, 1989; Palio-print silk shirts and leggings, 1991 and textured crinkles, 1993. She says: 'The English dress codes are the most complicated because dressing down takes a great deal of effort. In Japan we dressed up to go out, just as we do in New York. It's fun. Here they look down on you if you've made an effort. It's so boring on the eye.' Of her personal wardrobe, rather than her disguises, she admits to difficulties in putting a look together. Now, with a bigger budget she buys the whole designer outfit - 'Miss Matching, that's me' - or asks friends to buy her clothes. She says you cannot find glamour in London shops. At crucial moments in her life - her first dance, first day at Vogue, or penniless and directionless on her return from South Africa - her mother gave her a confidence-boosting outfit; a Biba strawberry pink mini dress; a smart, 15-year-old Jean Muir dress, a leather jacket. To Sergeant, the secret is not what clothes make you look like but feel like. 'My mother would look at my face, not my body, and if it lit up and I exuded confidence that was the right thing to wear. Most people don't notice what you have on, they only sense your mood. Take evening clothes. I use them like a whirlwind or a rocket behind me, whooshing me out of the door filled with confidence.' Her 'booster' clothes include a pair of shocking-pink kid gloves cuffed in black marabou feathers; a Bruce Oldfield suit, and Montana suits with short skirts to celebrate the Sergeant legs. 'This Montana which I bought a few years ago was perfect for Tokyo in the 80s - all glamorous and glossy. The cut makes me look slender.' Necessity has shifted the emphasis of Sergeant's wardrobe. 'When I was younger and spent my day as a writer at my desk, I often stayed in my dressing gown or kimono until six in the evening. And then having suffered Lonely Woman Syndrome all day, I'd go out and want to dazzle.' The big change was having children. Suddenly the house was full of nannies and dailies and she had to get dressed. The other change was coming back to London last year. 'Here I have been into school runs, seeing publishers for lunch so I had to buy smart day clothes for the first time. I buy one outfit each season. Don't take me out to lunch more than once or you'll just see the same suit again and again]' By day she lives in Marks and Spencer's gilt-buttoned blazers, brightly-patterned Gucci shirt and tailored trousers. 'It's my uniform. I do try to conform, but I always seem to get it wrong - something just slips in.' She gives the example of her 'I-am-a-banker's-wife' evening dress from Tomasz Starzewski, a black and white column with modest bugle beading at the neck. But instead of wearing predictable heirloom pearls and auntie's spray brooch or a success-proclaiming Bulgari necklace, she wears it with hub-cap sized African ivory and Indian silver bangles. Country clothes are absent from her wardrobe. Brought up in north London she admits to 'thinking of the countryside as Hampstead Heath'. During her angst-ridden 20s she dated very English boys, alumnae of her Oxford days, who would take her to cold country houses. 'I loathed it. Mud, cold, cystitis, the wrong clothes - trying to look sweet and pretty in puff-sleeved blouses]' Then she met Stephen Cohen, her husband who works at SG Warburg. He encouraged her to wear sexy shapes in dark colours instead of trying to look like an overgrown girlie. It suits her psyche and she is happy. To her horror, after 11 years of marriage, Stephen is suggesting they move to the country. To endure her 'green hell' she has reluctantly bought what she archly calls a 'Berber' waxed jacket, a knowing mispronunciation intended to communicate her irritation. Showing us her clothes, Sergeant realised she kept them like letters. 'They remind me of things that have happened and it is all rather moving. I met Stephen in that jacket.' As a chronicler of other cultures she is a person who looks out rather than in on herself. When I encouraged her to examine her 'wrappings', she realised that she had not dissected them with the sharp eye she applies to the characters in her books. She enjoyed the process - she says. The Old Sow In The Back Room, An English Woman In Japan is published on Sept 15, John Murray, Pounds 17.99.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure mounts over oil tax plans PRESSURE yesterday mounted on the government to alter the changes in petroleum revenue tax announced in the Budget, Emma Tucker. More than 20 MPs gathered at a meeting organised by Mr Cranley Onslow, former chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, to hear complaints from the oil industry that it was already losing contracts as a result of the government's decision. In the Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, announced an end to oil companies' rights to set their exploration costs against their total petroleum revenue tax bill. The effect will be to increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies which have been able to take advantage of the PRT offset. Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West who attended the meeting, said: 'Our intention is to convince the government that damage is already being done to all sorts of industries as a result of what is going on.' During discussions in the committee stage of the finance bill Ms Harriet Harman, shadow Treasury spokesperson, said that the government's claim that it was helping those on lower incomes by widening the 20 per cent band on income tax was bogus. Instead the government was increasing the burden of taxation and hitting the poor hardest by freezing personal tax allowances and increasing indirect taxes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A routine monthly JIJI NEWS SERVICE public opinion  survey for June shows the Hata Cabinet approval rate at 40.7  percent, or 0.2 percent lower than in the last survey conducted  shortly after the cabinet set sail in May. The recent survey  results were tallied and announced 19 June. The disapproval  rate for the cabinet grew 7.6 points to 35.2 percent over the  same period. Meanwhile, those who replied "I have no answer"  decreased 7.4 percent. This means that this portion of  respondents [who said they had no answer last month] changed  their position to that of disapproving the cabinet. As for  popularity for political parties, the poll showed the support  rate for the Japan New Party fell to 1.5 percent this month.    The survey was conducted 10 June -- when just one month had  passed since the Hata Cabinet started -- to 13 June with 2,000  men and women across the country through individual interviews  -- with 73.1 percent of them responding.    Immediately after the cabinet started in May, the prime  minister announced measures to appear as the "commoners' prime  minister"; for instance, freezing public utility charges and  installing fax machines [in the prime minister's office] so that  citizens can make proposals to the prime minister directly. He  has also been on stumping tours, making speeches on the streets.  However, the approval rate for his cabinet has not improved.  The people's uneasiness about a minority government has  apparently led to an increase in the disapproval rate.    As reasons for approving the cabinet, the largest proportion  of the respondents, as in May, cited "because there are no other  appropriate people." This passive reply was offered by 13.2  percent of the respondents (as compared with 14.1 percent in  May). This was followed by 11.8 percent (9.5 percent in May)  who said "because he gives a good impression", and 11.1 percent  (11.1 percent in May) who said "because we trust the prime  minister." As reasons for disapproving the cabinet, the largest  proportion, or 18.7 percent (16.5 percent in May), said "because  I cannot have expectations for it," 8.8 percent (5.0 percent in  May) said "because it lacks leadership," and 7.4 percent (3.8  percent in May) said "because its policies are wrong."    In popularity of political parties, the Liberal Democratic  Party and the Social Democratic Party of Japan gained somewhat,  with the former receiving an approval rate of 22.6 percent (21.3  percent in May) and the latter 7.2 percent (6.8 percent in May).  The approval rate for Shinseito [Renewal Party] dropped to 3.4  percent (4.6 percent in June). Approval rates for other parties  were 3.3 percent (2.5 percent in June) for Komeito, 1.5 percent  (2.1 percent) for the Japan New Party, 1.5 percent (1.4 percent)  for Shinto Sakigake [New Harbinger], 1.4 percent (1.4 percent)  for the Democratic Socialist Party, and 1.2 percent (1.4  percent) for the Japan Communist Party.</p>

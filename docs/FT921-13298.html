			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Warning on European air traffic EUROPE'S fragmented air traffic control system could start buckling by this spring, leading to long delays and cancellations, according to Mr Giovanni Bisignani, managing director of Alitalia, writes David Gardner in Brussels. Mr Bisignani, who has just taken over as chairman of the Association of European Airlines (AEA), which groups 23 flag carriers, said the failure to establish a unified air traffic control system had not been exposed last year because of the exceptional downturn in traffic, caused by recession and the Gulf war. Even so, AEA members clocked up 50,000 hours in flight delays in 1991. 'We cannot go on with 22 different operational systems and 33 different software systems,' he said. 'We need action and quick. It is not a lack of physical space; the system is inadequate.' He called on the European Commission to press for a unified control system as the precondition for a single market in civil aviation. Brussels' hands have been tied because air traffic control falls under national jurisdiction largely for reasons of national security. Mr Bisignani underlined that fragmentation imposed unacceptable costs - Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.22bn) a year in Europe - on airlines at a time of crisis in the industry, whereas the unified US control system dealt with three times the volume of traffic and cost airlines Dollars 2.5bn. His remarks came as part of a presentation on the AEA's reservations about Brussels' 'open skies' policy. 'We need and want a single market. . . but some things must be changed,' Mr Bisignani said after the presentation to MEPs and in meetings with the Commission.</p>

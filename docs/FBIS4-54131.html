			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa announced Tuesday that Japan and the United States have  agreed to resume "framework" trade talks stalled since February.    Kakizawa said the two contries have struck a deal on three  points to pave the way for reopening the bilateral negotiations  on the "priority" industry issues -- Japanese Government  procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, autos  and auto parts, and insurance business.    Among the three points agreed by the two countries is the  nature of "objective criteria," demanded by the U.S. for  measuring the openness of Japanese markets, Kakizawa said.    Kakizawa said Tokyo and Washington have agreed not to use  numerical targets as "objective criteria" when assessing foreign  penetration into the Japanese markets. He also said he is  convinced that Washington will not resort to punitive measures  in dealing with trade problems with Japan.    The agreement came after on-and-off talks since Thursday  between Sozaburo Okamatsu, Japanese vice international trade and  industry minister for international affairs and Deputy Foreign  Minister Sadayuki Hayashi for economic affairs, representing  Japan, and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  and Bowmen Cutter, deputy director of the White House National  Economic Council, representing the U.S.    Based on the so-called "framework" accord reached last July  between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton, the two countries launched a set of  formal market-opening negotiations.    The talks, however, collapsed in February at a Washington  meeting between Clinton and then Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa mainly due to a U.S. demand for specifying  "objective criteria." Japan has been opposed to the demand,  saying such measures would lead to "managed trade" and fearing  Washington would resort to sanctions if such targets are not met.    Under the framework accord, Japan is committed to  significantly reducing its huge trade surplus by expanding  domestic demand and opening its markets wider to foreign goods  and services.</p>

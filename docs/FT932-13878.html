			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy moves to repay Efim bank creditors THE Italian government yesterday took its biggest practical step to repaying foreign bank creditors of the Efim state holding company, put into voluntary liquidation last year, by authorising the treasury to raise L1,600bn through Euromarket loans. However, the entire Efim repayment package, which envisages issuing at least L9,000bn in special government bonds, continues to hinge on approval from the European Commission. Mr Alberto Predieri, the administrator appointed to run the group after its collapse, is due to meet Commission members in Brussels today to discuss the government's plans. The L1,600bn to be raised will be used to repay fully foreign bank creditors of Efim or wholly-owned subsidiaries. The creditors will be repaid in the currency of their original loans. The L1,600bn represents part of the figure of L9,000bn indicated by the government as representing Efim's exposure to the banking system. Timing for the repayments now hinges on the Commission. Mr Predieri has said it should decide on the legality of the government's package sometime after today. Both the treasury and prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, have indicated the government aims to repay foreign creditor banks by the end of this month. The money will be raised by a pool of Italian banks, co-ordinated by Banca di Roma, which will then on-lend the proceeds to the treasury. No date has been revealed for when the government will issue the special domestic bonds through which Italian bank creditors will be repaid. Foreign bank creditors have welcomed the government's plans. One member of the steering committee of foreign bank creditors played down the impact of the conflict with the Commission. 'We believe it's the usual problem of inadequate information from Rome,' he said.</p>

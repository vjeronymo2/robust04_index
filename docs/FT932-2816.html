			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM and Reynolds hold Ulster talks MR JOHN MAJOR sought last night to persuade Unionists to rejoin talks on Ulster's future, saying an 'early objective' would be 'to re-affirm in Northern Ireland the sort of democratic structures most people would want to enjoy'. Speaking after talks with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, he made clear that the two governments would not impose a solution on the province. The search for a lasting agreement via talks 'is a matter for persuasion and patience,' he said. Although he played up the prospects of a political reform in the province - the main ambition of unionists - the prime minister said the government still wanted a 'three-stranded' approach, also covering institutions linking north and south Ireland, and London with Dublin. Mr Reynolds said the two governments did not expect a resumption of round table talks until the autumn.</p>

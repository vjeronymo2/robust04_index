			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOSSES SPUR FDIC TO RAISE BANK PREMIUM;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE FUND INSURING BANK DEPOSITS IS AT ITS LOWEST POINT IN HISTORY AND  COULD BE WIPED OUT BY A RECESSION.  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. today raised the insurance premium for  commercial banks by more than 60% in a move aimed at bolstering its  deteriorating insurance fund.  </P> <P> Starting next year, the rate will be 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits, up from  12 cents this year.  </P> <P> It is the maximum increase allowed by law.  </P> <P> The action came after the five-member board heard a financial report showing  that losses to the fund from bank failures were even heavier than anticipated  in the first half of this year.  </P> <P> The fund decreased from $13.2 billion at the end of 1989 to $11.4 billion at  the end of June -- a 14% drop.  </P> <P> FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said he anticipated losses for the year would  be closer to $3 billion rather than the $2 billion he expected only one month  earlier.  </P> <P> The $1.84-billion loss in the first half of the year has reduced the level of  reserves in the fund to only 60 cents for $100 insured deposits. The minimum  level considered safe is $1.25 per $100.  </P> <P> The level of reserves is at the lowest point in the fund's history. The  congressional General Accounting Office has warned that if the economy dips  into a recession, the fund could be wiped out and require a taxpayer bailout.  </P></p>

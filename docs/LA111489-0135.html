			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EVERETT CAN SHOOT FROM HIP AGAIN;  </P> <P> RAMS: THE QUARTERBACK HAS FINALLY RECOVERED FROM HIS POINTER INJURY, SUFFERED  THREE WEEKS AGO, WHICH WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN EVER DISCLOSED.  </P> <P> Jim Everett's career took a New York Giant leap forward Sunday, painful as it  was. History takes kindly to quarterbacks who work miracles on bum knees and  bad backs, and now Everett can assume a proper place on the trainer's table.  </P> <P> It turns out the hip pointer Everett suffered three weeks ago against New  Orleans was more serious than ever disclosed and, more to the point(er), the  Rams didn't want it known lest the injury be considered an excuse for Everett's  sagging numbers and his team's skidding fortunes.  </P> <P> "Sure, no question about it," Coach John Robinson said Monday. "We tend to  downplay injuries as much as we can, but I think his throwing motion was  affected."  </P> <P> Naturally, it's much more manly to mention injuries after wins than losses.  Everett admitted Monday that the hip pointer, or deep bruise, may have  subconsciously changed his hip rotation and thus, his throwing motion. Now,  pass rushers such as Bruce Smith and Richard Dent can change your hip rotation  in a hurry, too, but that's another story.  </P> <P> Everett thinks the injury threw his whole body out of whack. He awoke Sunday  morning with a painful and stiff back, probably a result of compensating for  his hip, he guesses.  </P> <P> In between series, Everett could be found doing Jane Fonda workout stretches on  the sidelines, trying to work out the kinks. It didn't work.  </P> <P> "At halftime, we had the meeting with him standing up and a guy massaging his  back while we're talking offense," Robinson said. "But that's part of what that  position is. It isn't just the stats, it's finding a way to play when things  are crappy."  </P> <P> Everett had both the statistics and the will, setting a Rams' record with 18  consecutive completions in the 31-10 victory over the Giants. All told, Everett  completed 23 of 33 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns. Touching his toes  would have posed more a problem.  </P> <P> Robinson compared Everett's performance to one being played out in the  immediate vicinity Sunday by Giants' quarterback Phil Simms, who was wearing a  brace to protect a bad ankle.  </P> <P> "He's out there with a metal sleeve on his leg, his team's going down the tubes  and he's not playing very good," Robinson said. "But he is something else, I  think, that guy Simms. I just love him. I think he's one of those guys. I think  Jim, going through this period, gets more like Simms."  </P> <P> Slowed by the bad ankle and battered by the Rams' pass rush, Simms still  managed to complete 25 of 38 passes for 237 yards.  </P> <P> "I'd always point to Simms as a guy who keeps coming back," Robinson said. "A  guy like Phil Simms, you'd better kill him, you'd better not just wound him."  </P> <P> If you don't think the role of the Rams' running backs has changed, take a look  at Sunday's numbers. The Rams didn't have a runner gain more than 45 yards, yet  used the skills of four backs -- Greg Bell, Buford McGee, Robert Delpino and  Cleveland Gary -- to combine for 138 yards rushing in 38 carries. That used to  be a good day for one Ram, Eric Dickerson.  </P> <P> What's more, the four players also gained 128 receiving yards in 12 receptions.  </P> <P> Variety will apparently be the spice of the Rams' offense for years to come.  The Rams are already packaging their backs, using Delpino and McGee in split  fullback sets on some downs.  </P> <P> Gary, the first-round pick from Miami, made his most significant contribution  against the Giants, leading Ram runners with 45 yards in eight carries.  </P> <P> And running isn't even what Gary does best.  </P> <P> "It's clear to me," Robinson said, "that Cleveland Gary has to be in the game,  because his skills as a receiver are outstanding."  </P> <P> Delpino, a second-year man and fifth-round pick, is simply the Rams' most  versatile player. Sunday, he gained 34 yards rushing and 70 yards receiving,  while continuing to be impressive on special teams.  </P> <P> Delpino played 26 downs of offense and 13 downs on special teams.  </P> <P> The only back missing out on the fun is Gaston Green, who missed Sunday's game  with a rib injury.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Cornerback LeRoy Irvin (ankle) dressed for Sunday's game but said he could have  played only in a case of emergency. He should be ready for Sunday's game  against Phoenix. . . . With linebackers Larry Kelm and Fred Strickland back in  the lineup, the Rams were able to play 16 downs of Eagle defense. "And I  thought we played it well," Coach John Robinson said. "The defense looked more  like our defense of last year than any time this year." . . . The Rams are  carrying only seven defensive backs at the moment, and are hoping to make it  work until cornerback Alfred Jackson comes off injured reserve in two weeks. "I  don't know what to do," Robinson said. "We have some sorting out to do." . . .  Despite the recent slump, Robinson is satisfied how his team has fared against  some of the league's top teams. "We've certainly played the best in the league,  and most of them even," he said. "We've beaten the two teams (San Francisco and  the Giants) with the two best records, which is an interesting thing." . . .  Second-year man Mike Piel has done well since becoming the starter at right  defensive end two weeks ago. Sunday, he had two sacks. "Piel has established  himself as a solid player," Robinson said. "That's very pleasing to us." . . .  The six rushing yards allowed by the Rams' defense Sunday was the second-fewest  in team history. The Rams held the Chicago Bears to one yard rushing in a 1952  game. . . . Greg Bell has 26 touchdowns since becoming a Ram in October 1987.  Eric Dickerson holds the team's career touchdown mark with 58 from 1983-87.  </P> <P> THE RAMS BY THE NUMBERS  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHT  </P> <P> JIM EVERETT  </P> <P> Those huge sighs of relief you heard late Sunday afternoon were those of Rams  fans and Coach John Robinson as the quarterback shook the slump which had  bedeviled him over the last four weeks and reverted to his early-season form.  With the offensive line providing optimum protection, the fourth-year pro  completed 23 of 33 attempts -- including a club-record 18 in a row -- for 295  yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> SEASON TO

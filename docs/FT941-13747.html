			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Looking back to get the future in the frame - WH Smith/Menzies/MFI Two of the UK's largest newspaper, books, stationery and music retailers - John Menzies and WH Smith - are expected to announce increases in interim profits this week. Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retail and wholesale group, is expected today to announce increased profits for the six months to October from Pounds 3.8m to between Pounds 4.1m and Pounds 5m. As with other retailers announcing results, however, analysts are at least as interested in what it has to say about the Christmas trading period. They expect a reasonably strong performance from Early Learning Centre, Menzies' educational toyshop chain, with sales rising by up to 8 per cent, but less strong trading from the Menzies chain, though sales are expected to have risen by up to 4 per cent. WH Smith reports on Wednesday, and profits are expected to be up from Pounds 40.2m to Pounds 42m-Pounds 46m for the six months to November. Sales increases for the first half may be flattered somewhat by weak comparatives from the year before, with the second half comparatives getting more difficult. But strong trading is expected both in the first half and over Christmas from the UK retailing and distribution businesses, with sales rises possibly into double digits. However, there may have been some loss of margin in the music business, and analysts suggest results from the US may be less good than hoped. Losses may have been cut slightly at Do It All, the DIY joint venture with Boots. Thursday sees interim results from furniture retailer MFI, with analysts' uncertainty about its performance reflected by the wide spread of forecasts from about Pounds 17m to about Pounds 25m - up from Pounds 12.7m last year, excluding the profit on MFI's sale of shares in Carpetright. Its comments on the January sale period will attract attention, following market rumours that trading may have been dull.</p>

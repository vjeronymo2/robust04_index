Experts from the Sino-British Joint Liaison  Group (JLG), will resume negotiations tomorrow in a bid to break  the eight-year impasse over the disposal of military land in the  territory before 1997.    Emerging from the second of four scheduled days of talks,  Chinese team leader Luo Jiahuan said the Chinese side remained  dissatisfied over the size of the military base for the People's  Liberation Army on Stonecutters Island after the changeover.  "We insist on a naval base as big as the present HMS Tamar  headquarters," Mr Luo said.    But he rejected claims that a sizeable naval base in the  future Special Administrative Region (SAR) was needed because it  would be used as a strategic defence base for southern China  after 1997.    The Chinese side also raised new proposals on the future  disposal of military land during the four hours of talks  yesterday. "But the British side failed to give a response on  the spot," Mr Luo said.    British team leader Alan Paul said he would carefully  consider the proposals raised by the Chinese. Mr Paul  maintained the two sides would try to reach agreement in the  remaining two days of discussion. He also revealed that the two  sides had already discussed the construction costs of the future  naval base and the disposal of married quarters for the British  garrison in Central. The Chinese have stipulated that the  married quarters should be kept for PLA officers.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report London GOLD pushed higher out of its range of the past two weeks on fresh US fund buying on Comex against a background of volatile currencies and falling share markets. Dealers said expected resistance at Dollars 350 a troy ounce was brushed aside and the market is now focusing on Dollars 352 as the upside barrier. But Europe was largely side-lined with activity focused on Comex after the dollar slipped to a record low against the yen. London COCOA closed near its highs above key resistance levels, making way for possible further gains. Dealers said much cocoa activity centred on currency movements, with weak sterling pushing prices through key resistance and triggering buy-stops which took the market to the highs. There was some talk of light selling from Ghana. The December close of Pounds 684 a tonne could mean a test of Pounds 700 today, dealers said. New York raw SUGAR futures were lower but holding support at midday on selling tied to chart factors and renewed sentiment that the market was oversupplied after news that German statistician FO Licht now pegs world production in the 1992-93 season at 116.42m tonnes, compared with 115.85m this season.

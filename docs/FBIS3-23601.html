			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major Vadim Kinshin: "Advanced Maneuverability </F> Fighter"]    [Text] Interest in raising the maneuvering  characteristics of warplanes persists abroad. The military  departments of the USA and Germany are conducting joint research  on a number of aviation programs for the future. A program to  design a tactical fighter with advanced maneuverability (EFM)  occupies a special place. Series X airplanes are the first  experimental models.    A joint international simulation exercise was carried out in  1985 to evaluate the influence of maneuvering qualities on a  fighter's combat effectiveness, especially in close combat.    Research was conducted within the program with regard for  present trends in combat use of fighter aviation and air defense  resources. This is associated with the fact that significant  changes occurred in the last 10 years in the homing heads of all  types of missiles. The sensitivity of homing heads and their  scanning angles were subjected to modernization primarily.  Requirements on the tactics of aerial combat, especially close  combat, have risen: The modern fighter must have "tactical  freedom"--that is, it must maintain its advantages until the  absolute end of combat. However, for the time being we can  observe a different picture--more than half of the "one on one"  contests end in mutually observed missile launchings, or in  other words, the potential destruction of one another.    In the opinion of foreign military specialists high-speed  flight remains the best means of defense, because the commonly  accepted trends in development and use of fighters have  "wallowed at low speeds." Experts feel that it is only  theoretically that a decrease in speed makes it possible to  change a fighter's trajectory or maneuvering mode. In fact, an  airplane's inertia does not change when it carries out maneuvers  at high angles of attack, while its aerodynamic control becomes  weak. As a result the possibilities for completing a maneuver  quickly are limited.    Foreign specialists see passive inertial flight at a speed  of  around Mach 0.9 in particular sections of the trajectory to be  one of the solutions to this problem. This approach makes it  possible for a fighter to reduce flying distance while  maneuvering, and to complete maneuvers faster. Forestalling the  opponent in this fashion, the airplane can assume a more  advantageous position for effective use of onboard weapons. Its  kill capability will increase due to reduction of firing range.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Performance Characteristics of the X-31A                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Item No.                 |Characteristics          |Value                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1                        |Fully loaded weight      |7,228 kg                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2                        |Take-off weight          |6,623 kg                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3                        |Unfueled weight          |5,176 kg                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |4                        |Weight with fuel in internal tanks:                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Maximum                  |1,870 kg                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Normal                   |1,496 kg                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5                        |Fuel fraction            |0.225                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |6                        |Engine class: General Electric F404                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |7                        |Engine thrust            |71 kN                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |8                        |Thrust-to-weight ratio   |11.1                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |9                        |Wing area                |24 m[.sup]2[/]         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |10                       |Relative load on wings (-|270 kg/m[.sup]2[/]     |  |                         |at half fuel load)       |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |11                       |Maximum calculated speed |Mach 1.3                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Two X-31A fighters were the first models of aircraft of this  type. The airplane's configuration recalls that of the F-18  fighter. The X-31A has a swept-back fuselage with flat side  walls, low wings and a vertical tail fin welded to the fuselage.  The engine's air intake has a movable lower edge, and it is  located beneath the fuselage. According to design calculations  this is the variant that permits the fighter to operate in  optimum fashion at large angles of attack. Forward horizontal  control surfaces--for pitch control and balancing of the craft's  airframe--may be said to be yet another unique feature of the  airplane's design.    The flight control devices of the X-31A are of the  conventional variety. Presence of a group of three large vanes  mounted near the jet engine nozzle is an identifying structural  feature. They are intended for fast and precise deflection of  the main direction of the jet stream by changing part of its  flow in the needed direction. In this case the vanes keep the  engine's thrust factor at its maximum. They are capable of  increasing the total deflection of the main exhaust flow by more  than 10 degrees, which makes it possible to obtain up to 17  percent additional thrust energy in any selected direction.  Consequently the pilot may quickly change flight direction, and  maneuver without resorting to the assistance of conventional  control devices.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-76A>           Variant of a Maneuver by the X-31A to </FIG>       The wing structure is of certain interest. The wings are  flexed in the vertical plane, and they narrow at the tips. Good  aerodynamic qualities of the wings, especially at large angles  of attack both at sub- and supersonic speeds, have been noted on  several occasions in tests. The flat side walls of the fuselage  made it possible to achieve reasonable characteristics during  slip.    On the basis of maneuverability requirements the X-31A has a  "load ratio" (the ratio of a loaded engine to thrust) of not  less than 1:1. In addition the aircraft may be flown on the  basis of flight control system data, while the layout of the  fighter makes it possible to utilize full engine power even at  angles of attack of 70 degrees. The high maneuvering qualities  of the airplane are associated with presence of forward control  surfaces. Tests showed that at large angles of attack in  subsonic flight, a critical moment arises at which the center of  gravity shifts toward the tail or nose of the fighter--it  becomes unstable, and can spontaneously stall. It is to preclude  this that the forward control surfaces are used.    Research conducted under the program revealed that owing to  its advanced maneuverability, the X-31A can quickly assume a  stable position while performing any dangerous maneuver, upon  entering into a protracted stall, when the engine fails, or when  the thrust control system breaks down. This is how higher flight  safety of the X-31A in comparison with other fighters is  accomplished.    There is one unique feature of the fighter's control: Flight  control is linked to engine thrust control. Consequently the  principal means of flight control is automatic, using the flight  control system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-77A>           Variant of a Maneuver </FIG>       Certain changes were made in the controls and displays in  connection with the fighter's new possibilities. There is an  additional switch on the joystick allowing the pilot to cause  the aircraft to stall or return to ordinary flight. An  additional piloting mark is projected onto the heads-up display.  Its purpose is to indicate and warn the pilot of the real  angular position of the airplane in space and its subsequent  oblique displacements in the course of stall maneuvers. Tests  showed that the peculiarities of control of the X-31A favorably  affect the results of aerial combat, because it is hard for the  opponent to predict the airplane's trajectory. In addition,  stalling during combat makes it possible to more than double the  number of missiles launched, and thus quadruple the fighter's  firepower. In turn, the combat exchange factor rises by 160  percent to a ratio of 1:3 in favor of the X-31A. A 15 percent  increase in the airplane's mobility reduces losses to air  defense fire by 75 percent.    New structural concepts and results of tests on the advanced  maneuverability fighter encouraged further development of this  concept. Thus America's Grumman developed a similar fighter, the  X-29A, with forward-swept wings. Flight tests demonstrated the  airplane's high maneuvering qualities: At angles of attack of  25-40 degrees its speed of descent was minimal, and it made a  complete turn in a radius of 350-400 meters. Control of the  direction of engine thrust has also been reflected in a fighter  of a totally different type--the STOVL short take-off and  landing aircraft. According to reports in the foreign press it  will have an improved aerodynamic shape and built-in thrust  control.    The concept of advanced maneuverability of tactical fighters  is now being used abroad as the basis of active efforts to  design an airplane capable of changing its length while in  flight.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has also made corresponding changes to other provisions, such as the notice requirements in &sect;&sect;314.52 and 314.95, to include certifications for ``unenforceable'' patents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Two comments disagreed with proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(ii), which would require an applicant to state that, in its opinion and to the best of its knowledge, there are no patents that claim the drug or drugs on which investigations that the applicant relied upon in its application were conducted or that claim a use for the drug or drugs. One comment said applicants should only be required to certify that there are no listed patents. The other comment suggested deleting the provision and combining this patent certification with a paragraph I (no patent information submitted) certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA believes the comments have misconstrued proposed &sect;314.50(i)(1)(ii). The provision would require a ``no relevant patents'' certification if, ``in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of its knowledge,'' there are no patents described in the patent certification section (&sect;314.50(i)(1)(i)). In other words, if an applicant made one of the four patent certifications under &sect;314.50(i)(1)(i), the applicant would not make another certification under &sect;314.50(i)(1)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. One comment strongly objected to proposed &sect;314.50(i)(4). The provision would require section 505(b)(2) applicants whose applications were submitted after the late patent information is filed, or did not contain an appropriate patent certification at the time of the late submission, to submit a patent certification on such patents. The comment explained that section 505(d)(6) and 505(e)(4) of the act authorizes the agency, after providing an opportunity for a hearing, to refuse to approve an application or to withdraw approval of an NDA for failure to provide patent information. Thus, the comment argued that proposed &sect;314.50(i)(4) conferred a benefit on NDA applicants by permitting late patent information submissions without applying the statutory requirements for timely submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has considered this and other comments which suggest regulatory approaches for handling patents that are filed outside the statutory time limits. Congress clearly intended to enforce timely submission of patent information. The statute requires that patent information be submitted with the application, by amendment prior to approval of the application, or within 30 days after the patent issues. (See 21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1) and (c)(2)). For the most extreme example of untimely patent filing_when a pioneer fails to file required patent information within 30 days of notice from the agency_Congress has provided the extreme remedy of withdrawal of approval of the new drug application. (See 21 U.S.C. 355(e)(4)). Congress did not directly address the question of patent filings that occur more than 30 days after issuance of the patent and for which the agency does not provide notice of the deficiency. The agency could treat these filings in a number of ways. The agency could refuse to publish in the list the untimely patent information. This approach has been rejected because it would provide no notice to subsequent 505(b)(2) or ANDA applicants that a patent exists that the NDA holder believes is applicable to the pioneer drug product. Absence of publication could lead an applicant to submit a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA that it would not have submitted had the patent been listed. As a result, the applicant and the agency may expend resources unnecessarily. In addition, 505(b)(2) or ANDA applicants could thereby subject themselves and the NDA holder to unnecessary patent litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to publication of the proposed rule, the agency was asked to consider regulatory language designed to allow a pioneer holder to update, at any time, its patent information. This approach has been rejected because it would allow for manipulation of the patent filing system by the holder of the NDA and could result in delays in approval of otherwise approvable ANDA's. For example, if patents could be filed at any time after issuance, the holder of the NDA could delay the filing of a patent, and subsequent publication, until within 30 months prior to the expiration of the latest-expiring patent. Even if the ANDA applicant does not believe the patent is applicable to the pioneer drug, it will then be required either to file a paragraph III certification and wait until the patent expires, or to file a paragraph IV certification and therefore initiate the procedure set out at section 505(c)(3)(C) and (j)(4)(B). This procedure requires that the agency wait at least 30 months, unless a shorter or longer period is judicially ordered, before it makes effective approval of the application. Even if the NDA holder is unsuccessful in defending the late-filed patent, it will have extended its period of market monopoly in a manner inconsistent with the intent of Congress when it struck the balance between protecting the patent rights of innovators and encouraging prompt and efficient entry of generics onto the market. By requiring timely filing of patent information, the agency hopes to permit judicial resolution of patent disputes without unduly extending the innovator's period of patent protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The approach adopted by the agency as best embodying the compromise adopted by Congress requires that if an NDA applicant submits required patent information on an approved drug product more than 30 days after issuance of the patent, FDA will publish the untimely information, but will not require ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants with pending applications who have previously submitted a certification, i.e. those applicants who would be prejudiced by the late submission, to recertify to the new patent. Only applicants who initially submit ANDA's or 505(b)(2) applications after the submission of the patent information or whose pending applications do not contain a valid certification at the time of submission would be required to submit a certification as to that patent. (See &sect;&sect;314.50(i)(4) and 314.94(a)(12)(vi).) While this could result in two categories of ANDA's for a pioneer drug, those without certifications for the late-filed patent and those with certifications for that patent, this approach is the best means for discouraging manipulation of the patent filing scheme and providing optimum notice of applicable patents. Disputes over patent issues arising from this approach will be resolved by Federal courts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the agency's opinion that this remedy may also prove suitable in certain instances when an NDA holder fails to respond to an agency request for patent information within the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30-day period. It is a less severe sanction than withdrawing the approval of the NDA, but nonetheless effectuates congressional intent to encourage timely filing and protect patent rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

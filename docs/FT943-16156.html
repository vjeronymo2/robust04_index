			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Lords jolt for government The government suffered two defeats in the Lords last night over plans to set up secure training centres for persistent young offenders. The defeats followed a warning from Earl Ferrers, the home office minister, that amendments proposed by Lord Carr, a former Conservative home secretary, would undermine the criminal justice bill. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, has struggled to win parliamentary approval for large parts of the bill, which implements law-and-order reforms announced at last year's Conservative party conference. Mr Howard is expected to seek to reverse the defeats when the bill returns to the Commons, but the setback could complicate the government's business programme, delaying the start of the summer recess. The Lords voted 170-139, a majority of 31, to support Lord Carr's main amendment, allowing courts to sentence young offenders to local authority secure accommodation rather than government-run secure centres. Peers then voted 147-128, a majority of 19, for a further amendment allowing well-behaved young offenders to be transferred from secure centres to complete their sentences in local authority care. Earl Ferrers told peers during the bill's report stage that the amendments would undermine the government's proposals to set up five privately run, 40-place, secure training centres for offenders aged 12 to 14.</p>

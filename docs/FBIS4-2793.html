			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 13 (XINHUA) -- North China's largest  port city of Tianjin witnessed a new surge of overseas capital  inflow in the first quarter of this year.    In the three months, Tianjin approved the establishment of  554 foreign-funded projects, involving a total investment of 1.4  billion U.S. dollars, figures available today show.    The inflow of foreign funds has topped one billion U.S.  dollars, representing an increase of 55.4 percent over the same  period last year, an official from the municipal foreign trade  and economic cooperation commission said.    The official attributed the increase mainly to the improved  investment environment in the city, and to the efforts made to  improve services and simplify approval procedures.    Over 70 big projects involving overseas investment were  worked out and tracts of land were leased to foreign investors  to develop in the city last year.    So far, the number of the foreign-funded projects whose  total  investment surpasses five million U.S. dollars each has reached  38 this year, a hefty 52 percent rise over the same period last  year. Among them, 27 topped 10 million U.S. dollars each.    Foreign investment in real estate also gained the ground  last  year, with 35 newly-approved foreign-funded real estate projects  and 170 million U.S. dollars of agreed overseas funds.    The city also earned nearly 100 million U.S. dollars by  leasing 9,900 sq m of land, the official said.    It signed contracts for 38 new projects to renovate and  upgrade old industrial enterprises. The move made it possible  for 300 million U.S. dollars of overseas capital to be used in  this aspect.    The 1,220 operational foreign-funded firms in the city are  reported to have completed 5.15 billion yuan in output value and  5.27 billion yuan in turnover, and created 590 million yuan in  profits and taxes in the first quarter.    Exports by these foreign-funded firms accounted for 27.9  percent of the city's total.    In the first three months of this year 26 foreign-funded  firms expanded their investment, and the amount of increased  investment was more than 77 million U.S. dollars, including 32  million U.S. dollars in foreign funds.    The city has newly added 400 projects this year to attract  more foreign investment.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Arts: Today's Television For bank holiday Monday the people who run television have contrived one of the most unattractive schedules imaginable. Between 7.30 and 12.50 BBC2 are showing nothing but programmes about the most boring game on earth; the 'sport' which gave us the professional foul, mouth-to-mouth all male celebration, and Heysel. If you are one of those inverted snobs who love to stand on the terraces supping lager wi' t'lads and chanting racist slogans then presumably you will want to see the whole of Goal TV. Those with a modicum of intelligence will want to look elsewhere - but where? Radio appears to be the answer. Between 1.00 pm and 7.00 Radio 1 broadcasts Listeners' Top 100 Songs, a poll of all-time favourites with the Top 10 at 6.00. The Monday Play on Radio 4 is The Triumph Of The Cunning Man by JR Jones (7.45). Set in 1945 on the coast of Pembrokeshire, it is about Gwyn's mission to recall his father and brothers who were killed in the war. That is followed at 9.00 by Risking Your Neck, an investigation of the true risks of, say, getting cancer from nuclear power or from x-rays.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Total of young dropouts 'heavily underestimated' Far fewer young people than officially realised are in further education, training or work, says a study from the University of Wales, Cardiff. It estimates that up to 23 per cent of people aged 16 and 17 who have left school are outside these categories. The government estimates the figure at not more than 4.5 per cent of the age group, and the South Glamorgan Careers Service registers up to 12.5 per cent. But the study finds that, although the number fluctuates greatly from month to month, there are many more 'missing' teenagers not registered. The study is based on South Glamorgan, but Mr Paul Sheldon, chief executive of the local training and enterprise council, says the results have national implications. The Tec commissioned the study because of a lack of information about the number of young people who, having left school, fail to find a job or a place on a training programme in spite of the government's youth training guarantee. The study was compiled by Mr David Istance and Mr Howard Williamson of the university's School of Social and Administrative Studies. 'The relationship between areas of deprivation, high truancy rates at school and the ongoing lack of involvement in education, training and employment is clear,' Mr Sheldon says. 'Without significant change, we will see the growth of a whole new generation excluded from the jobs market due to a lack of basic core skills, vocational training and, most importantly, the lack of a work ethic.' Of the young people interviewed, the report states: 'The majority displayed a sense of low self-esteem, uncertainty and disorientation about the future and were, according to them, being thrust from pillar to post with little sense of having much control over what was happening to them. From the perspective of these young people, nobody seemed to care.' Even among those who had no early experience of crime, it says, there was a growing tendency towards offending behaviour. The authors share 'serious misgivings' about the withdrawal of income support to 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds and say many suffer genuine hardship. The current levels of training allowances are set so low as to be counter-productive, they say. Young People Not in Education, Training or Employment.

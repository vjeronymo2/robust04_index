			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: No efficiency in electric cars Sir, How can you refer to 'electrically-powered, non-polluting vehicles' ('Electric vehicles 'to boost copper demand'', November 24)? The electricity has first to be generated in a power station, most probably fuelled by coal; the efficiency of converting the coal into electricity will be in the order of 35 per cent. Next, the electricity has to be fed through supply lines to the point of use where it will charge the batteries of the 'non-polluting vehicle'. Transmission losses and battery efficiency take their toll and the 'non-polluting vehicle' becomes the most inefficient user of energy imaginable. F Chilton, The Alders, Grosmont, Whitby, N Yorks</p>

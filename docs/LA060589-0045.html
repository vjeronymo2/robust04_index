			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> NEW SOVIET ETHNIC RIOTING  </P> <P> Two days of ethnic rioting in Uzbekistan left an undisclosed number of dead,  and Soviet authorities have imposed a curfew in portions of the southern  republic, the official Tass news agency reported. "Extremist elements provoked  unrest," Tass said. It said police and Interior Ministry troops were used to  quell the rioting in the republic, which borders Afghanistan. Tass did not say  what caused the flare-up. The conflict was among mostly Muslim Uzbeks and  ethnic Turk-Meskhetis, Tass said. The Meskhetis are a small minority originally  from southern Georgia. Conquered by Turks in the 16th Century, they were  absorbed into Russia in the 19th Century.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] France has agreed in principle to accept the  Shokhin- Brittan formula concerning trade regulations for  substances used in the nuclear industry, notably uranium, at  talks between French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Russian  officials in Moscow, Interfax was informed by Maxim Medvekov,  the Russian Foreign Economic Relations Ministry official in  charge of bilateral cooperation.    France was the only EU [European Union] country at a session  of the EU Council on May 16 not to back the agreements reached  by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin and the EU  Commission's Vice- Chairman Leon Brittan in Moscow on May 2,  thereby putting the signing of the Agreement on Partnership and  Cooperation between the EU and the Russian Federation in June or  July this year under question.    Shokhin and Brittan agreed that general trading standards  would apply to uranium and other fissile substances, but with  some exceptions. France objected to the formula, but was unable  to provide any serious arguments to back its objections,  offering only abstract fears that the European market could  become inundated by Russian uranium some time in the future.    The sides did manage to untie the knot in Moscow, Medvedkov  said, agreeing on minor technical adjustments to the formula.    Now, he said, practically all obstacles to the signing of  the  agreement between Russia and the EU in June or July had been  removed, but he could not be absolutely certain until the draft  agreement had been approved by the EU Council on June 13.</p>

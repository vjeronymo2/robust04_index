			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Markets yet to be convinced on inflation habit BRITAIN IS winning the battle on inflation, but is some way from winning the war. That was the message yesterday from the Bank of England, which said that in spite of low price pressures financial markets have yet to be convinced that the UK has kicked its inflation habit. The Bank says in the inflation report in its quarterly bulletin that the Treasury's favoured measure of underlying inflation is unlikely to breach the government's 4 per cent ceiling in the next two years. This measure defines underlying inflation as the year-on-year rise in the retail prices index excluding mortgage payments. But the Bank adds that expectations in financial markets are not 'consistent with the achievement of the inflation target over the next decade'. It also warns that inflationary pressures could revive if the government fails to take tough action to bring down the rising budget deficit, which is likely to reach about Pounds 50bn this financial year. The Bank's central forecast is that underlying inflation should reach just over 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1995. It has reduced its inflation forecasts slightly since the last inflation report in May. Demonstrating the margin for error, the Bank says that underlying inflation in early 1995 could go as high as about 5 per cent or as low as 2 per cent. The underlying inflation in June stood at 2.8 per cent, after 3.5 per cent in March. Mirroring the decline in this figure has been a fall in 'headline' inflation, as measured by the RPI. This came down to a year-on-year 1.2 per cent in June, the lowest figure for nearly 30 years. Average earnings across the economy rose 3.75 per cent in the year to May, a 26-year low. The Bank reckons that earnings growth will stay subdued during the next year, partly because of high short-term unemployment. According to Bank estimates the proportion of people out of work for a year or less is about 7 per cent, a higher figure than at any time during the 1980s (see charts). While in May investors in gilt-edged securities were expecting inflation in 2010 to be about 5.5 per cent, in recent weeks this figure has come down by about 0.5 percentage points. Even so, the Bank says long-term gilt yields are still high, suggesting that investors 'either require a very large premium to compensate for uncertainty about future inflation' or are unconvinced that future governments will stick to the inflation target. By early next year the Treasury's measure for underlying inflation is likely to move up slightly as the switch from the poll tax to the less expensive council tax drops out of the RPI calculations. Together with the tax increases due to take effect next April, these changes will push up underlying inflation by 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter of next year and by 0.4 points in the second quarter. The Bank also comes up with another method - the RPI excluding not only mortgage payments but also local taxation and excise duties and VAT - for monitoring underlying inflation. It suggests this might be more useful than the Treasury measure. On this basis, underlying inflation 'is expected to decline until the middle of 1994 and then remain roughly constant'. All the Bank's forecasts assume base rates staying at 6 per cent and an unchanged exchange rate. The projections could be thrown off course by a further depreciation in sterling, which could affect prices by pushing up import costs. The Bank says April's appreciation in sterling, which followed the 15 per cent fall in the exchange rate last September after Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, was 'welcome'. Other factors which could trigger higher inflation might include companies or wage bargainers pushing up profits or pay levels in an attempt to regain ground lost during the recession. Helping inflationary remain low is that the labour market is still slack even after the surprise 83,100 fall in unemployment since the beginning of the year.</p>

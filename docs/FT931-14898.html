			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life increases new UK life business by 6% LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life assurance group, yesterday announced a 6 per cent increase in new UK life business for 1992. However, trends for its two trading arms varied widely. Black Horse Financial Services, the 'bankassurance' arm which sells only to customers of Lloyds Bank, saw an increase of 7 per cent to Pounds 66m in regular premiums and of 34 per cent to Pounds 711m in single premiums. That was equivalent to a 19 per cent rise, taking the standard industry yardstick of adding full regular premium business to 10 per cent of single premiums. In contrast, Abbey Life Assurance, which distributes most of its products via a direct sales force, saw regular premium business fall by 11 per cent to Pounds 82.5m and single premiums rise by only 8 per cent to Pounds 289.5m. Using the adjusted new business yardstick, that was equivalent to a fall of 6 per cent compared with 1991. The Abbey Life sales force fell from 3,507 to 3,200. Black Horse's sales force expanded slightly to 1,005. Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive, said the low regular premium figures were caused by low consumer confidence, particularly in the second half. Redundancy pay-outs and early retirements had helped to boost single premium business. He added: 'Banks selling assurance, with relatively strong branding and a customer relationship in place, are always going to have a head start with the customer.' Nonetheless, he was confident that Abbey Life, with its strong distribution power, would survive. He suggested that the increased market share for bank assurance would be at the expense of small companies operating through independent brokers, rather than large direct sales forces.</p>

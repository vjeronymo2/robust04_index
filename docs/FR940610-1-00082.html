			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By definition, the average results reported above mean that some school districts would be expected to experience food costs for the sample menus that vary considerably from those reported above. This is not different from the current situation because there is already a wide range of food costs due to factors such as economies of size, geographic variation in delivery and labor costs, and local market conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Market Effects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To estimate market effects a mathematical model was developed to incorporate information on the kinds, amounts, nutrient content, and costs of foods served in schools lunches. The model uses all of this information and seeks a solution which minimizes the changes in current amounts of foods served in NSLP meals and also meets the nutrition objectives set forth in the Dietary Guidelines and adds no additional costs to food purchases. The model constrains food offerings and recipes to those actually used in schools. However, the meal pattern is allowed to deviate from the current regulations regarding food groups and portion sizes as long as it meets at least one-third the RDA for all nutrients. In keeping with the principles of the Dietary Guidelines, the meals are also restricted to no more than 30 percent of calories from total fat and less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The model can be specified to allow the amounts of all foods to vary, which permits substitution between high and low-fat beef as well as across other food groups such as pork, poultry, vegetables, and fruits. There are a vast number of possible scenarios which can be explored through this model, and the three discussed below have been selected as most useful in understanding the impacts of the proposed rule. In several of these scenarios the model is constrained to maintain the amounts or types of foods. In all three scenarios the volume of beverage milk is held constant at current consumption levels. This was done because milk will remain a required item under the proposed nutrition based menu planning system. The model minimizes the changes in the quantity of each item served and satisfies the nutrition and cost goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The model includes the following constraints for all scenarios: Food ingredient cost at average cost for NSLP meals; calories (1/3 of average energy allowance listed in the RDA report); total fat (not more than 30 percent of calories); saturated fat (less than 10 percent of calories); carbohydrate (not less than 50 percent of calories); cholesterol (not more than 100 mg); 1/3 of RDA level for the following select nutrients: protein, vitamins (vitamins A, B6, B12 and C, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, folate), and minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc); and milk (total volume and mix by fat content held constant at current levels). As described in greater detail below, scenario one is the basic model using these constraints, scenario two constrains all chicken to have the nutrient profile of low-fat chicken, and scenario three constrains the model to retain current levels for major commodity groups. The estimated changes in food items are then aggregated to national estimates based on the total number of school lunches served in FY&hyph;1993. Subsequently, the impact of these changes on agricultural markets are estimated using commodity market models developed by economists in the Economic Research Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Data <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The study is based on the most recently available data on quantity and frequency of foods actually served in NSLP meals, detailed nutrient content of those foods, estimated food ingredient costs, and Recommended Dietary Allowances for micronutrients and Dietary Guidelines recommendations for fat and saturated fat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data on actual foods served in the NSLP were obtained from the 1993 USDA School Nutrition Dietary Assessment (SNDA) study conducted by Mathematica Policy Research for FNS. The study included a survey of about 3550 students in grades 1 through 12 in 545 schools throughout the country. The students reported detailed information on the kinds and amounts of foods and beverages they consumed during a 24-hour period. The impact analysis uses only the portion of the data on foods served to children as part of credited school lunches. It includes plate waste but excluded a la carte items, such as desserts, purchased in addition to the school lunch. The SNDA survey contained detailed information on over 600 food items served in the school lunch program. These items were aggregated into over 50 food groups based on the primary ingredient and the percent of calories from fat. For example, there were two beef categories: high-fat and low-fat beef; two poultry categories; etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Food items costs are estimated from ingredient cost data obtained in the 1993 School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study conducted by Abt for FNS and recipes for school lunch items. The recipes were necessary for two reasons: Aggregation of ingredient costs to costs of food served, and for estimating the change in usage of the various agricultural commodities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the agricultural economy, the amount of most foods served in NSLP meals is a small part of the total U.S. supply of agricultural commodities. For example, USDA and school district purchases of beef products account for less than two percent of the U. S. beef supply. Therefore, even the anticipated changes in the amounts of different foods served in the meals are expected to have minimal or no change in farm level prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three alternative scenarios were examined to gauge market effects with alternative specific recommendations which could be implemented into the meals. All three scenarios meet dietary recommendations and the milk requirement with no change from the current per meal average food cost. Table 1 shows the total U.S. market in millions of pounds for various groups of commodities and the corresponding current school market size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three scenarios illustrate a range of market effects that could occur under alternative implementation assumptions. The first and third options demonstrate the range of market impacts associated with either minimizing the change in current food offerings or minimizing the change in commodity markets. The second scenario was designed to show how the results could change if lower fat preparation techniques were followed in only one of the commodity groups. Although chicken is used in this example, other commodities, such as beef or pork, might show similar changes if substitutions were made between high and low fat alternatives. Additional information on the constraints on the model imposed in each of the three scenarios is described in more detail below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marko Franjic: "How Much Do the Herzegovinians </F> Smoke?"]    [Text] The key question is not the individuals  involved in smuggling; more important is the state budget's  revenue from taxes on tobacco and the control over their  payment, because if there are holes in the regulations and  control over the payment of taxes, there will always be  smugglers.    There are 450 metric tons of cigarettes smoked in the  Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, but three Croatian factories  officially export a total of 2,500 tons of cigarettes there.  Where the 2,000 tons of cigarettes went, and whether taxes were  paid on them, because it is assumed that 60 million German marks  [DM] in taxes have not been collected, was a deputy's question  from Vice Vukojevic on the first day of last week's Assembly  session. Prime Minister Nikola Valentic himself gave him an  interesting answer. The answer was approximately that some of  the cigarettes were exported to Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it was  most likely that a large amount of that tobacco ended up on the  Croatian market and thus evaded taxes.    After that, just a few days after the Assembly session,  everything continued to proceed in the established order and  rhythm, as if it had not upset anyone too much. Since the  question involved fairly specific statements, it seemed that  Vice Vukojevic had more facts, and so we asked him to expand on  his question and explain what was going on, and whether he  perhaps knew anything more about the whole case.    During the Assembly's recess, however, Vukojevic only  responded briefly to our query by saying that we should ask the  Finance Ministry who was given permits to export tobacco and  tobacco products, since the key and the answer lay in that,  while he himself, until he received that information, did not  want to comment on anything else. So far no one has spoken up,  although all three Croatian tobacco factories were clearly  identified in the deputy's question: the Zagreb, Rovinj, and  Zadar factories. They were called upon to answer where they had  marketed the 2,000 tons of tobacco, and whether no more or less  than about DM60 million in taxes had been paid for those  cigarettes. Also named was the Finance Ministry, which has  jurisdiction over issuing export permits. It is also concerned  with supplying the state budget, and it ought to know how much  cigarette tax has been collected. It is interesting that at the  last session of the Assembly, one of the agenda items was the  state budget, and the Ministry's strongest staff, with the prime  minister's assistance, had a great deal of work to do in  defending the proposed figures before the deputies.  <H5>  Germany One Hundred, Croatia Three </H5>   Furthermore, the IMF announced that Croatia would have to  prepared a state budget for the next three years if it wanted to  conclude arrangements with that institution. Naturally, in that  situation the key question is where to get the money, not only  as a fictitious amount on the paper of the state budget, but  rather as real collected revenue, which means that the ministry  absolutely has to take into account the collection of taxes. The  tax administration, which operates as part of the Finance  Ministry, has just prepared a proposal for excise duties, a new  system for taxing products that are of interest for taxation in  every country, which also include cigarettes, because most of  the tax revenue is collected precisely by taxing tobacco,  alcohol, and oil. Every year Germany collected DM100 billion  from those three products, while Croatia, according to some  assumptions, should earn at least DM3 billion. When we add to  this the claims expressed several times--also unofficially  admitted by the tax administration--that the state lost DM200  million on imported and licensed cigarettes and the smuggling of  those cigarettes last year because of the inappropriate tax  system, it is clear that this is not a problem that just  appeared yesterday, nor does it concern negligible revenues.    Furthermore, the state introduced stamps for cigarettes a  long time ago, and precisely thereby declared war on smugglers,  and by a special decree it tried to regulate exports of certain  products, including cigarettes, precisely because of smuggling,  which threatened the state budget's revenues. That decree  prescribed that deposits would be paid on exported goods, and  when it was proven that the exports had taken place, the Finance  Ministry would return the deposited money to the exporter.  Consequently, even before the introduction of the stamps (on 19  November 1992), it was known that cigarettes were a commodity of  interest for smuggling and that the state treasury was being  left empty because of that "interest."    Recently in the Varazdin area, the police there seized large  amounts of smuggled cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. As the  policemen explained, the goods, although intended for  Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the documentation, came from  Slovenia. Specifically, a large amount of cigarettes was first  purchased at the Rovinj Tobacco Factory, and then, according to  the documentation, it was supposed to be exported to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was taken to Slovenia, however, and after  that it was smuggled to the Varazdin area, where it was offered  at lower prices. So far there have been a lot of interested  customers there, who probably knew where the cheaper cigarettes  came from and how.  <H5>  Tobacco Smuggling Lobby </H5>   After that seizure of the smuggled goods, the Varazdin  police  administration says that one can now speak of organized groups  and a well-developed network for the purchase and smuggling of  cigarettes, but also other goods. The system is already known,  and, one might say, the usual one until recently. First of all a  factory in Bosnia-Herzegovina is found that will fictitiously  buy the cigarettes, which afterwards, of course, end up on the  Croatian market at lower prices, because the high taxes, which  are 60 percent for domestic cigarettes, are not paid. Judging by  the suspensions of policemen and customs officers, one can  assume who else is in the smuggling network in addition to  Croatian factories and the ones in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Specific  names are not being mentioned yet, however, and it is not known  whether the network is controlled by one center of power or  whether there are several organized groups. One could hear  stories in the corridors--and one of them was publicized  precisely in DANAS--that one Zagreb private businessman tried to  go into the business as an independent, but after having paid  $420,000 for a truckload of Marlboros, he was left without the  cigarettes or the money, since the deal was not "agreed upon"  with the smuggling lobby that allegedly controls that profitable  business.    After a year and a half the result of all this, aside from  the individual successful and ostentatiously presented police  operations to prevent smuggling known as "Stibra" [Tax] and the  firm promises that the economy will be put in order, is  Vukojevic's deputy's question, bringing up the same problems  again, which may imply that they have not been solved. Deputy  Prime Minister Vladimir Seks, who is responsible for monitoring  the implementation of the "Stibra" operations, says that both  the regular police and the financial police have already been  monitoring and checking what is happening in the profitable  cigarette business for some time now. The confiscations of  smuggled cigarettes, and even the suspensions of policemen and  customs officers, resulted from that. Vladimir Seks, however,  did not want to prejudge anyone's guilt, and thought that it  would not be proper to talk about the involvement of people from  the tobacco factories in cigarette smuggling and even about the  names obtained during the investigation, since the investigation  has not yet been completed.  <H5>  A Time of Big Scandals </H5>   So far it is known for certain that the goods were not  exported, that they did not end up where they were supposed to  according to the customs declaration, and instead were sold on  the black market, probably in Croatia. It is also suspected that  customs declarations were falsified. Since this is all still the  subject of investigation, however, not even Assistant Finance  Minister Bozo Prka could comment much more on it, as he politely  explained. Nevertheless, it appears that this time, what has  been uncovered and what is being investigated will not be hushed  up. Our impression is that the state authorities are now working  seriously on this, but the question is whether it will be  brought to a finish or whether the public will be offered some  "little fish" as scapegoats. After all, the key question is not  the individuals who are engaged in this; what is more important  is the state budget revenues from tobacco taxes and control over  their payment, because if there are holes in the regulations and  control over the payment of taxes, there will always be people  interested in smuggling.    According to the proposed model for tobacco taxes, or excise  taxes, they will be 6,000 and 8,000 dinars, depending on the  location of the sale, for foreign cigarettes, and 2,400 and  3,000 dinars for domestic cigarettes, with customs duties also  paid for imports of foreign cigarettes. The difference in taxes  for foreign and domestic cigarettes was the big reason for the  smuggling of those cigarettes, but Croatia's joining GATT  [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], which is in  preparation, will be based precisely on the requirements to make  taxes on domestic and foreign goods equivalent, with tariffs  being the instrument to protect domestic production. The  question is whether the proposed model for taxing cigarettes  will pass, while experience with smuggling seems to have taught  the Croatian government nothing.    When the present events are summed up after an interval of  time, this will certainly be remembered as a time of big  scandals for which no one has been held accountable, because not  one official has resigned or left because of mistakes and  omissions. In some cases there has not even been an attempt to  determine who could have been responsible for a certain mistake,  but without that, things will not be put in order.</p>

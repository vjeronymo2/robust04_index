			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Lloyd's joins battle on its vital statistics: Richard Lapper reports on how Chatset faces competition for the first time THE DECISION by Lloyd's of London to publish annual syndicate statistics for the first time in its 306-year history has caused some consternation. The decision, announced on Thursday, brings the insurance market into direct competition with Chatset, a small specialist publishing company. Its compendium of statistics, Lloyd's League Tables, had been regarded as the most comprehensive available for the 22,000 Names, the individuals who provide the market's capital. Mr Charles Sturge and Mr John Rew, Chatset's founders and editors, have become increasingly outspoken critics of the Lloyd's establishment and their supporters suggest that the move is deliberately designed to spike their guns. Mr Sturge says the new Lloyd's venture is designed to 'stuff' Chatset, which derives most of its revenues from sales of about 2,000 copies of League Tables each year. Since its publication in 1981, the annual 400-page compendium of statistics has become to Lloyd's what Wisden is to cricket. League Tables are painstakingly prepared from dozens of syndicate reports. The new publication, called Limelight, draws directly on the considerable resources of the Lloyd's Corporation, the body that provides back-up services to the market. Lloyd's says that the new venture is 'absolutely commercial'. It aims to sell 3,000 copies this year and looks well placed to eat into Chatset's market share. Not only is Limelight, a hefty 600-page manual, cheaper than League Tables, it also contains more information. Worse still, the market is declining as the number of Names falls - and there is more competition around the corner. Next week the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Names, is set to launch a much improved version of its own syndicate guides, which members will receive free as part of their annual Pounds 90 subscription. The guides will be based on statistical work carried out by Financial Intelligence &amp; Research, a management company. Ironically, it is precisely the success of League Tables that has paved the way for Chatset's difficulties. Mr Sturge and Mr Rew have been pioneers in promoting the climate of greater openness at Lloyd's that has led directly to the increase in competition. Until the 1980s, the operation of syndicates, into which Names are grouped, was shrouded in secrecy. Names could obtain the results of their own syndicates. But Mr Sturge, who worked as an underwriter, recalls: 'You could never find out how other syndicates had peformed. It was strictly not allowed to swap reports. They were considered confidential documents.' Chatset's supporters say Lloyd's has been stung by criticism to compete and angered by Chatset's support for disaffected Names, who have borne the brunt of recent losses at the market, and by the pessimism of its recent forecasts. Mr Oliver Carruthers, a prominent Lloyd's-watcher who edits a monthly newsletter, Digest of Lloyd's News, and helps compile the League Tables, says the move by Lloyd's is a 'spoiling tactic'. Chatset's critics, on the other hand, say that its high profile has been artificial and that the views of its editors have been unduly influenced by the large losses they have sustained themselves. Yesterday Mr Sturge was phlegmatic. Readers will still want Chatset's pithy commentaries on market and syndicate prospects, he believes. 'We've got to hope that brand loyalty wins the day. The future is a bit worrying. But you have to wonder whether there will be a Lloyd's next year, let alone a Chatset or a Limelight.'</p>

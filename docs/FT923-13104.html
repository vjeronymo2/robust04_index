			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Maxwell inquiry order challenged AN EMPLOYEE of Lehman, the US finance house, yesterday challenged an order that he submit to oral examination by the joint liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the company from which hundreds of millions of pounds of Maxwell group pension funds have disappeared. Mr Mark Haas, a manager in Lehman's fixed income division and an executive director of Lehman Brothers International, asked the High Court to discharge or vary the order, made under the Insolvency Act. His examination has been provisionally fixed for tomorrow. Mr Charles Aldous QC, for Mr Haas, told Mr Justice Hoffmann that Mr Haas was not seeking to have the order discharged with a view to withholding information from the liquidators. He had not been involved in the introduction of any Maxwell companies to Lehman, nor in the establishment of a stock lending agreement entered into with BIM in November 1989. He had not become involved in the agreement until about August 1990. The liquidators believed that pension fund assets had been charged under the agreement as collateral for loans which, although ostensibly for the benefit of BIM, had in fact gone to other Maxwell companies or interests. Mr Haas was willing to answer written questions but objected to an 'oppressive' oral examination in which questions could be put ranging over the whole of the operation of the stock lending agreement. Mr Aldous suggested that the 'sole or predominant' purpose of the oral examination was not to get Mr Hass's assistance about the agreement but 'to seek to establish by admissions a case against a third party or the company which employs him'. Lehman had already provided an enormous amount of documents, Mr Aldous said. It was estimated that since April 1 about 10,000 had been made available. Mr John Brisby, counsel for the liquidators, said all questions that could sensibly be dealt with in writing had been dealt with. 'We are now down to the rump of things we say can only be dealt with by oral examination,' he said. The hearing continues today.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad hit by Pounds 12m exceptional costs Owners Abroad yesterday announced profits before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 17.8m for the 12 months to October 31, compared with Pounds 30.4m the previous year. Mr Francis Baron, chief executive, said Pounds 12m of exceptional items had pulled the pre-tax profits figure down to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 25.5m). Mr Baron said Pounds 4.9m of the exceptional costs were attributable to the successful defence last year to a takeover bid by Airtours, its rival, the establishment of its strategic alliance with travel agents Thomas Cook and other professional fees. A further Pounds 1.5m of exceptional costs arose from compensation paid to former directors of the group. Mr Howard Klein, chairman, Mr Roger Allard, managing director, and Mr Geoffrey Stone, finance director, resigned last year. Mr Baron would not say how the compensation was divided between the three. The remaining costs related to property provisions in the UK and Spain. Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 710m as a result of holiday price discounting and reduced airline revenues. Cash balances at the year-end were Pounds 100.3m, compared with Pounds 98.4m. COMMENT The City was cheered yesterday by the absence of any previously undisclosed bad news. Mr Baron is also widely seen to be taking appropriate action to restructure the group. A cause for concern, however, is how Thomson and Airtours, the group's larger competitors, plan to respond to Owners Abroad's new management. Mr Baron said Lunn Poly and Going Places, the larger groups' travel agents chains, had damaged Owners Abroad last year by pushing Thomson and Airtours holidays. Owners Abroad's link with Thomas Cook gives it some advantages but does not allow it to respond fully in kind. Expected 1994 profits of Pounds 21m and earnings of 7.4p put the group on a prospective multiple of 16, which is probably generous. Most analysts, however, do not expect restructuring benefits to show through until 1995, when expected Pounds 27.5m profits and earnings of 9.7p provide a more realistic multiple of 12.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Prevent Hong Kong People From Getting Involved </F> in Controversies Over `Human Rights'"]    [Text] Instigated by the British Foreign Affairs Select  Committee report on human rights issues, some pro-British and  anti-Chinese forces in Hong Kong have made use of various  opportunities to influence public opinion into urging the  British Hong Kong Government to do two things prior to 1997,  namely: First, to set up a committee to "supervise human rights  conditions in Hong Kong after 1997"; and second, to negotiate  with the Chinese side on the applicability of the two  international covenants on human rights in Hong Kong, while  demanding that the Chinese Government regularly reports on human  rights conditions in Hong Kong after 1997 to the UN Commission  on Human Rights and accepts its supervision.    Lu Ping, deputy director and secretary-general of the  Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee for the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR], recently made an  explicit response on those two issues. He indicated that the  establishment of a committee on human rights in Hong Kong would  obviously run counter to the Basic Law. Should such a committee  be set up, that would turn out to be something "alien" in the  future and would definitely be abolished after 1997. The parts  of the two international pacts on human rights applicable to  Hong Kong will be implemented through Hong Kong laws after 1997  in accordance with the stipulations in the Basic Law. China is  not a signatory of the two human rights pacts and has no  responsibility or obligation whatsoever to report to the UN  Commission on Human Rights on Hong Kong human rights conditions.  These words are convincing enough.    What should Hong Kong rely on in protecting human rights  after 1997? A law or an organization alone? Of course, we  should rely on the Basic Law formulated with Hong Kong  residents' hearts and souls and not an organization set up at  the instigation of a handful of pro-British and anti-Chinese  elements. During the Sino-British talks in 1984, the Chinese  Government announced a series of basic principles and policies  toward Hong Kong which included the stipulation that "the Hong  Kong SAR Government will protect the rights and freedoms of the  residents and other people in the Hong Kong SAR in accordance  with the law. The Hong Kong SAR Government maintains the rights  and freedoms stipulated in Hong Kong's existing laws...."  Later, these policies were fixed in the form of the Basic Law  and became solemn legal provisions which nobody can violate. The  National People's Congress has endowed Hong Kong residents with  a legal weapon to protect their own legitimate rights,  interests, and freedoms. So long as we resolutely safeguard the  Basic Law after 1997, the basic rights and freedoms of Hong Kong  residents will be protected.    If some people think that human rights can be guaranteed  only  in those countries and regions where committees on human rights  are set up, is it not like saying that human rights do not exist  in the many countries in the world where such committees are  absent? Britain and the United States do not have committees on  human rights. Does this prove that there are no human rights in  Britain and the United States?    In 1991, when some people in Hong Kong set out the need to  establish a committee on human rights, the Hong Kong government  stated explicitly that the issue would not be taken into  consideration, saying that "having referred to the experiences  of some countries which have set up committees on human rights,  including Canada and Australia, the Hong Kong Authorities  believe that the need to set up a committee on human rights does  not exist." How will the British Hong Kong Government answer  the question today?    The organization for a committee on human rights does not  exist in the Basic Law. Some people are going all out to  advocate the establishment of such an organization. In fact,  this is their attempt to sow the seed of instability after 1997  and make this a breakthrough for revising the Basic Law.    Regarding the relevant clauses in the "International  Covenant  on Civil and Political Rights" and the "International Covenant  on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights" which are applicable  to Hong Kong, it is stipulated in the Basic Law that they "will  continue to be effective" and will be "implemented through the  law of the Hong Kong SAR." Here, it says that only those  clauses "which are applicable to Hong Kong" in these two  international covenants will be effective and does not mean they  will be copied in their entirety. They must be implemented by  Hong Kong SAR laws after 1997 and the British Hong Kong  Government should not intervene by making any stipulations.    Some people are clamoring for Hong Kong to adopt the two  covenants before 1997 and cannot wait to use some of the clauses  helpful to them to revise existing laws (such as legal documents  on media operations and the government regulations on security  and social security) and to serve their purpose of formulating  the "law on freedom to seek information [zi xun 6327 6061]" and  "draft regulations on the committee for human rights and equal  opportunities."    The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the  existing Hong Kong laws will remain basically unchanged. The  Basic Law stipulates that, with the founding of the SAR, the  existing laws of Hong Kong will be adopted as the Hong Kong SAR  laws with the exception of those nominated by the NPC Standing  Committee as running counter to the Basic Law. Should any more  of the existing laws be found to run counter to the Basic Law,  they will be revised and terminated in accordance with the  procedures stipulated in the Basic Law. Should the British Hong  Kong Government make any revisions of its existing laws running  counter to the Basic Law before 1997, or formulate decrees and  regulations in violation of the Basic Law, these will all be  abolished after 1997. Some people are attempting to introduce  the two international covenants on human rights before 1997 and  compel the Chinese Government to bear the obligation to report  Hong Kong human rights conditions to the UN Commission on Human  Rights. Obviously, they want to make preparations to add  international pressure to impeding the NPC Standing Committee  from abolishing the decrees and regulations which run counter to  the Basic Law. Nevertheless, that is just a one-sided wish.    Some people think that, at the instigation of the British  Foreign Affairs Select Committee report, the British Hong Kong  Government and its followers have made a great fuss over the  human rights issue in an attempt to push Hong Kong into the  vortex of controversies over "human rights," confuse right and  wrong, and achieve their ulterior motive. We really must be  vigilant and guard against this.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Election factor spurs trade war: Simon Davies and Simon Holberton go behind the US-China dispute THE HONG Kong business community's interest in an election 13,000km across the Pacific contrasts with its somewhat apathetic response to the planting of the seeds of democracy in its own front yard. The importance of Hong Kong as a conduit for trade between the US and China is such that the election of a US presidentcan have more impact on the Hong Kong economy than the election of any localpolitician. And the breakdown this week of talks between Washington and Beijing, aimed at avoiding the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on a 'hit-list' of Chinese goods, has heightened interest in the US election. At stake is nearly 20 per cent, by value, of China's 1991 exports to the US. Of last year's near USDollars 20bn of sales to the US, USDollars 13.3bn were routed through Hong Kong and an unknown, but presumed large, percentage was made by Hong Kong-owned factories in southern China. 'There is always a political and an economic imperative in trade disputes,' says Mr Jim Walker, research director of Credit Lyonnais Securities. 'This dispute is driven by a political imperative: the re-election of George Bush.' Many economists argue that, if the proposed hit-list on USDollars 3.9bn-worth of imports from China were to be applied, there would be far more damage to Hong Kong than to China, which has a rapidly growing domestic market. The Hong Kong government issued an implicit warning to the US recently that application of the hit-list, which could mean tariffs of up to 100 per cent, would have a knock-on effect of USDollars 4.5bn on Hong Kong's trade. There are fears the real impact could be worse. China is already threatening to block a similar amount in US imports to China. According Mr Ian MacFarlane, Wardley Investment Services chief economist, this would eradicate a further HKDollars 500m in Hong Kong trade. The Hong Kong government estimates that the territory would lose 16,000 jobs and 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product as an immediate reaction to the tariffs. The knock-on effect would be more severe. Wardley claims that the secondary impact - loss of investment confidence, tourism and business related to re-exports - would result in as much as 2 per cent being sliced off GDP in the following year; in 1993, that would mean a loss of about HKDollars 14bn. Hong Kong is the outlet for 80 per cent of Guangdong province's exports, and about 75 per cent of products manufactured by Hong Kong companies are made in Guangdong. Given the escalation of the dispute, however, the atmosphere in Hong Kong is surprisingly relaxed; nobody believes the colony will in fact be hit by the full list of trade tariffs against China. 'There is a high probability that Hong Kong will have to brace itself for some bad news, but I don't think it will be as bad as people are now calculating,' says Mr MacFarlane. Other economists believe Hong Kong will come out totally unscathed. First, the US is pushing against a door the Chinese government wants to open. Beijing is well aware that, if it is to achieve its aim of membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, its foreign trading regime will have to conform to what Washington wants. Chinese trade negotiators have already given US negotiators a substantial list of product categories covered by import bans. It has agreed it will not enforce 'secret' trade regulations, and will eliminate all import substitution policies. Second, although the Chinese currency is still officially pegged near Yn5.4 to the dollar, it is trading at nearly Yn7 in the officially-sanctioned 'swap' market. In the short term, at least, this sizeable devaluation ought to be a boon to Chinese exports to the US, even if the trade talks fail and tariffs are raised. Then there is Mr Bush himself. Beijing does not like change and, in the incumbent, it sees a US president who has kept economics and trade separate from human rights. Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic party's presidential candidate, is an unknown quantity for China. The responsibilities of office may lead a President Clinton to moderate his anti-China rhetoric of the campaign trail, but China will not want to risk that by harming the electoral chances of the only friend it has in Washington.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Call Report data also show that 63 percent of the dollar volume of agricultural real estate loans fell below the $100,000 threshold, and that 15 percent fell between $100,000 and $250,000. For thrifts, TFR data show that 46 percent of farm loans fell below $100,000, and 36 percent between $100,000 and $250,000. Farm loans represented approximately one-half of one percent (.58%) of non-residential mortgages held by thrifts. Thus, in the area of farm loans, only a relatively small amount of additional loans will be exempted by the raised threshold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the increase in the threshold will increase the dollar volume of exempt transactions, the agencies believe that the quality of loans and lending practices of banks and thrifts will not change for these transactions. Moreover, an institution must obtain evaluations for these exempt transactions when it does not obtain appraisals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, there is evidence that the loss rates on loans below the $250,000 threshold will be low. For 1992, the commercial bank loss rate for farm loans was .23 percent (approximately the same loss rate as for 1-to-4 family loans). These loss rates on residential and farm loans are significantly lower than the loss rates for the types of real estate loans that are much less likely to fall below the $250,000 threshold_construction loans (3.54% loss rate for commercial banks) and multifamily loans (1.68% loss rate for commercial banks). Loss rates for non-farm non-residential real estate loans at commercial banks were 1.55 percent, higher than residential or farm loans, but still below the loss rates experienced for loans for construction or multifamily housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in addition to the relatively lower risk of the portfolio of real estate related loans between $100,000 and $250,000, the fact remains that the dollar amount of each credit is relatively small. In the experience of the agencies, banks and thrifts generally do not fail because of real estate-related financial transactions under $250,000. It is generally large construction and development loans that have created safety and soundness problems. For example, much of the thrift losses of the 1980s were caused by losses in large, speculative real estate development projects, such as construction of offices, condominiums, and apartments. See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GAO Report AFMD 89&hyph;62, Thrift Failures: Costly Failures Resulted from Regulatory Violations and Unsafe Practices. Such projects generally involve loans in much greater amounts than $250,000. The experience of the agencies continues to be that larger development and construction loans are most likely to cause significant losses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although many commenters suggested that raising the threshold would result in losses similar to those of the thrift failures of the 1980s, they did not offer analysis to support those statements. The agencies do not believe that inadequate appraisals on loans under $250,000 were a significant cause of those failures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional Protections. Significant protections exist so that loans under $250,000 will not create a safety and soundness problem once the $250,000 threshold is in place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, each agency will, during each required full-scope, on-site examination, analyze the prudence of each institution's credit underwriting practices, including appraisal and evaluation practices, as appropriate to the institution's size and nature of its real estate-related activities. If an institution is doing a poor job of evaluating real estate for transactions under $250,000, then the appropriate agency may order the institution to obtain appraisals for certain loans or for all loans above a certain amount that are not subject to another exemption. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As noted below, the agencies may require an appraisal for loans between $100,000 and $250,000 (not otherwise subject to an exemption) when an institution is in troubled condition, and that troubled condition is attributable to underwriting problems in the institution's real estate loan portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, even though a bank or thrift will not generally be required to obtain a Title XI appraisal for real estate-secured loans under $250,000, the institution must determine the value of the real estate before making the loan. Under the appraisal regulations, banks and thrifts must support any transaction below the threshold with an evaluation that is consistent with the agencies' guidelines. Evaluations will be performed by persons who are capable of rendering an appropriate estimate of value of real estate as a result of their real estate-related experience or training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As several commenters noted, a $250,000 threshold will have its greatest effect in smaller communities where property values are lower. However, as many community bank commenters pointed out, local lenders in small communities tend to be extremely knowledgeable of property values. Also, collateral for loans of this size do not typically represent complex problems of analysis or valuation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, a $250,000 threshold does not prevent the use of appraisals when needed. Banks and thrifts may obtain appraisals prepared by licensed or certified appraisers whenever the institutions believe it is prudent, and customer may independently obtain such appraisals. If, as some commenters contend, history demonstrates that such appraisals are important to the decision to lend and the failure to obtain such an appraisal will lead to higher loss rates, then banks and thrifts would presumably have a strong incentive to use appraisals. As several commenters noted, institutions will obtain appraisals when their underwriting criteria warrant one, regardless of whether regulations require it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, in many cases involving residential real estate, banks and thrifts will be required to obtain the equivalent of a Title XI appraisal in order to make the loan eligible for sale in the secondary market. According to HUD data, in 1992, secondary mortgage market purchasers, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), purchased approximately 63 percent of all 1-to-4 family mortgages originated in the United States. In addition to the 63 percent that were purchased by major secondary mortgage market entities, other loans were originated so as to be eligible for sale to such entities. The agencies have concluded that the appraisal requirements of these government sponsored agencies should protect federal financial and public policy interests in the loans that are eligible to be purchased by them. The agencies also believe that compliance with these appraisal requirements will protect the safety and soundness of regulated financial institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Data Submitted by Commenters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The notice of proposed rulemaking asked commenters to submit loan loss data for different categories of real estate-secured loans above and below $250,000. Many depository institution commenters noted that they do not maintain loss data by loan size and that this information is not reasonably accessible. Only a small number of depository institutions submitted such data. The agencies do not believe that this response is sufficiently large to base any conclusions about industry-wide conditions. Nonetheless, the agencies note that the information provided by commenters is consistent with the low loss rates for real estate lending indicated by other sources. The responses that the agencies received are summarized in the following table. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Rongdian (1728 2837 0368)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- Meeting with the sixth  delegation of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] headed  by Wataru Kubo, SDPJ general secretary and a member of Japan's  House of Councillors, in Zhongnanhai this morning, Jiang Zemin,  general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president of  the state, expressed the hope that China and Japan will make  constant efforts to promote the two countries' good  neighborliness and reciprocal cooperation.    During their cordial and friendly conversation, Jiang Zemin  extended welcome to the delegation and said: "I have met the  leaders of your party on several occasions in Beijing and Tokyo.  I think senior leaders of our two parties should maintain  regular contacts which are very important for promoting  understanding and friendship. I hope your party will regard  this visit as a new starting point and continue to promote the  development of Sino- Japanese relations."    Jiang Zemin said: China and Japan are close neighbors.  Developing the two countries' good neighborliness and  cooperation not only is in line with the interests and  aspirations of Chinese and Japanese people, but also is in the  interests of peace and development in Asia and the rest of the  world. China and Japan should make continuous efforts to  promote their good neighborliness and reciprocal cooperation.    Jiang Zemin spoke highly of SDPJ's perennial efforts in  preserving and promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, saying that,  over the years, the SDPJ has made important contributions to  normalizing Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and promoting the  healthy development of Sino-Japanese relations.    Wataru Kubo said: "SDPJ always attaches great importance to  its ties with China. We maintain that approaching history  correctly is an important issue in Japan-China relations. We  always advocate that Japan should follow the course of peaceful  development and should preserve and promote Japan-China  friendship. The purpose of my current visit to China is to  further promote the development of Japan-China friendship  through marking the 10th anniversary of the establishment of  ties between our two parties."    Jiang Zemin said: The discordant tone which recently  appeared in Sino-Japanese relations runs counter to history and  the feelings of Chinese and Japanese peoples and so it was bound  to be condemned. "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide  for the future." Only when we approach history correctly and  insist on preserving Sino-Japanese friendship can the peoples of  our two countries be friends for generations to come.    Wataru Kubo indicated that the SDPJ, no matter whether it is  a ruling party or not, will continue to have friendly contacts  with the CPC and the Chinese people, and will also strive for  peace and development for Japan and China, as well as Asia and  the world.    Li Shuzheng, head of the CPC Central Committee International  Liaison Department, was present at the meeting.    On the morning of 16 May, Li Shuzheng and members of the  delegation had working discussions on the development of the two  parties' relations and other issues.    Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met and  feted the delegation at the Diaoyutai State Guest House this  evening.</p>

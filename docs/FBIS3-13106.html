			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>   [Excerpts] Today's cabinet meeting, which was held under  the cloud of a government crisis, addressed an issue which has a  majority support only in the present cabinet composition. The  issue was the immediate evacuation of the Jewish settlement of  Hebron. The Meretz ministers and Ministers Bar'am, Namir, and  Ben-Eli'ezer were in favor of the evacuation. The cabinet will  not vote on the issue before next week. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Minister Sarid is working on an alternative  proposal to be raised if the evacuation idea falls through:  Rabin and Peres will announce that the future of the centers of  friction, such as the Jewish settlements in Hebron, Netzarim,  and Kfar Darom, is to be decided within a few months, rather  than after the interim period in five years. Sarid stressed  that any decision on the settlements' future will be a purely  Israeli decision completely unlinked to the negotiations with  the Palestinians.    Rabin and Peres did not announce their views on the matter,  although they said last week that they were against such a move.  Both Minister Tzur and Minister Shetrit were opposed. [passage  omitted]    Also this morning, the cabinet decided to somewhat ease the  closure on the territories. According to the decision, 4,500  Arab men and women above the age of 40 will receive permits to  work in Israel in the coming days.    On another matter, Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir  advised the ministers that several persons, who had applauded  the Hebron massacre, will be charged with agitation by the end  of the week. Attorney General Ben-Ya'ir reported legal  difficulties in outlawing Kakh and Kahana Hay.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German economic slowdown gives bourses confidence THE NEWS that German wholesale prices fell by 1.3 per cent in July from June, and 0.9 per cent from July, 1991, gave bourses something to bite on yesterday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. The question was whether investors were really moving, or just talking about it, while traders covered their short positions and tried, on a Friday afternoon, to make a little weekend spending money. PARIS was encouraged by the German economic data and comments by Bundesbank deputy president Mr Hans Tietmeyer, interpreted as implying no immediate change in German interest rates. The CAC-40 index, which hit a year's low on Thursday, closed up 31.10 at 1,753.46, still 1.3 per cent down on the week. The futures market reacted quickly to the German news, having been depressed in early trading, and this enthusiasm was quickly taken up by equities. However, in spite of the mild euphoria that greeted the unexpected change of direction, turnover remained moderate at FFr1.62bn. Some FFr102m of that was accounted for by dealings in Eurotunnel which continued to rise on earlier reports that settlement may be in sight over the dispute between the group and contractors. Its shares advanced FFr2.60 or 8 per cent to FFr35.10. FRANKFURT had little time to react to the prices data and the DAX index, while it rose 6.82 to 1,547.80 on the day, still closed 3.8 per cent down on the week. There were signs in London, later, that blue chips were recovering further in the post bourse. Turnover fell from DM6bn to DM4.9bn. During the session, the carmakers BMW and Daimler dropped DM1.50 to DM530.50 and DM3.50 to DM617 respectively. Dealers said that the weaker dollar has been weighing on exporters and Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, of James Capel in Frankfurt, expected a sizeable drop when the July car registration data come out in about a week. Mr Wodniok said that yesterday's was a technical recovery, perhaps with some shorts covered, but that after the severe depression of sentiment on Tuesday and Wednesday in particular, people were beginning to think about equity investment again. AMSTERDAM, encouraged by its neighbours, moved ahead with the CBS Tendency index gaining 1.5 to 113.3. But weakness throughout the rest of the week resulted in the index shedding 2.2 per cent over that period. Wessanen, the food products group, stood out with a rise of Fl 2.20 to Fl 87.70 after earlier reporting a 13 per cent rise in first half earnings. ING, the insurance group, rose 20 cents to Fl 46.20 on news that it was not to take a 5 per cent stake in Banque Bruxelles Lambert. MILAN weakened on Moody's downgrading of Italy's foreign currency debt rating, the Comit index dropping 4.58 to 393.70, 5.6 per cent lower on the week, in very low volume. Investors ignored preliminary measures to enliven the market, and to advance the government's ambitious privatisation programme, announced late on Thursday by the finance minister Mr Giovanni Goria. Traders did note, however, that the insurance sector posted gains in after-hours trading, partly on rumours of a devaluation of the lira, which has been under speculative pressure. Ras closed down L265 to L13,744 but recovered to L13,908 later, while Alleanza fell L206 to L11,069 but recovered all of that and L2 more to end at L11,277. MADRID followed Europe up, the general index finished 2.09 higher at 207.58, 3.8 per cent lower on the weak, but dealers said that the higher prices had hardly any support in volume terms. Banks were the outstanding feature, led higher by Santander which gained Pta130, or 3.9 per cent to Pta3,500. Banesto added Pta65 to Pta2,160 and Popular Pta180 to Pta8,800. OSLO rose for the first time in eleven trading sessions, the all share index ending 3.49 better at 351.33, still 3.1 per cent lower on the week. VIENNA ended the week stronger with the ATX index up 13.12 at 696.08, but 3.3 per cent lower over five days.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open  10.30am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1029.46  1032.67  1033.63  1036.53  1036.86  1038.97  1040.67  1042.13  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1042.13    Day's Low  1029.33  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Aug 13    Aug 12    Aug 11    Aug 10     Aug 7 1035.59   1037.76   1044.92   1049.68   1067.01  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

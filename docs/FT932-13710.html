			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Going against the grain When Pauls Food, a small UK manufacturer of private-label groceries for supermarkets, acquired a troubled breakfast cereals plant in northern France for Pounds 3.8m in late 1988, it knew it was taking a gamble. Not only had the plant's losses and demoralised workforce deterred several larger prospective buyers; but in seeking to export its private-label expertise to continental Europe, Pauls was heading down on a road previously untravelled by any British food company. But, after some nervous moments, the gamble paid off. Today the French business, H&amp;C Cereales, is the country's leading manufacturer of private-label breakfast cereals, supplying most of its main food retailers and a growing list of customers elsewhere in Europe. Its annual sales of Pounds 35m are nine times higher than when it was acquired and contribute a third of Pauls' total turnover. It has been in profit for almost three years and is in the middle of a Pounds 10m expansion programme. The turnround, though remarkably swift, was far from effortless. Pauls found that building a business in France has required it to teach retail customers at least as much as it has learned from them. And early on, the whole enterprise almost came to grief. Pauls, part of Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, a British industrial conglomerate, had initially planned to raise H&amp;C Cereales' output volumes to economic levels by exporting to the UK. However, the idea foundered on resistance from UK retailers, which criticised the products' quality and on a weakening of sterling against the French franc in 1989. Though a trusted British manager had been put in charge of the business and installed tighter financial controls, output was still well below capacity in early 1990 and losses were continuing to mount. 'We really began to wonder whether we had done the right thing,' recalls Alan Jones, Pauls' managing director. He decided to stake everything on a bolder strategy. This called for H&amp;C Cereales to go all-out to win continental business by transforming itself from a mediocre 'me too' producer into an innovator which aspired to match the standards of Kellogg, the industry leader. Substantial investments have been made in sophisticated production equipment, better raw materials, quality controls and product development. By the end of this year, Pauls will have invested Pounds 14m in H&amp;C Cereales, on top of the purchase price. A crucial element in the strategy, says Jones, was the decision to offer continental supermarkets a comprehensive range of services. This was a novelty in France, where most private-label groceries are cheap and usually inferior imitations of branded products and their manufacturers provide retailers with little marketing support. Pauls' found it had a powerful calling card in its experience as a supplier to chains such as J. Sainsbury and Tesco in the UK, where - uniquely in Europe - private-label is a high-margin business which competes on quality as well as on price. However, although French retailers envied their UK counterparts' success in private-label, none really understood how to replicate it. 'It was quite difficult at first,' says Jones. 'Some of our French customers took as long as two years to learn the business. Even today, only a few devote staff exclusively to managing private-label, as UK supermarkets do.' H&amp;C Cereales, which employs a multi-lingual sales and account management team based in Paris, now helps retailers in France and other continental countries identify opportunities by supplying them with market research. It also advises extensively on product specifications, packaging, design, labelling and regulatory issues. Today, the company claims 12 per cent of French breakfast cereals sales and is the third largest supplier after Kellogg and Cereal Partners Worldwide, a joint venture between General Mills of the US and Nestle of Switzerland. About 40 per cent of the Picardy plant's output is exported and a second factory may eventually be built elsewhere in Europe. Jones thinks private-label could ultimately capture as much as a fifth of the European breakfast cereals market which, in France, is growing by 20 per cent annually. He is not worried that Pauls could be squeezed by its two bigger competitors, which are spending an estimated 20 per cent of the value of their French sales on advertising. H&amp;C Cereales has benefited, not suffered, from their extensive marketing campaigns, he says. 'It certainly helps that two branded multinational players are firmly committed to ensuring that the market expands.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>   [Excerpt] Last night the residents of the Dugit settlement  in the northern Gaza Strip abandoned their settlement and set up  an encampment on the Israeli side of the border. The encampment  was a protest against what they termed a deterioration in the  state of security.    "We do not intend to return to Dugit any more. We fear for  our lives. If they cannot protect us, they should compensate us  and let us leave," two settlers, Tova Goren and Orit Qariti,  said last night.    The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the police placed guards  at the encampment and declared the new settlement a closed  military zone, permitting the settlers to stay on the site till  morning.

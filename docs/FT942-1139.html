			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie at new 1994 low on dollar's problems - Market report The UK stock market plunged through its low point for the year yesterday, closing at its lowest level since July 1993, as fears grew that the apparent failure of central bank intervention to protect the dollar may force the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Although equity trading was not heavy, share prices collapsed as the dollar continued to fall. The FT-SE 100 Index declined nearly 66 points to close at the day's low after one of the largest daily setbacks of the year. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index down 65.8 at 2,876.6. Interest rate fears were fuelled from the US market, where the Dow Industrial Average was down 40 points when London closed. Almost the whole of the Footsie 100 list was savaged, with the UK interest-related shares vying with dollar stocks in the setback. The market closed without a glimmer of recovery, with traders convinced that unless action was taken over the weekend, the dollar and the securities markets would face a further pounding next week. British government bonds had a turbulent session. After falling at first as the dollar weakened, gilt-edged securities quickly rallied and briefly moved into positive territory when it was confirmed that the central banks had taken action in the currency markets. But the bond market turned down again sharply as selling of the dollar was renewed. By the close of trading, short-dated gilts, the most closely linked to UK base rates, were  3/8 down. The longs, continuing to express fears of inflation ahead, shed . Index-linked gilts, the market's inflation hedge, slipped  17/32 . In the equity market, losses across the broad range of equities were reflected in a fall of 62.7 to 3,374.2 on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which covers an extended list of blue-chip and second-line stocks. However, equity volume, as measured by the Seaq electronic network, recorded a total of only 450.2m shares, a relatively low figure and nearly 17 per cent down on Friday; non-Footsie shares made up about 56 per cent of yesterday's total. The poor volume figure bore out comments from several leading securities houses that the current weakness of UK equities has been caused by unwillingness of the institutions to buy shares rather than by heavy selling pressure. Several leading securities firms again drew attention to valuations of equities against bonds, suggesting that these implied that UK shares were not overvalued at current levels. Traders said that there was 'some selling' at the opening when international clients reacted to the fall in the US dollar in New York and Tokyo. 'But after that it was too late to sell,' said one dealer. The Footsie managed to regain the 2,900 mark briefly when bonds turned higher as the central banks intervened to support the US currency. This was also seen by some optimists as an indication of underlying support for equities. But the finally convincing loss of the Footsie 2,900 level was an alarming development for the equity chartists who now fear that the market could be vulnerable down to the 2,800 mark - unless more determined action is taken to settle the US currency. Some comfort was also taken from the rapid, albeit temporary, recovery in the bond market at mid-session. Volatility in this market has been a prime factor in unsettling equities.</p>

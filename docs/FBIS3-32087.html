Foreign Minister  Salaverria read a six-point official communique which cited the  Vienna Convention that guarantees complete immunity from  judicial punishment, which in this case favors the U.S. officer.    According to the communique, Maj. Lopez is not subject to  any  sort of detention or arrest by Salvadoran authorities, and can  be summoned to give testimony regarding this case. [sentence as  heard] According to Salaverria, this same diplomatic immunity  applies in similar cases involving diplomats in any country  which has signed the Vienna Convention. Nevertheless, the  foreign minister condemned the incident:    [Begin Salaverria recording] This incident is condemnable  from every angle, and it is regrettable because it involves a  person's life. Whether the life of a Salvadoran or a foreigner,  all life is priceless, and no monetary compensation that may  eventually be paid to the family can offset this loss. One must  consider other family aspects, such as the effect this man's  absence will have on his children, as well as how this will  affect them for the rest of their lives. These are just some of  the considerations. I, however, can assure you that no one can  be happy about this incident, and the one who feels most ashamed  is the U.S. Government. This is one problem it does not need,  and I am sure that the U.S. Government will prosecute this  gentleman under the full force of the law. [end recording]    From the very start, the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry has  received the U.S. Embassy's assurances that Maj. Lopez will face  a U.S. court martial. The foreign minister reported that Maj.  Mike Lopez, a U.S. Embassy employee, on 21 January killed  bodyguard Cresencio Diaz Alvarado in the Guadalupe neighborhood  in Soyopango, on the outskirts of eastern San Salvador.  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria reiterated  that there has been no violation whatsoever of national  sovereignty in the case of the death of this bodyguard.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, Yugoslavia, May 15 (TANJUG) -- There  will be no autonomy or special status for ethnic minorities  under a new bill that is shortly to be submitted to parliament  for debate, says the Yugoslav human and minority rights  minister. No document obligates the state to give anything like  this to the minorities, said Minister Margit Savovic on Radio  Kragujevac in Serbia on Sunday [15 May]. The rights enjoyed by  the ethnic minorities in Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) ensure  normal life and work for all their members, she emphasised.  Minister Savovic was categorical that there would be no  yielding to any kind of pressure in this matter, and added that  there must be no difference made among the ethnic minorities and  no picking and choosing which should have autonomy and which  should not, because the law is the same for all.    The new bill should enable Yugoslavia to show to the world  the kind of rights enjoyed by the minorities in this country,  said Savovic. Asked to comment on a statement made by British  Minister Douglas Hogg in Pristina, Serbia's province of  Kosovo-Metohija, about a need for a dialogue between the  authorities and the Albanian minority, Savovic said she was not  sure what the minister had actually been referring to, but that  any talks must not be to the detriment of the state. "We have  many times before showed our readiness to open talks of this  kind, but we cannot under any circumstances agree to talks on  any form of special status. It is well known that the province  of Kosovo-Metohija has autonomy and that the Albanians are not  deprived in any way, but they do not want to avail themselves of  it. Therefore, we cannot give more than what is provided under  the constitutions of Serbia and Yugoslavia," said Savovic.    Kosovo-Metohija is being torn apart by the subversive  activity of an ethnic Albanian separatist movement which is  striving to detach the province from Serbia and its parent  Yugoslavia and annexe it to neighbouring Albania. Under  pressure from the separatist leaders, a section of the  province's ethnic Albanian community has been refusing to  exercise their rights to receive education in their own language  and take part in the country's political life.</p>

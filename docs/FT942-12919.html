			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Strike-hit Heineken has to import beer Heineken, the Dutch brewer, yesterday called on the help of its subsidiaries around Europe to counter the threat of a shortfall in Dutch beer supplies caused by a six-day strike at its two main plants in the Netherlands. The two breweries, in Zoeterwoude and Den Bosch, produce 11m hectolitres of beer a year, roughly a fifth of Heineken's worldwide output. The group operates more than 90 breweries in 50 countries. Supplies of beer were due to start arriving last night from subsidiaries in European countries which produce the group's two flagship brands, Heineken and Amstel. Heineken declined to say which countries would supply the beer. Heineken and Amstel are brewed by several subsidiaries from Ireland to Greece. In the UK, Whitbread brews Heineken under licence from the Dutch company. Heineken acknowledged the imports were 'curious' for the company, which is the world's second biggest brewer but the largest exporter of beer. Heineken has a commanding 50 per cent share of the Dutch beer market, which is poised for one of the biggest days of the year on Saturday when the country celebrates the queen's birthday at street fairs and outdoor carnivals. Exports to the US, where Heineken is the best-selling imported beer, were not immediately threatened because the company has a week's supply in reserve at the Dutch port of Rotterdam. The strike, over pay and conditions, has divided Dutch unions. Two unions have accepted a deal with the company but the country's largest union federation has rejected it, and its members have blocked the exits of the two breweries.</p>

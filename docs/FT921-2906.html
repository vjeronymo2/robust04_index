			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Local pay deal likely at health trust A COMMUNITY health trust in Dorset announced yesterday that it expected to agree Britain's first locally negotiated deal on pay and conditions, signalling a move away from the national Whitley Council agreements for health workers, Lisa Wood writes. West Dorset Community Trust said it was negotiating a local 'reward package' with trade unions representing its 1,200 hospital and community services staff. This would be applicable to all staff except doctors. The package would include performance-related pay and changes in holiday and hours agreements. A radical departure from the rigid pay and conditions of the National Health Service's Whitley Council was a prime objective for the self-governing hospital and ambulance trusts when the first wave came into operation in April last year.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Arts: Welsh head quits Matthew Epstein, general director of Welsh National Opera, resigned yesterday, St David's Day, writes Antony Thorncroft. He gave as his reason the parlous financial state of the WNO. 'This year's funding decision, and those intimated for the future, are simply not acceptable in the face of the WNO's record of international artistic success and acclaim.' Epstein, an American, led the WNO for just under three years. He recently announced redundancies and cancelled productions brought about by a deteriorating financial situation. Taken with the threats of Simon Rattle to quit the CBSO for similar reasons it will put pressure of Peter Brooke, Heritage Secretary, to raise arts funding.</p>

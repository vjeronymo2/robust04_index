			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INVESTOR ALAN PARSOW NOW OWNS 8.3% OF COMARCO, MAY SEEK PLACE ON BOARD  </P> <P> A Nebraska investor who specializes in underpriced stocks now owns 8.3% of  Comarco Inc. in Anaheim and may try to place a representative on the company's  board of directors, according to a filing Tuesday with the Securities and  Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Alan Parsow, a full-time investor who has made millions buying stock in  companies he says are undervalued, has owned stock in Comarco for several  years. He usually invests only in companies that he thinks are already  well-managed, according to analysts.  </P> <P> "I talked to Alan this morning," said Harry Young, Comarco's president and CEO.  "His intention is to make suggestions to management to try and increase our  shareholder value and to try and do that in a friendly manner. There is nothing  hostile in his intent or his actions."  </P> <P> Parsow's purchases of an additional 14,000 shares of Comarco stock over the  past few weeks represent only 0.3% of the 4.6 million shares of common stock  outstanding.  </P> <P> Comarco is a defense contractor that supplies engineering and technical  services to various branches of the military and to government agencies. The  company also builds the solar-powered cellular telephones installed in  emergency call boxes alongside some of Southern California's freeways.  </P> <P> Comarco's performance has been rather dismal in recent years but analysts say  the company is making a comeback. For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 1989,  Comarco reported revenue of $88.6 million, up nearly 17% from 1988. Net income  was $6.1 million, contrasted with a loss of $12.9 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> The company's stock has not enjoyed the same kind of recovery. While it traded  for as much as $11.75 in January, 1987, Comarco common stock closed Monday at  $2.88. News of Parsow's investment was not released until after the markets  closed.  </P> <P> Even though its annual revenue is almost $90 million, Comarco's total market  capitalization -- the current value of its common stock outstanding -- is a  paltry $13.3 million.  </P> <P> "I've been surprised it's taken someone so long to recognize what Comarco is --  an incredibly cheap stock," said Robert Hanisee, an analyst with Seidler Amdec  Securities in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Parsow could not be reached for comment. He is best known for his investment in  New York's Irving Bank. The stock soared from $52 to almost $80 a share in 1987  after the Bank of New York offered to buy a controlling interest in Irving.  Fortune magazine estimated that the Parsow partnership's portfolio was worth  $40 million at that time.  </P> <P> More recently, Parsow in January joined the board of directors of National  Lampoon Inc., the humor magazine and film company. Along with actor Tim  Matheson and television producer David Grodnik, Parsow owns about 20% of the  company.  </P> <P> "I expect that more than anything else, Mr. Parsow is looking at this as an  investment," said Gerald Griffin, Comarco's chairman. "We are going to have to  wait a while and see what happens next."  </P></p>

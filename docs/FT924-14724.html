			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Burn Stewart meets flotation forecast with rise to Pounds 10.34m BURN STEWART Distillers, the Scotch whisky producer, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.23m to Pounds 10.34m for the year ended June 30. The 26 per cent advance matched the forecast made by the company when it came to the market last November. Its shares closed 8p higher yesterday at 129p, com-pared with the flotation price of 140p. Earnings per share of 13.2p, marginally higher than forecast because of a lower than expected tax charge, were unchanged from 1991 because of the greater number of shares in issue. A final dividend of 3.33p will be paid. In spite of difficult trading conditions, operating profits rose from Pounds 11.44m to Pounds 12.47m on turnover 10 per cent higher at Pounds 41.95m. The company, which makes Black Prince whisky and supplies own-label brands to multiple retailers such as Asda, increased the bottled-in-Scotland share of its business. Gross margins were maintained at last year's levels. Lower volume sales of high-value aged whiskies and some softening of prices were offset by the increased use of the company's stocks of lower cost whiskies. Mr Bill Thornton, chairman, said that the development of the business would con-tinue to focus on building sales of the bottled-in-Scotland brands. New distribution arrangements were being introduced in a number of overseas markets and additional marketing and sales staff had been recruited. The recently-established Russian joint venture, Plodimex, was extending its trading activities in wines and spirits in Russia and eastern Europe. 'It has not yet made any material contribution to profits but we regard it as a long-term growth opportunity,' Mr Thornton said. Overall, trading since June had been satisfactory, he added. Prospects for the rest of the year would depend on price levels, but they should be helped by the sterling devaluation. The company has used part of the flotation proceeds to reduce borrowings from Pounds 28m to Pounds 12m. Gearing has fallen from well over 200 per cent to 36 per cent, and interest charges, down from Pounds 3.21m to Pounds 2.13m, are covered 5.9 times.</p>

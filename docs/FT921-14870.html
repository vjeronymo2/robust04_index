			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Thornton agrees Pounds 14.6m Bromsgrove bid BROMSGROVE Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering conglomerate, yesterday announced its expected agreed takeover of GW Thornton Holdings. The shares or cash deal values the Sheffield-based engineer at Pounds 14.6m. Bromsgrove also announced a fully underwritten 1-for-4 rights issue at 105p per share to raise Pounds 10.75m. This should eliminate gearing, which, at the end of last September, was 31 per cent. The new shares, both those issued through the rights and those issued to Thornton shareholders, will attract a fractionally higher final dividend for 1991-92 than Bromsgrove paid in the previous year. A proposed final of 2.5p brings the year's total to 4p (3.9p) on the enlarged capital. The acquisition terms, which because of their acceptance by Thornton directors, advised by Henry Cooke Corporate Finance, mean that Bromsgrove has control of 55 per cent of its target's equity, are seven new Bromsgrove shares for every four Thornton; this values each Thornton share at 220.15p against a suspension price on January 6 of 150p. There is a cash alternative of 200p per share. Responding to the suggestion that such a price looked expensive in historical terms, Mr Steven Mills, Bromsgrove chief executive, said 'In prospective terms we have not undertaken acquisitions which have been earnings-diluting.' The main attraction of Thornton for Bromsgrove is its precision forging side. Thornton's aerospace activities dovetail with those of Bromsgrove, while at the same time, Thornton's manufacture of orthopaedic equipment like hip and knee joints takes Bromsgrove into a new engineering sector. The acquisition would have lifted gearing to an unhealthy level. Hence the rights issue, underwritten by Albert E Sharp. The rights price compared with Bromsgrove's suspension price on January 6 of 131p. Thornton, in the year to last September, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Accumulator Invest rescue collapses ACCUMULATOR Invest, a property and investment company dominated by Mr Klaus Riskaer Pedersen, a Danish Euro MP, went into receivership yesterday. Mr Pedersen said he believed all creditors would be paid in full. The collapse of the company, which had at one time made Mr Pedersen a wealthy man, came when an attempt to reorganise the company, by excluding Mr Pedersen from any influence over company affairs and appointing a lawyer as chairman, came undone. One consequence of the collapse was the immediate closure of one of the country's oldest and most prestigious provincial newspapers, Frederiksborg Amtsavis, which was one of a group of newspapers acquired by Mr Pedersen in 1990.</p>

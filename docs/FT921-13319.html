			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: New guidelines aim to enhance use of derivatives RECOMMENDATIONS for the reporting of financial futures and options in investment portfolios, published yesterday, will provide UK pension fund managers with professionally-agreed standards of performance measurement of derivatives for the first time. The standards, designed to suit the needs of pension fund trustees, should encourage greater use of derivative products by UK pension fund managers. Since the tax treatment of derivatives was clarified in the 1990 finance act, the main barrier to the use of derivatives by pension funds has been a negative perception of these instruments as speculative, particularly by trustees. The new guidelines will allow trustees to assess more easily whether fund managers are using futures and options for investment or hedging purposes, or whether they are taking more speculative positions. 'I am confident that these recommendations will greatly enhance institutional investors' use of derivatives, particularly equity products such as the FT-SE 100 index futures and options,' said Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of the London International Financial Futures Exchange. Based on a consultative document issued by Liffe and the London Traded Options Market in May 1990, the recommendations were reached after consultation with trustees, investment managers and performance measurers, and are endorsed by the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF). The recommendations will be followed by the UK's two largest independent performance measurement organisations, Combined Actuarial Performance Services (CAPS) and the World Markets Company (WM). '(These recommendations) will lead to a better understanding of the uses of these instruments, higher standards of reporting and more consistent performance calculations,' said Mr Tim Gardener, head of planning services at Mercer Fraser, the actuarial consultancy firm commissioned to write the report. In the past, pension funds have tended to report futures and options as a separate asset class. While this system is relevant for certain types of funds, such as futures funds, the overall picture can easily be distorted since derivatives are frequently used as part of a broader investment strategy. In addition, such an approach ignores the gearing inherent in derivative instruments. Futures are typically used by fund managers to increase or decrease exposure to underlying assets. Increasing exposure. If a fund manager buys futures on the FT-SE 100 stock index and holds a cash deposit, he is creating a synthetic equity asset. It is usually cheaper and quicker to gain exposure to the market by this method than by buying a portfolio of stocks in the cash market. Decreasing exposure. If a fund manager buys equities in the cash market and sells the future, he is hedging against a fall in the stock market, (since the futures position will gain if the market falls). Thus, under the recommendations, positions in the futures market - and relevant cash deposits held against futures positions - are incorporated into, in this case, equity assets. Options, on the other hand, are generally used to modify exposure. The effect of options on portfolio performance is asymmetrical - for example, a fund manager can by a put option on a stock to protect against potential losses in the stock, without losing any potential gains. The report recommends reporting options at their market value, under the relevant asset class. Given the complexity of option products, a written explanation of strategies (for example that puts have been purchased as insurance against downward risk) is recommended. In addition, when there is a substantial position in options, there needs to be an analysis of exposure to market movements. Because of the asymmetrical movement of options, the price does not indicate how the option would react to changes in the underlying market. Consequently, the recommendations suggest showing how the portfolio would react to, for example, a 50 per cent rise or fall in the market. The method is suitable for pension fund reporting, because trustees are generally not interested in short-term fluctuations in the fund's value, but in the general thrust of the investment strategy. Other investment institutions may need a different approach, including Delta analysis - a mathematical calculation of the sensitivity of positions to market movements. The pressure to conform to the recommendations is likely to be quite strong, even though there are no formal rules. 'We will ask (the pension funds) to provide data to us so we can report in line with the recommendations,' said Mr Alan Wilcock of CAPS. The recommendations encompass derivative products sold by banks, known as over-the-counter products, such as swaps and OTC options, and exchange-traded contracts. While they help clarify the reporting of derivative products, the fund management industry has some way to go in setting other important performance measurement goals. The next issue which the industry is preparing to address is risk-adjusted performance measurement, since there is as yet no standardised way of assessing the returns offered by funds in conjunction with the level of exposure. Although other issues, such as credit, will need to be assessed in that debate, the ground rules on futures and options will be a useful step forward in that process.</p>

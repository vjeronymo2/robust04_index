			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Mayor to be next US ambassador to Vatican THE CITY of Boston was flabbergasted on Tuesday night when its mayor of 10 years, Mr Raymond Flynn, announced he was to be the next US ambassador to the Vatican. There had been no hint in the days before St Patrick's Day that the popular Mr Flynn - Boston-Irish, liberal, Catholic and an opponent of abortion - would be so honoured or was thinking of leaving his urban charge in the middle of his third term. Most local speculation had centred on who was to become the next ambassador to Dublin, a nomination long expected to mark the visit to the White House yesterday of Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister. President Bill Clinton confirmed most rumours by announcing that he had chosen Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of Senator Edward Kennedy from Massachusetts and his two slain brothers. Another woman with impeccable political credentials, but no formal career in politics, is widely expected to get the plum embassy in Paris. This is Mrs Pamela Harriman, English-born widow of the US statesman Mr Averell Harriman, former wife of Mr Randolph Churchill, and mother of Mr Winston Churchill, a Conservative member of the UK parliament. Mrs Harriman is a great Washington and international socialite, long a prominent Democratic party fundraiser and an early supporter of Mr Clinton. She speaks French fluently and is widely reckoned to possess a political acumen comparable to her considerable charm. The Paris embassy, like that in London, is normally reserved for political patronage, and Mrs Harriman was rumoured at one stage to be in line to be ambassador in the country of her birth. She always denied this, expressing a preference to stay in Washington now that it had a Democratic president. It is now widely believed that Mr Raymond Seitz, the first professional diplomat ever to be US ambassador to the Court of St James, has been asked to stay on in his present post for at least another year. This would satisfy the UK government, which regards him highly. Another important embassy, that in Tokyo, also seems to have been earmarked for Mr Richard Holbrooke, the Asian expert who served in President Jimmy Carter's State Department.</p>

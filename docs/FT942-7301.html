			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Tax chief calls for scrutiny of advisers Tax advisers should be subject to a regulatory regime, the incoming president of one of the leading UK tax bodies said yesterday. Mr Ian Luder, a tax partner with accountants Arthur Andersen and the new president of the Institute of Taxation, called for self-regulation monitored by professional bodies. His plea comes at a time of growing concern about control of one of the few forms of financial advice that is completely unregulated. Many tax advisers are also accountants or lawyers subject to regulation by professional bodies, but there are no examination requirements or other controls over the use of the title 'tax adviser'. 'I have no time for the unclean and unwashed, the unqualified practitioner with no professional standards and whilst I do not seek to create a monopoly, I am very opposed to the current position whereby anyone can put up a brass plate and offer their services,' Mr Luder said. He said regulation was inevitable, and should not be introduced through 'the back door'. He added that the Inland Revenue was already moving in this direction with plans to accredit advisers from whom it would accept tax returns lodged electronically. He also cited a proposal in this year's finance bill which would have considerably boosted Revenue powers to gain access to tax advisers' papers but which was dropped. 'The Revenue is trying to introduce quite draconian powers when the problem is with a small minority of practitioners.' Mr Luder said the institute received a number of complaints each year about tax advice and that several members had been reprimanded or expelled. But many complaints related to individuals who were not members of the institute or of any other professional body which could take action against them. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday reprimanded Mr Samuel Oddy of Carlisle and fined him Pounds 500 for 'improperly' passing tax repayments belonging to clients through his overdrawn practice account.</p>

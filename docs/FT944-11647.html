			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Using cattle to repair the land  -The controversial techniques of a Namibian farmer Nambia, the driest country in southern Africa, is worried by the loss of trees, mopane bush and grass in the sandy, heavily-grazed, populous communal areas of the far north. Further south it is concerned by the spread of impenetrable thornbush thickets on commercial farms, which occurs because browsing game animals are fewer in number and loss of grass around waterpoints gives the bush a chance. Argo Rust, who farms near Windhoek Airport, is proposing a controversial answer to both problems. Cattle, he believes, can cure as well as cause degradation of arid land. He has pursued that principle for 25 years and has doubled to 600 the number of cattle on his small farm. To spread his ideas, which are controversial with agricultural advisers, he founded the Namibia Centre for Holistic Resources Management in 1989. It has 65 members. Success has enabled him to give a better deal to his seven workers. 'If you want to involve your labour force, they must understand the goal and be part of it,' he says. 'That can happen only if their quality of life is addressed.' In the 1960s he took over the 4,000-hectare family farm, Sonnleiten, which had only 300 cattle. He was advised to destroy encroaching bush and reduce the number of cattle. Instead, he pursued the ideas of a Rhodesian, Alan Savory, who had noticed that national parks, with their big, constantly moving herds of game, had good grass. The problem, says Mr Rust, is not the number of animals but the time they spend on a piece of land. If this is controlled, the hooves of a big herd break up the surface and their dung manures it, encouraging grass to grow and preventing thornbush establishing itself. He also decided on a holistic approach, avoiding the use of chemicals that could harm important dung beetles. Fences are used to divide his land into paddocks around waterpoints. Cattle stay in each paddock for a limited time. He points out that similar results could be achieved without fences on communal land by herding cattle from place to place. He has been surprised to find that grass germinates best in corridors where cattle tramp most. Some of his land was like concrete, yet it recovered despite below-average rain, which suggests even the worst land can be restored. Researchers have now discovered his land has a higher percentage of perennial grasses than land farmed conventionally by the agricultural college next door.</p>

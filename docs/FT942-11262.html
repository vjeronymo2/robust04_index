			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / High stakes at the launch-pad: The ambitions of the European space industry will ride on next month's Ariane 4 mission The countdown has started for what will be the most important lift-off in the 14-year history of Arianespace, the European satellite launch company that has given Europe leadership in the Dollars 2bn a year commercial space transport business. 'It would be a catastrophe if we suffered a second consecutive failure,' says Mr Charles Bigot, the chief executive of Arianespace, bluntly. Since the failure on January 24 of an Ariane 4 rocket with the Dollars 350m loss of Turkey's first national satellite, Turksat 1, as well as a European telecommunications satellite, the European consortium has been working round the clock to investigate and modify its rocket to ensure that the launch at the beginning of next month goes off without a hitch. The stakes are high. Arianespace must restore confidence among its international customers at a time when competition in the high risk commercial satellite launch business is intensifying. Apart from its traditional US rivals, the European group is facing an increasing challenge from Russia, China and Japan, all seeking to penetrate the western commercial launch market. New cut-throat price competition coupled with uncertainties about European governments' funding of future European space initiatives, risks undermining the success of the Ariane programme. The project has done for the European space industry what the Airbus consortium achieved in the civil aircraft field: the establishment of a credible competitor to the US dominance of commercial aerospace markets that lasted until the early 1980s. The achievement has been all the more remarkable because Arianespace, 56.6 per cent controlled by French state and private shareholders but also public and private shareholders from 11 other European countries, was set up when rockets, or expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) as they are known, were widely believed to have become redundant. The US threw its lot into the development of the space shuttle. But the Europeans considered a manned shuttle too complex a system on which to build a reliable space transport business. The gamble paid off. The disaster that befell the US shuttle Challenger in 1986 and the long interruption in US shuttle flights vindicated the European decision to concentrate on rocket technology. It also helped Arianespace to capture more than 50 per cent of the commercial satellite launch market. 'It was not just the choice of sticking with ELVs. But Ariane's success was also the fruit of a new concept in space launches,' says one French space industry official. 'The idea was that not only could launchers be produced and sold like aircraft, but that a comprehensive launch service also had to be offered to the market,' he adds, explaining that Arianespace now offers its customers financing facilities, satellite insurance cover and other services. Until the latest accident, the reliability of Ariane rocket launches had also helped build up international market confidence. Since the first experimental launch in December 1979, there have been 63 launches, of which six have failed. But since the introduction in 1988 of the bigger Ariane 4 rocket capable of placing more than one satellite into orbit, there have been only two failures: flight 36, which destroyed two Japanese commercial satellites, and the recent flight 63. Flight 36 failed in February 1990 because a cloth was left in the rocket's cooling system. 'It was a stupid accident,' concedes Mr Bigot, 'but it did not raise questions on the fundamental soundness of the rocket.' In contrast, the flight 63 failure was the result of an engine shutdown in the third stage of the rocket after an oxygen pump bearing overheated. 'We couldn't simply say it was the fault of a rag or a particle of sand: the explanation of what happened was far more subtle,' Mr Bigot adds. A board of inquiry set up after the accident did not establish a 'unique and proven cause' for the failure. It concluded, however, that the engine shutdown was probably due to the conjunction of a late pre-cooling of the liquid oxygen pump bearing and a series of aggravating factors. Modifications have now been made to ensure that the rocket's third stage cryogenic engine is less prone to overheating. The new modified systems have undergone more than 100 tests at facilities in France and Belgium. Mr Bigot has travelled to the US and Japan to reassure customers who are also kept up to date with weekly company briefings on the latest developments in the Ariane rocket corrective programme. 'We now have the situation well in hand,' says Mr Bigot. 'It is most important for us to show our customers how we are correcting the system. They would never forgive us if we failed to give top priority to quality and security.' Arianespace is also anxious to resume rocket launches as quickly as possible to meet its existing commitments to place in orbit 39 satellites for a total revenue of about Dollars 3bn during the next three years. Before the January accident, the company had planned 10 Ariane 4 launches this year at monthly intervals. It is still hoping to meet this target by adjusting its procedures to enable launches every three instead of four weeks from the beginning of next month. Although Arianespace has continued to win new satellite launch orders since the flight 63 failure, the four-month interruption in its timetable has inevitably had an impact on business, with some potential orders lost to competitors. The biggest blow was last month's decision by the European Telecommunications Organisation Eutelsat, which consists of 39 European telephone companies, to opt for a US General Dynamics Atlas 2A rocket to launch a television satellite, Hotbird 2, in August 1996. The telephone consortium claimed it picked the US rocket because there were no slots available at that time in Arianespace's packed launch manifest for its Ariane 4 rocket. But Arianespace had offered to launch the Hotbird satellite on the first commercial flight of its new Ariane 5 rocket, scheduled for late summer or early autumn of 1996. The underlying reason for Eutelsat's decision appears to have been its reluctance to be first on Arianespace's larger and more powerful rocket, which will eventually replace the current family of Ariane 4 rockets, suggests a senior French aerospace official. 'It's clearly a snub for Ariane to see a European organisation not committing itself to a rocket programme in which Europe has invested more than Dollars 6bn,' he adds. Arianespace officials describe the Ariane 5 programme as Europe's biggest engineering project after the Channel tunnel with substantial infrastructural investments already completed at Arianespace's launch site in the jungle of French Guiana. Ariane 5, a two-stage rocket capable of transporting 6 to 7 tonnes of satellite payload compared with 4.5 tonnes on the three-stage Ariane 4, has been designed not only to put heavy satellites into orbit but also to carry manned spacecraft and parts of a planned space station programme being studied jointly by the US and European space industries. Space experts also believe that the two-stage rocket design will provide even greater safety and reliability because most failures have so far involved the third stage of the Ariane rockets. Our ambition is to become during the next 30 years not only a satellite launch company but also Europe's space transport company providing flight services to and from space as well as in space itself,' Mr Bigot explains. But with the cuts in Europe's space budget, the immediate challenge for Arianespace is to consolidate its position as leader in the commercial satellite launch market. To remain competitive, Arianespace must retain at least 50 per cent of the commercial satellite market. 'We need a large market share to justify the scale of our investments and maintain competitive operating costs for our rockets,' Mr Bigot concedes, adding that the operating costs of the new Ariane 5 rocket will be directly tied to the rocket's annual launch rate. Achieving this long-term target will depend on the reliability as well as the cost of the European consortium's satellite launch services, compared with rivals. US competitors have become more aggressive following the failure of the Challenger space shuttle eight years ago and the subsequent decision of the US government to encourage its three US launcher manufacturers (McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta) to compete for commercial business against Ariane. As for other competitors, Mr Bigot is more worried by the Russians at this stage than the Chinese who are still trailing western manufacturers. He also regards the threat from Japan as a longer-term problem. In four weeks, the future of Arianespace and the ambitions of the European space industry will ride on the 64th mission of the Ariane 4 rocket carrying an Intelsat telecommunications satellite and two small space technology research vehicles for the British Ministry of Defence.</p>

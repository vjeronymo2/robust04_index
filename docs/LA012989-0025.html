			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN ON THE JOB  </P> <P> What your article on women who are "making it" shows is that the companies for  which these women work are gender-blind only if their employees are not  mothers. Maybe this is because you'd have had to devote at least 10 times the  space to women who, by your standards, are not making it because the men and  childless and/or affluent women in management can't relate to parental  responsibilities and refuse to allow parents to successfully combine work and  parenthood.  </P> <P> KRISTIN BLANCHARD  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "Association Accuses the </F> Government in Crisis"]    [Text] The investment crisis is the main obstacle along the  path of market adaptation by denationalized enterprises. This  can be seen from the results of the Russia-wide conference--"On  the Use of Credits and Technical Assistance Afforded by  International Financial Organizations in Accordance with the  Program of Support for Privatization and Structural  Transformations in Russia"--conducted 5 February at the Moscow  Association of Privatized and Private Enterprises. Conference  participants demanded that the government institute measures  which would stimulate investments in denationalized enterprises.    The Association of Privatized and Private Enterprises  was established in November 1992. It unites about 3,000  enterprises and has 49 regional divisions. The president of the  association is Yegor Gaydar.    Voucher privatization has enabled the denationalization of  more than 8,000 medium and large-scale enterprises and has  brought about a steady demand for investments. Deputy Prime  Minister Anatoliy Chubays, however, who took part in the  conference, explains the lack of investments not just by virtue  of the economic crisis, but by the absence of a purposeful state  investment policy as well. This circumstance has a direct effect  on attracting large and long-term investments in privatized  enterprises.    According to data from the Russian Property Fund, the total  amount obtained from the sale of blocks of shares of  denationalized enterprises at investment auctions in 1993 came  to 1.2 trillion rubles [R], i.e., 8 percent of the investment  volume of the Russian market. In this regard, short-term  programs (up to two years) clearly dominated, while long-term  programs (up to six years) comprised just 6 percent of all  investment projects. Under these conditions, the association  proposed that the government implement urgent measures to  stimulate investments in denationalized enterprises. The Program  of Support for Privatization and Structural Transformations in  Russia, developed with the participation of the State Committee  for Property Management, is specifically aimed at achieving  this. It includes the affording of advantageous (paid for by  international financial organizations), competent consulting and  auditing assistance to the councils of directors of joint-stock  companies in developing their investment projects and choosing  investors. In the words of Anatoliy Chubays, however, the  program has still not been formally approved by the government,  and its confirmation is expected within the next 10 days.

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Call for action over Haiti observers A group of countries led by the US last night called for 'quick and decisive action' following the latest act of defiance by Haiti's military-backed government. Haiti has given a team of more than 100 human rights observers, representing the United Nations and the Organisation of American States, 48 hours to leave the country, claiming they are a threat to national security. After a flurry of diplomatic activity at the UN, US ambassador Madeleine Albright said the regime's move 'intensifies the resolve of the international community to find a definitive solution to this crisis'. She was speaking on behalf of the 'friends of Haiti' - the US, France, Venezuela, Canada and Argentina - which have been working to restore democracy in Haiti following the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Asked if quick and decisive action meant an invasion, she said the White House had 'a full range of options'. She added: 'What we need to do here is to get an international presence into Haiti.' Mr Dante Caputo, the UN's envoy to Haiti, said that neither Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, nor the head of the OAS had yet determined how to handle the situation. But the UN was not going to be pushed around. A UN official said there were 40 UN staff and 64 representatives of the OAS, all in Port au Prince. They had concentrated in the capital after withdrawing from other locations in the country. The regime had an obligation to guarantee their protection but was not doing so, the official said. The ultimatum to remove the mission was delivered without warning and the UN knew of no instance that might have provoked it. Haiti is under an international economic embargo, but the military has refused to leave office. The expulsion order stated that the observer mission should leave the country 'in order to avoid an incident or provocation'. The government ordered the mission to stop its work a week ago, but the UN General Assembly subsequently renewed the mission's mandate on Friday. Mr Caputo said yesterday that the expulsion was an outrageous provocation. 'The reasons are quite obvious. They kill people. They torture people. They rape people. And they don't want any witnesses in their country.' The government of the Caribbean island of Grenada has denied that it has reached an agreement with the US to provide a 'safe haven' to Haitians fleeing their country. The government said it had received the US request, but had not yet agreed to it. The US government said last week that Grenada, Dominica and Antigua had agreed to grant temporary asylum to Haitians until the crisis has been resolved.</p>

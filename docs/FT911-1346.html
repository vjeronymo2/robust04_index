			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Observer: Green blight Holding a Formula One motor race may not seem the most tactful way to promote an environment conference, let alone the most environmentally friendly. But Rio is the city where anything goes. With preparations in full swing for the United Nations World Environment Conference there in June 1992, all sorts of bizarre publicity ideas are emerging. And the most controversial proposal is to hold a second Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio during the conference. Gilberto Cavalcanti, vice-president of the International Automobile Federation, confirmed that Brazil has already asked the International Automobile Federation for permission to hold the extra Grand Prix. Discussions are under way with Rio authorities, he said. The move has dismayed ecologists. They claim that promoting an environment conference on the strength of racing cars burping far from ozone-friendly fumes, is hardly good publicity for their cause or, for that matter, consistent with Rio's aim to be the Green capital of the world.</p>

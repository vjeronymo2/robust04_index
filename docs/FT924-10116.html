			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: European equities Investment strategies based on convergence of European bond yields have been a well-trodden path for the past five years. But equity markets have been staging a quiet convergence of their own. As the chart shows, European equities have been moving in closer step since 1986. As with bond markets, though, the question must now be whether closer correlation can survive the threat of recession and strains within the exchange rate mechanism. For stock markets whose currencies are out of the ERM, greater unison seems a distant prospect. The FT-SE has outperformed the German market by 15 per cent since sterling started floating freely again. Even within the core of European countries still linked to the D-Mark, though, recession is likely to result in a wider divergence in equity performance. For one thing, governments will be seeking greater flexibility in fiscal policy. With the future of the treaty already in doubt, the Maastricht criteria on government borrowing will hardly be at the front of finance ministers' minds. That said, so long as interest rates in the core ERM countries are effectively set by the Bundesbank, bond yields should remain close to those of Germany. To the extent that bond yields influence equity yields, equity markets will find it hard to plough their own furrow for long. If the core European equity markets do continue to march in step, investors merely need to keep an eye on those getting ahead or falling behind. A simple extension of convergence argument is that equity investors should behave more like bond market investors - trading on the basis of the relative valuations just as bond investors trade yield differentials. Traditional research-led investors will doubtless see this as a heresy. But if the differences between countries and currencies have become less important they can always spend more time looking at the differences between stock market sectors and specific stocks.</p>

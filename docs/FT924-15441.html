			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Cable television bill to test Bush's veto powers PRESIDENT George Bush's veto power will today face its toughest test when the Senate votes on a motion to override his refusal to sign legislation regulating the cable television industry. On all 35 previous Bush vetoes, including votes last week on trade with China and abortion counselling, Congress has failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to override them. The cable bill, however, won majorities well above the two-thirds mark on its first passage in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Mr Bush needs to persuade at least nine Republican senators to reverse their earlier votes if he is to prevail. Cable regulation has turned into a populist cause. Television broadcasters and consumer interest groups have lobbied massively to fan the flames of public hostility to the cable companies, which in many cities have used their monopoly positions to raise fees by three times the rate of inflation. The cable bill would empower the Federal Communications Commission to set 'reasonable' rates for basic cable services, although the few cable operators who face competition in their districts would be exempt. Mr Bush said in his veto message that it would result in higher, not lower cable costs. Differences of opinion on the bill do not always run along party lines, although most supporters of the regulation effort are Democrats, and most opponents Republicans. Mr Bush yesterday called key Republican senators who voted in favour of the bill a fortnight ago to breakfast at the White House, in the hope of persuading them to switch their votes in the interests of party loyalty. Perhaps assisting him in this effort is the active role of Senator Al Gore, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate, in pushing for the cable bill. Mr Gore's vote for the bill on September 22 was only the third he has cast in the Senate since Governor Bill Clinton picked him to be his running mate in July. Mr Gore's use of the cable issue on the presidential campaign trail could help win over Republican waverers like Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING FUNDS FOR THOSE WHO HELP ILLEGAL ALIENS  </P> <P> Re the Costa Mesa City Council ruling to take back funds from nonprofit groups  that provide services to illegals (except medical and dental):  </P> <P> The council's decision, following so closely on another, similar one (denial to  renew lease of the Share Our Selves center) clearly shows that the three men on  our Council aim to get rid of all "undesirables" -- first the homeless, now the  illegal aliens. The frightening question is: Who's next? Members of a  particular race maybe? Or creed? Or even affiliation?  </P> <P> But let's assume the target is illegal aliens. Does Orville Amburgey really  believe that someone would trek all the way from Guadalajara because he's heard  that in Costa Mesa he can get a free bowl of soup? Isn't it rather because he  heard that here he can get employment?  </P> <P> Therefore, Amburgey, Peter F. Buffa and Ed Glasgow, wouldn't it be a better  idea to close all the businesses rather than the soup kitchens? I'm sure that,  as members of the Chamber of Commerce, you'd be at the source to implement a  speedy cessation of commerce in the city, thus getting rid of illegal aliens as  well as the worry of how to distribute the taxpayers' money in one inspired  swoop!  </P> <P> No, Amburgey, as a fellow Republican, I resent your idea of setting yourself up  as an instrument for the U.S. Congress 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.  As a business owner and resident of Costa Mesa, I agree with Mary Hornbuckle to  leave the implementation of immigration policy to the federal government and  that your job, as a council member, is to keep our city healthy, prosperous and  humane. Or all the glorious Performing Arts Centers and glittering shopping  malls will not hide the fact that "Costa Mesa, City of the Arts" is on the fast  road to becoming known as "Costa Mesa, City Without Heart"!  </P> <P> MARICA HEFTI  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

Yuriy Meshkov read out his own appeal to the Crimeans, in  which he assured them that he was ready for creative work and  cooperation with all political groups and representatives of all  ethnic groups. The Crimea could and should become a bridge of  friendship between Russia and the Ukraine, he stressed.    Replying to journalists' questions, Yuriy Meshkov announced  that with his election the question of Crimean statehood was  decided once and for all, but the Crimea will not become a "hot  spot" like Karabakh or the Dniester Region. As for the Black  Sea Fleet, it should remain united and Russian.</p>

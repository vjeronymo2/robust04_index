			<p>BFN     [Text] Banhan Sinlapa-acha was yesterday elected leader of  the Chat Thai Party, formally ending the long power tussle with  his predecessor, party founder Praman Adireksan.    Praman was moved to the ceremonial post of party president,  as earlier agreed between his small group of supporters and  Banhan's powerful faction. The post of president was created  recently just for Praman.    The elections, held during a party assembly at the Siam City  Hotel, in Bangkok, also saw Sano Thianthong appointed Chat Thai  secretary-general, replacing Banhan. New deputy party leaders,  eight altogether, include Bun-ua Prasoetsuwan, Thawit  Klinprathum, Watthana Atsawahem, and Praman's son Pongphon  Adireksan. Prathuang Wichanpricha was made party spokesman.    Banhan, a Suphan Buri MP, is the first non-member of the  Ratchakhru clan to rise to the helm of Chat Thai which was  formed 20 years ago.    After learning the result of the election, Banhan told  reporters he would adhere to the policies laid down by previous  leaders.    Chat Thai, which has no House seats in Bangkok, would try to  penetrate the city political stronghold -- dominated by Phalang  Tham and the Democrats -- during the next general election.    "If Chat Thai wins some seats in Bangkok, it means that  Bangkokians accept us as working for the country," Banhan said.    Asked whether he had manoeuvred to seize control of Chat  Thai  as preparation for the prime ministership, he refused to  comment, saying it was not the time to talk about it. However  Sano cut Banhan short telling reporters that the new party  leader was ready for the job of prime minister.    "If he was not ready for the post of prime minister, he  would  not have dared to accept the Chat Thai leadership," Sano said.    Praman said he was confident Banhan would take good care of  the party. "I believe he will lead the party out of all kinds  of trouble," Praman said.</p>

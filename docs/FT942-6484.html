			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: JW Spear board split over Pounds 47m bid from Hasbro The board of JW Spear, which owns the rights to the board game Scrabble outside North America, has been split by the unsolicited offer for the UK company made by Hasbro, the biggest US toys and games group. At a board meeting on Saturday, all but one of the Spear directors rejected the Pounds 46.9m cash offer, which was launched late on Friday. The exception was Mr Francis Spear, the group's chairman, who said he thought the terms - worth 900p per share - were fair and reasonable. In its offer, Hasbro said it intended to encourage Mr Spear to continue to manage Spear's Enfield, London, manufacturing plant. The rest of the Spear board, and the company's financial adviser, Barings, said Hasbro's offer was totally inadequate. The board instructed Barings to solicit higher offers. Hasbro is in a strong position, since it already owns a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear and has received undertakings to accept its offer from some Spear family trusts which control a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings become irrevocable on Friday if a higher offer has not received. Barings is approaching other international toy companies which might be interested in Spear, but the tight timetable makes it doubtful that another buyer would have time to intervene. It seems most likely that the rest of the board will try to obtain a higher offer from Hasbro, in exchange for their recommendation. Spear is also probably of the greatest value to Hasbro, which since 1989 has owned Scrabble in Canada and the US, where the game was invented. Hasbro said the acquisition would be a logical extension of its strategy to develop and expand core operations around the world. It also seems unlikely that Spear could see off Hasbro by just selling the Scrabble business to the US group. Scrabble accounts for 40 per cent of the UK group's sales and one source said 'the rest of the games portfolio hangs on the back of it.' Hasbro's offer of 900p a share is a premium of more than 21 per cent to the last reported dealing price of 740p on May 12.</p>

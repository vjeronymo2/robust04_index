			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: SKF sees SKr1.8bn loss as European markets worsen SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, yesterday said it would make a SKr1.8bn (Dollars 264m) loss in 1992 as it announced an intensification of its job reduction programme in the face of worsening conditions in key European markets. The Swedish group said the major part of the loss would arise from a SKr1.1bn provision connected to a plan to cut 4,000 jobs next year and a further 1,000 in 1994. The cutbacks represent an increase of 2,000 on figures announced in October, and will bring staff levels (excluding the planned disposal of CTT Tools) down to 42,000 by 1995. Market conditions for SKF's products have deteriorated sharply in the past few months as the group was expecting a profit for the full year as recently as August. It noted yesterday that its new rationalisation programme had been prompted by a continuing fall in European demand in the final quarter, with many customers announcing production cutbacks during December and January. 'European demand for the group's core product, roller bearings, will decline even further in 1993,' it stated. Europe accounts for 60 per cent of SKF's sales so the prospect of an upturn in the US, where it sells 20 per cent of its output, is insufficient to compensate. SKF, which announced a SKr361m loss for the first nine months, said it was continuing efforts to reduce its inventories, which have fallen by SKr2bn since 1990. It said this, together with reduced investment, would enhance cash-flow and reduce net borrowing. The group's financial figures for 1992 have been exacerbated by a SKr150m currency loss on an ECU convertible loan, and by SKr100m in other charges relating to the sale of CTT Tools and restructuring of Ovako Steel. Ovako, the special steels operation which SKF bought last year, has been a drain on its resources, posting a SKr407m loss over the first nine months.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (12): In the limelight / Profile of Argentaria In the game of Spanish banking, the players are waiting for the new arrival to make the next move. Argentaria - the group which came on to the scene three years ago, combining state banking operations and competing on an equal footing with the main private-sector banks - was bitterly disappointed by its defeat in April in the bidding to take over Banesto and equip itself with a comprehensive branch network. It had done more than its rivals to try to justify its participation in the Banesto auction - controversial because of the government's role as Argentaria's majority shareholder. But it last in the contest, outbid by Banco Santander by a margin of almost 35 per cent. The finance ministry was anxious that the bank should not do a bad deal. For Francisco Luzon, Argentaria's chairman, the big constraint was the risk of losing credibility, less than a year after launching Argentaria on the stock markets. His team has since been reviewing the group's 'strategic focus', keen to strengthen its international side but also to reinforce its retail network of 1,500 Spanish branches, adding perhaps a further 500. Argentaria is the prominently displayed brand-name of the more prosaically entitled Corporacion Bancaria de Espana. Set up in 1991 it has majority control of Banco Exterior de Espana, the large quoted bank which has traditionally been the channel for Spanish export credit but lost its monopoly in 1985. Under the reorganisation, Banco Exterior absorbed the state's Banco de Credito Industrial. Other state interests brought into Argentaria were leading mortgage specialist, Banco Hipotecario; the post office savings bank, Caja Postal; and two institutions dedicated respectively to the food sector and local authorities, Banco de Credito Agricola and Banco de Credito Local. Because of the deficiencies of each inherited elements, managers jokingly referred to them as 'four cripples and a one-eyed man'. The group has since established itself among the country's top banks with more than 500,000 shareholders and pre-tax profits rising 40 per cent over the past two years. Last year it made two share flotations in six months, both heavily oversubscribed, reducing the state's holding to just over 50 per cent and bringing in Pta296bn to the treasury. A third stage of privatisation is planned later this year or early in 1995. Mr Luzon's vision is of a modern, innovative bank able to hold its own among the top Spanish groups, with a state holding of 20-25 per cent, with 30 per cent of its business abroad and a strong presence in nearby markets of Portugal, southern France and North Africa.</p>

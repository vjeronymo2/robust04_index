			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Spending on roads to reach record RECORD road spending means work will start on 41 new national road schemes in the year beginning this April, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told MPs yesterday. The biggest single project will upgrade 13 miles of the A1 between Walshford and Dishforth in North Yorkshire to motorway status. A fourth lane will be added to 18 miles of motorway, including the M25 in Surrey and the M62 in Greater Manchester, and work will start on the remaining M65 link around Blackburn, Lancashire. Other schemes include improvements to the A66 northern trans-Pennine road, the A11 to Norwich and the A27 south coast route, and by-passes for 19 communities. The government's plans mean Pounds 2.09bn will be spent. The figure includes Pounds 1.4bn for construction and Pounds 550m for maintenance. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said that although the programme would be welcome in certain areas, it contrasted vividly with plans to halve British Rail's investment. Mr MacGregor said the plans would bring substantial economic, safety and environmental benefits, and provide 30,000 jobs in construction. 'The value of the benefits from accidents avoided and time saved to road users has been assessed at Pounds 2.5bn, and this is before any allowance for the net environmental gain achieved by reducing urban congestion and taking traffic away from town and village centres,' he said.</p>

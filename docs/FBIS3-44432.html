			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary] Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai municipal party  committee, addressed a ceremony held by Shanghai Municipality to  commemorate the centennial of Mao Zedong's birth on 25 December.  Wu Bangguo said: "Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th  CPC Central Committee, our party has upheld and developed Mao  Zedong Thought, and actively sought a socialist construction  path suited to our nation's conditions; it has scored tremendous  success in this respect. The most important thing is that it  has finally found the path of socialism with Chinese  characteristics, which Comrade Mao Zedong sought but failed to  find in those days, thus enabling the formation of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on socialism with Chinese characteristics."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>   [Excerpt] Today, 29 April, here at the Defense Ministry in  Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin for the first time held a  broad, comprehensive, and detailed discussion on the nature of  the peace Israel is offering Syria. For the first time, Rabin  presented the Americans with the details of the three stages of  withdrawal on the Golan Heights. He did not go into full  details, but the plan known as Majdal Shams First -- the plan of  handing the Druze villages over to Syrian control as one of the  stages of the arrangement -- was definitely mentioned.    Remarks of this nature have been made before in very small  and closed forums, such as Rabin-Clinton or  Rabin-Peres-Christopher meetings. This time, the remarks were  made in a very broad forum, which is a message in itself. The  Golan withdrawal is formally being taken out of the closet.    According to the plan Rabin presented, the withdrawal will  be  conducted in three stages. The Israeli settlements will be  removed in the second stage, and the withdrawal will be  completed in eight years, without specifying the line of  withdrawal at this time. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Books: Witches' tale with no holds barred - Children's Book of the Month BURNING ISSY, Melvin Burgess, Andersen Press, Pounds 6.99, 155pp. THE witch, that hardy perennial of literature for children cackles lustily, dresses top-to-toe in black, with pointed hat, pointed shoes - and a pointed chin. Her long, horny finger nail beckons from behind every gnarled oak. Though timelessly old, she is youthfully mischievous; and when she flies through the starless skies at midnight, her tatterdemalion skirts stream back in the wind. And she may or may not on closer inspection prove to be your own grandmother. . . In short, the witch of the average children's book has been reduced to a harmless figure of fun: neutered; superannuated; robbed of her sting. Which leads us on to a puzzling question: why cannot writers of books for children, given their degree of fascination with these poor creatures, ever tell the truth about witches? Melvin Burgess has endeavoured to do just that in his second novel, Burning Issy, which deals with the persecution of the tribe in 17th-century England. One difficulty, of course, is that the subject is frightening, morally repugnant, and a horrifying indictment of the established church; and this novel does not try to avoid these problems. In fact, it is brutally honest in its treatment of the subject, and for that reason alone parents who buy this book for their children or recommend it to others should be warned of such incidents as the one in which a parson, in order to extract a confession from a child that he believes to be a witch, grasps hold of her wrist and holds it as steadily as he is able over a naked candle flame. This remarkable historical novel erupts into life from the very first page. A beggarwoman thrusts a warm bundle into the arms of a man who happens to be passing through the market square of a small village in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The unwilling, though kindly, recipient carries the unexpected gift, wrapped in filthy rags and coughing like a cat, back home to his son and daughter. It's a pitiful sight indeed beneath the swaddling bands - all blotched, red skin on its two-year-old face as if it had been burnt in a fire. The child, Isabel, is both welcome and not welcome in these parts. The villagers whisper that it's the devil in hell who owns her, and that's why they call her Burning Issy. The child herself is terribly afraid of fire, even going so far as to shun the light of the candle at her own bedside. It seems that she can never quite efface some terrible, searing memory of burning. Solitary by nature, her only playmate is Jennet, daughter of a local witch who, some day soon, will be obliged to pledge herself to the devil too. Issy, fascinated by the goings on up Malkin Hill where the witches weave their spells, sneaks up with her foster-brother to observe the hags shaping their wax images as they spit and curse into the flames. The oldest witch senses the presence of strangers and they are caught; but Issy, possessed of her own brand of magic, pitches the old crone Demdyke into the fire, and for that act of gross impertinence the witch makes an image of the foster-brother Ghyll and threatens to kill him, little by little over the next fortnight or so by melting his effigy over the fire. The only way out is for Issy to give herself, body and soul, to the witches; and, in their opinion, that is only right and proper. Has she not already demonstrated by the use of her own strange powers that she is no ordinary mortal? Freedom comes with the return of the woman who gave Issy away. Having tricked Issy's adopted family into believing she has wrested the image of Ghyll from the witches, she and Issy travel north to the woman's house. But the forces of repression in the shape of the brutal witch-finder Bawdwen are closing in. At the novel's end Issy, Jennet and the other local witches are captured and forced to recant or suffer the terrible consequences. This novel helps us to understand not only that many witches were nothing worse than poor, persecuted beggars, but also that their beliefs were grounded in a set of religious practices that often antedated Christianity; vestiges of a paganism that the furiously proselytising Christians of the day could show no mercy toward. There was a terrible climate of superstition and fear in which the words 'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live' were intoned from every pulpit. For all the impressive simplicity of the language of this book, the complexity of its ideas and the stark, brutal honesty of so many of its scenes suggests a readership of 10 and above.</p>

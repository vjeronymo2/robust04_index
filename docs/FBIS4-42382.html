			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Colin Narbrough report: "Money Supply Growth Sparks </F> Inflation Fears"]    [Text] Sharp acceleration in the money supply in May,  despite the 8 billion pound increase in taxes in April, ruled  out hopes of further interest rate cuts and raised the spectre  of monetary tightening ahead to check inflation.    Year-on-year growth in MO, the officially targeted narrow  money measure, relating mainly to banknotes and coins, rose to  7.1 per cent. This indicates that the authorities will have to  watch for signs of inflationary pressures building up. The  Government's target for MO is 0 to 4 per cent.    Fears about inflation and interest rates sent shudders  through Europe's financial markets; the FT-SE 100 index fell 41  points at one stage, before the market recovered its nerve. The  index ended 4.1 points up, at 2,970.5. Bonds fell sharply, the  long gilt shedding 1.5 points.    Anxieties will be reinforced by the results of the latest  survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  (CIPS). They show that raw materials shortages and capacity  constraints appear to be driving up prices in manufacturing.    The institutes purchasing managers index, which measures  output, new orders, delivery times, stocks and jobs, rose to  59.2 per cent in May, its highest since the series began in June  1991. Demand was found to be growing so fast in some areas that  firms were having difficulty finding supplies.    The survey underlines last week's CBI [Confederation of  British Industry] industry report, which indicated that economic  growth had withstood the tax shock. But the CIPS prices index  rose for the sixth successive month, jumping to 57.8 per cent in  May, from 54.3 per cent in April.    The strength of new orders, at record levels in May, and of  production, encouraged firms to take on more workers for the  fourth consecutive month. The survey and other pointers are  likely to prompt the Treasury to upgrade its growth forecast for  the overall economy this year from the 2.5 per cent predicted in  November.    The Bank of England said year-on-year growth in MO, for  which  the Treasury has set an annual growth monitoring range of 0 to 4  per cent, rose to 7.1 per cent in May, after a 6.2 per cent gain  in April. Annualised MO growth over the past six months was 9.2  per cent.    The Treasury sought to dismiss the above-target growth in  MO,  arguing that interest rates at their lowest for two decades have  persuaded consumers to hold more cash. But the Bank, more  concerned about inflation, gave a warning in its recent  inflation report that the implications would be "more  disturbing" if the money supply continued to rise.    The Bank sees MO as a reliable advance indicator of  inflation. The measure is linked by economists to movements in  retail sales, which showed annual growth of 4.4 per cent in  April. Though some economists believe the impact of tax  increases on consumers has yet to be felt, galloping MO suggests  that the monetary reins might need a tweak by the end of the  year.    Year-on-year growth in May was distorted by very low growth  recorded in May last year. But John Marsland, an economist at  UBS, said the rate of increase was still very strong and  signalled a bout of inflation next year.    The Government has highlighted its success in achieving  economic growth with low inflation, and City economists believe  there is no immediate need to raise base rate from its present  5.24 per cent. Some fear, however, that by the final quarter of  next year, base rates will have almost doubled to contain  inflation.    Mortgage lending by the major British banks totalled 1.43  billion in April, a fall of 11 per cent from March and 20 per  cent lower than in April last year, the British Bankers'  Association (BBA) said. Net lending, after seasonal adjustment,  showed a further deceleration. Mortgage approvals were also  lower in April, in both value and volume.    Lord Inchyra, the BBA's director-general, said it was too  soon to attribute the drop in lending to tax increases or  changes in mortgage tax relief. He said two explanations could  be the shorter month and a rush in March to beat the  introduction of higher rates on fixed-rate mortgages.</p>

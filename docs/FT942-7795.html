Today in Assignment George Alagiah reports how 150,000 people in Ethiopia died at the hands of Col. Mengistu's government in the mid 1970s. In promoting the programme the BBC blithely announces that this 'reign of terror' has been hidden until now. So who has been hiding it? And why? It could not be, could it, that the South African regime, perhaps responsible for a handful of black deaths, was white while the Ethiopian regime, perhaps responsible for 150,000, was black?

Today Colin Winter is 53 and can hardly speak, and often fails to recognise his family (8.00 BBC1). Omnibus is devoted to Robert Stephens who, after an absence from the stage in the 1970s and 80s, returned triumphantly in 1992 with a magnificent Falstaff (10.50 BBC1).</p>

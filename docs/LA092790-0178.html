			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDS OF THE RAT  </P> <P> The Food section's Newsbites column (Sept. 6) contained a short article about  rats who died of respiratory failure after ingesting large quantities of hot  sauce.  </P> <P> The article was light in tone and admonished readers not to drink quarts of hot  sauce or "shoot up" with hot sauce lest they suffer a similar fate. Can you  imagine, however, the suffering involved in this reported experiment? Obviously  the rats didn't rush to overindulge a hot-sauce passion -- they must have been  force-fed. A death by respiratory failure, for man, rat, dog, horse, etc. is a  horrible one. SARI REZNICK, San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Let the Bethune Spirit Reappear"] </F>   [Text] After reading reports about Zhao Xuefang's deeds,  who could not but be deeply touched by them? It is not at all  going too far to call her a living Bethune because she vividly  embodies Norman Bethune's spirit; neither is it going too far to  call her a banner in medical circles because what the motherland  demands and what the people look forward to are precisely good  doctors like her.    As a communist party member, she has turned the lofty ideals  she is pursuing and the aim of wholehearted service to the  people into practical actions of giving quality service to  patients. The relationship between a communist party member and  the masses should be as completely harmonious as that between  her and her patients.    As a doctor, she regards the work of healing the wounded and  rescuing the dying as her duty. She constantly improves her  skills; has an unremitting sense of responsibility in her work;  treats her patients enthusiastically, patiently, and cordially;  looks at all their angles; takes care of their every need; and  tries by every possible means to relieve them of their pain.  For this reason, she is highly trusted, loved, and held in high  esteem by vast numbers of patients.    As a "daughter of the Taihang Shan," she never forgets the  people's upbringing and kindness. She never forgets the  difficulties caused by the shortage of doctors and medicines in  the mountain areas and takes advantage of every opportunity to  examine and treat the diseases of the women of the mountain  areas. She has devoted her love to the masses of the people.    As a section head and secretary of the party branch in a  hospital, she takes the lead in setting an example and leads her  colleagues in working conscientiously and sternly resisting the  corrosion of such unhealthy practices as money worship and  egoism in medical circles. She has maintained the pure image of  a people's doctor.    As a patient who suffers from two types of cancer, she  thinks  first of patients who suffer from lingering diseases and then of  herself. Before undergoing an operation, she made only one  request to the party organization: she should be allowed to  first perform gynecological and obstetrics operations on  patients who had been admitted to the hospital. After  undergoing two operations, she tenaciously threw herself into  her work again. What she thought about was how to make better  use of her limited time to preserve the lives and health of more  patients rather than how to preserve her own life.    In her medical practice of the past three decades and more,  Zhao Xuefang's motto is to devote all her love to the people and  not create a fuss. Day after day she works for ordinary peasant  sisters without taking remuneration into consideration. Her  spirit of absolute selflessness can be rated as a paragon for  contemporary medical workers. We should take good care of good  comrades like Zhao Xuefang who are respected by colleagues and  held in high esteem by patients. This is the wish of the masses  as well as the duty of leaders.    It should be admitted that, in the current process of  replacing the old medical structure with the new, power and  benefits have been readjusted and some people have lost their  sense of righteousness at the sight of benefits and have sought  private interest through medical practice. There are some in  the medical ranks who are not concerned about the weal and woe  of patients, are irresponsible, and give poor service. They  have damaged the image of medical workers in the public's minds.  This is a conspicuous issue that should be conscientiously  tackled in medical and public health reform.    Holding the banner of Zhao Xuefang and learning from the  Zhao  Xuefang spirit is not only of practical significance to medical  circle, but is also needed in the present era of reform. It is  hoped that, like Zhao Xuefang, our medical workers will turn  their true love for the public into the inflexible pursuit of  undertakings, working industriously and wholeheartedly, offering  quality services, and making positive contributions to promote  the building of two civilizations on the public health front.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'DEAD POETS,' 'THE ABYSS' JOIN TAPE PARADE  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Two very good but very different movies from last year make their video debut  this week.  </P> <P> "Dead Poets Society" (Touchstone, $89.95, PG) stars Robin Williams as an  unconventional teacher at a private boys' school in 1959. Directed by Peter  Weir, the funny and moving film shows -- as did "Stand and Deliver" -- how much  difference a teacher can make when he or she is as daring as caring.  </P> <P> "The Abyss" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13). You may be disappointed with the ending  of this special-effects thriller, but chances are you'll enjoy the underwater  trip that precedes it. Directed with dazzle by James Cameron ("The  Terminator").  </P> <P> Other films fresh on tape:  </P> <P> "The Pajama Game" (1957) and "Damn Yankees" (1958) both star Doris Day, both  were co-directed by George Abbott and Stanley Donen, both feature exciting  choreography by Bob Fosse, and both are colorful and lively versions of hit  Broadway musicals. They're $59.95 each from Warner.  </P> <P> "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" (1964) gave Don Knotts his strangest role (yes,  even stranger than Barney) as a bookkeeper who turns into a, gulp, fish -- who,  gulp again, becomes a war hero. The whimsical mix of live action and animation  is no "Mary Poppins," but pretty charming all the same. Also $59.95 from  Warner.  </P> <P> "Chocolat" (1988, PG-13), "The Music Teacher" (1988, PG) and "Murmur of the  Heart" (1971, R) are three notable foreign films from Orion ($79.98 each). All  three feature easy-to-read yellow captions.  </P> <P> "Night Ambush" (VidAmerica, $39.98), originally released in Britain in 1956 as  "Ill Met By Moonlight," a taut World War II thriller, was the last film on  which the famous "Archers" team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger worked  together.  </P> <P> "The Keys to the Kingdom" (1944), "A Man Called Peter" (1955) and "The Story of  Ruth" all featured big Hollywood budgets and plenty of emotional  self-sacrificing in the name of religion (Christian, of course), but not much  else to recommend them. They're $29.98 each from CBS/Fox.  </P> <P> "Fear Strikes Out" (1957) is a strong film depicting the battle baseball star  Jimmy Piersall (Anthony Perkins) fought with mental illness. "Hell Is for  Heroes" (1962) is a fairly decent WWII drama with Steve McQueen and Bobby  Darin. Both are only $14.95 from Paramount.  </P> <P> "Cookie" (Warner, $89.95, R) is one of the two crumby "comedies" director Susan  Seidelman blessed us with last year (the other was "She-Devil"). This one has  Emily Lloyd, Peter Falk, Dianne Wiest and Brenda Vaccaro in the tale of a teen  and her racketeer father.  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> CBS/Fox has just released four volumes containing two "Twilight Zone" episodes  each. These are the original, b&amp;w shows from the '50s and '60s, introduced  by Rod Serling. Each volume sells for $14.98.  </P> <P> That's not all, folks. MGM/UA has some more hourlong collections of those  fantastic Warner Bros. cartoons from the '30s and '40s: "Daffy Duck and  Company," "Porky Pig and Company" and "Bugs Vs. Elmer." They're $14.95 each.  TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE CO. CAN SET PRICES AT WILL  </P> <P> Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Ray Watson's primer on affordable housing in Orange  County (May 6) had all the validity of a used-car salesman trying to sell us a  lemon.  </P> <P> Watson's solution to the exorbitant housing prices charged by developers in  Orange County? "Build enough housing to meet the need and watch what  old-fashioned competition will do to prices."  </P> <P> Who are you kidding, Mr. Watson? According to your own article, Irvine has "a  shortfall of 60,000 homes." Assuming that this dubious statistic is accurate,  just how the heck do you expect our overtaxed infrastructure to handle the  impact of all those people?  </P> <P> In case you haven't noticed, we haven't enough water to satisfy our current  needs. Our traffic system is at near-gridlock. How do you propose to pay for  the huge increase in demand for municipal services?  </P> <P> Mr. Watson blames the controlled-growth policies of the Irvine City Council for  the high cost of housing. Gee, Mr. Watson, why don't you tell us how much it  really costs the Irvine Co. to build one of those $300,00 homes? Why is a  $100,000 house in Riverside three times more expensive in Irvine?  </P> <P> The truth, Mr. Watson, is that more housing has been built in Irvine in the  last five years than during any other period. Despite that growth, prices have  skyrocketed because the Irvine Co.'s status in the community as a monopolistic  landowner permits it to set the cost of housing at whatever it darn well  pleases. And that growth, without the necessary municipal resources, has  resulted in taxing our traffic, our public safety and our water supply.  </P> <P> The Irvine City Council has shown farsighted restraint in restricting growth  until the funding and natural resources are available to support it.  </P> <P> STEPHEN C. SMITH  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

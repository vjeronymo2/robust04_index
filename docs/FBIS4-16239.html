			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Turkmen President Saparmurad  Niyazov has severely criticised the idea of establishing a  Eurasian union, saying it is "doomed to failure."    Niyazov said the history which has repeatedly made the  concept of such a union the subject of many discussions proves  this point of view. "This idea has been repeatedly considered  and rejected by the Russians as fatal for the nation since  1861," Niyazov added.    It is not hard to predict the fate of another such idea, not  a new one, which runs counter to the current processes of  national revival in independent states, he said.    At the same time, he warned against dashing from one idea or  proposal to another, because each may have a grain of common  sense.    Haste and extremes are most dangerous for the Commonwealth  of  Independent States now, he said.    The Turkmen leader praised Russian-Turkmen relations, saying  he consideres them as a priority in his policy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Zhu Mei from Beijing; from </F> the "Morning News" program -- passages within quotation marks  recorded]    [Text] The shopping baskets of Shanghai residents became a  hot topic of discussion among Shanghai's delegation to the  National People's Congress [NPC] today [12 March]. At today's  discussion, Municipal Party Secretary Wu Bangguo and Mayor Huang  Ju spoke at length to explain once again about Shanghai's  shopping basket project.    Deputy Wu Bangguo said: "I would like to use a common  expression. I am just like a scale that carries a 1,000-jin  weight. Shanghai residents will be angry if they do not see  vegetables for three days. Comrade Zemin used to say in  Shanghai that the people can see the situation from their  shopping baskets. I think this is an issue that directly  concerns the people's interests. Further, we all know that the  vegetable supply in Shanghai often fluctuates. Sometimes they  are in short supply and sometimes they are abundant. When they  are in short supply, urban residents will grumble. When they  are abundant, on the other hand, vegetable farmers complain. But  it is not only Shanghai residents who are concerned about this  problem, the general secretary and the premier also understand  the problem very clearly."    Speaking from the viewpoint of Shanghai residents, Mayor  Huang Ju talked about his plan for the shopping basket project:  "A prominent contradiction is the vegetable issue, and the  prominent contradiction of the issue is how to reduce  difficulties and enhance our ability to adapt green vegetables  supplies due to seasonal changes. We should start a  new-generation shopping basket project, called the green  vegetable project. We should guarantee [?40,000 mu of land for  this project]. Once this has been decided, it should not be  changed for 10 to 15 years. Even if the land is infertile, the  entire municipality should unanimously implement the policy. No  changes should be carried out until after new farms have been  established. Secondly, we should strengthen the establishment  of agricultural facilities. The municipal government has  allotted 250 million yuan to construct large sheds on 5,000 mu  of farmland. [sentence indistinct] If Shanghai has 25,000 mu of  vegetable farms with large sheds, the supply of vegetables for  residents can be ensured. Further, we can gear our policy  toward meeting this goal. Therefore, I believe that in three  years' time, we can achieve our goal in green vegetable  production."    What should we do about enterprises that incur losses? This  has been a noticeable problem in Shanghai in recent years. In  their speeches today, deputies Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju gave us  their thoughts on how to solve this long-standing problem. Wu  Bangguo maintained: "We will continue to apply measures taken  previously to tackle Shanghai's deficit-ridden enterprises one  by one. The problem is relatively prominent in six out of our  eight major industrial zones. In Shanghai's industrial zones,  not all enterprises incur losses, although occasionally some of  them encounter difficulties. There are about 144 such  enterprises, involving some 165,000 people. How much is the  loss? It is (?350 million) yuan. What can these enterprises  do? My view is that the market economy is different from the  planned economy. There are no losses in the planned economy  because the state assumes unlimited responsibility and makes up  for losses incurred by enterprises. However, in the market  economy, there are both newly formed enterprises and  long-established enterprises, leading to a situation in which  the fittest survive. Deficit-ridden enterprises should not  always use old methods to solve their problems. They should  actively explore and apply the laws of the market economy to  solve their problems. An enterprise may possess market share  and be known for quality and efficiency, but it may have too  much plant and equipment. We can help this type of plant by  reorganizing it into a new enterprise. This is called injecting  new blood, the purpose of which is to avoid (?collapse). For a  second type of enterprise, we should undertake what we call  merger. We may [words indistinct] some deficit-ridden  enterprises while leasing or auctioning off others. However,  merger is a very good method. In recent years, Shanghai has  merged 456 enterprises with relatively good results. This year,  we have decided to merge between 80 and 100 enterprises. We  should be determined in tackling bankrupt enterprises. I  personally feel that if we succeed in tackling the bankruptcy  issue, it will carry major significance for the establishment of  the socialist market economic system. This means we will have  taken another step forward."    On ways to help troubled enterprises, Deputy Huang Ju said:  "Shanghai is currently dealing with this problem. Its approach  is to rely on the social security system to guarantee the basic  living expenses of workers. Enterprises and the government  should support the social security system in order to guarantee  the basic living expenses of workers and to let everybody derive  tangible results from reform. Therefore, to do a good job is to  improve people's lives in the course of economic development.  In eliminating difficulties, Shanghai will not confine its  efforts to injecting new blood but will mainly focus on changing  enterprises' mechanisms and on developing their blood-making  functions so as to acquire new [words indistinct]."    Deputy Huang Ju is very familiar with Shanghai's strengths  and weaknesses. He is keenly aware of his heavy responsibility  stemming from what is expected from Shanghai by the central  authorities. He specifically thanked other provinces and  municipalities for their support for Shanghai. Today, he told  fellow deputies and dozens of Chinese and foreign correspondents  who were present either as visitors or to cover the NPC session:  "Shanghai is a metropolis as well as a city devoid of energy  and raw and semifinished materials; it is an open port city with  a huge population and a limited supply of land. Although we  have a strong industrial base, we are confronted with the  question of how to further enliven large and medium state  enterprises. Some of the measures and methods that we have  adopted can only be applied to Shanghai; they cannot be promoted  in other parts of the country. We need the understanding and  support of fraternal provinces across the country.    "Shanghai is worthy of its name in three aspects. It is my  opinion that we should truly implement Comrade Zemin's  requirement that we be worthy of our name in these three  aspects. We should truly justify our leading role among areas  targeted for development along the Chang Jiang. To do so, we  must elevate our standards and development baseline. We should  introduce technology and management expertise from abroad,  assimilate them, and disseminate without reservation the results  of our assimilation across the country so that Shanghai will  truly become a distribution center in this respect. Moreover,  we should really justify our name as a prospective international  economic, financial, and trade center. This year, we should  actually start moving and strive to achieve this goal. Of  course, turning Shanghai into an international economic,  financial, and trade center in the Asia-Pacific and West Pacific  regions is a long-term task which will take about 20 years to  accomplish. But it does not run counter to our goal of becoming  a center in another area. Comrade Zemin has specifically called  on Shanghai to become the Shanghai of the entire nation. We  feel [?we have come a long way] from the Shanghai of the fifties  through the eighties to become today the Shanghai supported by  the rest of the country. Particularly during the nineties,  Shanghai enjoys the support of other parts of the country in its  development drive. Of Shanghai's 3 million residents who came  from other parts of the country, 1 million work in major  construction projects or in partly or wholly foreign-owned  enterprises, thus contributing to Shanghai's construction.  Shanghai should serve, support, and contribute more to other  parts of the country. To this end, we shall send more people to  fraternal provinces this year to learn from their valuable  experience. Also, we shall further explore the means of  cooperation with fraternal provinces and municipalities in the  interests of common prosperity."</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Passenger aircraft industry in tailspin / Examining a rapid decline in values A WORLD glut of passenger aircraft is sending aircraft prices into a tail spin and threatening the expansion plans of aircraft makers, airlines and aircraft leasing companies. Evidence for a slide in aircraft values is mounting. Earlier this year, a one-year-old Boeing 737 was for sale at an asking price of about Pounds 27m. The price seemed reasonable, considering it cost Pounds 30m when new. It sold for less than Pounds 23m. That seller was desperate; most would rather put their property into storage. There are about 800 civil airliners parked on desert runways in the southwestern US, safe from corrosion. They represent about 10 per cent of the western world's passenger jet fleet, and at new prices, comprise about Dollars 25bn (Pounds 13bn) of non-performing assets. This makes bad reading for investors. The industry increasingly depends on the financial sector to provide capital to buy aircraft. Failure of last month's equity flotation by GPA Group, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, was partly due to the soft market for used aircraft. GPA makes more from selling aircraft it has owned for a few years than from leasing them. Investors did not have to rely on anecdotal evidence. Apart from storing aircraft, airlines have been trying to lease them. The result has been a decline in lease rates. The monthly payments for leasing a Boeing 737, the world's biggest-selling passenger aircraft, are up to 22 per cent less than than a year ago, according to Avmark, an Anglo-US aviation consultancy. The effect is widespread: 67 of the 69 passenger aircraft types have seen lease rates fall during the last year by up to 47 per cent. The fall has steadied in recent weeks, according to the Los Angeles-based International Lease Financing, the second biggest aircraft leaser after GPA. 'It could just be the summer season,' says Mr John Plueger, a senior vice-president at the company. If manufacturers have been under pressure to cut the price of new aircraft in response to oversupply in the secondhand market, they are not showing it. They have resisted price cuts on new aircraft, arguing that the apparently unstoppable growth of air traffic determines pricing policies. That growth ended last year; the first for decades to show a decline in passenger numbers. Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell-Douglas, the companies which dominate passenger aircraft sales, have found ways to help struggling customers. They are more accommodating when airlines request deferred delivery dates and there is talk of special loans or other inducements. 'Aircraft manufacturers may now be forced to cut prices,' says Mr Keith McMullan, of Avmark. 'Then they would have to concentrate more on production economies on their current models rather than going for new models.' The process has begun. Last month McDonnell-Douglas, the third biggest civil aircraft maker, all but abandoned plans to build the MD-12, a 500-seater designed to be the first of a new generation of ultra-large aircraft. In the last few months, Airbus and Boeing have said they will be cutting jobs and slowing production. Strong airlines stand to benefit from the over-capacity among manufacturers. Those in a position to buy will get lower prices and pay lower operating charges. Weaker airlines may be locked into lease payments at older, higher prices. They would have to compete with rivals paying less for newer aircraft. Weak and small airlines may also suffer from GPA's failed share offering. They have used the buying power of GPA to cut the cost of aircraft and help them compete with larger airlines. Without the proceeds from its share sale, GPA may have to cancel some orders. Last week, it announced that it had cancelled plans to buy-in its joint venture companies to avoid bringing Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 640m) of extra borrowings on to its balance sheet. Cancelled orders are more than simply a matter of slower growth. They mean losing bulk discounts and incurring penalties. GPA's customers could bear the brunt of the resulting higher costs. City stockbroker Kleinwort Benson says that the smaller airlines will come under increasing pressure and that some will drop out. 'Ultimately there will be a stronger airline industry.'</p>

Kim met with visiting American senators Sam Nunn and Richard  Lugar over breakfast and requested continued support from the  U.S. Congress for such cooperation, Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said.    Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and  his entourage came to Seoul after visiting Russia on what  officials here called a field trip.    The spokesman said there was no discussion of sanctions on  North Korea in case diplomatic dialogue fails but described the  senators visit as intended to gather necessary information on  various possibilities if sanctions become inevitable.    Nunn reaffirmed the U.S. security commitment to Seoul,  recalling President Bill Clinton's words that an attack on South  Korea is an attack on the United States. This, he said, was the  position of the United States.    He called South Korea-U.S. cooperation an invaluable  prerequisite to stability on the Korean peninsula and added that  American troops need to stay in South Korea, the spokesman said.    The senators return to Washington later Tuesday.</p>

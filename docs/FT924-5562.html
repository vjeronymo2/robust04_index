			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Watchdog criticises Ford finance plan FORD OF Britain is to amend advertising, sales literature and other material for its Options car finance scheme after being told by the Office of Fair Trading that aspects of it are 'misleading'. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, is to seek assurances from other manufacturers that they will not promote similar schemes in the same way. Options is a modified hire purchase scheme under which the 'buyer' makes monthly payments on a portion - usually about half - of the full price of the car, plus interest on the full price. The driver has to pay a final instalment of several thousand pounds. The underlying intention is to encourage the driver to hand back the car to Ford in exchange for a new agreement. The OFT's criticisms were that the promotional material purported to compare Options with a bank loan, implying that they were similar schemes. But with a bank loan, Sir Bryan said, the customer owned the car from the time of sale and was free to sell it as desired. Under Options, the car remained Ford's property until the last payment was made. In not making a true comparison, Ford was in breach of consumer credit legislation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- An attack on Russian  President Boris Yeltsin has not been supported by the majority  of deputies in the State Duma. Independent Deputy Nadezhda  Verveyko of the Krasnodar territory suggested at a plenary  meeting of the Duma on Friday that an item on the Russian  president's oath be put on the agenda of the session. She  asserted that for several months now the Russian president has  been working without being sworn in. A minority of deputies of  the State Duma voted for her proposal.    Deputy from Russia's Choice group Anatoliy Yushchenko who  spoke in the debate pointed out that Nadezhda Verveyko, a  trained jurist, should know that under articles of the new  Russian Constitution for the transitional period the president  need not be sworn in a second time. Nevertheless Verveyko has  insisted on the voting.    It is surprising that despite the clarity of the matter she  was still supported by 178 votes.</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Scheme to help Names gains mixed response PROFESSIONALS IN the Lloyd's insurance market generally reacted positively to the recommendations of the task force yesterday, but many doubted whether the recommendations would help Names already in financial difficulties. The welcome was cautious, however, as brokers, underwriters, advisers and Names - the individuals whose wealth underpins the market - struggled to digest the 240-page report. Mr Max Lehrain, managing director of Grimston Scott, a tax and financial adviser to Lloyd's Names, said late in the afternoon: 'I have to admit I'm only on page 52 at the moment. But what is encouraging is to see the Council responding in a positive way.' Mr Chris Burton, joint managing director of AJ Archer, a quoted underwriting group, said: 'It's a very comprehensive document. My immediate reaction is, it's a breath of fresh air for the whole marketplace. The whole concept of the report is getting back to the commerciality of Lloyd's. I welcome the growth in the number of Names, and that the capacity is being maintained for individual Names.' He also welcomed the importance given to the Names and enhanced links to brokers, whom he called 'the life blood of the market'. He did not feel the new rights for Names would make managing agency business less attractive. Mr Ken Carter, chief executive of insurance broker Lloyd Thompson, was particularly pleased with the reaffirmation of the partnership between brokers and underwriters. He added: 'The report is not very radical. It is what one would have expected. The original aim was to look at Lloyd's capital base. That has moved slightly into the background.' The proposal to allow Names to reinsure their 'open years' with CentreWrite, in particular, had a lukewarm reception. Mr Mike Voller, Lloyd's specialist with the accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn, which advises about 1,000 Names said: 'If they can afford that, they can probably afford the losses.' He added: 'I can't see an awful lot of people taking that out because of the level of premiums which is likely to be charged.' Mr Mark Farrer, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents 9,500 Names - 40 per cent of the total - was more positive about the proposal. 'I think the proposals for CentreWrite are going to be extremely useful for Names, because nobody at present is really prepared to assess the individual risk. I don't doubt that what is proposed is an excellent idea. 'Proposals like this underline the importance of the providers of the market's capital and go a long way towards correcting an imbalance between Names and syndicate management.' He recognised that Names suffering losses from the old years 'will not find a panacea in the proposals'. Brokers were generally enthusiastic. Mr Alan Colls, chairman of the Lloyd's insurance brokers committee, and chairman of Nicholson Chamberlain &amp; Colls, a Lloyd's brokerage said: 'The instantaneous applause that David Rowland received when he made his presentation said it all. I think the report has the balance about right. It has to be about the art of the possible. I am glad to see support for the broking community.' Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Names, was positive, but added: 'It's done nothing to help the injured Names, of which there are 6,000. Many of them are in great financial difficulties already, and it's going to get worse this year. Names who are suffering this year ain't seen nothing yet.' He welcomed the report's recommendations for the future. 'It's a first-class, imaginative report, and I'm sure it will lead to a profitable future. For the first time in its 300-year history, it's putting the outsiders first, and not the insiders.'</p>

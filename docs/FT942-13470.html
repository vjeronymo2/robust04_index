			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Actions by EC strike at the principle of subsidiarity Sir, On two successive days you reported items which ought to provoke serious concern about European Union affairs. Your article 'EC set to back Cardiff Barrage' (April 21) indicated that the (Greek) environment commissioner has insisted on additional work to protect wading birds, and that the UK government's reaction to this has delayed work on the barrage. If the principle of subsidiarity has meaning and importance we ought to be able to assume that the Union will in future leave such matters, in this country, to be dealt with by us; and in such matters an expensive and wholly unnecessary extra tier of government (Union government) and government activity will be abandoned. On April 22, you reported a suddenly imposed quota on Chinese silk imports into the Union ('Britain's silk imports boom cut short as Brussels imposes quota'). The incompetence demonstrated in this is reflected in the number of UK retailers which have placed and paid for substantial imports of Chinese silk goods which they cannot now import. But - and this is much more significant and worrying - this Union government action highlights the extent to which protectionist Union attitudes now extend far beyond the boundaries of the indefensibly selfish Common Agricultural Policy.

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EFFECT OF DRUG WAR ON BLACKS  </P> <P> Your article on the effects of the drug war on minorities was both excellent  and long overdue ("Blacks Feel Brunt of Drug War," front page, April 22).  </P> <P> At the current rates of incarceration, by the year 2000, at least one-half of  all of the young black men in America will be in prison or on parole.  </P> <P> About 1.5 million black male teen-agers will be dead or in prison before their  30th birthday. Young black men who go to prison are as good as dead. They do  not come back as productive members of society. For every black teen-ager who  goes to college, three will go to prison.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the General Accounting Office just released its own study  which showed that medical treatment reduces drug addiction, health problems,  and drug-related crime by at least 85%. The vast majority of drug users who  received treatment became productive members of society in less time than the  average prison sentence for drugs, at about one-tenth the cost of prison.  </P> <P> The federal goals, as outlined by drug czar William Bennett, will destroy at  least half of an entire black generation -- even if the drugs do not. This is  not a sensible drug policy. This is wholesale slaughter.  </P> <P> CLIFFORD A. SCHAFFER  </P> <P> Canyon Country  </P></p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Observer: Dreaming spiral Oxford must be mortified by the Universities Funding Council's assessment of research quality. Oxford lags far behind Cambridge, and barely nosed ahead of University College, London, in the number of its centres judged to be conducting research of an international standard. The dreaming spires house the largest history and French departments in the country. Both are judged inferior to their Cambridge counterparts. Oxford's historians are even ranked behind the hoi polloi at Birmingham. In politics and international relations, Oxford is outscored not just by the LSE and King's, London, but by Essex, Hull and Manchester. It is a similarly sorry tale in sociology, statistics, music, agriculture, education and business/management studies. Cherwell sources were quick to point to excessive teaching loads, and were none too polite about the assessment exercise itself. They may have a point there. Alas, whingeing will not get the Campaign for Oxford far in its quest for business and alumni millions. Perhaps the accumulated reserves should be spent on a Brummie historian or two . . .</p>

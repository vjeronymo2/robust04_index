			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / People: Cooper quits Treasury for James Capel The Treasury has lost another of its top economists to the private sector in the shape of Adrian Cooper, who is leaving to join James Capel. Cooper, the Treasury's forecasting co-ordinator, is joining two other ex-Treasury economists in James Capel's six-strong economists group. Cooper, 28, has worked at the Treasury since 1986. He has played a key role in extending the Treasury's contacts with outside economists in an effort to improve on its poor recent forecasting record. Cooper, who graduated from Bristol University and has a higher degree from the London School of Economics, says he is leaving primarily to 'gain experience of economics in a private-sector environment'. The fact that he would be paid more at James Capel 'is not the main reason, though it is a nice feature'. Despite criticism directed at the Treasury, morale within the economists' department was high; 'I've enjoyed working here.' Cooper will work in a James Capel team headed by Keith Skeoch which also includes two other ex-Treasury econ-omists, Gwynne Hacche and Stephen King. He will feel very much at home at James Capel's City offices, which are shared with its sister company Midland Global Markets, also owned by HSBC Holdings. In Midland's economics teams are a further two former Treasury officials in the shape of Simon Briscoe and Julian Jessop. Cooper - who leaves the Treasury in early May - has recently been working under Colin Mowl, the Treasury's chief forecaster. He has sat in on meetings of the 'seven wise men' of outside forecasters and was responsible for a large amount of the draft of this group's first report issued in February. He has also become involved with controversy over whether the Treasury might at some point seek to contract out its computerised economic model to an outside group. But the Treasury says it still has some way to go before deciding on whether to ask companies to do this work.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Lie and Xie Yicheng: "Jetliner Crash Near Xian Kills </F> All 160 on Board"]    [Text] A TU-154 passenger jet liner of China Northwest  Airlines with 160 people on board crashed yesterday morning near  Xian, capital of Shaanxi Province. There were no survivors.    By 9 pm last night [1300 gmt], the cause of the crash was  still under investigation. However, rescue teams have already  recovered the black box containing the flight recording, which  is being analysed by experts, according to reports from the  crash site.    A source from the Civil Aviation Administration of China  (CAAC) said Flight No 2303 took off at 8:12 am on a flight to  Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province.    Eight minutes later, the plane lost contact with the airport  control tower, the source said, and was seen crashing in  farmland in Mingdu town of Chang'an County soon afterwards .    Reports from the scene were confused but the latest  information said that all the 146 passengers -- including 133  mainland Chinese plus four Italian, two American, two British,  three Hong Kong, one Taiwanese and another unidentified overseas  traveler -- and also the 14 crew members on board the  Russian-made jet were confirmed as killed.    The death toll included four children, according to airline  sources.    Three eyewitnesses said they heard two loud explosions in  the  clouds and then saw a fire ball crashing to the ground. Debris  was scattered across a wide area.    Local officials, aviation experts, and medical personnel  rushed to the crash site upon hearing the news.    Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and leading officials of CAAC and  the  Ministry of Labour, including the newly appointed CAAC director  Chen Guangyi, flew from Beijing to Xian to investigate the case  soon after the crash was reported.    The crash site was 30 kilometres southeast of Xian and 80  kilometres away from the Xianyang International Airport, where  the plane took off. It was near the Qinling Mountains but the  site of the crash was level ground.    The incident was the first air fatality in China since last  November, when an MD-82 airliner of China Northern Airlines  crashed while landing in the western city of Urumqi. Twelve  people died in that accident.</p>

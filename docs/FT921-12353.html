			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Israel confident of deal over Dollars 10bn US backing SENIOR Israeli ministers yesterday predicted that the country would reach agreement with Washington on securing Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in loan guarantees to aid Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union - without surrendering its commitment to build settlements in occupied territories. Despite a clear signal from the Bush Administration on Friday that it would link the two issues, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, said Israel was 'not speaking about any freeze of settlements. Please forget about it'. One of his ministers claimed that US terms for the guarantees would allow 'massive' settlement building over the next three years. This assessment may yet be deflated by Washington. Mr James Baker, the US Secretary of State, made clear in talks on Friday with Mr Zalman Shoval, Israel's ambassador, that their meeting was the first of what could be lengthy negotiations on the terms of the guarantees. However, the highly sensitive issue could affect the multilateral phase of the Middle East peace negotiations due to open in Moscow tomorrow, given the deep Arab hostility to Israel's settlement policy. Syria and Lebanon have refused to attend, citing Israel's refusal to make any concession on occupied Arab territories in three rounds of bilateral talks held so far. In Tunis last night, an official from the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which bitterly opposes the loan guarantees to Israel without a strict settlement freeze, said the Palestinians would not participate in the Moscow talks unless the composition of their delegation was broadened. Mr Baker indicated to Mr Shoval that the loan guarantees would depend on curbing new settlement construction, which the US regards as an obstacle to peace. But the Israeli government interpreted this as falling well short of a demand for a total settlement freeze. 'The United States has re-affirmed its readiness to assist us in the unprecedented task of absorbing the large immigration from the Soviet Union and other countries,' said Mr Shamir. 'The United States understands that for us the building and development of all parts of Eretz Israel (including the West Bank and Gaza) is a matter of principle. We will now engage in a common effort to find a formula that will not contradict US policy or this principle of ours.' Other top ministers, including Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, and Mr Dan Meridor, justice minister, said they expected an acceptable compromise. Mr Ehud Omert, the health minister and a close associate of Mr Shamir, declared that Mr Baker had signalled that Israel could proceed with the many new houses already under way or budgeted, which would provide for a 50 per cent increase in the settler population of 100,000. 'They agreed in the coming three years Israel will continue to build massively in the territories,' he said. With an election looming in June, Mr Shamir's Likud party is desperate to show the public it can deliver its dual promise of US economic aid and a continued commitment to the ideological goal of settling and ruling the West Bank and Gaza.</p>

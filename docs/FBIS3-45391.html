			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 6 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--This year  will prove to be mainland China's "legislation year," in which  over 10 economic laws will be adopted and put into effect,  including a "law on foreign trade," "law on commercial banks,"  "law on joint-stock cooperative enterprises," "law on swap  transactions," "labor law," "insurance law," "securities law,"  "trust law," "bills law," "real estate law," and "auction law.  The "Company Law" was the first to be promulgated: It was  adopted at the end of 1993 and took effect on New Year's Day of  1994.    Under the present situation where mainland China is bringing  its economy into the orbit of a market economy, all this  legislation is undoubted urgently needed by the country. It has  been reported that in the next five years, the mainland plans to  adopt 152 laws concerning such fields as the economy, justice,  culture and education, and environmental protection. The most  prominent of all is the economic legislations. Last 29  November, at the closing ceremony of the Fifth Session of the  NPC [National People's Congress] Standing Committee, NPC  Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi indicated that the NPC  Standing Committee would continue to place the work of speeding  up legislation, especially economic legislation, in a primary  position; strive to enable legislative work to keep pace with  reform; and use laws to guide, push forward, and guarantee  reform. He said: The NPC Standing Committee should step up  efforts and work out laws badly needed in such fields as  finance, money, bonds, and securities. He stressed: After laws  are promulgated, we must resolutely put them into practice, for  a failure to put laws into effect means there is no law at all.    As a result of China's feudal history of several thousand  years, during which the emperors' imperial edicts were regarded  as more authoritative than laws by local officials, an awareness  of rule by law was relatively weak at both the higher and lower  levels. It may be for this reason that stories about "Justice  Bao [an imperial magistrate famous for his wisdom and fairness]"  are so popular these days. Even today, some officials on the  mainland often refuse to act according to the law and they are  used to handling economic and social disputes with  administrative means. Some cadres abuse their power and  authority for private gain, or forget about their duties the  moment they see an opportunity for making a profit. It is clear  that such a situation would undoubtedly create obstacles and  hidden dangers for the smooth operation of the market economy.    As a matter of fact, during a period when the mainland is  trying to change the operational pattern of its economy, a  number of deeper contradictions in the economic field still  remain unsolved, most state-owned enterprises are still plagued  by losses, the rate of wage increases is falling behind  inflation, many workers and staff are leading a relatively  difficult life, and a number of social contradictions which have  been triggered by inflation have added to those factors leading  to social instability. Under such circumstances, a failure of  government offices at all levels to act according to the law and  to stop lawbreakers from fishing in troubled waters will  probably lead to turbulence in the society. It is exactly based  on this consideration that we need to put into practice the  "bankruptcy law" and the "social insurance law" (including  unemployment relief funds and pensions). Meanwhile, we need to  work out and further perfect laws on building a clean  administration and on the campaign against corruption to provide  more powerful legal grounds for handing down effective  punishments for corrupt officials and bribe takers.    Free competition is allowed under a market economic system.  However, due to different conditions and economic strengths  enjoyed by state-owned enterprises, collective enterprises,  privately run enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises, a  question has thus emerged on whether or not there is fair  competition. The "Law Against Illegal Means of Competition,"  which was adopted by the mainland in October last year, filled  this gap, thus providing favorable guarantees for all sides.  With this law, all departments, enterprises, units, and  individuals wishing to enter the market can neither enjoy  privileges or monopolize the market, nor beat down their rivals  by dumping products. The "law on foreign trade," which is to be  promulgated this year, also carries clauses on drastically  reducing import tariffs and preventing the dumping of foreign  goods.    The "Company Law," which took effect on New Year's Day of  this year, mainly aims at establishing the status of companies  as the main body in the market structure, standardizing the  organizational structure and conduct of companies, enabling  state-owned enterprises to carry out reform of their property  rights and head for a corporate joint-stock system, and at  finally setting up a modern enterprise system which regards the  laws of the market as the main productive factor.    Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, has  indicated that China should base its legislation "on its own  national conditions and boldly assimilate and use for reference  the accomplishments and experience of foreign countries in  legislation." He noted that it has become the usual practice of  all countries in the world to assimilate and use for reference  the legislative experiences of other countries. He stressed  that when adopting economic legislation, China should not, and  sees no need to, start everything from the very beginning;  instead, it can transplant to China from foreign countries laws  that suit China's national conditions and which enjoy the common  nature of a market economy. This is also a shortcut for China to  accelerate its adoption of market economic legislation. The  mainland probably plans to take such "shortcuts" when it adopts  152 new laws in the next five years.</p>

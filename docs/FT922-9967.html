			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Better trading environment for Daily Telegraph Panmure Gordon, brokers to the Daily Telegraph, has published a report on the company, which is planning a stock market flotation in the summer. The report says it has been transformed over the last six years from a loss of Pounds 11.2m in 1986 to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 40.5m in 1991. However, the report says the company is operating in a mature area of publishing, although the quality national sector should do well in a period of cyclical recovery. The broker argues that the Telegraph will be able to use its strong cash flow and its share quotation to make acquisitions. These are likely to be in the media, mainly newspaper publishing in the UK and overseas, and to some extent in the UK television industry. Panmure is constrained from making profit forecasts but says currently there is a more encouraging trading environment, and operational gearing means extra revenue can convert into profits at rates up to 70 per cent. In 1993 the recovery in advertising should gather pace, and the group's 15 per cent stake in John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group, should more than cover its financing costs.</p>

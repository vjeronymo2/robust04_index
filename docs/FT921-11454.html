			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (12): On a triple springboard - Telecommunications THE telecommunications sector is still growing, despite the world recession. Profits of many telephone companies have continued to increase - albeit at a slower rate than before - the volume of telephone traffic is rising, investment is up and new services are mushrooming. Three principal factors lie behind the market's continuing dynamism: First: The industry is in the midst of a far-reaching reorganisation as national state-owned telephone monopolies try to turn themselves into globally-competitive operators. Globalisation itself is being spurred on by the fact that governments are increasingly privatising their state-run telephone companies and subjecting them to competition. Second: new technology is reducing costs, improving efficiency and expanding the range of services that can be offered to customers. The widespread introduction of fibre-optic cable and digital exchanges has laid the ground-work for the modern telecommunications infrastructure. The increasing intelligence of networks combined with advances in radio and semi-conductor technology have also played their part. The most explosive growth continues to be in mobile communications, in particular cellular, and data communications, which is being spearheaded by the facsimile machine, and the personal computer. Third: developing countries and the nations of the former Soviet bloc are now trying to make up for decades of under-investment in telecommunications. There is a growing appreciation that they cannot participate in the modern world economy unless they can communicate effectively, both domestically and internationally. Most Third World and eastern European governments have recently adopted crash programmes to increase the number of phone lines in their countries. However, there is considerable doubt over whether they will be able to find the funds needed for the massive investments planned. The world telecommunications services market was worth Dollars 279bn in 1990, up from Dollars 175bn in 1986, and is forecast to reach Dollars 567bn in 1995 by the Telecommunications Research Centre, the UK-based industry analyst. Meanwhile, the global equipment market has grown from Dollars 88bn in 1986 to Dollars 127bn in 1990 and is forecast to reach Dollars 169bn in 1995. The liberalisation of telecommunications markets is now fairly well established in the US, the UK, Japan and a number of other smaller countries. These countries allow competition in the full range of telecommunication services, including the basic telephone service. The European Commission is due later this year to examine whether competition in the basic phone service should be required across the Community. In most developed countries there is already competition in mobile and data communication services. The one area of the telecommunications market which has proved particularly resistant to competition is the provision of international telephone services. These have traditionally been provided by national monopolies, co-operating with one another in a series of cartel arrangements. Even here, though, change is coming. The US regulatory authorities, the EC and a number of national regulators are trying to reform the cartel practices and international call charges have already started to fall. Governments have been keen to privatise their telephone monopolies, partly in order to promote efficiency and partly to attract greater investment. The latter reason has been a prominent feature of Third World privatisations. The trend towards globalisation has had three main manifestations: First: the acquisition of stakes in newly-privatised telephone companies. The US 'Baby Bell' operators have been particularly prominent in this area. Second: establishing 'green field' operations in basic telephony, cable television and mobile communications. Earlier this year, for example, American Telephone and Telegraph formed a joint venture to build a network in the Ukraine, while Nynex, one of the Baby Bells, is close to finalising a deal to build a network in Bangkok, Thailand. Third: the formation of international partnerships with the aim of catering to the global telecommunication needs of multinational business customers. Last year, BT, previously British Telecom, tried to persuade Germany's Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telphone to join its US-based Syncordia partnership. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T has held extensive negotiations with the UK's Cable and Wireless about collaborating extensively across the globe. So far, nothing has materialised in either BT's or AT&amp;T's case. But international partnerships are expected to be an important feature of 1992.</p>

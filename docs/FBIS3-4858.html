The government-backed institution said in the February  survey  that the diffusion index of profits came to a seasonally  adjusted minus 26.4 from January's minus 30.7, with the sales  index improving to minus 14.7 from minus 18.9.    Looking three months ahead, the sales index came to minus  4.4  from the previous month's minus 6.9, with signs for recovery  seen particularly in the consumer electronics and public-works  related construction fields.    But the institutions noted "concerns over adverse effects,  again primarily on subcontractors related to exporters from the  yen's recent further advance."    The index represents the percentage of those answering "an  increase" minus those saying "a decline."    The survey covered 900 smaller firms, with responses  obtained  from 662 firms, or 73.6 percent.    The product inventory index, or the net saying shortage,  deteriorated to minus 23.5 from minus 22.1, with stockpiles  considered excessive on a broad front.    The labor shortage index waned to minus 13.9 from minus  15.5,  with an excessive labor force continuing in precision equipment,  steel and auto parts firms although some improvements are seen  at electric machinery and chemical manufacturers.</p>

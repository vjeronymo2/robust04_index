			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television If you know any young people (and there seem to be lots) who are vague about what, exactly, was so detestably inhuman about the Nazis, tell them to watch today's Timewatch. Pawel Lozinski's documentary 'Birthplace' follows Henryk Gryndberg as he returns to the village in Poland where he was born, and moves from house to house trying to find some trace of his family or information about how they died (8.00 BBC2). It is followed by the last in the present series of Building Sights, USA. Actor John Malkovich enthuses over the Chrysler Building which is easily the most attractive in New York. At all times of the day or night, in all conditions of light and weather, it is always exciting to catch sight of the Chrysler down one of those urban canyons (8.45). The Underworld shows how the middle class drug dealers of the 1960s have been superseded by professional criminals (9.30 BBC1). One day perhaps television will make a programme showing how the de-criminalisation of drugs would, at one fell swoop, destroy most of the modern crime wave.</p>

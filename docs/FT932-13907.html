			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Citicorp rises sharply to Dollars 370m in first quarter CITICORP, the biggest US commercial bank, reported first-quarter 1993 operating earnings that jumped to Dollars 370m, or 67 cents a share, from Dollars 183m, or 37 cents, in the first quarter of last year. The bank's net profit was inflated to Dollars 670m as a result of accounting changes related to tax benefits. US consumer banking business was weak, and the bank's commercial property loan business in North America reported a net loss of Dollars 202m in the quarter, less than half the Dollars 462m loss a year ago. But most other divisions of the bank did well. Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, said the results reflected a continued drop in credit costs, as well as cost controls. He said the bank continued to strengthen its balance sheet by building bad debt provisions and capital. Citicorp's tier one ratio of capital to assets stood at 5.2 per cent at the end of March, up from 4.1 per cent. The bank's consolidated bad debt provisions in the quarter totalled Dollars 689m, down from Dollars 1.2bn a year ago. Non-performing assets amounted to a total of Dollars 10.2bn of assets, only slightly above the Dollars 10.1bn level of a year ago. Net loan write-offs in the quarter were Dollars 514m, down sharply from Dollars 997m in the first three months of 1992. Mr Bill Rhodes, Citicorp's vice-chairman who was given responsibility for credit control at the end of 1991, said that during the quarter the bank sold Dollars 125m of properties, seized when loans went into default, compared with Dollars 300m in the whole of last year. The average price achieved for these properties was 67 per cent of the value of the loans on them. Earnings in the global consumer business increased by 30 per cent year-on-year, to Dollars 320m. Revenues of Dollars 2.6bn were unchanged. Global finance division reported first-quarter earnings of Dollars 353m compared with Dollars 193m. The cross-border refinancing portfolio had Dollars 40m of earnings in the quarter, down from Dollars 130m a year ago and caused by the release of funds from bad debt provisions. Total Citicorp revenues in the quarter were up by 5 per cent year-on-year at Dollars 4.3bn. On Wall Street, the shares closed Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 28 3/4.</p>

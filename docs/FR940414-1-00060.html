			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Cost Estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA estimated industry-wide costs for these five options by estimating costs on a plant-by-plant basis for the 707 facilities involved in the survey. These costs were used to estimate costs for the 2400 facilities that are represented by the survey. Each of the surveyed facilities that use and discharge wastewater to the POTW was costed for each option. For the second phase of the evaluation (facilities processing both the 272 and the non-272 active ingredients) additional costs were determined based on the survey responses. For facilities processing only the non-272 active ingredients, costs were estimated based on the results of costing compliance with the proposed rule for the 2400 facilities for which the detailed information was developed. Based on the additional 1500 facilities processing only the non-272 PAIs, as identified in the FIFRA data base, and taking into account the estimated number of these facilities that would already be at zero discharge based on the surveyed population of facilities, 311 of the 1500 PFPR facilities were estimated to incur costs. This is proportional to the 507 PFPR facilities which were costed in the costing evaluation for the 272 PAIs. Since the practices and types of products are expected to be the same for facilities processing both the 272 active ingredients in the survey data base and the other active ingredients (non-272 active ingredients) covered by the proposed rule, the distribution of costs was estimated to be the same for both populations of facilities. Including the additional costs for the 311 PFPR facilities to formulate, package, and/or repackage non-272 PAIs, the additional annualized cost associated with the extended coverage of the proposed rule for PFPR facilities is $20.5 million, with 818 PFPR facilities incurring costs. EPA also estimated that there could be an additional 13 manufacturing/formulating, packaging and repackaging facilities that make products containing only non-272 active ingredients. Using the same approach as above EPA estimates there may be a cost of $5.8 million annualized cost associated with their compliance, and an additional $3.7 million annualized cost for the original 22 PFPR/manufacturers. This results in a total annualized cost of $56.1 million for the proposed option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the detailed costing evaluation for the 2439 out of the 3879 facilities, EPA began by establishing a hierarchy with which to estimate the costs for all wastewaters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;EPA assumes that any wastewater stream achieving zero discharge to surface waters as of 1988 would not be affected by these regulations and so no additional cost was included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Any wastewater stream generated by rinsing drums or shipping containers is assumed to be reused in product formulations without storage at no additional cost to the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wastewater streams generated by rinsing bulk storage containers are assumed to be temporarily stored and later reused on site. Facilities would incur costs associated with this storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wastewater streams generated by cleaning the interiors of pesticide formulating and packaging equipment are assumed to be temporarily stored and later reused in product formulation where possible, or treated (as discussed below) and reused on site. Facilities would incur costs associated with this storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wastewater contained in waste streams that are generated by cleaning pesticide formulating and packaging equipment with both water and solvent streams is assumed to be kept separate from the solvent and treated and reused on site. When switching from a solvent to a water-based product a facility typically rinses the equipment first with the solvent, (which can be reused in the next formulation) followed by a water rinse. Although this water rinse may contain small quantities of solvent, the Agency believes this water can be treated on-site and reused. Facilities would incur costs associated with this treatment and storage.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the selected regulatory approach wastewater generated from cleaning out the interiors would be reused as diluent in the next batch of the same product to be formulated, thus recovering the product value of this wastewater. However, some facilities reported cleaning equipment interiors in a way that may preclude the wastewater's reuse. The Agency believes that these facilities can change their cleaning practices or change their equipment configurations such that they will be able to reuse these waste streams. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Without the facility-specific information needed to assess how each facility might do this, the Agency has taken the following approach to costing for these interior waste streams.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Organic based Solvents used for cleaning are not expected to be discharged to a POTW and are not included in the estimates of cost. EPA's survey data base indicates that companies generally prefer for cost or other reasons to keep solvents separate from wastewaters and not discharge them to POTWs. Often companies can reuse solvents or burn or sell them for their fuel content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cleaning with inert materials (besides water) or mechanical cleaning (e.g. scraping) are not expected to result in a wastewater source and are not included in the estimates of cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cleaning water that is currently being recycled or reused is already complying with the regulatory approach and therefore is not included in the estimates of cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cleaning water that is disposed of off-site and not to a POTW is already complying with the regulatory approach in that it is not discharged directly to surface waters or indirectly through a POTW and therefore is not included in the estimates of cost.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of cleaning the interior of equipment with water only, the following factors were also considered:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Lines that do not formulate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is assumed that wastewater generated by cleaning lines that are not used to formulate products (i.e., those lines used exclusively for packaging or repackaging pesticide product) is unable to be reused directly in product formulations, since no pesticide products are formulated on these lines. These waste streams were costed for treatment and reuse or off-site incineration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

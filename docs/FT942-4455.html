			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Brazil eases restriction on mutual equity funds Brazil's Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) has moved closer to the modernisation of its stock exchanges by allowing non-financial institutions to form and manage mutual equity funds, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo. CVM president Mr Thomas Tosta de Sa said: 'We want to make the rules flexible for the stock market in Brazil.' He said the measure would come into effect over the next few days. 'The CVM's board of directors will approve the measure today. It will be effective as soon as the board's decision is published in the government's official gazette,' Mr Tosta de Sa said. He said consultant firms, as well as individuals, would be allowed to form and manage their own equity funds. According to current stock market rules, only financial institutions are allowed to open stock funds in Brazil. CVM officials said, however, that stock custody and distribution rules would remain unchanged. 'An individual will be allowed to open an equity fund, but he still needs a financial institution to provide the custody and distribution of the shares for him,' Mr Tosta de Sa said.</p>

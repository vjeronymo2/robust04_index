			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / North Sea operators face tough new safety measures A TOUGH new safety regime, which will take North Sea operators' costs of improving safety to more than Pounds 1.7bn, were recommended yesterday by the Health and Safety Commission (HSC), which is part of the Health and Safety Executive. The draft regulations flow from the inquiry chaired by Lord Cullen into the 1988 Piper Alpha explosion and fire in which 167 workers died and which caused the industry to rethink its approach to safety. The recommendations have been put out for consultation before being submitted to government. It is expected they will become law next year. Operators in the North Sea welcomed the document but said they would question some aspects, including a regulation that could result in operators having to provide standard temporary safe refuges on unmanned installations. Lord Cullen in his report recommended technological innovations to improve safety, such as the installation of emergency shutdown valves. The industry estimates it has spent more than Pounds 1bn on hardware since the report was published. He also urged a revamp in the way safety was managed and called for a move away from measures taken in the past, where safety regulations would be laid down in minute detail, to a more flexible regime which left individual companies to develop their own guidelines. Under the new draft regulations, which implement 30 of the 106 recommendations set by Lord Cullen, operators will have to submit a 'safety case', details of how they plan to make the changes, for each installation by next year. These must then be accepted by the HSC. Other Cullen guidelines will be incorporated in future HSC regulations. The HSC estimates that the overall cost of modifying installation will be about Pounds 1.75bn, most of which has already been spent or committed by operators. The HSC estimates it will cost companies initially in excess of Pounds 115m to prepare safety plans for the 230 installations in the North Sea. Ongoing costs for new installations and updating safety plans have been estimated at between Pounds 4.5m and Pounds 11m a year. Trade unions with members offshore welcomed the recommendations. Mr Jimmy Airlie, Scottish executive member of the AEU, the engineering union, said: 'This report vindicates our long campaign to improve health and safety offshore. The implementation of these new procedures cannot come soon enough.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu commentary: "A Reshuffle That Does Not Solve </F> Anything"]    [Text] Yesterday morning, on the seventh day of the week,  which was created by the Lord for all humans to rest, the news  started circulating among political and press circles that at  the Cotroceni [presidential headquarters] audio and video cables  were being laid down to record the oath-taking ceremony of the  newly appointed ministers. Many thought that is was just a  joke. In order to have new ministers sworn in, first the old  ones have to go. Until yesterday morning no one knew anything  about any imminent government reshuffle. This is how yesterday  at the Cotroceni they managed to set a new record of condensing  into just a few minutes events that usually stretch over several  days: The announcement of the government reshuffle, the  announcing of the names of the new ministers, the oath-taking  ceremony, and the sipping of the customary glass of champagne.  Taking into consideration that all these historic moments took  place at once, on Sunday at noon, when people are usually trying  to cure their hangovers, we can safely say without fear of  contradiction that this was a genuine original in the history of  Romanian and even world politics. What made the PDSR [Social  Democracy Party of Romania] leaders and Ion Iliescu adopt such a  style of doing things -- that is, covering things in secrecy  while gasping because of the sudden effort -- remains an enigma.  In the next few days, when people will be less careful to keep  their mouths shut, they will probably offer us the solution to  this mystery. Until then all we can do is remark that such a  style is far from being able to meet the requirements of  democracy, which may be defined precisely by the long pondering  that precedes decisionmaking, and that previously decisions were  usually subject to debates or, at least, to the test of public  opinion. Having secretly appointed Petre Salcudeanu as culture  minister, the PDSR was subsequently surprised to find that the  dignitary in question does not refrain from going to work with  blurry eyes and with the zipper of his pants open [reference to  photograph of minister in a compromising situation]. Let us  hope that the PDSR will not be surprised in a similar way by any  of the new ministers sworn in yesterday!    It is very difficult to work out a formula explaining the  latest moves of the government party. It froze the negotiations  with its left-wing allies to set up the red pentagon government  [coalition consisting of PDSR, the National Romanian Unity Party  -- PUNR, the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania -- PDAR, the  Socialist Party of Labor -- PSM, and the Greater Romania Party  -- PRM], and opened negotiations with opposition parties.  Despite the fact that PDSR issued a firm declaration engaging  in a controversy with the left-wing political parties, the  government party was very careful not to severe all the links  connecting it with the PUNR, the PRM, and the PSM. This  ambiguous stance made many of the country's nationalists wonder  toward which end of the political scale the PDSR is actually  leaning: the right or the left? Does yesterday's reshuffle  answer that question? In my opinion, it does not. A closer  look at yesterday's changes shows that the PDSR headed by  Iliescu continues to play a double game. Some of the  replacements were intended to satisfy the left wing, such as  Niculae Spiroiu's ousting from the leadership of the defense  ministry. Other replacements were designed to please the right  wing, such as the ousting of George Ioan Danescu. One can  assume that all these changes made the object of previous  discreet consultations with the parties both on the left and the  right of our political spectrum. However, considering that  friendship does not count much in politics, one can safely  assume that what the PDSR actually wanted to achieve by this  government reshuffle is to continue to play the ball alone.  After all, it cannot be excluded that the new ministers were  appointed merely because they pass as reliable members of the  government party and supporters of Ion Iliescu. They need  reliable people if early elections are to be held, as in such  electoral processes the key ministries are those of the interior  and justice.    While in terms of the power struggle the reshuffle  represents  an important moment, in terms of the struggle to pull the  country out of the current crisis it totally lacks significance.  Trying to explain the replacements, the PDSR and Ion Iliescu  claimed that they were necessary because more competence was  required. However, it is quite clear that more competence was  needed in areas other than those in which the reshuffle  occurred. The latter, except for transportation, had been  working quite well under the leadership of their former  ministers. More competence would have been needed in the key  ministries for the promotion of reform and privatization. But  the reshuffle avoided precisely those sectors, while preferring  those that are fundamental for the PDSR's survival. This gives  us the right to assert that once more, the PDSR has placed party  interests above the general interests of the country. The  earth-shaking, epoch-making government reshuffle with which the  PDSR has been threatening us over the past month does not solve  anything.</p>

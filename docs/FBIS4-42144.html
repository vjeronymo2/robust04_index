			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A condemnation of violence and support for  political dialogue and the economic reforms launched by  President Zeroual's regime are the results of the brief visit to  Algiers by the Greek, German, and Belgian troika of European  Union foreign ministers. After he returned to Brussels last  night, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes spoke to Quentin  Dickinson:    [Begin Claes recording] It seems clear to me that if Algeria  does not receive financial and economic aid from the  international community, it will find it very difficult to  overcome two challenges simultaneously: terrorism as evolved by  the fundamentalists on the one hand; and public opinion, which  in fact is suffering financially and economically from the  consequences of the policy on structural reform. If we want to  provide a social safety net, if we want to give a concrete  signal to the people that something is starting to move and  changing in the right direction, aid has to come from abroad.  Otherwise, I really do not see how the Algerian Government can  make its program successful. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

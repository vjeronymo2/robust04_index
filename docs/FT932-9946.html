			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Wienerberger posts 30% decline WIENERBERGER, the fast growing Austrian building materials group, suffered a decline in operating profit last year - its first in more than a decade. Operating profit fell 30 per cent to Sch626m (Dollars 56.48m) mainly because a ferro alloys subsidiary fell into loss. Net profit was 42 per cent lower at Sch378m. Group sales rose 11.4 per cent to Sch11.7bn. Wienerberger shares, which have tumbled from a 1993 peak of over Sch3,500, closed down Sch8 at Sch2,865 on the Vienna bourse. In spite of the setback, the group, in which Creditanstalt-Bankverein has a controlling interest, is paying a 34 per cent dividend, an effective increase of 26 per cent because of the prior issue of share dividends. Mr Erhard Schaschl, chief executive, emphasised that the core building materials businesses continued to perform well and he forecast a profit recovery in the current year. The group's main problem stemmed from its 51 per cent owned Treibacher Chemische Werke. Treibacher, acquired in 1989, makes ferro alloys for the steel and automotive industries. The slump in demand and margins in world markets caused 'a dramatic deterioration of the results which could not be offset by rationalisation measures,' the group said. Treibacher fell from a profit of about Sch30m in 1991 to a loss of Sch169m last year. Mr Schaschl predicted it would return to profit this year. The property division also disappointed, with turnover down to Sch283m from Sch307m.</p>

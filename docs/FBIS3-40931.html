			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A briefing was held today at the Ukrainian Foreign  Ministry in Kiev. Commenting on the possibility of signing any  final document on eliminating nuclear arms on Ukrainian  territory during the talks in Moscow between the U.S., Russian,  and Ukrainian presidents -- as hastily reported by Ostankino  Television -- and on a bilateral meeting between the Ukrainian  and U.S. presidents, Yuriy Serheyev, chief of Foreign Ministry  Information Department, in particular said:    [Begin Serheyev recording] As of today, I cannot say that a  final document has already been drafted; I cannot say what form  this document will take. That is why the scheduled tripartite  conference in Moscow may have any form. If the final [draft] of  the document is not completed, the Moscow conference is likely  to be of consultative nature and aimed at coordinating aspects  which still need to be coordinated. If the Moscow meeting  manages to resolve uncoordinated issues, the document should  take some form. I want to draw your attention to [word  indistinct] commentaries, or I would rather say biased  commentaries regarding the translation of Mr. Gore's statement  which can be interpreted as an agreement or a treaty. As you  see, at this stage, it is better to speak about a document  rather than agreement or treaty.    [Serheyev continues] Discussions over the form and essence  of this document are still continuing, in Ukraine's governing  circles as well. I want to stress that the Moscow summit will  be preceded by a short meeting in Kiev. The possibility and  likeliness of such a meeting were discussed very thoroughly  through diplomatic channels. I also want to point out that as  stated in yesterday's declaration by the Council of Ministers'  and presidential press service, the main theme of the meeting  will be the discussion of a wide range of issues concerning  bilateral relations. This is very essential. Moreover, this  statement is not unilateral; it was coordinated. There is a  mutual desire on both sides to discuss bilateral relations at  this meeting. This is not a bad example and not a bad result  demonstrating that prospects are opening for a more constructive  dialogue and more constructive relations with the United States  in the spheres discussed in the course of Mr. Christopher's  visit to Kiev. In particular [we should] balance our relations,  direct them into the stream of military-political cooperation,  and in the first place, economic cooperation. This visit once  again emphasizes the attention paid Ukraine and importance of  developing bilateral relations with her. Naturally, in the  course of the [Kiev] meeting, issues tackled in Brussels and  those to be tackled in Moscow will be discussed. [end recording]</p>

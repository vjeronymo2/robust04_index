			<p>930312 FT  12 MAR 93 / Suharto's deputy elected GENERAL Try Sutrisno was elected vice-president of Indonesia yesterday by the People's Consultative Assembly, writes William Keeling in Jakarta. General Sutrisno, who retired as head of the armed forces last month, was the only candidate, just as President Suharto had been a day earlier when elected for his sixth five-year term of office. The general now becomes the favourite candidate to succeed 71-year-old Mr Suharto. Gen Sutrisno could provide a counter-balance to Mr Suharto. Diplomats say relations between the two men cooled following a massacre by soldiers in 1991 of civilians attending the funeral of a pro-separatist activist in the disputed territory of East Timor. Gen Sutrisno vociferously defended the military's actions.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Roche registers sales increase and sees higher profit Roche, one of the big three Swiss pharmaceutical groups, recorded an 11 per cent increase in consolidated 1993 sales to SFr14.3bn (Dollars 9.7bn), following a 13 per cent rise in 1992. It said all divisions contributed to the sales increase. The Basle-based group, which normally provides a full financial report in April, indicated it achieved 'a significant increase' in group profit. In 1992, consolidated net income rose 29 per cent to SFr1.9bn. Roche said operating profit last year was boosted by 'a better utilisation of production capacity and consistent management of costs'. The significant increase in net income was also due to 'another healthy result in the non-operating sector'. The group says that it has been only marginally affected by government pressure on drug prices in many countries. In Italy, the most recent European country to act in this area, Roche said it achieved real growth in sales last year, although the devaluation of the lire hurt the Swiss franc result. Investors have showed great confidence in the group, bidding up its non-voting shares 51 per cent last year after a 60 per cent rise the previous year. Its current market capitalisation of about SFr61bn makes it the world's most highly valued pharmaceutical group. The group had liquid reserves of more than SFr12bn at the end of 1992. The pharmaceutical division, which accounts for more than half of total sales, reported a 13 per cent rise in revenue to SFr7.8bn. The leading drugs (Rocephin, an anti-infection treatment, Dormicum-Versed, a mild anaesthetic, Roaccutane for treating severe acne, Furtulon for treating solid tumours and Roferon-A for cancer and anti-viral therapy) continued to record volume increases. Sales of the self-medication business, Roche Consumer Health, surpassed SFr1bn. Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals advanced 7 per cent to SFr3.3bn, due to strong demand for vitamin E, beta-carotene and the feed additive Astaxanthin. The diagnostics division reported a 10 per cent rise in revenues to SFr1.7bn, while revenues of the flavours and fragrances division were up 8 per cent to SFr1.4bn.</p>

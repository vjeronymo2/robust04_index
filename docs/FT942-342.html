			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Corning shares jump as sales soar Shares in Corning jumped by more than 6 per cent as the US manufacturing group beat market expectations with strong sales growth in its second quarter. Corning lifted post-tax profits to Dollars 111.4m, or 54 cents a share, compared with Dollars 89.8m, or 47 cents a share, in the same period in 1993. Revenues in the three months to June 19 were Dollars 1.1bn, up 22 per cent from a year before - though around half of the growth stemmed from the acquisition last year of Damon, a medical testing company. The rest was due to the stronger US economy, which had a positive impact on all the company's main businesses, Mr James Houghton, chairman, said. Corning also benefited from stronger earnings in associated companies, primarily Dow Corning. This, and the elimination of losses with the disposal last year of its interest in Vitro Corning, led to reported income of Dollars 34m from associates, up from Dollars 27m a year before. For the first half, Corning's net income rose to Dollars 169m, or 82 cents a share, from Dollars 139m, or 73 cents, a year before. Its shares closed at Dollars 33 1/8, up Dollars 1 7/8 on the day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Bataercang (1572 1044 1422 0221) and Lu </F> Guodong (0712 0948 2767)]    [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- Mongolian President  Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat cordially met at the State Palace on the  afternoon of 29 April with Chinese Premier Li Peng, who is  currently on a visit to Mongolia.    During the meeting, the two leaders joyfully recalled their  meeting in Beijing in 1990. Li Peng conveyed President Jiang  Zemin's cordial regards to President Orchirbat and his  invitation to President Orchirbat to visit China. Li Peng said:  China and Mongolia are neighbors and therefore should maintain  friendly relations. Over the last few years, many changes have  taken place in both countries. China is developing a socialist  market economy and we fully respect the development path  Mongolia has chosen. Today we will sign a treaty on  Sino-Mongolian friendly and cooperative relations. This is an  event of great significance in the history of Sino-Mongolian  relations. China is willing to maintain friendly and neighborly  relations with all its neighbors, including Mongolia.    Orchirbat said: There are no unresolved issues of principle  between Mongolia and China. As for some minor problems, the two  countries can resolve them in a friendly manner on the principle  of mutual respect. He added: "We attach great importance to  Premier Li Peng's visit to Mongolia. The visit is a  continuation of the increase of contacts between the leaders of  the two countries, and has great significance for the  development of Mongolian-Chinese relations. It is especially  significant that a treaty on Sino-Mongolian friendly and  cooperative relations will be signed during your visit. The  treaty will not only reflect the relationship that has existed  between China and Mongolia, but also will lay a legal foundation  for the relationship between the two countries in the next  century. I am satisfied with the continuing development of  Sino-Mongolian relations and hope these relations will continue  to develop -- this is also the wish of the Mongolian people."    Orchirbat said: The Mongolian Government and people  congratulate China for the achievements it has made in carrying  out reform and opening up and in improving the Chinese people's  living standards. Mongolia supports China's foreign policy,  especially its advocation to build a new international political  and economic order. China exerts important influence on world  affairs; therefore, China's foreign policy has great  significance for preserving regional and world peace and  stability. Developing Mongolian-Chinese and Mongolian-Russian  relations is the primary task of Mongolia's foreign policy; so,  we are glad to see that Mongolia has maintained friendly  relations with these two great neighbors.    Orchirbat said President Jiang Zemin, in his letter to him,  sets forth the principle for developing relations between China  and Mongolia. He asked Premier Li Peng to convey his good  wishes for President Jiang Zemin and hoped President Jiang will  have an opportunity to visit Mongolia.    Li Peng said: The Chinese Goverment supports the Mongolian  Government's foreign policy of safeguarding regional security  and peace, and thanks the Mongolian Government for its support  for China's independent foreign policy of peace. He stressed:  China respects all countries' independence and their choice of  political and economic systems. China hopes Mongolia will  develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries,  including Russia. We are willing to see that all countries get  along friendly. Li Peng said he believed relations in the  political, economic, and other fields between China and Mongolia  will definitely further develop.</p>

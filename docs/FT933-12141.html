			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ammunition against red tape Sir, You expressed dissatisfaction at the limited results from the Government's Review of the Implementation and Enforcement of EC Law in the UK ('Red tape', July 21). At first reading, the scrutiny report appears to be a bit of a whitewash. But on closer reading the document is pretty damning of the way in which the UK approaches both negotiation and implementation of EC law. In particular, the report concludes that UK implementation of legislation does tend to go beyond the requirements of EC directives; that this amounts to a more burdensome regime for UK business which is potentially damaging to the UK's competitive position. Also identified is a weakness in the UK approach whereby negotiation and implementation are seen as separate processes. In consequence, implementation difficulties are not anticipated sufficiently to influence the negotiating process. Particularly damning is the report's case study into the Home Office's proposals for new fire safety regulations. These were wrongly claimed to be consequent upon a non-existent EC fire safety directive and would have imposed major new burdens on British business. The report recommends that 'the Home Office Fire Department should reconsider its current plans to bring forward revised regulations'. There is plenty of ammunition in the report for those who wish to continue the campaign against unnecessary regulation in the UK.

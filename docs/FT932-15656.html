			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Income lure in new bond GUARANTEED equity bonds have offered little so far to investors who want income. Now Acuma, the financial planning arm of American Express, has devised a new product to meet that gap - the Fixed High Income bond. The key to this offer is that Acuma has chopped up the income and capital elements in a new way. After five years, basic-rate taxpayers are assured of a minimum capital return which, in addition to the income received, gives them back their original investment. That is the same guarantee as on a conventional GEB - the return is just offered in a different way. Getting only your money back after five years is not much of a deal - the capital will have declined in value in real terms and you will have missed the interest you could have earned in the building society. What is needed to make the bond worthwhile is a rise in the stock market: the capital repayment level is linked to the FT-SE 100 index. But investors need to know what they are doing when they buy this bond. Three levels of income are offered - 10, 9 and 7.5 per cent (these are paid net of basic rate tax; higher rate taxpayers may face an extra charge). The higher the level of income you choose, the more the FT-SE 100 will have to grow to repay your capital in full, as well as earning the income. An example might help. If you invest Pounds 10,000 (the minimum is Pounds 5,000) and opt for 10 per cent income, you will get Pounds 1,000 a year in income for five years, or Pounds 5,000 in all. If the FT-SE 100 does not rise at all over the next five years, or falls, you will receive Pounds 5,000 of capital back in 1998 to take you back to your original Pounds 10,000. The FT-SE 100 would need to rise 10 per cent a year in order for you to get back all your capital plus the income on top (so your overall gain would be 50 per cent). If you opt for the 9 per cent income, return of capital depends on 8 per cent growth in the Footsie; at 7.5 per cent income, the Footsie needs to rise at only 4 per cent a year. These are not overly demanding rates of return - in the five years to end December 1992, the index rose by 10.7 per cent a year. But you would not get more than your original capital returned. And, as with other GEBs, you do not benefit from the yield on the Footsie. All this makes it a difficult product to assess. It is an odd hybrid of equities and cash. Even a 7.5 per cent income is highly attractive at present interest rates, and it would be reasonable to expect the 4 per cent annual rise in the Footsie needed to get your money back. But if the market climbs substantially, you would do better to buy most conventional GEBs - and even better to buy an indexed unit trust, such as Gartmore's. And if the market falls, you will be better off in the building society. The lure of the income offered could attract many investors to Acuma, but they should be aware of the risks.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA COLLEGE PLANS $17-MILLION, 3-STORY LIBRARY  </P> <P> Pasadena City College will build a $17-million, three-story library to replace  a smaller, aging facility that dates from the 1950s, the school's president has  announced.  </P> <P> Ground breaking for the 90,000-square-foot building is set for mid-1990, and  the new library is expected to open in 1992 at the southwest corner of Colorado  Boulevard and Bonnie Avenue.  </P> <P> It will be built with $15 million in funds provided by the state and $2 million  that the college hopes to raise from alumni groups and charitable  organizations.  </P> <P> School officials say the present facility, built in 1950 to serve 5,000  students, lacks the space and books to serve today's student body of 25,000.  </P> <P> Gruen Associates of Los Angeles will design and build the library. The firm's  architects have extensive experience in campus-related architecture: They built  Claremont Colleges' Central Library, designed master plans for an addition to  the central library at U.C. San Diego and the Miami University Art Museum and  Cultural Center.  </P></p>

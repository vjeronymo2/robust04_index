			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Mr Carr goes to Whitehall: An industrialist's secondment to the DTI MR JOE CARR is convinced that some of his colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry regard him as 'a complete pain'. Civil servants, he says, are usually pretty inhibited when it comes to 'crossing borders, questioning fundamental wisdoms or challenging their boss'. Given that such traits come more easily to him, it is perhaps as well that his career prospects will not be decided by powers within the DTI. Mr Carr's air of independent detachment is understandable, bearing in mind his imminent departure from the department after an 18-month secondment from TI, the specialist engineering group. His temporary relocation in London from TI headquarters in Oxfordshire - having changed places with the DTI's Mr Chris Jackson - forms part of the department's strategy for developing a new partnership between industry and Whitehall. Mr Carr, who was TI's commercial director before arriving at the DTI, has been one of a five-strong team of private-sector high-fliers attached to the department's innovation unit. His relatively easy access to ministers will not have endeared him to some of those who rarely see, never mind win the ear, of the DTI top brass. His unit's aim is to promote the need for innovation in business as a key element in improving UK competitiveness. Mr Carr has been a busy emissary, spending three days a week out spreading the message around the business and academic communities. After nearly 20 years and a 'very narrow career experience' in the same company, he was anxious to widen his horizons and jumped at the chance to enlist at the DTI. He insists that, in spite of the frustrations he has encountered in the department and the closed minds of some of those with whom he has had to deal, the experience has been valuable and a lot of fun. He stresses his admiration for the professional skills of the civil servants with whom he has worked: 'They have excellent brains and are extremely literate. Businessmen are consumed by data, relying on numbers and diagrams. Civil servants are the masters of language and, contrary to what some cynics might say, dedicated to the public interest.' Mr Carr has criticisms, too. 'The trouble is that most of them have very little alternative experience. The result is that they try and resolve issues by polling everyone's ideas, averaging them out and making a decision. Your view is not necessarily recognised, even if you have specific expertise. That cannot be the best way to proceed.' He believes that, in spite of the DTI's new mission to help UK industry successfully compete in a tough world, many officials still believe they can bring about change only 'by legislation and regula-tion or by spending money'. The DTI, he stresses, offers an 'enormous menu' of responsibilities and broad scope to influence events. In his time there his projects have included preparing a report on the role of venture capitalists in financing innovation, a joint venture with the Confederation of British Industry to devise a code of best practice for innovation, and an initiative to improve dialogue between the City and the engineering industries. Mr Carr has considerable sympathy for his temporary colleagues. The DTI's big problem, he says, has been a lack of credibility which has prevented it from doing its job properly. 'It is inevitable for a department which had so many bosses in so short a time,' he says. 'Under Mrs Thatcher it had no intellectual raison d'etre. 'It was given a hard time by the companies it tried to talk to, so it became inward looking, afraid of the outside world.' The result has been an unrealised potential and a worrying level of performance. Yet he accepts that the DTI is beginning to fulfil its potential to help stimulate successful industry. He says: 'People are beginning to realise that the dialogue with industry should not just be about crisis but about what is good in business and how it can be encouraged.' He says he has been helped from 'going native' and accepting the traditional DTI approach to life by the presence of his four fellow secondees. 'We have been able to regularly ask ourselves whether it is 'us or them' who are right or wrong,' he says. 'That way you can collectively press for change, rather than accept conventional attitudes.' Therein, according to Mr Carr, lies another problem for civil servants. 'Your work goes into the system and it is very hard for most DTI people to establish whether their efforts have any real impact,' he says. 'How do you ever know if you are, in some small way, helping the wealth-creation process? You are left in no doubt about that at TI.' So what benefits has the exercise brought for the DTI and for Mr Carr's employer? He believes that he has brought some added value to the department's operations. He has been able to achieve a quality and range of dialogue with parts of industry which would have been hard for department officials. He has also been able to ask in-depth questions born of his detailed industrial knowledge. 'I think most people have been persuaded that we have made a difference,' he says. As for TI, he says: 'If I ask whether my company's shareholders will benefit from my experience, the answer must be yes. A better understanding of the broader issues must, inevitably, help TI. And I've made some wonderful contacts.'</p>

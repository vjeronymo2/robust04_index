			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGMENTS ON THE KCBS 'OFFICE ROMANCE'  </P> <P> What a delightful article. It serves to remind me that love is still "a  many-splendored thing."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, there always seem to be some negative overtones from a few when  happiness abounds.  </P> <P> If these few find that Bree's and Jim's decorum doesn't meet their standards,  nobody's stopping them from changing channels.  </P> <P> I agree with Robert Hyland that one's personal life should be respected. We who  hold positions in the professional arena hold these positions because we do the  job that is expected of us. As long as Jim and Bree continue to do their jobs,  it's none of the business of KCBS or their co-workers or the public whether  they love or touch each other or not.  </P> <P> I think they are two happy people and it shows. What a refreshing lift for the  news.  </P> <P> DOROTHY J. SMITH, Compton  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Kutakhov] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 20 Jun -- The number of visits paid by U.S.  nuclear submarines to ports on the west coast of Japan has  increased during the last 12 months. Japanese naval sources  quoted by KYODO news agency today believe that this is connected  with the increased tension over the DPRK's nuclear program and  the belief that Pyongyang is striving to create its own nuclear  weapons.    The reason for the increased activity of U.S. nuclear  submarines is the intensification of the U.S. Navy's  intelligence operations around North Korea. The nuclear  submarines are cruising along the DPRK coastline, picking up  information about the communications networks of the North  Korean armed forces and intercepting all kinds of radio messages.    The largest number of visits were to the U.S. naval base of  White Beach on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Submarines  called there 17 times. Moreover, U.S. nuclear submarines were  also frequent "guests" at the docks of Sasebo (Nagasaki  Prefecture) and Yokosuka (Kanagawa Prefecture) naval bases.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / A burst of light for banks in Nordic gloom: The rise of a sector Judging by the extraordinary rise in Nordic banking shares this year, the market has decided the sector's financial crisis is over. Euphoria based on the belief that Nordic banks are firmly on the road to recovery has lifted shares from the lows to which they sank last year. Bank shares have risen 270 per cent in Sweden, 185 per cent in Finland and 165 per cent in Norway. Much of the buying has had a speculative flavour, yet recent developments have borne out the speculators' most fervent hopes. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the region's largest commercial bank, withdrew its request for state support this week after a return to profit in the second quarter and a SKr5.3bn (Pounds 440m) rights issue. Yesterday Unitas, the Finnish banking group, said it too was launching a rights issue on the back of improved performance. Norway's two biggest banks, Den norske Bank (DnB) and Christiania Bank, reported a return to profit in the first half, with DnB saying it will not need a NKr600m (Pounds 55m) state guarantee. The optimism has sprung from a dramatic improvement in earnings, rather than from a drying up of the credit losses - or debt write-offs - which have ravaged the sector. SE Banken's figures demonstrate this: its operating income before loan losses was up 58 per cent in the first half at SKr4.85bn. The most important factor has been interest rates which now lie at their lowest levels for at least 10 years in all three countries. This has enabled the banks to widen their margins, boosting net interest income. It has also prompted rallies in bond and share markets, enhancing the trading contribution. Banks have helped themselves by restructuring. DnB, for example, claims to have cut costs by 40 per cent over five years, leading its president Mr Finn Hvistendahl to claim this week that he knew of 'no other large bank which can point to similar cost effectiveness'. One worry is that some of the gains reported in the first half will prove to be of a one-off nature. This applies particularly to share, bond and foreign exchange income. But a bigger cause of concern is the high level of credit losses. Even though lower interest rates should reduce the bruden on customers, most banks are being extremely cautious about predicting anything more than a modest drop in loan losses in 1993. SE Banken, for instance, has warned that credit losses this year could reach SKr11bn, only slightly less than last year's SKr11.2bn. Its non-performing loan portfolio, though declining, still amounts to SKr22.5bn, or 7.4 per cent of total lending. Even the two big Norwegian banks, the first in the region to enter crisis, reported largely unchanged credit loss levels at the half-way stage. DnB actually saw a slight increase in non-performing loans. In Finland, where the structural economic problems are greater than in either Sweden or Norway, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's leading commercial bank, and Unitas expect to cut their losses this year. At KOP, credit losses increased to FM933m (Pounds 107m) in the first four months, against FM728m, and non-performing loans grew to FM8.2bn from FM7.1bn at the end of 1992. 'The worst is past in the Finnish banking sector but the crisis is not yet over,' says Mr Roar Nilson, chief financial analyst with Arctos Securities in Helsinki. 'Credit losses in the public sector, among personal customers and in domestically orientated companies can be expected to increase.' Most analysts believe the picture will start to change next year. In any banking recovery, there is always a time lag before non-performing loans begin to fall sharply and their conversion into bad debts tapers off. Hence some of the region's banks may not be back in profit until 1996. And nervousness persists about the pace of economic recovery, although less so in oil-rich Norway than in either Sweden or Finland. But even those two are beginning to see the first signs of an export-led recovery and both should see at least a slight expansion of their economies next year, ending three consecutive years of decline. Governments are growing confident that the final bill for bailing out their financial systems will be less than they originally feared. Indeed, in Norway, the belief that the country's six-year banking crisis is nearly over has encouraged the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund to consider accelerating privatisation plans for DnB and Christiania Bank. Sweden also has plans to return Gota Bank and Nordbanken to the private sector. The key, though, to the privatisation of banks in the Nordic area will be evidence of sustained profitability. That, for all the euphoria of recent days, has still to be demonstrated.

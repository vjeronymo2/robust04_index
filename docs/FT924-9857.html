			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Management: Battle to rebuild family store - In the second of two articles on BhS, John Thornhill looks at the widespread purge of staff that underpinned the restructuring of the UK retail group In January 1990, a group of 15 senior managers from BhS apprehensively assembled in a hotel in Newbury to discuss the future prospects for the ailing UK retailing group. The mood was subdued, tense and heavy with anticipation. The company's trading background had sharply worsened over the past few weeks as the recession had begun to intensify. The arrival of an enigmatic American chief executive two months previously had excited a flurry of speculation. And a frightful gale, which buffeted the hotel, knocking out its electricity supply, heightened the sense of crisis as the group huddled around an open fire to review the company's performance. 'We just sat around that fire and talked and talked and talked for three days. We discovered very few strengths and lots of weaknesses,' recalls one participant. BhS's past mistakes were dispassionately dissected. Its competitive position was analysed and a forthright management consultant's report was kicked around in a free-for-all discussion. Out of the talk was born a simple 52-word mission statement that was to serve as a blueprint for a series of whirlwind changes that were to transform the group over the next two years. 'The BhS mission is to be the first choice store for dressing the modern woman and family. We are committed to service, quality, harmony, innovation and excitement in all that we do. We will succeed by being a focused organisation in dynamic partnership with our customers, suppliers and each one of us,' the statement ran. When the new chief executive, David Dworkin, joined the company he knew he had to act fast to reverse the sense of drift. 'We had to superimpose some vision on the business very quickly. We also had to streamline it. There was too much noise and too many layers,' he says. Dworkin says the company was a staid, male-dominated hierarchy where head office staff only met the directors when they were invited to do so. At lunch time staff were strictly segregated into different dining rooms. BhS's head office contained 1,041 people while similar-sized retailers had half that number. Dworkin promised a refreshing new informality. BhS staff still recall the shock of attending meetings when Dworkin strolled in wearing a T-shirt, cycling shorts and bare feet, eating a pot of yoghurt. To simplify and focus the structure of the business, Dworkin launched a twin-track attack to effect change: first, by taking out several management layers, reducing costs by Pounds 10m; and second, by introducing incentives for the talent remaining in the business and recruiting fresh thinkers from outside. People were to become the company's greatest source of competitive advantage. In all, 900 head office and store managers were dismissed, including 10 of the 15 managers who attended the Newbury meeting. About half the 130 store managers were replaced, along with 60 per cent of buyers and merchandisers, and all but two of the 20 most senior line managers. The main criterion for deciding whether to retain people came from their perceived flexibility to accept change. Dworkin says he was looking for 'a sensitivity and a sense of looking at the world anew. We needed an openness and a religious commitment to the view that things could be done better'. Dworkin says some mistakes were undoubtedly made but is unrepentant at the scale of the purge. 'I would argue that it did not destroy morale. It might have made a lot of people unhappy but my role is not to be sensitive to that, but to be sensitive to shareholders and give them a productive team. The new team now has extremely high morale,' he argues. Given the staggering turnover of staff, it is a wonder to an outsider how the company continued to function at all. Yet while this 'creative destruction' was being implemented, a simultaneous thrust allowing new ideas and people to emerge was also appearing. An action programme, headed by Steve Bedford, the human resources director, known as Activity Value Analysis (AVA) was launched to scrutinise and improve every group activity. Bedford tirelessly explained the company's mission statement to managers at a series of seminars and they, in turn, discussed with their staff how it could be achieved. Twelve individual 'change agents' took a prominent role in stimulating this participative process. 'We put these people together from different levels and different functions to be the leaders of change. They trained and energised everyone else. We received more than 5,000 ideas on how to improve the business,' says Bedford. As a result, old ways of running the business were updated. New performance targets were devised and successful staff were given bonus payments. This change process cascaded through the company embracing every function and department. At the store level, layers of back office managers were stripped out and the proportion of staff on the sales floor increased from 60 per cent to 80 per cent. As one example, Mark Bowland, store manager at the BhS store in the Metro Centre in Gateshead, says he cut the number of managers from 23 to 11. But the obverse side of this painful process was that it devolved greater responsibility both to the remaining managers and increasingly to the shop floor associates, who were encouraged to exercise greater individual initiative. The whole process attempted to tilt the management effort towards supporting ideas from the front-line staff. 'At the end of the day we are the people who take the money,' says Bowland. This 'unfreezing' process was accompanied by extensive training programmes. Shop floor staff, including part-timers, were encouraged to take the retail exams for the National Council of Vocational Qualifications. For the first time, BhS devoted more of its training budget to its 15,000 shop associates than to its head office staff. 'I think the greatest respect you can pay to anybody is to want to invest in them,' says Bedford. But training also yielded cost benefits by reducing substantially the high levels of staff turnover. It also meant that sales associates could increasingly assume the functions of junior managers. Yet in spite of all these improvements, it is arguable that BhS has, as yet, only won the easy victories. The dramatic gestures and changes have been made. Now comes the infinitely harder process of establishing a 'learning organisation' whereby continuous daily improvements can be made. The company has also to avoid the danger simply of introducing a new orthodoxy that will itself ossify. 'Because we challenged every aspect of what we did, we made people think that everything we did in the past was wrong and everything we were going to do in the future was right. We have to overcome that attitude,' says Helena Packshaw, marketing director. Although sales per square foot are beginning to show impressive improvements they are coming from a low base and still lag a long way behind BhS's main rivals. Based on estimates from Verdict, the retail consultants, BhS's sales per square foot were less than one third of the Pounds 536 that Marks and Spencer achieved last year. Some staff say morale is still fragile as a result of the massive personnel upheaval. One insider at BhS, who does not wish to be named, says: 'The company is still run by fear. There was a lot of flab in BhS that had to be cut out but people are still afraid for their jobs. It is not a nice atmosphere.' Some observers suggest the impetus of change may dissipate now that Dworkin is helping to push through similar changes at Mothercare, after becoming chief executive of Storehouse, the parent of both companies, in July. The doubts remain but Dworkin, at least, is convinced that the company has pushed the reforms far enough to ensure they are sustained. 'Change is a mind-set,' he says.

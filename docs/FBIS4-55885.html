			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jerzy Krajewski: "To Unite Forces, To Confront </F> Western Banks"]    [Text]Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, chairwoman of the  National Bank of Poland [NBP], is in favor of big banks merging  into even bigger structures which would be able to compete with  Western banks in the future. She does not anticipate any  private bank going bankrupt this year. She approves of the idea  of allowing shares by all state-owned banks into public  circulation soon.    During a session of the "Club 500" attached to the editorial  board of ZYCIE GOSPODARCZE yesterday, NBP Chairwoman Hanna  Gronkiewicz-Waltz spoke in favor of a consolidation of the  Polish banking system: "The point is not just about merging  small private banks threatened by bankruptcies, with big ones,  but also about mergers among big, state-owned banks, so that in  a few years' time, when Poland joins the European Union, we have  three to four large structures able to compete with huge Western  banks" -- she explained. When Andrzej Topinski, chairman of  General Savings Bank- National Bank noted that there are no  incentives for such a consolidation, the NBP chairwoman replied:  "Mergers among large, state-owned banks should be promoted by  the Finance Ministry which exercises ownership supervision over  them." According to Gronkiewicz-Waltz, privatization of the  banks should take place with the participation of foreign  strategic investors who contribute modern management techniques  and technologies.  <H5>  Bankruptcies Not Very Likely </H5>   According to the NBP chief, one of the reasons for the  difficult situation of the banking system, was an overly liberal  policy of granting licenses to banks in the 1990-91 period.  Over 60 new banks were established then but they are weak from  a capital standpoint. Scandals involving some of them undermined  customer confidence in all banks. That is why, over the last  two years, licenses to open up new banks were granted at a  slower pace and with more deliberation. Five banks received  their licenses in 1992, while in 1993, it was just the Polish  Investment Bank (which arose out of the remnants of NBP's  commercial part). The criteria for granting concessions were  also tightened up.    The NBP chair does not anticipate a bankruptcy by any  private  bank in the immediate future, even though she does not rule out  such a possibility. NBP intends to spend 3 trillion zlotys this  year for a program of bringing private banks back to health.  This should be compared with $6 billion (over 130 trillion  zlotys) which was spent on saving the banking system in Sweden  in the 1990s. Gronkiewicz- Waltz was trying to convince the  banks to display a greater solidarity: "When privately-owned  banks in some region have troubles, this means a decrease of  confidence also toward state- owned banks, while generally  speaking, this also causes a decreased willingness to save  money" -- she said.  <H5>  More Openness </H5>   Boguslaw Kott, chairman of the Bank of Economic Initiatives,  proposed that state-owned banks implement a procedure soon to  allow their shares into public circulation. The main purpose of  such an operation now, would not be the introduction of the  shares onto the stock market, but to better inform the public  about the banks' financial situation. Wojciech Kwasniak, NBP's  representative in the Securities Commission, promised to support  the idea.</p>

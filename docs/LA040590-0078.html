			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TURKEY FRANKS WITH FLAVOR OF THE SOUTHWEST  </P> <P> Instead of a beef frankfurter use turkey for lower fat content. And instead of  using the usual bun, update it with a Southwestern flavor.  </P> <P> Wrap the frankfurter in a flour tortilla. Skip the mustard and relish and use  shredded cheese, green onions and a zesty salsa.  </P> <P> Turkey frankfurters can be wrapped in cheese slices, such as Swiss, Jack or  Cheddar, place in frankfurter buns and heated in a microwave.  </P> <P> For a turkey frankfurter casserole, layer the bottom of a casserole with beans  and top with frankfurters and garnish each with slices of cheese. Bake until  heated through and cheese is bubbly.  </P> <P> For appetizers, cut frankfurters in halves and spear rounded ends on bamboo  sticks. Dip in French dressing mixed with mustard and bake until heated  through.  </P> <P> TURKEY FRANKFURTER ROLL-UPS  </P> <P> 4 turkey frankfurters  </P> <P> 4 flour tortillas  </P> <P> 1 cup shredded Cheddar or Jack cheese  </P> <P> 3 green onions, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 cup salsa, mild or hot  </P> <P> Place 1 turkey frankfurter in center of each tortilla. Top each with 1/4 of  cheese, green onions and salsa. Roll up. Place seam side down on  microwave-proof platter. Microwave 1 minute on HIGH. Makes 4 servings.  </P></p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Warning on performance of pooled pension funds TOP performance by managers of pooled pension funds cannot be maintained over a long period, according to a survey which raises questions about the basis upon which such managers are selected. Trustees of pension schemes and consultants frequently use past performance as a guide to future returns. But Hymans Robertson, the firm of consulting actuaries, attempted to find fund managers who had produced top-quartile returns for each of three three-year periods between the years 1983 and 1991. 'No managers met this criteria,' it says in its 1992 pooled pension fund survey. Several managers were able to produce consistently above-average returns for the whole period, but none could maintain a ranking in the top 25 per cent of performers for any length of time. Henderson Administration and Newton Investment Management were in the top quartile in two of the three-year periods and had the most consistently good investment performance. Two managers, Crown Life and Provident Mutual, after achieving top returns between 1983 and 1988, fell into the bottom quartile in the 1989-91 period, while two others, Britannia Life and London and Manchester, ranked in the top quartile between 1986 and 1991 but neither fund was available in the 1983-85 period. The survey also found that segregated pension funds  - fund managed as discreet entities  - tend to out-perform pooled funds run by the same manager, in spite of the conventional wisdom that economies of scale allow pooled funds to outperform. In attempting to explain the divergence, Hymans Robertson said that fees automatically deducted from clients in pooled funds may affect returns and that the property exposure of pooled funds may also have undermined performance.</p>

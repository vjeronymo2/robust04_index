			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Sanctions threat to China over missiles THE Clinton administration, which two months ago renewed favourable trade benefits for China, has threatened to impose economic sanctions on Beijing if it ships missiles to Pakistan in defiance of an international agreement, Agencies report from Washington. The issue - following strong evidence that China is shipping M-11 missile technology to Pakistan - will be raised by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, when he meets his Chinese counterpart, Mr Qian Qichen, on Sunday in Singapore. Ms Lynn Davis, undersecretary of state and the Clinton administration's chief arms negotiator, will also discuss the matter in Beijing. The 'effect of applicable US law would be made clear to China and that includes the likelihood of sanctions under certain circumstances,' a State Department spokesman said. He added that sanctions would be imposed once it was determined that 'certain transshipments of items have occurred, and to my knowledge we have not determined that'. The US has been concerned about China's M-11 missile sales to Pakistan for several years, arguing they violate the missile technology control regime designed to stem the spread of ballistic missiles. China has said it supplied short-range missiles to Pakistan without exceeding MTCR.</p>

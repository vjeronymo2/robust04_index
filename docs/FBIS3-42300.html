The cab  belongs to a resident of the village of Yoshivya near the town  of Netivot named Ellan Sudri, aged 23 years.    Blood stains were seen on the interior and exterior of the  cab. Several hoses were also found inside the car. The blood  stains were sent to the laboratory for tests. Inside the car,  signs of resistance were also detected. Police, Border Guard,  and Israeli Defense Force units hastened to the site of the  incident. They have started large-scale combing operations,  using helicopters.    This driver disappeared at approximately 2100 yesterday,  when  he informed his station by radio that he was returning home.  However, he failed to make the return trip home. The police  began an investigation into the circumstances surrounding his  disappearance. The police fear this driver was killed by  terrorists. A leaflet sent to a foreign news agency signed by  the so-called Islamic Jihad stated that a border guard policeman  had been kidnapped and killed. The leaflet included a photograph  of the driver's identity card, and a photograph of a policeman's  identity card belonging to the same driver. This driver has  been demobilized from the Border Guards Corps.    Police Minister Moshe Shahal has said all security agencies  are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the  disappearance of this driver. He indicated that search  operations are currently under way for this driver, adding that  the police are collecting intelligence data on the issue.    In a separate development, the body of a 70-year-old man has  been found near the cooperative village of Nein in the Rehovot  area. The Coastal Plain police have begun investigations into  the incident. They arrested many residents of the area belonging  to minority groups. This person is believed to have been killed  by terrorists.</p>

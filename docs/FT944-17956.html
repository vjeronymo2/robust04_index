			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Manila Dollars 675m first-half surplus: Increase of 54% over year ago The Philippines' overall balance-of-payments ended the first half of this year with a surplus of Dollars 675m, an increase of 54 per cent over a year ago, data released by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the country's central monetary authority, shows. The favourable balance resulted mainly from a big increase in foreign investment inflows (up 82 per cent to Dollars 2.59bn) and a sharp fall in net short-term capital outflows (down 68 per cent to Dollars 165m). This helped offset a rise in the merchandise trade deficit (up 42 per cent to Dollars 4.06bn), the central bank data said. The current account ended the six months with a deficit of Dollars 1.62bn, higher by 38 per cent from the year before, because of the increased trade shortfall. Merchandise exports came to Dollars 6.07bn (Dollars 5.18bn the year before) while imports reached Dollars 10.14bn (Dollars 8.05bn). Non-merchandise receipts amounted to Dollars 524m while payments totalled Dollars 57m. The increased flow of foreign investments combined with a net inflow of medium- and long-term loans of Dollars 674m to boost the non-monetary capital account to Dollars 2.1bn, the central bank said. Philippine economic officials believe the big growth in imports, which has led to the record trade deficits, has been brought about by acquisitions of electric-power equipment and manufacturing machinery. Finance officials said the gap may be expected to narrow with the end to the power supply shortage in the country recently. Communist rebels killed eight of their comrades to stop them surrendering to the military in the southern Philippines, the state-run Philippines News Agency said yesterday, AP reports from Manila. New People's Army rebels ambushed their comrades in Siay, Zamboanga del Sur Province, 490 miles south of Manila. The government has initiated an amnesty, and pledged livelihood for those surrendering.</p>

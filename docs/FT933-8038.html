			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Management: Seven routes to the top of the tree - Hard work, motivation and a certain something can lead to business success Success stories of business superstars are certainly as interesting and improbable as the biographies of minor European monarchs or film stars. Many tycoons can tell the 'teaboy-to-managing director' fable of how they made it from humble beginnings to multi-million dollar moguls. Many of these tales are of an occasionally moving, roller-coaster ride through early success, false starts and repeated failure, with the only comparison on this lonely journey being a consistent motivation to succeed. But by definition, these auto-hagiographies are the enviable stories of success. How people become rich is the stuff of dreams; the hope of every lottery ticket buyer and the fantasy of every gambler. Most people have imagined what they would do if they won the pools. However, no self-made billionaires are such idle time wasters. They have all worked hard, for long periods to find those extremely elusive secrets of success that lead to mega-riches. They are proponents of the adage that 'success' comes before 'work' only in the dictionary. The so-called secrets are of course often well known. People who have studied the histories of business achievement have documented various possible routes to the same end - that sweet, distinctive smell of success. A careful examination of the main pathways to company growth has revealed how relatively few they are in number. Case studies have shown for instance that the success of companies such as Walt Disney, Benetton, Korean Airlines, Federal Express, Hilton Hotels, Gucci and the Mandarin Hotel group were each achieved via different pathways. Business School researchers such as Simon Tam, at Hong Kong University Business School have argued there are only really seven distinct routes to significant business success. All hyper-growth firms surveyed appear to fit into one or other of these categories. All companies following one pathway might experience the same benefits, but they also share the same vulnerabilities. The seven routes are distinct, although they may exist in various combinations, within large groups or over time. They are: The Product Innovation Route: here the business is built on one or more extremely successful, original and unique product. Polaroid and Sony are examples. Products may be as varied as instant noodles to adult magazines, but the companies succeed, after a long period, researching the unique, innovative and, of course, highly desirable product. The Technological Innovation Route: here business success lies not in finding a new product, but rather a different way of producing it. Honda added an engine to a bicycle and Evergreen thought of container ships. Many have, sometimes through luck, discovered a new way to do things. And they have become extremely rich in the process. The Relationship Route: all business people know about contacts and networking, but few make it the secret of their success. Khashoggi and Hammer, for example, both became filthy rich by establishing and maintaining highly beneficial relationships with politicians, the military, corporations and royalty. They certainly believed that God gave us our friends and the devil out relations. Exploiting the Rigid Competitor Route: some firms have succeeded by spotting not a gap in the market, but the lazy, inflexible rigid competitor. Regulatory change and the opening of legal loopholes means that some entrepreneurs have anticipated and used the opportunity. Freddie Laker, Federal Express and DHL typify those who made their killing by exploiting the complacency of others. Turnround Route: some have made it rich by a dramatic and unpredicted turnround of poorly functioning companies. Individuals have taken weakly functioning organisations and changed then into vigorous, customer-sensitive, dollar-generating companies. Hilton Hotels and First Pacific nicely illustrate this. The Market Forces Route: some people are, it seems, super-sensitive to consumers' psychology. Those with the metaphorical ears to the ground of market forces have included Gucci, Saatchi and Saatchi and Lotte. These highly successful businessmen have capitalised, mobilised and manipulated market forces to their own ends. The Exceptional Service Route: There are those, such as Singapore Airlines and the Mandarin Hotel chain whose success is almost entirely attributable to going beyond currently conceivable levels of service. The potential customer becomes a regular customer and a happy free-advertiser by word-of-mouth for the company. It is hard work but such companies are proof that it can be done and there are rich pickings once the reputation for service has been won and the prices can be marked. The problem with all lists or category systems is that the hair-splitter find unclassifiable or combination routes. Others, hoping for fame, devise alternative classification systems. But rather than figure out a perfect and parsimonious nomenclature for becoming rich, it may be better to begin the journey.

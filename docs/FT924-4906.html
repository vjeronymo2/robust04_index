			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Russia before the Congress THE CONGRESS of People's Deputies which meets in Moscow this week is a leftover from Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, which demolished the old communist system but failed to erect a new one. Many of its members represent the interests of the old, centralised economy, which made the Soviet Union a deformed military superpower but never delivered prosperity, because it was not designed to do so. Before the Congress these men tried to pursuade President Boris Yeltsin that the monster designed to make the Soviet Union militarily powerful can be re-targeted, to make the Russian successor state prosperous and efficient. Powerful men such as Mr Arkady Volsky, leader of the industrialists' association, have sought to weaken the market reformers in the government led by Mr Yegor Gaidar. They have demanded the resignation of reformist ministers, accusing them of trying to foist an inappropriate western model onto Russia. They have also pushed for a further slackening of financial and other restraints on the military-industrial complex and an economic strategy which would make state enterprises the engine of modernisation. Recent events have already provided indications of what such a policy would mean. For a start, it means a new effort to provide work for military factories by a determined export drive. Russia is offering tanks, submarines, aircraft carriers, aircraft and arms and equipment of all descriptions, in competition not only with western manufacturers but also with arms plants in Ukraine and other former Soviet states. It also means a new emphasis on 'self-reliance', as in the decision to place a multi-billion dollar contract for the development of the giant Shtokman gas field in the Barents Sea with a consortium of Russian defence industries, and the expected decision to go ahead with the Udokan copper project. This would provide thousands of jobs, but is never likely to provide an economic return. Given Russia's shortage of hard currency, and the spectre of mass unemployment, it is understandable that the managers should wish to keep their empires together by mammoth projects like these. That is what they were designed for. But the Soviet Union paid highly for the obsessive concentration of resources on a few prestige projects, like the White Sea canal under Stalin or the BAM railway through the Siberian wilderness under Brezhnev. Russia needs a new type of economy, responsive to market forces and the demands of ordinary people for the 'thousand and one tiny things' which central planning could never deliver, from a decent shirt to tasty foods and good medicines. That is the kind of economy being created in post-communist central europe. It is the kind of economy which Mr Gaidar and his government have also been striving to create. Mr Gaidar agrees that Russia should produce more and better equipment for the oil and gas industry and many other products designed to improve Russian efficiency and satisfy long-neglected needs, where necessary with the help of western finance and investment. A painful compromise has been worked on between the government and Civic Union conservatives. But Mr Gaidar is right to insist that four basic principles be retained. These are: no return to a state distribution system; tight control over the ballooning money supply; no wage or price freeze; and no artificially low exchange rates. Mr Yeltsin dismissed Mr Gorbachev's efforts to merge the contradictory plans for reform of market-oriented economists and the industrial bureaucracy as a 'marriage between a hedgehog and a snake'. He should remember those words and insist that Russia re-build its economy along market lines, with state industry playing its part within these disciplines.</p>

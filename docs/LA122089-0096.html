			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> IBM Introduces Powerful New PC: International Business Machines Corp. announced  the most powerful member of its Personal System/2 family of microcomputers, a  model based on Intel Corp.'s i486 microprocessor. The PS/2 Model 70 486 is two  to three times faster than systems using Intel's previous generation 386 chips.  The new IBM computer is intended especially for users of numerically intensive  applications, IBM said. The PS/2 Model 70 486 is available immediately and  sells for $12,395 or $12,990. Introduction of the model apparently was made  possible when Intel solved a problem with the i486 chip.  </P></p>

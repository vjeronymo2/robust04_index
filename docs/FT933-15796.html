			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Postel delivery By riding to the rescue of Greycoat, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel's new boss, is indulging a long-standing fascination with property. Given Mr George Soros' joint venture with British Land, and the spate of rights issues in the sector, he is not alone in regarding commercial property as cheap. But it is hardly routine for one of the nation's biggest pension funds to assume control of a listed company. Underwriting Greycoat's rights issue suggests greater enthusiasm for the prospects than that mustered by his peers. Ordinary shareholders will suffer dilution, but the more difficult task may be winning the support of bond and preference share holders - not to mention the banks. The approval of each is required. The rally in Greycoat's preference shares on Monday, on the assumption that they would be spared any serious sacrifice, now looks especially misplaced. The nominal value of the prefs is to be more than halved, future interest payments cut, and deferred interest lost. Greycoat could yet be undone by its proliferation of capital instruments. Without the promised asset valuation the fine details are difficult to assess. If net assets have fallen anywhere near to the Pounds 80m minimum demanded by Postel for the deal to go ahead there would be precious little left over once the banks had exercised their security. That should focus the minds of bondholders. The more interesting question is why Postel is going to the trouble of taking control instead of letting Greycoat sink and buying the best of the assets on the cheap from the banks.</p>

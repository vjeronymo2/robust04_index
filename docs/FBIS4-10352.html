			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alberto Rivera] </F>   [Text] Jinotega -- Eleven former commanders of the  Democratic Forces for National Salvation [FDSN] have given this  LA PRENSA correspondent a copy of a communique expressing their  firm determination to take up arms again "because of the  government's failure to fulfill the pledges signed in 1992,"  when more than 2,000 fighters were demobilized.    The former FDSN fighter's noms de guerre are: Alexis,  Campeon, William, Osmar, Cain, Efrain, Luis, Venado, Conejo,  Danto, and Tigre.    In the communique, the commanders address Francisco Valdivia  Chavarria, known as Commander Dimas: "Mr. Francisco Valdivia  Chavarria (Dimas) and staff: Prepare yourselves. Do you people  think you will be allowed to keep the haciendas and vehicles you  were given? No, gentlemen. Time is up. No one will stay  behind. All of the 5,000 FDSN demobilized will fight for our own  interests, land, and homes."    The commanders remind Dimas of his pledge to take up arms  again if the agreements fail to be complied with, and they urge  him to join them in the mountains, making it clear to him  neither he nor the government will cheat them.    The commanders blame Violeta's government, saying: "The  government will be held responsible for any rebellion in the  country's north, because the government made a pledge and  failed."    The commanders describe themselves as "men of peace" but  warn  they will not tolerate deception. Finally, they set a two-week  deadline for the government to show signs of willingness to make  good on its word.</p>
